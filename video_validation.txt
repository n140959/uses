B000H00VBQ I had big expectations because I love English TV, in particular Investigative and detective stuff but this guy is really boring. It didn't appeal to me at all."
B000H00VBQ I highly recommend this series. It is a must for anyone who is yearning to watch \"grown up\" television. Complex characters and plots to keep one totally involved. Thank you Amazin Prime."
B000H00VBQ This one is a real snoozer. Don't believe anything you read or hear, it's awful. I had no idea what the title means. Neither will you."
B000H00VBQ Mysteries are interesting.  The tension between Robson and the tall blond is good but not always believable.  She often seemed uncomfortable."
B000H00VBQ This show always is excellent, as far as british crime or mystery showsgoes this is one of the best ever made.  The stories are well done and the acting is top notch with interesting twists in the realistic and brutal storylines.  This show pulls no punches as it enters into the twisted minds of criminals and the profiler psychiatrist who helps out in a northern english city police force. The show looks like it is shot in Manchester but it is called by another name in the show.  One episode is not on this disc the excellent 'prayer of the bone\" which is on a seperate disc.  Still crime shows don't get much better than this one on either side of the ocean.  It's just a great show that never has had a less than well made episode. Unfortunately like all British shows you only get about five shows a year ,  but these are an hour and a half shows , still one could hope for at least 8 of these a year.  The realism and depth of the main character Tony Hill as protrayed by the excellent Robson Green is well worth viewing because he just makes this role truly part of himself in everyway.  I bet he went to crime scenes even in real life to research his role.  But the writers too must be applauded for their way above average stories.  Lets hope this show continues on for many years to come."
B000H00VBQ I discovered this series quite by accident. Having watched and appreciated Masterpiece Contemporary: Place of Execution, I was keen to read the novel (which inspired the TV adaptation) by Val McDermid. The novel was very well-written, and a nail-biting suspense thriller. Then I discovered that Val McDermid wrote other novels as well, and a couple of them inspired the TV crime drama Wire in the Blood.I finished watching all of Season 1 and have become a fan of this gritty crime drama that follows the investigations led by DI Carol Jordan (Hermione Norris). She is assisted by clinical psychologist Dr. Tony Hill (Robson Green), a rather eccentric figure who delves deeply into the minds of serial killers, studies patterns of criminal behavior and profiles criminals. His methods may seem strange at times, but he always manages to get results. Both Jordan and Hill make a strange if compelling pair, with Jordan analyzing a case based on evidence, and Hill working based on his knowledge of deviant behavior and what makes people commit disturbing crimes.Unlike some of the \"cozy\" mysteries such as the long-running Midsomer Murders - Set One and The Complete Inspector Lynley Mysteries, Wire in the Blood is not for the faint of heart. The crimes are horrific, sometimes involving children, almost always patterned on deviant behavior and the suspects are almost always very disturbed individuals. The crime scenes are difficult to watch as are the way victims are found and even the forensic examinations are graphic and unsettling. Though compelling, this is not really a show to watch in one sitting, and may very well give viewers nightmares.The first season contains three main stories, each divided into two episodes:The Mermaids Singing - Hill is on the trail of a seriously disturbed serial killer who targets homosexuals.Shadows Rising - The skeletal remains of a young woman is found, and when further evidence turns up, DI Jordan and Hill realize they have a serial killer on their hands, one with a penchant for dark-haired young women.Justice Painted Blind - Another unsettling case, this time revolving around an old child abduction and murder case. A couple of apparently random murders turn out not to be so random after all when it is discovered that the victims do share a connection involving an old court case where the accused was found not guilty. This throws up a whole bunch of suspects, including the parents of the murdered girl.The writing on this crime drama is excellent, and Robson Green is credible as the clinical psychologist who has a rare knack for profiling and getting under the skin of some of the most dangerous criminals. The drama also explores the chemistry and tension between Hill and DI Jordan, all of which result in a riveting show that keeps viewers coming back for more.The streaming was go
B000H0X79O It beats watching a blank screen. However, I just don't seem to be in tune with to comedy of today."
B000H0X79O There are many episodes in this series, so I pretty-much just skip through them to try to find a description of something I think I would like.  It's kind of a crap shoot as to whether you'll be entertained or not, but hey, if you're just sitting around trying to kill 20-30 minutes while you're waiting for something else to do, it's worth a shot."
B000H0X79O This is the best of the best comedy Stand-up. The fact that I was able to just watch continuously one comedian after another was great. I had the best laughter I have had in a long time."
B000H0X79O Not bad.  Didn't know any of the comedians but first time viewing put a smile on my face.  I'll check out the next season soon."
B000H0X79O Funny, interesting, a great way to pass time. I usually enjoy standup comedy and is this is a good show for me."
B000H29TXU I love the variety of comics.  Great for dinner TV entertainment because of length of each episode.  Many of the featured comics have gone on to even bigger TV specials so it's great to see some of their earlier material."
B000H29TXU comedy is a matter of taste. this guy was a little funny but there are others that are far funnier than this guy"
B000H29TXU if this had to do with Dat Phan, he was hilarious, I enjoyed his comedy and would watch him alone numerous times"
B000H29TXU Watched it for Kevin Hart and only Kevin Hart!  He makes me laugh.  The best comedy comes from pain and Kevin does his comedy with a huge heart."
B000H29TXU he's OK. His humor consists mainly of varying between a Vietnamese accent and a smooth articulate presentation of ironic situations."
B000H2DMME some comedians are very good, some not so good, and some are just not funny.  I don't know the names to chose from and watched this by picking random episodes. However, I do know some big names in stand up comedy and these were not included on prime."
B000H2DMME I only watched the Wanda Sykes portion of this show. I think it was interesting to watch because it was before she came out as a lesbian. She was married to a man at the time. She actually made some jokes that raised my eyebrows since she is now a lesbian. I didn't like this because it seemed hypocritical but I think Wanda Sykes is really funny. She is one of the few comedians who can make me really LOL (Laugh Out Loud). If you want to see what her comedy was like before she came out a lesbian or you are a Wanda Sykes fan, watch it. I am a huge fan of hers. I would like to see her in a live how. I am glad she is true to herself now and came out as a lesbian. I hope Wanda keeps on making me and others laugh for a long time to come."
B000H2DMME Enjoyed some of the comedians, it was a joy to laugh after losing my father whom I was a caregiver for"
B000H2DMME All the comedians are hilarious. I have seen them all before on Comedy Central but what a great idea to put them all together. I love Amazon prime and I love their shows. They are so much better than Netflix. I got rid of my Netflix Amazon rocks and Netflix well it thymes with rocks but in a bad way."
B000H2DMME There were some good entertainers, and some are just dumb.  I kept a paper and pen and wrote down names of the ones I wanted to see more.  They keep them in fairly short bits.  If you are looking to laugh continuous this may not be for you.  But each person has a different sense of humor so give it a try, but don't expect greatness."
B000H2DMME Very funny. Some of the comedians were funnier than the others. We were laughing so hard the dog thought something was wrong with us"
B000H2DMME Great variety of good comics. Each show is just the right length to not get boring. The comics are really funny too."
B000H2DMME I loved the humor of the stand-up comics featured here. I only got the free episode listed at the beginning of the season, but it probably gives a good idea of what is contained in the rest of the season. I have actually watched several episodes of this season when I was having a free 30-day trial membership in Amazon prime, which I eventually plan to become a paid subscriber to."
B000H2DMME It was fine - not my favorite but a comic on her way up. Some of the same cliche material I hear from others but a spark if the individual world view comes to the fore."
B000H2DMME It is nice to see some of the more popular comedians when they were first starting out. You can tell why some made it big and some didn't. If you like stand up comedy, I recommend giving it a try."
B000H4YNM0 This is a cute series, and I did watch two episodes, and enjoyed both of them.BUT I had to ask myself, if I had watched these two episodes on regular TV, would I have watched a third episode a week later? I had to honestly answer that I might watch it, but if something better was on, I wouldn't &#34;need&#34; to watch it.If you enjoy comedies, you might love this series more than me, and I might return to try it again in a few months or years. Sometimes, I return to a book at a later date and love it more, and the same could happen here."
B000H4YNM0 Season 2 of It's Always Sunny In Philadelphia is mandatory for anyhow who watches the show to own. This season has some of the greatest episodes in Sunny history!"
B000H4YNM0 Each episode gives me more entertainment than anything else on the tube. though I may not  want to have these characters as real friends - the women are hot though - the plots and characters make for great viewing.Do not see myself abandoning this series.I give 5 stars to every episode and season of Always Sunny in Philadelphia!Thanks Amazon!"
B000H4YNM0 Got these for my son's birthday. He says they are great! They are funny so give them a try! OK!"
B000H4YNM0 The show is a little bit dry, but is definitely funny.Have only seen the first four episodes, and they were definitely funny enough to continue watching the series.Characters are easy to relate to as they are about my age, funny stuff."
B000H4YNM0 This show is plain dumb and not funny. It is sad how much TV comedy has deteriorated. Gone are the days of fantastic shows like Seinfeld, Cheers, Frasier, Everybody loves Raymond, Tool time etc. And they are replaces with shows like this one, with 2 dimensional stupid characters, bad acting and idiotic writing, where sleazy behavior is supposed to be funny. It is not!!!The 3 guys characters all have exactly the personality; all unlikeable, dumb, juvenile, infantile, sleazy and lack any redeeming qualities, and the girl is the same shallow personality in female version.The stories all have the same theme; juvenile pursuits of cheap thrills like one night stands (referred to as \"banging\") or getting quick cash without effort. And to get these thrills these 4 characters and even the father in season 2 are willing to do anything; \"banging\" the other guy's mom, selling alcohol to minors, threatening people with Jihad terror attacks, cheating the welfare system etc.The 4 characters plus the father are supposed to be business partners and friends, but all they ever do is screw each other over. With friends like these, who need enemies?YUK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
B000H4YNM0 maybe i just dont get it...but crude not funny and irritating most of the time....guys that dumb shouldnt be on TV"
B000H4YNM0 Gave this to a good friend and ordered another for myself.  Very funny!  I highly recommend this for anyone who enjoys irony and a good laugh."
B000H4YNM0 Out of all the new comedies that have come out in the last ten years, Sunny is as the top of my list.  You need an affinity for quirky, offbeat humor to enjoy it, not to mention a high tolerance for raw language and sexual humor.  The first season consisted of just seven episodes, but established the core characters and operators of Paddy&#8217;s Pub; owners Dennis, Mac, and Charlie, and waitress/Dennis&#8217;s twin sister Dee.  In Season 2 (ten episodes), Danny Devito comes on board as Frank, Dennis and Dee&#8217;s dad.  The show&#8217;s creators (Rob McElhenney/ Mac; Glenn Howerton/Dennis; and Charlie Day/Charlie) are hilarious as actors, and also as writers.  Every character on the show stands out and gets big laughs out of me.  It&#8217;s one of those great ensemble casts that&#8217;s incredibly balanced in terms of the personalities and comedic nature of each character, resulting in a consistently high level of quality in every episode.  These first two seasons have some of my favorites, including &#8220;Charlie Has Cancer,&#8221; &#8220;Charlie Got Molested,&#8221; &#8220;Dennis and Dee Go on Welfare,&#8221; &#8220;Hundred Dollar Baby,&#8221; and &#8220;Charlie Goes America All Over Everybody&#8217;s Ass.&#8221;  Like most fans of the show, I tend to favor the Charlie-themed episodes, and considering that he&#8217;s the only one so far to get movie roles and a gig hosting SNL, it&#8217;s clear how important he is as part of the cast.  But that&#8217;s not a knock against anyone else.  I can&#8217;t really imagine it continuing if they lost any of the key characters of Dennis, Dee, Mac, and Charlie, and even though Frank wasn't there in the beginning, it would definitley hurt the show to lose him.  As far as current TV comedies go, no one else is doing anything funnier than &#8220;Always Sunny,&#8221; and these first two seasons show it."
B000H4YNM0 It's basically a slightly less intelligent version of &#34;Seinfeld.&#34; If I had to define it I'd say it's sophomoric humor which contains lots and lots of yelling amongst the main characters. For lovers of low brow comedy, this will be among your favorites. I haven't seen all of the episodes yet, but so far it appears that no topic is taboo."
B000H4YNM0 4.5 starsI knew nothing of this until a friend lent it to me this weekend. I laughed. Often. At things that aren't supposed to be funny, but as any serious fan of comedy knows, those can be the best laughs. I walked away feeling lighter and happier. If that ain't comedic success, what is?IASIP is like Seinfeld if the SeinFour were ten years younger, Irish, and ran a bar in South Philly. These guys have clearly studied Sein and Curb very closely, and their tight timing and topics and banter are all very Larry Davidesque...but they go places even LD won't. The best two shows of the 7-episode first season are about cancer and abortion; I howled at some moments. These guys have done what so many guys want to do: make a show about how funny they are. Except, these guys really are funny. Sometimes. But hey, no one's always hittin' homers, even on comedy 'roids, so I cut these three some slack and marvel at how tightly they work together. There's a lot to be said for working with old friends, if they have talent: the camaraderie and timing here are born of many years of drinking and laughing and thinking and falling down, no doubt. And these three guys are each pretty dang funny, each in his own fashion.DeVito is ok but I liked the first season best for its rawness. Still, as the later shows get a little more polished it's often in good ways.If you don't like drinking, if you insist on PC language from your friends and neighbors, and if you are in general just plain uptight about people living and thinking the way you want them to, look elsewhere. But If you enjoy tying one on and laughing your butt off at the endlessly silly idiocy that accompanies being alive in America these days, you may just find Always Sunny to be almost always funny."
B000H4YNM0 I enjoyed the first season a lot. The 4 main characters are very funny with their self centered ways. The second season they added Danny Devito  (Frank Reynolds) as the deranged father figure. Now most of the story lines revolve around him. Not as funny. Maybe it's better to just leave well enough alone."
B000H4YNM0 This series revolves around 4 friends who run a bar in Philadelphia and who go through a variety of difficult but extremely funny and often extravagant situations. I had heard of the series previously but was only convinced of buying it after seeing an intervewi with the actress. What a suprise: this is a somewhat lesscorrect version of Friends meets My Name Is Earl. I agree that this may not be correct at all since this series has no respect for conventional moarl issues such as lying about having cancer, discovering a friend's grandfather was a nazi. It also tackles the strange love men sometimes has for guns ets... In some ways it is difficult to describe and understand if you have not seen this gem of comedy."
B000H4YNM0 It was a disappointment. I gave it a few episodes to get into it, but it didn't get any better."
B000H4YNM0 Watched Charlie Day give a commencement address and then decided to check out his show. Found this show surprisingly GOOD!  The cast is funny but they deal with real world guy and girl issues I. A fun, but informative way. Highly recommend it and not just for the laughs."
B000H4YNM0 I was pleasantly surprised with this \"out of the box\" series.  Good writing, good acting, laugh out loud situations.  Devito showing up in the second season gave it a little boost as he's always dependable for turning the mundane into the hilarious.It's basically about 3 jackass friends in Philly who own a bar and get themselves into offbeat situations.  What I liked best is that it is not the clice venue for the young and the beautiful.  It often hi-lightes the old and the ugly and in doing so cultivates a good portion of the laughs.Worth you time and money....bg"
B000H4YNM0 Overacted but occasionally funny over the top sitcom of friends running a bar that involve getting caught in some silly scheme, one character trying to convince others how selfish or immature they are acting, being broke, getting drunk, or getting laid.  Perhaps the story ideas got funnier in season 2 as they did with \"Portlandia.\"  This show is definitely geared towards viewers in their 20's."
B000H4YNM0 I wish I were a part of this cast. This is the funniest stuff ever. YOU MUST GET THIS IF YOU ARE A DIE HARD &#34;SUNNY&#34; FAN!"
B000H4YNM0 Who says the sitcom is dead?  Not since Arrested Development has a sitcom been this truly hysterical and quick paced that you don't know what to expect next.  It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia, originally premiering on the FX network in 2005, revolves around four friends: Charlie (Charlie Day), Mac (Rob McElhenney), Dennis (Glenn Howerton), and his sister Dee (Kaitlin Olson); all of whom own and run an Irish bar in downtown Philadelphia.  They get into all kinds of crazy hijinks through misunderstandings and just plain bad judgement, ranging from being mistaken as a gay bar to Charlie lying about having cancer.  Yes, there's nothing really wholly original about the show's premise, but it remains hysterically funny throughout.  The second season of the show finds Danny DeVito joining the cast as Dennis and Dee's father, who isn't the sanest of the bunch either.  This DVD set compiles the first two seasons of the show, and is definitely worth picking up for viewers who turned it when it first premiered, as well as newer viewers who may be anxiously awaiting the upcoming and long awaited third season of this very funny show."
B000H4YNM0 I heard about It's Always Sunny from a Kevin Smith Smodcast. If you haven't been force-fed the usual formula comedycrap replete with obnoxious laugh tracks, you might just like it.It's not a continuous knee-slapper but just some good ol' off-center comedy. Welcome back Danny DeVito - sure he's doing the same ol' DePalma character, but I STILL think it's funny. For me, it's another one of those sit down and plow through a DVD at a time. I would never have had the patience to watch these one at a time on the tube when it aired (that's just me)."
B000H4YNM0 funny thing. My brother's been trying to get me to watch this show forever. As it turns out, I get the videos of the day, everyday, and one was Charlie Day giving the commencement speech at his alma mater, Merrimack college in New Hampshire. it was then I realized that its Always Sunny in Philadelphia, was his show, and he's from New Hampshire where I'm from also.of course, this is what prompted me to actually start watching the show. I really enjoy it, it almost seems unscripted. The best part is, it's on Amazon Prime for free. How can you beat that!"
B000H4YNM0 Fan-tastic. This is a show about terrible people being terrible, and it's hilarious and mean and perfect. Watching the characters grow into such vile monsters is a real joy. Seriously!"
B000H4YNM0 I love this show and I don't think that will ever change.  I hate all of the characters and I mean that in the best way.  Hilarious."
B000H4YNM0 I love it's always sunny and wanted to own the seasons, but didn't want to spend a lot of money. Came to Amazon and managed to buy seasons 1-6 for less then $25!! Way pumped!The discs were clean, no scratches, worked perfectly. No problems at allAs for the first seasons of it's always sunny, you either like it or you don't. I used to hate this show, but it's now one of my favorite shows. If you haven't seen it yet, then get on it player!"
B000HAB4NK Wish I had watched this show when it began back in 2001.  Very happy that it is available from Amazon to stream.  I've watched 5 seasons in 3 weeks!  Will keep you on the edge of your seat (if you suspend reality a little bit).  Highly recommend!"
B000HAB4NK Non stop action with edge of your seat thrilling plots with a new turn every minute.  Cast of great stars keep all events seeming like weeks but actually are in 24 hours"
B000HAB4NK I had a hard time following this show when it was on TV but now that it is on Prime I can watch the episodes in a row without commercial interruption. I now can watch all of them at my leisure. I am so excited that I can't wait for another day to watch more! And I think Keifer Sutherland makes the show. I would like to tell all viewers out there that you should be on Prime because all of these episodes are for free with your membership. Many of your TV episode series are for free and tons of movies. So you all out there join Amazon Prime!"
B000HAB4NK Season 5 24 is fantastic.  Each episode gets more and more exciting!  I keep thinking, it can't get any better than this, but guess what!  It does! Fantastic show, no show can beat 24!  I am a wreck when its over, but I love it so!"
B000HAB4NK Seson five is killer! I would recommend this dvd set to anybody! Full of suspense killer action! Jack is a bad ass! Buy it , you won't regret it!"
B000HAB4NK This show is like a runaway train ride. Every episode has poor Jack in some death defying crisis. Really enjoyed the ride."
B000HAB4NK hope they start changing the plot a little faster, never seen so many pole changes in one show in one week"
B000HAB4NK For sheer intensity and plot topsy-turvies, no other show comes close to 24. You'd think the premise (every hour of the 24 episode-long season is played in real-time; thus 24 encapsulates a full day) would get old by now, but, surprisingly, the producers and writers have managed to come up with another riveting, must-see season. In fact, this might be the best season of them all. The thrills and nail-biting suspense (as well as the SPOILERS alert) begin early in the season five opener, with the shocking slaying of President Palmer and assassination attempts on familiar CTU agents (one of which is tragically successful). Jack Bauer (Kiefer Sutherland) is lured out of hiding after 18 months and becomes rapidly embroiled in a devious conspiracy that goes all the way up to the White House. As he becomes the most wanted man in America (he is framed for Palmer's assassination), he must try to ferret out the true culprit(s) and again save the country from deadly Russian extremists and various domestic villains. On a personal level, he must come to terms with the deaths of personal friends, the alienation of his daughter Kim, and the fact that his former girlfriend  Audrey Raines (Kim Raver) might have moved on.There's a reason why Kiefer won the best dramatic actor Emmy and why 24 beat out the likes of the West Wing, the Sopranos, Grey's Anatomy, and House for best drama. The fifth season is fully serviced by a coming together of story and acting - from the gripping, edge-of-your-seat plot line, with its manic twists and turns, to the no-quarters-given, full speed ahead performances of the cast, but specially of Kiefer Sutherland, who gives his all in inhabiting his role. Kiefer IS the show and consistently produces such driven intensity, lying just beneath an icy cold surface, and yet his eyes reveal a vulnerability of sorts, when he's reacting to something personal to him. He makes a scene work, even without dialogue. Very good stuff. And, no, you do not want to get in the way of Jack Bauer.There are other standouts, of course. Gregory Itzin as the shifty and weak-willed U.S. President makes you gleefully hiss, while Jean Smart as the medicated First Lady Martha Logan brings earnest soap-opera acting to primetime. Mary Lynn Rajskub (Chloe O'Brian) continues her highlight role as CTU's brilliant but cantankerous and socially-inept tech support operative. Meanwhile, James Morrison, Roger Cross, Kim Raver, Carlos Bernard, Louis Lombardi, and Sean Astin become the season's dependable, solid bedrock.That so many of the regular cast die in this season lends an immediacy to the episodes and exponentially raises the stakes. There's no comfort level at all here, as you're never sure who would survive in the end (but, with this show, were you ever sure?). Even Kiefer Sutherland had played around with the idea of having Jack Bauer biting the dust (Please, no!).So, the 24 - Season Five dvd box releases December 5, 2006, just in time for you to go thru 'em to prep for season six, which begins next January on Fox. Season Six, by the way, picks up nearly two years after season five's finale and will have James Cromwell with a recurring role as Jack's estranged dad, Phillip Bauer. Also joining the cast is Eddie Izzard, Kal Penn (Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle), Peter MacNicol, Regina King, and the beautiful Rena Sofer. I can't wait to own season five and, then, to see season six. Long live Jack Bauer!"
B000HAB4NK Revel in his awesomeness!!! For he is a god amongst men and he is deserving of all praise that can possibly be heaped upon him. The one time the Emmys got something right!! Jack Bauer is as close as any fictional character has become to being superhumanly powerful, and at some times his recurrent circumvention of the bureaucratic system, assaulting his friends and co-workers, his flagrant abuse of \"prisoner's rights\" and his uncanny ability to fight his way out of any trap... it may require a little bit more suspension of disbelief than would normally be necessary in a lesser show, but the very core of this show is Jack Bauer, or more specifially, Kiefer Sutherland and his increasingly better performance each season of 24. When he is having a particularly emotional moment, you feel it exude from the screen.... this is just an example of the power that Sutherland brings to this show. Also standing out as always is Mary Lynn Rasjkub as the wonderfully ascerbic and wicked-tongued Chloe O'Brien. The introduction of her character is one of the best things that's happened to this show. But this season has some other stand-out characters: one that was introduced in season 4 and a brand new one. Fans of the show know these as President Charles Logan (the wonderfully slimy Gregory Itzin) and his first lady Martha Logan (the amazing Jean Smart). Their interplay and their performances are almost as key as Sutherland in this season. Another thing that came to be almost an in-joke is that three members of the cast of the original ROBOCOP film appear in different parts of the series, which as a fan of that film was just really cool to see. Whether or not that was intended, it's still a nice touch for genre fans. Julian Sands has lots of fun chewing up scenery as the evil Russian-yet-English-Accented Terrorist. The premise is per usual: Jack must defy all odds to save the country and avenge his personal losses. But the plot itself is of a higher level of complexity and tragedy this season than prior seasons. The way it begins is ALMOST as shocking as the way the season ends. And the ending of the final episode of the season... that scream you heard in the whole of the United States and parts of Canada and Mexico... that was me. January 2007 CANNOT GET HERE SOON ENOUGH!!!"
B000HAB4NK The first five seasons of 24 are the best thriller/escapism you'll find on television. It's fast-paced, big-budgeted, over-the-top (sometimes WAAAAAAAY over-the-top), and mostly clever. But I don't think ANY of the previous seasons (or the lame season 6) can come even close to the excitment and joy of watching this fifth season.Yes this season follows the same (tired) gimick of everything happening in real-time, but what set this season apart for me was it's more focusd plot-line. Several of lead character Jack Bauer's friends are killed or attacked and he's out to find out who and get revenge. Ok, sometimes t
B000HAB4NK Just finished the 5th season of this very riveting series. I must admit the season started off with a Bang! When you watch it you will see what I mean. However, about mid season I had to push myself a little to get through to the last 1/3 of season, and I am SO glad I did! WOW! talk about being on the edge of my seat. This season really does have more of an edge to it. A fictional Syntox gas, nerve agent,  is involved, terrorist plots, political corruption and some of the main characters are bumped off! Loved this season and would highly recommend it to anyone!"
B000HAB4NK Ugh, I can't take it - making the presidents right hand man involved in terrorism ?! The first lady clinically insane.  Then making you think it's the vice pres, then it turns out to be the president himself.  Uhhh, yeah, right. I thought at first at least they didn't do another mole in CTU (which they had done every single stinkin season).......then, turns out they did have someone in there following the 'right hand mans' orders! But he 'thought' he was doing the right thing.  Either way, STOP RECYCLING THE EXACT SAME PLOT LINES.  And they still have everyone respond to anything with \"I understand\".  Choose a different line once in awhile !  I give this 1 star, no idea why this has an average of 4 1/2 stars.  This is by far the worst of the first 5 seasons I've watched. It's more boring daytime soap opera than action/drama like the seasons before this one.  Feel free to skip this season, I wish I had."
B000HAB4NK Absolutely great show! Every episode keeps you on the edge of your seat!  Makes it very hard to turn it off!"
B000HAB4NK While I had kind of given up on 24, this is a good return to form for the series. It starts with the assasination of previous president Palmer and as the season advances we see how Jack, who has come back from the dead for many, is confronted with a group of russian separatists who have gotten some nerve gas. The way the story unfolds gets slightly too straightforward from the middle of the season on but it is still quite exciting stuff. Kim comes back for a short period also."
B000HAB4NK I particularly like the fact that the show (which I missed when broadcast) subtly introduces the moral dilemmas of the situations."
B000HAB4NK In the aftermath of season 4, Jack Bauer (Kiefer Sutherland) had to fake his own death and go into hiding.  But he can't seem to stay in retirement for long.  Someone knows Jack is alive and targets his friends, forcing Jack to come out of hiding to face down terrorists yet again.Meanwhile, it is an important day for the United States and President Logan (Gregory Itzin).  He has been working hard to iron out an anti-terrorism treaty with Russia, and that treaty will be signed that day.  But the treat of terrorists in Los Angeles with stolen nerve gas just might be enough to derail the treaty.Season 5 won an Emmy for best drama, and it was well deserved.  Even after five years, this show is gripping drama with excellent writing and acting.  I am glued to my seat every week, breathing only during commercial breaks.  This season the threat and storytelling seemed more focused then previous years, adding to the drama.There were a couple flaws this season.  I sure don't remember the explanation of who knew Jack was alive at the beginning of the season.  Maybe it was mentioned and I missed it.  Furthermore, we have yet more examples of lack of security at CTU.  While it does make for gripping drama, it does seem like they could come up with a new plot trick every so often.My biggest complaint this season was the body count.  We lost several key characters from previous years.  While I understand the producer's desire to keep us on the edge of our seats, can't anyone from the show live happily ever after?  It honestly got to the point I dreaded seeing anyone who had been on the show before for fear they would be killed off.Still, these are minor issues with a truly wonderful show.  I'm counting down the hours until the next season premiers and we can start the rush all over again."
B000HAB4NK (BEWARE, SOME SPOILERS BELOW)Man, this is really a violent, dark and totally avoid of humour show. But's the beuaty of it: there shows around about very differente themes.The proposal of 24 hours is to give you non-stop action, non-stop twists and, also, a lot of bloodshed. It's interestin also to see through the shows the incredible amount of highly trained, superbly financied and intelliegnt people willing to do harm to good old Uncle Sam, be them American, Muslin, German, Rusian... Also, the terrorists portrayed in the show are capable of mobilizing killer squads in less time than it takes to say \"Killer squads\"... But, suspension of desbelief is something required to any show (if we wanna just see reality, just check the news, not a show!), since they respect tha canon and \"mitology\" described by that show itself. In that respect, 24 is respectul to itself.I'm also one of those that consider Season Five the best season of them all. There are so many ingredients. Kim Raver is acting better than ever... the rhythm is breathtaking all the way (although the death toll is incredible high, even by thwe show standards - to kill Almeida, David Palmer, Michelle, Edgar Stiles, all of them in one single season... uau...)Yes, I denitely think this is the best season of 24 until now."
B000HAB4NK This is a banner series for this extraordinarily conceived and executed television series.  From its explosive opening through 24 hours of plot twists, exciting action, and devastating loss, this season is absolutely superb.  Be warned though---there's lots of unexpected killings in this season and several favorite characters are disposed of.  You just don't know what to expect from this Emmy-winning series.Kiefer Sutherland won his much deserved Best Actor emmy as Jack finds himself confronted with one impossible task after another.  The supporting cast is superb:  James Morrison as CTU director Bill Buchanan; Mary Lynn Rajskub as the neurotic but brilliant Chloe; Kim Raver as Jack's former love Audrey; William Devane as irasible Secretary of Defense; Louis Lombardi as the plump and human Edgar; Jayne Atkinson as the Homeland Security Director; Sean Astin as the pompous replacement; Peter Weller as the vicious assassin; Glenn Morshower as the stoic Aaron; Jude Ciccollella as Mike Novick; Julian Sands as the evil terrorist; and of course, Gregory Itzin and Jean Smart as the President and First Lady, who were robbed of their supporting actor Emmys, and who are just fantastic in these pivotal roles.24 is one of the best series out there and this season shows why."
B000HAB4NK 24, Seasons 1 - 8 are some of the best I've ever seen! From the first hour, every scene is filled with suspense and anticipation. JACK BAUER (Kiefer Sutherland) is a story hero that is always two steps ahead of the bad guys which helps keeping me from throwing rocks at my i-pad (the bad guys)! Can't wait for the next season to show up!&#128522;"
B000HAB4NK Love the show. Period. Have just finished watching the first 5 seasons (something of a marathon over the last month).Season 5 is probably my favorite season to date. It starts strong and doesn't let up until it's over.As to packaging and the discs themselves: the first 4 seasons come in fold-out packaging + outer sleeve, much like the Highlander series and a few others. The first discs contain the episodes themselves, and the last disc contains some bonus materials. Season 5, however, breaks from this tradition and instead packages the discs in 4 slim cases (the 4th holds the bonus features disc). A change of page in packaging, but still quite attractive, with approximately the same shelf footprint (if not slightly smaller).Season 5 continues to do a good job with chapter breaks, scene selection menus, and bonus features. I might note however, they've added a slightly longer intro before getting to the main menu (looks like booting up and logging into a CTU computer system). However, on my DVD player I could skip ahead without having to play the whole sequence. So, it wasn't completely ungainly.The video and audio were up to par. Of course I don't have a large-screen/wide-screen TV nor surround sound, so I can't test under all conditions. But if there were any video or audio issues I didn't notice them. Perhaps some moire/color issues in scenes with close parallel-line patterns. But I've noticed that on any number of DVD releases of other series from other studios, so I wouldn't say there was any more in 24 than other series.Overall, I highly recommend this for anyone who hasn't seen 24, and who likes the spy/thriller type show. If you liked Alias and/or La Femme Nikita, you'll probably like 24 as well. There are some \"intense\" scenes and probably some harsh language, so preview episodes before showing it to any youngsters, if at all."
B000HAB4NK 24 is the most  fun series I have ever seen on tv.  I love keifer Sutherland and it appears to me that a lot of actors get good parts and get in a lot of acting.  Also this series has people, even the bad guys speaking articulately and very rationally.  We are seeing a show full of admirable people not a bunch of losers.  That must be a part of the popularity of the series.Note something else, these people comply with the human requirement  of pronouncing judgement."
B000HAB4NK There was lots of action, I love it , Cant wait for the next season, very good acting. A lot of actors I remember. I would recomend to everyone."
B000HAB4NK Season Five was the winner!  Of course, Kiefer and the regular cast absolutely rock, it was fantastic to see as much of Agent Pierce as we did this season, and Gregory Itzen and Jean Smart...... well, what can I say about them other than === shoulda won the Emmys!!!"
B000HAB4NK We were not fans of 24 until a family member gave us Season 7 DVD.  The show is well done, we get a kick out of the fact that 24 shows is equal to 24 hours of activity.  And laugh that no one ever takes a nap or eats during any of the shows.  We are now working on Season 6 and then will catch up with the new show on TV this season."
B000HAB4NK The shocking opening moments of the fifth season of 24 literally blew away everything that we've come to know about the show.  Alliances are challenged, close friends are lost--all the while Jack Bauer tries to keep his sanity and find out who the real culprit is behind one of the most trying days in American history.The cast is perfect, the storyline is compelling, and the action is never ceasing.  This season had by far the most suspense as well as the most cliff hangers.  After I finished watching an episode, I usually wanted to go right to the next and watch it right away!  There is, however, a big plot hole in the season.  The fate of Evelyn Martin and her daughter was never covered, and I found that unfair; an entire episode depicted their plight, and I feel it should have been resolved, whether she was killed or left alive by Henderson.Any show that can make a person sympathize with someone while viciously rooting against them (i.e. Logan) is a stupendous show.  24 delivers all of that and more, with its best season to date.9/10"
B000HAB4NK I loved this season of 24. I loved almost everything about it, even the death scenes. I felt like nobody was safe, and anybody could die! I especially loved the episode where everyone is trapped in C.T.U. with the nerve gas everywhere. I also loved the surprise ending with Jack being taken hostage by the Chinese who were still after Jack from season 4. I highly recommend this season to all fans of 24. And I just saw the season six trailer. I've watched it over three times and I can't wait."
B000HAB4NK I am watching each season of 24 on Amazon Prime Video and thoroughly enjoy each season. The twists and turns in each story are amazing, plus the shows give you mystery, action, love, betrayal, and so much more. It can take some time to get through an entire season because there ARE twenty-four 45 minute episodes. But whatever time you have to devote to this series is well worth it."
B000HAB4NK I'm a fan what can I say.  I just watched seasons 1-5.  5 was one of my favorites, Jack seems to be going rogue more, the president is a despicable character.  The various sub plots are on the verge of repulsive but the writers reel it in or at least end them with Jack Bauer justice.  This season you should watch."
B000HAB4NK By now I've gotten into 24 pretty deep. I like the intensity of this real time format. I really enjoy watching Jack save the world."
B000HAB4NK I enjoyed nearly all the seasons of 24 and this is probably my third year I have watched them.  So excited they are bringing the show back though it may be somewhat different.  I enjoy dramas such as &#34;24&#34; and &#34;Covert Affair&#34;.  Good luck to the 24 actors and crew and hope the new show will do well."
B000HAB4NK \"24\" is like Red Bull--once you've had it you're addicted. The fifth season of \"24\" revolves around one central mystery: who killed an ex-president and how is Jack Bauer connected to the assassination? It's a thrilling season--probably the best since the first season--and it comes to a stunning conclusion that will be answered in January of 2007. Interestingly after having watched \"Casino Royale\" its clear that the new Bond film was inspired by shows like \"24\" which were, in turn, inspired by early Bond and some of the newer spy thrillers out there. There are a number of twists and turns in this season set my advice is NOT to read any reviews that summarize anymore of the plot if you haven't seen this season as there are some major spoilers in some of the reviews that follow.As usual Fox has put together a terrific DVD. This also features a brief episode \"prequel\" to the sixth season like previous sets had. We get a large amount of worthwhile commentary tracks including some with Emmy winner Kiefer Sutherland. There's also a summary of the season included as well athough if you've watched the show (or are watching it now) it won't really provide anything new. Th \"100 Episode Reel\" is a pretty useless extra -- basically a clips compilation.Different places are offering different exclusives. If you purchase it here you can download a free episode from Unbox (at least during the Holidays) while Target also offers a limited edition bonus disc for this set with additional featurettes on the show. Regardless of whether you buy it here at amazon.com or elsewhere this set features plenty of extras including an examination of the wonderful Presidential retreat featured in the show, a good featurette on the stellar work by the cinematography on the show, a featurette on the supporting actors on the show as well as extended and deleted scenes. I haven't had a chance to dig through all the bonus material yet but it what I have checked out looks really, really good.This set is packaged in the thinpak holders with two discs per holder so the accordian style packaging has been abandoned for this thinner packaging. This is a terrific set for an outstanding season of the series.What I would love to see if Keifer Sutherland and Donald Sutherland featured during a season."
B000HAB4NK great acting.  Lot of cliff  hangers.  good direction. absorbing - couldn't stop watching it.  i would recommend it to anyone."
B000HAB4NK While Season One of 24 focused much of its attention on President David Palmer, Seasons 2-4 saw the Oval Office by and large take a back seat to the missions of Jack Bauer and CTU.  However, Season Five brings some of the attention back to the sitting U.S. President (this time Charles Logan) and ends up with a much more well-rounded storyline.For a basic (non-spoilery) plot summary, a group of Russian terrorists threaten to release canisters of nerve gas in the U.S., leading Bauer to be reprieved from his thought-to-be death in order to help stop the crisis.  As CTU begins investigating the terrorism, however, it quickly becomes clear that the terrorists are working with a high-ranking government official, and the conspiracy begins to be unraveled.To be honest, at first I was skeptical of all the focus on President Logan, as didn't like his character and wasn't sure that he could command the camera as well as his predecessor Palmer.  However, by the end of the season, Logan is easily the most enjoyable/interesting character on the show.  His acting, along with his wife, chief of staff, and head of security, really gives the show the Presidential presence it lacked since that first season.Of course, there is still more than enough of Jack Bauer and his fellow CTU agents (Audrey Rains, Bill Buchanon, Edgar Stiles, Chloe O'Brien, etc.) to go around, which means that intense drama ensues in every single episode.  The writers have an amazing way to take a character that looks like a creep (think Tony Almeida and George Mason in the early seasons) and, by the end of a few episodes, have him become a noble hero, and that tradition continues in this season as well.The only \"knock\" I have on this season is that the cliffhanger endings of each episodes aren't quite as shocking (e.g. Nina Myers doesn't appear out of nowhere).  However, I think that was more of a creative choice by the writers, as the story is actually more coherent that any season besides the first one.  Instead of seemingly changing the plot of the show with every episode, Season Five slowly crescendos until the big finale.So, fans of 24 can purchase this season with confidence knowing that they will still get their action, drama, suspense, and some great twists and turns along the way."
B000HKWE3O If I had a friend Like MacGyver, than I would have try Survival Island and we would win all the money."
B000HKWE3O MacGyver can work his way out of anything with his knowledge of physics.  He is a master of problem solving.  I think everyone would enjoy seeing his stories."
B000HKWE3O It was  Good and funny I enjoy it it is worth watching a family movie Just enjoy  very light  Enjoy"
B000HKWE3O As usual, MacGyver is as exciting as ever."
B000HKWE3O James Bond minus the adult stuff.  Great show that shows the mind is still the best weapon.  Sure there is some liberal stuff thrown in but it is family friendly.  And who can't resist the MacGyverisms as you think could that work.  Maybe not but it will make the kids think and want to experiment.  Good stuff for the whole family."
B000HZEHL6 Well, I enjoy them for many reasons. i remember Mark Harmon when he played football for UCLA. He made the right career choice instead of getting banged up and damaged from the NFL he is raking it in with all of these hit series year after year."
B000HZEHL6 What happened with Tony and the plague he was dying from.  HELP!  It's killing me to know!!!!!!!!!!"
B000HZEHL6 Season three opens, with Gibbs going after Kate's killer, Ari. And to try to throw alot at us, NCIS gets a new director, Jenny Shepard played by Lauren Holly. Now Shepard and Gibbs do have some history, since both were partners at NCIS at one time, also. To proclaim Ari's innocence, is Massade officer Ziva David. And I'm sorry, I didn't like her then. And I don't liker her now, She and pretty much all of Massad is built up like they are the only agents that are extremely tough, they're unstoppable. So Ziva and Jenny try to convince Gibbs that he's wrong, and Gibbs even makes the only logical argument against Ari's innocence. That if he were innocent, he would turn himself in. So, after much arguing, he gets Ziva to follow him. And Ziva kills Ari in Gibb's basement, And we get each persons view of how they saw Kate in this episode. Now, I would have inserted Paula Cassidy to the team after this. Since there was some obvious chemistry between her and tony, but no. We get Ziva, and she is built up like I said. As this unstoppable, lean mean killing machine. The best of the best, and I'm sorry, but she's abrasive and annoying. And I still have a hard time accepting her to the team, Gibbs magically trusts her more than any other member of the team. season three is a good season, and Ziva is the on;y reason I didn't give it 5 stars. Although season three does end with almost getting blown up, going into a coma. Waking up from that coma, and thinking it's 1991. And we get to meet Gibbs's mentor, Mike Franks. Which leads to gibbs trying to stop a terrorists attack. Only the generals won't allow it, and Gibbs ends up Quitting NCIS. All in all, season three is still awsome. Like I said before, my only problem is Ziva. The introduction of a new director, and then Gibbs leaving."
B000HZEHL6 NCIS changed in third season..and gotten strongerAt the end of season two, Kate was shot and died. Season three handles her death in the openning two parter \"Kill Ari\" which also introduces the audience to Ziva David (Cote de Pablo) and the new NCIS director (Lauren Holly).The change comes in many ways, Gibbs seems harder after Kate's death and it shows during the season, which builds to the two part season finale \"Hiatus\"...a cliffehanger to open season four. all the character grew from Abby, Ducky, Mcgee and especially Tony.Most say change is bad, for this show is GOOD and we the audience reap the benifitsBennet Pomerantz AUDIOWORLD"
B000HZEHL6 We have watched the first and second season and we love the series.  We are now watching the third season and just like the first two we love the NCIS Team and the plots are excellent."
B000HZEHL6 Please see earlier rant on season 4.  I like that they do not always end on a shocker, sometimes they just quietly say good bye.  It can be so hard to replace characters but they have a knack for it.  Good season for sure."
B000HZEHL6 What is there to say about NCIS?LGG..slappin the back of peoples's heads.Abby..man what a great show.I watch this every Tuesday night,though Los Angles is better."
B000HZEHL6 Started watching NCIS marathon on USA Channel (had never watched the show) and got hooked.  I have since purchased every season through Amazon and am enjoying every episode.  Great show."
B000HZEHL6 Season 3 is much easier to use because CBS Video has splurged on the Play All function and subtitles.  I started to like NCIS with the introduction of Cote de Pablo who looks like a cross between Winona Ryder and Salma Hayek.  This is the season with the \"homos on the train\" line."
B000HZEHL6 Love having the Instant View feature on Amazon.com. I have used this feature many times and will do again. Would highly recommend to friends and family."
B000HZEHL6 as one of their own is shot and killed by the terrorist Gibbs has been hunting Ari.  The season also shows how the different NCIS members are dealing with this tragic loss in a two part episode Kill Ari.  This in turn leads to the new characters, Ziva David and the new NCIS Director (who has more than a little history with Gibbs).This all blends in well and the new members of the team pick up right where they left off.  With all the quirkiness and fun that they have in each show, it only helps to show much the actors/actresses have grown together and it makes NCIS one reason that i love to watch not only this show.  But others of the same caliber.  I am looking forward to season four as well as the 3rd season ended in a particular way.  It leaves a lot of things open for the following season.But it also answers a few questions before the season is up like Gibbs past and how that affects him in his job today.  I love all the characters in the show-Abby, Ducky, Dinozo(sp), \"Probie\", Ziva and the like.  As each of them has their various moments throughout the season from killing an undercover cop, to a prisoner dying in custody or a mentally deranged ex-boyfriend that just won't go away.Along with some cool special features, NCIS is a show that is best watched from the beginning so that you get the full effect.  So buy the 1st seasons and start from there.  By the time you get to season 3 you'll be well versed and know what all the buzz is about.  NCIS is the real deal when it comes to TV shows period."
B000HZEHL6 It is a well-done TV series that can absorb cast changes and continue to deliver excellent shows.  NCIS Season Two ended with the shocking murder of Agent Caitlin Todd.  Season Three opens with two major cast additions.  Cote de Pablo joins the team as the beautiful and dangerous Israeli Mossad Agent Ziva David, while veteran actress Lauren Holly, as Jenny Shepard, becomes the new director of NCIS.The changes put iconic Senior Agent Jethro Gibbs (Mark Harmon) in the awkward situation of working in a new agent while getting used to a new boss who is a former love interest.  The rest of the team, still grieving for Caitlin, are slow to embrace Ziva but will be won over by her obvious competence, and by her hilarious efforts to master American slang.  Wisecracking Agent Tony DiNozzo (Michael Weatherly)in particular will find that Ziva forces him to raise his game in a way that Caitlin never quite did.The exciting two-part season opener resolves the still-open case of Agent Todd's murder.  A two-part season ender places Gibbs' service with NCIS at risk.  The audience will learn more about Gibbs' past while contemplating another season-ending cliff-hanger.  In between, the team will handle serial killers, terrorists, and kidnappings with its usual mixture of brisk police procedural and entertaining repartee.  Six special features about the making of the show are included in the DVD set.  \"NCIS: The Third Season\" is very highly recommended to fans of the series."
B000HZEHL6 This series has it all in the &#34;crime&#34; solving genre:  Great cast, humor, story lines and gadgetry to keep you coming back for more.  Especially enjoy the new addition replacing Kate's character."
B000HZEHL6 Season two ended with the murder of Caitlin Todd by the double agent Ari.The NCIS team is not going to allow this to go unpunished and the first two shows deal with this.Former Mossad intelligence officer Ziva David's replacement of Caitlin is not without problems as the team deals with both loss and acceptance.Complicating matters is a new director that has a romantic past with Gibbs.This season the Director of NCIS moves out of the shadows and into the light.  From now on, the Director is a full-fledged character and an important part of the story.Tony, Tim, Abby, Ducky and Jimmy are perfect in their roles.Jethro is boss, maverick and teacher while being larger than life.The cases are engrossing, complex and intelligent.The on-going interactions and personal stories support the show and fit the characters.This is an excellent series and this is an excellent season."
B000HZEHL6 This is one of very few current TV shows which is worth my time to watch. Most of the shows on TV now are vulgar, violent, unfunny or intent on pushing an offensive social or sexual agenda - even the so-called animated comedies. Even the game shows are leaning way Left (Jeopardy clues etc.). Most Reality shows are just plain stupid and fall into the above description as well. Though NCIS is often more GP than G rated, it has great characters and good plots."
B000HZEHL6 This said it was used but you couldn't tell. The box had just a little wear on the corners other then that it looked new. Would order from them again."
B000HZEHL6 Great storylines and very believable great i would recommend it to anyone over the age of 18 years and love the show"
B000HZEHL6 I love this show!  It is interesting and is a show I have great fun watching with my dad when he has time off.  The characters are funny and the banter is excellent."
B000HZEHL6 It was rough enough for the fans of NCIS to lose Kate Todd by having Ari Haswari snipe her at the end of Season 2.  So, starting Season 3 off by showing Kate's murder from Ari's POV is a little rougher.  But the two episodes that start off Season 3 of NCIS--the two part \"Kill Ari\" episodes--really bring up a subject in this series that hadn't been fully fleshed out.  Obviously, these two episodes allow the regular characters to come to grips with the loss of Kate--the irony of Kate's ghost talking to Ducky and Ducky not talking back to the ghost, t
B000HZEHL6 We love NCIS and all the seasons are great.  Anyone who enjoys the characters will like this season.  Beware of scenes in the autopsy room."
B000HZEHL6 Season Three lacks the edge that the first two seasons had, but the characters remain complex and the plots, unpredictable--except for the demands of the formula.  Visually and auditorially effective."
B000HZEHL6 This serries is OK, but it really lacks the substance that Criminal Minds, MI-5, CSI or Alias has.  The list goes on. When is the second season of Bones and Criminal Minds coming out?"
B000I5PVD8 It is Doctor Who (Classic) Season 1 what else is there to say? If you are a true Doctor Who fan than you can not miss watching these classic, see all of its humble beginnings.Only thing we have seen that is a problem, is that there if several seasons missing, it would be nice to watch every Doctor Who up to date today."
B000I5PVD8 The hypothetical life of the protagonist time traveler, Dr. Who, has entertained me and my relatives who have grown into wonderful young men and women. They derived hours of pleasure watching all the episodes available here in the U.S.A. However, I did not give the show five stars because the stories are a bit far-fetched for the trained mind."
B000I5PVD8 I used to watch this as a kid. We could only get it when the atmospheric conditions were just right and the tv antenna was turned to just the right direction to get the one station that played this at 10pm. They would show this as a double feature with Dark Shadows. It is fascinating to see how much has changed in how we treat each other and how tv is made."
B000I5PVD8 They've come a long way since the original Dr. Who. I still like the latest versions. If you are a Dr. Who fan, then these episodes give you a taste its origins... OK, but corny."
B000I5PVD8 Same review as season 5.  Too old, short of nostalgia no real reason to watch.  Give each episode 5 min for future reference."
B000I5PVD8 This is a great example of the &#34;Dr being stuck in ancient earth&#34; theme that shows up over and over in the decades that follow.  Other than the time travel there is not much science fiction here.  It is very interesting to see the Dr interacting with his &#34;crew&#34; and how he is more like the captain of a ship rather than the more active character that he becomes over time.  Probably the most interesting thing about this episode is how it shows the cultural mores of the 1960s.  If you enjoy ancient TV this is a gem.  If you are expecting anything like the modern Dr you probably want to skip ahead a couple decades."
B000I5PVD8 I had always heard and read about Doctor Who's &#34;early years&#34;, but had never watched.  What a pleasant surprise.  This enterprise has been a winner since the beginning.  I've got a lot of shows to watch!!"
B000I5PVD8 My first Dr. Who was Tom Baker back in the 1980s. I watched every episode and even taped them to watch over and over.  When many years later I found the early ones I laughed because they were so silly and the technology was hysterical, cardboard, plastic tape, logic errors, and then I realized that they were made in the  1960s and were made for children.  Funny, I never thought of it as a children's show.  I was nearly 50 when I first watched and it grabbed me instantly!  So now I am over 80 and I still love it.  Even these funny old ones.  A truly wonderful show for any age."
B000I5PVD8 I rated this a 4 star because the film was grainey.  I suppose this is the best it could be after all of these years.  What a treat you start learning about Dr. Who's start"
B000I5PVD8 starting with an actor who was noted for military roles and still going on today Dr. Who is part of many of our lives.The original shows were on miniscule budgets and demanded a lot more imagination from the viewers than today's shows.The Aztecs in this show were probably more comfortable on the London Underground than in the Central American jungles but that doesn't matter.The Doctor is a far cry from today's version-  with no real alien identity (two movies had him as definitely an elderly Earthman)- but that didn't matter- kids loved it and more than a couple of their parents too!.A captivating history lesson"
B000I5Q0ZG Season 12-16 are getting the same review.  Tom Baker (my dad's favorite) fits not only the role of the Doctor, but also time in Earth 'real time'.  The introduction of the sonic screwdriver, New companions which continue to defy the command 'stay here!!' Short episodes make this a great binge.  The cerebral side of the Doctor as well as 'the classic Dr.smile' grow into the story line."
B000I5Q0ZG The Doctor is the longest running si fi on television and there is little dout as to why. It's great."
B000I5Q0ZG The Ark in Space is a great story.  It has everything you need for classic SciFi: aliens wrecking spaceships, teleporters, life and death decisions with the human race in the balance and of course the 4th doctor.  It is all here... unfortunately the rest of the season is missing from Amazon.  Sigh...."
B000I5Q0ZG Compared to today the special effects are comical, but that justs adds to the fun of watching these old shows"
B000I5Q0ZG Hi, it was great to get to watch these episodes (The Ark In Space) that I never saw before, especially on Prime.  But...most of the season's episodes are not available. If they had everything available including classics about the Daleks, Crinoids, etc. this series would be a home-run. Also, Tom Baker is my favorite childhood version of Dr. Who, which is another reason why I would love to see everything featuring him available on Amazon Instant Video."
B000I5RENI The older Dr. Who series always has a theatre quality to it. Tom Baker is the Doctor I grew up with, so it feels good to stop by and see these episodes again. This one features Romana, one of the better companions I feel (though she was kind of forced on the Doctor).Generations today always want a female Time Lord (ok by me), and well, there you go. Romana is a Time &#34;Lady&#34;. She's as smart as the Doctor, but lacks the experience he has traveling the universe.  She also seems to usually be very calm in a tight situation against his silly antics some times. They make a good pair.So if you ever wanted to see what a female Time Lord (excuse me, Lady) might be like, check out these episodes."
B000I5RENI It is great filling in some of the blanks of what happened to that character or how did the doc meet this character! it would be great if you would get more missing episodes ."
B000I5RENI In episode #17 (part 1) listen for a bonus at the 2:26 mark, give or take a second.  That being said, Tom Baker's Dr. was the best until the new 2005-present series.  Historically in real time this is a 'post Star Wars' timeline.  Keeping to the look and feel of Dr. Who was getting lost as the 80's progressed but this is still in the good phase of the show's run."
B000I5RENI The best and lonest running sifi on tv ever. I have been a fan since 1970s. I think my wife loves it more them myself."
B000I5RENI enjoyed all episodes of season 16 I only hope it continues with 2014(season 56) cant wait for it to appear"
B000I5RENI The writing in this season is amazingly well done. As is the acting. The character actors playing the bad guys and the heroes accompanying the Doctor are top notch."
B000I62JFU Everything has to start somewhere but as a viewer there is only so much nostalgia one can have for sci-fi.  Thus is a 50 year old season and it shows.  Campy at best.  If you want a good starting point for Dr. Who I suggest starting with Dr. #3 in app 1970.  This is also the start of color. That being said seeing Cybermen as an original 'bad guy' shows the connection to the past."
B000I62JFU While some of the special effects are so old they detract from the story, Tomb of the Cybermen is still enjoyable to watch.  Troughton as the doctor is great because he shows the snide humor that shines in later doctors.  Sadly because so many of the oldest episodes are missing we don't get the back story of the doctors companions but we do get to start to see some of the origins of the Cybermen mythos.  This is great fun and a must for any fan of the doctor."
B000I62JFU I have watched Dr. Who for years and enjoyed these early ones.  The thing I liked the best about this Dr. Was the way he would get confused and say &#34;Oh dear&#34; all the time.  He is very sweet, and I loved him just because he was Dr. Who.  Since it was a children's show, this might has had a lot of appeal to a child. for myself, I tend to forget it was started for children, and watch it avidly every time."
B000I62JFU if you like Dr. Who it is well worth watching to see some of the history of the show.  It really is too bad that they don't have more of these classic episodes."
B000I62JFU A great show about the Cybermen.  The episode centers around the tomb of the cybermen and the old look of them is pretty cool.  I only wish there were more episodes in the AMAZON library."
B000I8FOZA Nothing wrong with production value/quality.  But the subject matter is so improbable that it seems like such a waste of energy to pack even more people into a crowded area (Tokyo) of a crowded country.  750,000 people in an engineered group of buildings stacked like a pyramid.  Watch it if you don't have strong reactions to hubris on display."
B000I8FOZA I appreciate technology and seeing the dreams fot the future.  I will watch additional Extreme Engineering seasons.  thank you for tne presentation."
B000I8FOZA I've lived in Boston for many years and have driven on these roads since the day they opened. After ten years, this video is a very interesting look at the past, and the promises vs. the reality of what became of the Big Dig project.Ironically, or perhaps prophetically, the film begins by showing a section of new tunnel (at time = 2:06). This is the EXACT LOCATION where (on July 10, 2006) the ceiling collapsed on a car, killing passenger Milena Del Valle. The heavy concrete panels were glued in place with epoxy cement that had not been applied properly. It was ultimately determined that ceiling panels weren't actually needed in that location, so today, the ceiling that appears in the video is no longer there.Such was the theme for most of the Big Dig's design and construction. Too many things were \"never attempted before\",  \"biggest in the world\", \"cutting edge\", and/or other custom-designed or unproven technologies. At the same time, the well-connected engineering and construction contractors deliberately made things more complicated and expensive than necessary, so as to maximize their own profits. One notorious example of this became known as the \"Ginzu Guardrails\". Instead of using industry-standard round pipe hand rails in the tunnels, an engineering contractor ordered custom-designed stainless steel hand rails with sharp vertical edges. Besides being much more expensive, they earned the \"Ginzu\" moniker for their ability to slice through accident victims like a knife! Today, many of the original hand rails have been destroyed in accidents and have not been replaced; other sections have been deliberately removed because they are too dangerous. As was the case for the section of ceiling that collapsed, these hand rails were not really needed at all.Of course, it's not all bad; the I-90 extension to the airport has been a great improvement. The Ted Williams tunnel (a.k.a. the Frozen Head tunnel) was one of the first sections to open and the quality of construction is much better than all of the other tunnel sections that were built later. Unfortunately, most of the tunnels under Boston were built very poorly and most disturbingly of all, were not properly sealed to be watertight. In the winter, the leaking water forms huge icicles and ice patches that require application of large amounts of salt inside the tunnels. The large volume of water; combined with the freeze-thaw cycles and corrosive salt effect; was not something the tunnels were designed for. Consequently, the concrete and steel in the tunnels is deteriorating much more rapidly than expected. In another ill-advised design, the aluminum tunnel ceiling light fixtures were attached with steel brackets. Two dissimilar metals in a moist, corrosive environment are always doomed to corrode, and sure enough, in February 2011 the fixtures began falling into the roadway. (they're now temporarily held in place with plastic tie straps, but must all be replaced) As if the initial construction cost wasn't bad enough, the ongoing maintenance costs of the Big Dig will only get worse as the shoddily constructed sections continue to fall apart.I could go on and on about so many other things, but the bottom line is that the cost of the Big Dig was way more expensive than expected and way more expensive than necessary. So much money was spent on this one project, that there was nothing left for other highway projects in Massachusetts, or for the mass transit projects that were initially promised as mitigation for the environmental effects. For most drivers in Boston, the traffic is just as bad if not worse, but instead of being stuck in traffic on Boston's old elevated Central Artery where at least you had a nice view, now you're stuck in traffic in ugly, filthy, crumbling tunnels.The film ends with another ironic quote at time = 33:03 - \"Nobody in five years or ten years is gonna remember the cost, they're gonna look at this thing and say: 'what a beautiful job' \".It would be laughable, if it weren't so very sad.Note for road geeks: Time = 24:05 has a very old aerial view of the Charles River crossing, showing the original elevated ramps that connected the Upper/Lower deck to the Tobin Bridge. Time = 24:42 shows the City Square tunnel under construction in Charlestown, before the loop ramps and Leverett Connector bridge were built."
B000I8FOZA Couldn't even finish &#34;Sky City&#34; - it just feels like a sales pitch. Just get to the extreme engineering people."
B000I8FOZA Some are better than others b
B000I8FOZA Love to see where men build and keep striving for better.  It's nice to live in a day when things naturally progress."
B000I8FOZA It would have been much better if the program shows the specific details they are talking about, instead show the faces of the people speaking about the project.This is a TV show, not a radio."
B000I8FOZA Not the best show ever made but you do learn.  I would love more in depth info but I do understand there is only so much that a show can divulge.  But I will say you will learn a lot and some episodes are done very well others not so well.  But hey give it a shot you may have an engineer in you waiting to get out."
B000I8FOZA The series is in the older square video version.  Made for the older TV types, but it's still a great series.  Inspirational and mind boggling.  Some of the amazing things they come up with are absolutely incredible."
B000I8H2ZU These guys are great and they have a fantastic team. There have been a couple of knock-off shows that weren't even in the same galaxy as the Mythbusters. I would give 7 stars if I could!!"
B000I8H2ZU I've been a Mythbusters fan for a long time and while I'm still not used to the US narrator (coming from the UK where it is narrated by a Brit) I made my way through all the Mythbusters series again on Amazon Prime.The show takes us through those things we always thought we knew about but often didn't. Watching the whole seasons through, it is obvious that while Adam and Jamie were younger in this season they were also a lot angrier at each other. Perhaps they learned each others quirks as the seasons progressed but it is interesting to go back to the early days. You can also view how the budget for the show started increasing over time as their initial experiments were low cost and generally done near the shop, now they have massive explosions in man made lakes and mining quarrys.I recommend this show to my friends and it is often discussed in the work place. Everyone with an interest in science, explosions and humour should be watching this show."
B000I8H2ZU Interesting and kind of educational. Though the filming isn't the best possible at all times, this is a great show for those of us who wonder about what's true and what's not. I highly recommend for everyone who's curious, and those who like scientific explanations for things."
B000I8H2ZU These guys are a little bit crazy.  It is a fun series to watch.  You never know what they are going to do."
B000I8H2ZU I've always enjoyed Mythbusters. Glad this show has gone as long as it has because I can always pull up an episode and be entertained even though I've seen most of them before."
B000I9S5BE Probably the best children's show since Mr. Rogers Neighborhood. I wish they'd kept it going. This show has not one moment of anything I ever worry about my children watching. It's wholesome, educational, and actually interesting (lots of kids shows fail hard on that last one). My favorite thing is that unlike Dora the Explorer or Diego, no one *ever* encourages the audience to be loud. Also, while they do &#34;play Blue's Clues&#34; in every episode, the shows are not all the same. The structure changes slightly each time, which is fantastic. To get what I mean by that, try watching an episode of the exceedingly vapid Animal Mechanicals for a comparison...it's painful."
B000I9S5BE My 2 1/2 yr old granddaughter who is only allowed limited TV time, is quite the connoisseur of children's shows.  Blues Clues is one of her favorites, and explains to me what is going on, and which host is on the show (apparently Steve went away to college)."
B000I9S5BE This is great for my grandchildren.  As an educator I know how important it is to encourage children to think and problem solve.  That is exactly what this show does.  My 22 month old twin grandchildren love it and it is the only show they are allowed to watch."
B000I9S5BE My 18 month old grand daughter loves it!  I guess she understands what Blue says when she 'speaks', I sure 'whoof, whoof' don't!!  I just love that she loves it!"
B000I9S5BE My grandbaby loved this show very much. She still looks for spots all over the place. She was mezmarized totaly."
B000I9S5BE Really? have you ever met a kid who didn't like watching this show whether with joe now or steve in the past?"
B000I9S5BE Blue's Clues has been around for well over a decade, but this 90's gem still shines in contemporary times with content that rivals any other children's programming today.  Educational and at a level that is attractive to a wide range of ages, Blue's Clues is a staple for educational / enjoyable children's shows."
B000I9S5BE Granddaughter, age 5, can't get enough of Blues Clues Season 1.  I must say tho that when she viewed later seasons that changed Steve's role to another guy, she didn't like it.  So she watches the seasons with the original Steve over and over."
B000I9S5BE So glad Blues Clues is on Amazon Prime!! My kids love it :) Thank you so much Amazon! Just wish y'all had other shows, like Little House On The Prairie, and all os the seasons of Dr. Quinn Medicine Woman."
B000I9S5BE I love this program.  The kids get so involved in the entire show. I really chuckle as the little ones really think they can be interactive."
B000I9S5BE My 3-year-old son likes Blue.  His attention span is still pretty short, so he doesn't usually make it through an entire episode.  But, he repeats &#34;a clue!  a clue!&#34; often throughout the day."
B000I9S5BE Good, clean, moral show. Teaches them a lot and not just wasting time watching useless junk.  Good for kids and fun for adults too"
B000I9S5BE I'm not crazy about my son watching TV, but I make an exception for Blue's Clues. It is very sweet and my son loves it."
B000I9S5BE Very instructional and cute. Both my 7 year old and 1 1/2 year old love the show! More seasons for Prime members to stream!!"
B000I9S5BE My daughter (5) really enjoys this show. It's colorful and interactive. She gets to help Blue (the dog) solve problems."
B000I9S5BE Such fun and so educational. Perfect show for toddler.  I love to watch the learning. Highly suggest this show for supplemental learning."
B000I9S5BE Awesome tv series. My son loves blue clues. Wish it was on more often. He likes then one where Blue talks in the videos too"
B000I9S5BE My grandson ask to watches this all the time.  He is a big fan of this show.  The streaming is excellent so the picture quality and sound is clear."
B000I9S5BE My 2 and 3 year old grandsons love Blue's Clues.  I bought Season 1 and downloaded it to my Kindle Fire.  They like to sit in Nana's lap and watch Blue and Steve....and it gives Nana a good excuse to hold and rock the boys."
B000I9S5BE Steve is a genius with children -- he really knows how to elicit their feedback and engagement with the story, and it never feels like he is above his audience.  And it is not too jarring or obnoxious like some children's shows can be."
B000I9S5BE There are a lot of kids' shows that are super, super annoying.  This one is cheesy, but it is sweet, and I especially love Steve.  I love how this show teaches kids about deduction and gives them the chance to solve mysteries."
B000I9S5BE i grew up watching blues clues and now my daughter can enjoy the great music and teachings from fun blue"
B000I9S5BE This is a great edicational show. My kids have watched the entire run of blues clues. They love to watch blue and Steve"
B000I9S5BE My children love this show. I will give a great example from my four year old from last week. We come to a stop sign and she reads S T O P and says that spells stop. We were really impressed, we have been working on letters for quite a while now, but she could comprehend  stop means stop. We  asked her if she learned it in K-3. She said no she learned it on blues clues. Just a side note I know some people are going to read this and say. Well if he didn't have his kid in day care they would be smart... or something of that ilk. Our children are in a small Christian school and they didn't have enough teachers so my wife became a full time volunteer to help the kids. I'm not a fan of preschool, I do not sit in judgment of those who do. It's just a personal choice for us. Back to the show my children have learned so much from this show. hope this helps."
B000I9TWV6 Our two year old loves watching Dora. If your kid loves shows like Bubble Guppies, Backyardigans, Umizoomies then this show is probably right for you."
B000I9TWV6 Well if my two year old had a say she would give it ten stars. I think the show has gotten better since it's introduction. I don't mind her watching it at all and the fact that she surprised me by counting to 5 in Spanish says a lot."
B000I9TWV6 What is bad about Dora.  Not one thing.  This is my grand children's all time favorite.  The first thing out of their mouths are &#34;I need Dora &#34;. Recommend to anyone"
B000I9TWV6 I enjoyed watching Dora and Boots and  the Gang with my Granddaughter on Saturday morning.  The plot lines are simple and easy for her to understand, (she is a preschooler), and she was really engaged.  She loved being a part of the story when Dora asked her to participate.  She was so involved in what was going on.  We had a lot of fun, and we will enjoy watching it again very soon.  We love Dora!!!!"
B000I9TWV6 I like Dora. Both my kids like to watch this show. The music and lessons taught are very helpful. All the interaction with other characters are great and telling Swiper to stop swipping is hilarious, Love all seasons of Dora."
B000I9TWV6 We purchased this season for our daughter who loves Dora using the Amazon Instant Video app for Wii. We have no issues with play or image etc.Unfortunately, my husband and I cannot stand Dora. She sets our teeth on edge. But our daughter loves Dora so we put up with the show. I don't feel that my daughter has gotten much educational value from Dora, to be perfectly honest. She's learned more from Ni Hao Kai-lan, Yo Gabba Gabba, Little Einsteins, and Team Umizoomi. I only took off one star for this since Dora is entertaining for toddlers (admittedly the target audience, not parents) and for some reason kids love her."
B000I9TWV6 The colors are bright and cheerful. Great story lines.kkeps a child's attention while teaching them life lessons.My grand child really learns a lot from this show"
B000I9TWV6 My 18m/o loves this show it teachers her friendship, Spanish, and how to solve problems. It is age appropriate too."
B000I9TWV6 The little short videos is just right for her.  It helps her learn to count and limited Spanish as well as sequencing. Very helpful for learning to read."
B000I9TWV6 My 2 year old grand daughter loves Dora and all her friends!  It's a very positive toddler/kids show. It's also educational, fun and entertaining."
B000I9TWV6 My 4 yr old loves Dora and always enjoys going on adventures. She also like to speak other languages and thinks it is so cool."
B000I9TWV6 Entertaining and informative for the young minds. Granddaughter already is counting to 10 in Spanish and has picked up several words (colors).  She is only 2."
B000I9TWV6 my child loves it.  It is the ABC animal episode.  We don't generally like Dora but this specific episode is really cute and keeps my little guys attention."
B000I9TWV6 I like the show because you can learn Spanish words and that is good exposure for my 3 year old. The show is good for very young children but it is a very simple show."
B000I9TWV6 The grandkids really love Dora the Explorer and is a very good way to learn beginning Spanish a language that they will probably need later on in life."
B000I9TWV6 I believe it's a very positive show, she can learn both languages, English and Spanish and also, about friendship! Isn't that awesome. Only three seasons are on prime but its really worth the cost."
B000I9TWV6 dora teaches problem solving, spanish, manners and fairness.  my son loves this show, as most kids do, but i feel good letting my son watch this show, because he always comes away learning something and the show is very interactive, it prompts kids to talk back to the tv and answer questions and solves problems."
B000I9TWV6 My two-year old daughter LOVES this show.It's interactive: it engages the viewer to repeat a set of instructions, dance, and shout at Dora's nemesis, Swiper, \"Swiper, no swiping!\" The cast includes Dora, Boots (her sidekick), the Map (it gives directions to help Dora on her journey), the Backpack (provides a toolkit to resolve any issues), and Swiper the Fox.The show is also educational because it teaches viewers a Spanish word or two during the show. Think Spanish 101. In fact, some people I know brush up on their Spanish by watching a few episodes before taking a Spanish quiz in class (yes, Dora's pretty thorough).The storylines are predictable, yet they are always entertaining to my two-year old. Not a day goes by where she isn't yelling at the TV, \"Swiper, no swiping!\""
B000I9TWV6 My son loves this show. He is always asking \"more Dora more Dora\" I like how the show will pick up where u last left off"
B000I9TWV6 No matter what episode it is, my son has been hooked on this cartoon since he was a little baby... he's learn alot of words and general knowledge watching this..."
B000I9TWV6 Age appropriate cartoon packed with learning for my little ones. great job with the show options amazon prime. well done"
B000I9TWV6 I love the ease to remember songs for my kids, and that it helps them work on their memory. It's got rally cute characters too. I so like that it teaches Spanish too"
B000I9TWV6 I am a nanny an the little girl love this show. Every time we go shopping she screams backpack (what she calls Dora) when she see it."
B000I9TWV6 My kids enjoy this show.  I like that it's got some educational value and isn't annoying for me to watch with them."
B000I9TWV6 My girls ages 3 and 4 absolutely love Dora and they enjoy these episodes from season 2. They stream easily on the Roku."
B000I9TWV6 There is a adventure in every episode. Every adventure is new. In each episode, There is a place to go."
B000I9TWV6 I have two young children and we love almost everything Dora! The shows always have some element of learning,  My girls have actually recognized Spanish words in books now that they have heard Dora speak them."
B000I9TWV6 When I was little, I used to despise watching this program, and I only hate it more now. Every episode, of course, is repetitive (I know it is a nursery schoolers' television cartoon, but there are more educational, entertaining series out there, such as \"Little Bear\" or \"Little Bill\", that can educate children without repeating themselves continuously) and predictable, even for a three-year-old child. When I was a small child, I understood that, whether you answered a fourth wall-breaking cartoon character's questions or not, they were going to find out the answer on their own anyway, and it can grow tedious waiting for every little scene that you knew to expect after viewing previous episodes to be over with so the next boring, repetitive scene can appear and bring you closer to the conclusion of the episode. I know that many little children don't realize that Dora will figure out the answers to her endless supply of obvious questions on her own as soon as the blue arrow clicks on a landmark along the path for her, but I did and hated to watch her. I also thought that the characters were ugly. I mean, Dora did teach me some Spanish, but most of the time she bored me out of my mind."
B000I9TWV6 My grandson LOVES Dora the Explorer and he learns a bit of Spanish too which really isn't the goal of watching this program."
B000I9TWV6 After watching Dora for the last +10 years! I have Kids ages 3-16!Good for kids. Lots of stuff to learn."
B000I9TWV6 Both my sons love watching Dora. The language is appropriate for 3-5 year old kids and boots is an awesome addition to the characters."
B000I9TWV6 My kids love to interact with Dora. Both my one year old and 3 year old learn with this show."
B000I9TWV6 This video downloaded ok. It did have to buffer it once but I'm not sure if it was my iPad or what but it did great after that, had no problems and I would recommend this video to anyone with little kids!"
B000I9TWV6 My granddaughter just can't get enough of Dora. Two years old and it's perfect for her..she is learning a little bit of spanish, and the stories are a wonderful learning tool."
B000I9TWV6 Who doesn't love Dora? My three-yr old granddaughter is being expertly prepped for K-2. Just as my previous four grandkids. The vocal response to Dora's questions say it all. Five stars, Dora, five stars"
B000I9TWV6 My grandsons love Dora.  I find myself watching right along with them and learning new words.  If you have a preschooler please try Dora.  She is fun and entertaining."
B000I9TWV6 I don't like Dora but the kids are transfixed for 25 minutes so it allows me to get something done. I only like Dora because of learning words in other languages. otherwise, it's annoying"
B000I9TWV6 Great show for young kids. My thee year old son loves Dora & Diego. Educational & entertaining for kids & will make them want to sing."
B000I9TWV6 Two year old likes it, but it is very hard for an adult to watch more than one or two episodes without pulling their hair out."
B000I9TWV6 Educational and entertaining to the grandkids. Would recommend for anyone with preschoolers. Hope to see more seasons in the future!"
B000I9TWV6 Good clean and colorful fun for a four old.  I can always be sure that she will be entertained as she learns about the world she lives in"
B000I9TWV6 On our third round of Dora with our youngest and it is still great. Going to miss it when they are too old to watch. :( The blend of math, patterns, comprehension and problem solving is so key to development at the young ages. Dora is great."
B000I9TWV6 I found this dull and unexciting.  The graphics are very 90s ish and the soundtrack is so-so.  She's no Diego that's for sure.  Then again, she's probably in the country legally..."
B000I9TWV6 The quality is as good as can be expected from a 10-year-old cartoon, but it plays smoothly.  One odd complaint--the Nickelodeon &#34;intro&#34; is MUCH louder than the rest of the cartoon for some reason, and that's consistently true across all of the Dora and Diego cartoons.  When watching you may want to adjust the volume down (or mute) until the intro is done to save your TV speakers and possibly your ears.  The cartoon itself is cute and well-structured for younger children, that eventually understand what Dora is asking for and the order in which things happen on the show.  My 2-year-old girl loves it and would watch an entire season straight through if I'd let her.  It's the first cartoon like this to really capture her attention for an entire episode so that alone makes it worth the recommendation for younger children."
B000I9TWV6 She's so enthusiastic and has great adventures!  Our son and daughter both love Dora shows!  They're great enthusiastic fun and the kids learn a little too."
B000I9TWV6 My granddaughters, ages 5 and 3, can not get enough of Dora.  They ask to watch it every time they visit.  We love it because this show teaches the girls so much.  Would highly recommend this to all!"
B000I9TWV6 I still like the show, I just kind of enjoy the early seasons better... It seems that right about this season they stop singing the original map song as much and my daughter really enjoys that song."
B000I9TWV6 My two year old loves this show. I personally find it kind of annoying, but it wasn't made for adults, was it?"
B000IBUIS0 I won't write you a &#34;book&#34; on this one, others have already done that. This was one well done series, in just about any aspect. Well written, it even &#34;looked&#34; good- unlike the typical SYFY Saturday movie. I always wondered why religion came into the plot line the last couple of seasons, negatively portrayed at that, but maybe the writers were running out of material. Well written even if you don't like the subject matter sometimes, or the enemy ( I &#34;liked&#34; the Goa'uld- seasons 1-8, better than the Ori- 9-10, and even then the stories had something to them.Start at the beginning of the series, not the end, and always be sure to watch the extras each season.This was the best of the three Stargate series."
B000IBUIS0 This season seemed to be more about the artsy predilctions of the actors and producers.  The battle with the Ori became more and more convoluted and was not resolved to my satisfaction with the bad guys getting their butts kicked by the good guys.  I liked the first 9 and would watch them again.  I wouldn't watch season 10 again."
B000IBUIS0 This series was always dependable.  It always resolved itself satisfactorily.  The characters were sensible, disciplined, and willing to have fun."
B000IBUIS0 What a morose way to end such a fun series. I always said that if they ever began taking this show seriously, it would come to a bad end, and I was right. It's like, we're ending the season with no sense of humor. In fact, we're gonna off the Asgard by letting them commit mass suicide and then we're going to spring a Greek tragedy on poor T'ealc. This show succeeded through its sense of humor (why else watch a show where everyone within three galaxies all speak 21st century English? Duh!). Now it fades into oblivion without any sense of fulfillment. What a shame. Maybe that's why this season is going for $29! I'd rather buy two copies of Season 1! How do I pick zero stars?"
B000IBUIS0 If you've never seen the franchise get the movie starring Kurt Russell first.Then get all 10 seasons(there is a boxed set of all 10).Nuff said!!!"
B000IBUIS0 SG1 is everything a show should be, intelligent, funny, attractive- this is sci fi that deserves to stick around for a long time."
B000IBUIS0 I found it to be an enjoyable series though the recognizable science was a bit thin. Towards the end it seemed to me the writers had explored pretty much what could be done in the premise of the show. It was a good idea to stop when they did. If you like science fiction, I think you will like this one."
B000IBUIS0 Oh the finale!! Did you get the feels? I did. Man I cried once(on the inside) when I re-watched the most memorable of episodes. Ahh! Why did you have to leave us!!"
B000IBUIS0 A great show that will make you laugh, cry and cheer.  Fantastic acting and loveable characters.  What more do you need in a show."
B000IBUIS0 I'll admit, this is not one of my favorite episodes. This episode was not great, but it was okay. It gave you a bit of a background look into Valla and her family. The showing of Vala's father in this was very nice, as we don't know much about her, besides her being a thief before. Also, this was a good opportunity to see Landry and his family a little closer. However, the funniest and most favorite part of mine will always be the ending. Probably one of the funniest scenes in the SG-1 series. I feel so sorry for Teal'c. Good episode."
B000IBUIS0 Stargate  SG-1is one of those shows that the good guys win most of the time.Lots of action, Lots of humor if you pay attention.I would recommend to most anyone how wants Sifi, action or adventure"
B000IBUIS0 what an episode. its episodes like this that make me realize that SG-1 isthe best scifi ever. I hope all feel the same!"
B000IBUIS0 Good cast, good stories. Well directed and well-written.  And of course Richard Dean Anderson is always good even if this role is definitely different than his more famous one Angus MacGyver."
B000IBUIS0 Always buy this series, and am sorry that it is, as a weekly show, ending.Therefore it is good to be able to have the last season (I have all the others) as it is one of the best in the field - science fiction - apart from old faithful Star Trek. Always miss Richard Dean Anderson, that wry and handsome wit, but Shanks and Browder, let alone Claudia Black, what a terrific actor! more than make up for his loss. I always wish more of Amanda Tapping's abilities apart from sheer mathematics that she is forced by plot to come out with at least four or five times per episode could be utilized in more interesting directions, but she is the greatest also. Look forward to her in Stargate Atlantis.Stargate SG-1 season 10 is a worthy product and has been added to my collection with great satisfaction.Linda Sheean"
B000IBUIS0 This show is fantastic!  I love how they wind ancient culture and Myths into futuristic events!  It's a lot of fun to watch, especially if you're into ancient myths and such."
B000IBUIS0 IT WAS RELLY GOOD I LOVED IT, WAS FUNNY AND PLENTY OF ACTION&#62; I WOULD WATCH IT Again Just Enjoy"
B000IBUIS0 Stargate was a good movie and an even better series.  Very imaginative and well acted.  Recently, I rewatched the series and enjoyed it very much."
B000IBUIS0 Love the characters and seeing them as they develop over time. Very fun show. Episode 200 is awesome. Love it"
B000IBUIS0 While the writers gave us a new enemy in the Ori it also felt a little redundant to do so somewhat since they already were notified that the series would end here. It felt like the writers were hoping that the backers and producers would renew the series for this new saga but after ten years it was time to give the series a decent finale and while you do get the finale it felt a little weak for what the series was.If you already have the other past seasons and for the price of this set I'd say go ahead and add it to your t.v. show collection while not on par with the past eight seasons it still has for the most part an intriguing story and cast to make you watch the season through to the end."
B000IBUIS0 Warning!  Many spoilers!Additional Warning:  Thanks to Canadian and British television, the final episodes of STARGATE SG-1 have already been shown through much of the world.  The following review is based on having seen everything including the series finale.And so after an amazing ten year run, STARGATE SG-1 comes to a dignified end.  Sorta.  Plans for a couple of TV movies are already in the works, so the plot ends that are left somewhat open at the end of the series will probably be resolved at that time.  It is hard at this point to know what the show's legacy will be.  It never received the critical acclaim that series like FARSCAPE, BATTLESTAR GALACTICA, FIREFLY, or even BABYLON 5 received, and one can't point to specific ways that it has altered or molded other Sci-Fi series, but simply being around for a decade is unprecedented in Sci-fi.  Yeah, DR. WHO has been around longer, but its presence has been far more episodic and it has sometimes been prey to a budget smaller than a kids' show (though certainly this is not the case for its present incarnation).  It certainly did a number of things right.  The writing remained strong throughout.  The production values were strong from beginning to end.  And if it never scaled the peaks of brilliance of other series it still managed to produce many memorable moments.  Perhaps its legacy is something to be set aside for a decade or so.What is amazing is that the tenth season was a largely successful effort at self-recreation.  Season Nine had been plagued by pregnancy.  Both Amanda Tapping and Claudia Black (and some of the outfits Ms. Black wore in Season Ten reveal that she has fully recovered from having given birth--the highlight of Season Ten might have been the outfit she wore in the high school reunion episode from near the end of the season) had children during that season.  I'm a huge fan of kids and having babies, but it doesn't mesh well with making TV shows.  Tapping was missing for the early part of the season and Black for most of the middle.  Both were present for the entirety of Season Ten.  Black's real life pregnancy fed into the plot of Season Ten, with her giving birth to a mystical child who became the super-empowered leader of the Ori.  Adria (played by Monica Baccarin, Inara from FIREFLY) grew into a full-grown woman with overwhelming powers in a matter of weeks.  Throughout the season SG-1 has to struggle against their most powerful foe yet, who nonetheless harbors affection towards her mother, hoping to convert her to a belief in the Ori.What makes Season Ten work for me above all else is Claudia Black as Vala.  Although I have long been a fan of the show, I've long felt that there was a central problem in the core cast.  Though Richard Dean Anderson's Jack O'Neill was ever the wise cracker, there was a lack of genuine humor at the core of the show and despite the implied attraction between O'Neill and Samantha Carter, no real romantic chemistry.  But Vala is really, truly funny and a real sex post as well.  And it was brilliant to team her with the wound-too-tight Daniel Jackson rather than Col. Mitchell (which would have been expected, since Black and Ben Browder portrayed what was perhaps THE great romantic couple in all of TV Sci-fi, Aeryn Sun and John Crichton on FARSCAPE).  Vala and Jackson are great together, with the unconventional and free-spirited Vala both appealing to and threatening the Boy Scout Jackson.  As a huge fan of Claudia Black's Aeryn Sun, who was a stern and serious character, it was delightful seeing her be such a goofball on this show.  All in all, her character brought a bit of anarchism that was frequently lacking on the show.  If I have a regret with the series coming to an end, it is in not knowing what happens to her next.  In one of the most endearing touches of the season, the Stargate program only very gradually decides to allow Vala to become a part of the SG-1 team.  The season's opening credits start off with the main four marching through the gate, but the week after she is allowed to join, just as the four start to walk through, Vala scampers up to join them.The main plot for the final season focused on the ongoing struggle against the Ori, a group of ultra religious fanatics.  With religious fundamentalism dominating both domestic and international news, with both Christian fundamentalists in the US trying to force public opinion to conform with their beliefs and Islamic fundamentalists trying to force the rest of Islam to conform with their violent and intolerant readings of the Koran (readings that the vast majority of Muslims do not agree with), nothing could be more relevant than intolerant religious zealots who are willing to kill those who do not agree with them.There were some significant farewells in Season Ten.  Samantha's father, who had seen his life extended several years by accepting a symbiote and becoming a member of the Tok'ra, finally did die.  And not only Thor, but also the entirety of the Asgard died as well.Although STARGATE SG-1 was noted for its huge, epic, cliffhanging finales, the series finale was surprisingly subdued and quiet.  But also, I thought, remarkably appropriate.  I'm sure there was the temptation of a \"Big Ending,\" but instead they decided to focus instead on a relatively unspectacular, intimate episode in which time is essentially frozen for a few decades.  The main five simply spend some time together, while Vala and Daniel actually live a life of romantic bliss.  Typically, they manage a brilliant scientific solution to their dilemma at the end, with only Teal'c retaining any memory of the preceding decades.  As the show ends he smiles bemusedly as Vala and Daniel fall into their bickering ways.  But we know the potential that remains.So, a classic series comes to an end.  It wasn't the best Sci-fi series ever.  It wasn't the most ground breaking.  And it isn't likely to be one of the more influential.  But it was the longest running uninterrupted Sci-fi series in the history of Sci-fi and introduced us to a host of memorable characters.  Yeah, it had some unpleasant quirks.  It used \"Science as Magic\" to such a degree that it almost became a parody of itself.  It reused plots endlessly.  I mean, just how many alternate universe episodes did we really need?  And how many times were there multiple copies of the same character?  (I suspect that BATTLESTAR GALACTICA's refusal to use the same plot device twice or to EVER employ science in magical fashion owes a great deal to the abuse of both by SG-1.)  Still, the show took us to a host of wonderful places, introduced us to some wonderful enemies, and continually managed to entertain and delight.  And we got to know the core group of characters quite well.  Not many shows get ten seasons; even fewer manage ten seasons so well.  The show was starting to seem a bit old by the end, but it managed to do what almost no series ever gets to do:  last ten years and still have something left in the tank at the end."
B000IBUIS0 This is a spin off from the movie Star Gate with Kurt Russell and James Spader.  The series starts up where the movie left off.The shows were well written, and the acting was good.Of course Richard Dean Anderson gave the show its' sense of humor. Give the show a try.  Based on science fiction it was the cast that gave Stargate SG 1 a 10 year run on TV."
B000IBUIS0 In case you aren't familiar with the show, this is the final season DVD set.It's a TV show that lasted 10 seasons and gave the viewers a realistic world of science fiction that often made you think if it's really fiction.Imagine finding an ancient artifact that allows you to travel light years away to another planet and explore the unknown. What you discover is fascinating, exciting and dangerous; We are not alone and we are not as advanced species as we once thought.I've been a Stargate SG-1 fan since the beginning.This DVD will complete my collection as I already seen all the episodes.  This is for my personal archive of what I consider the best Science Fiction show.I have been a long time fan of Science Fiction.  I watched various Star Trek Series, Space 1999, The Avengers, Doctor Who, just to name very few.I loved them all for what they gave me; a momentary escapism.  They all have given me a place where I can immerse myself and enjoy the wonder of another place and time.Then came the Stargate SG-1.  I'm sure many will argue what is the most influential SciFi of all times.  But if you ask me what show gave me the most satisfying and lasting impression as the best SciFi, it's Stargate SG-1.I have to thank the writers and the chemistry of actors who made it the most enjoyable show."
B000IBUIS0 The 200th episode was pretty dumb, and there were too many episodes that got away from the ongoing theme (the Ori), but it was still pretty good, especially for 10 seasons.  Glad they could wrap up the Ori in the follow-on The Arc of Truth movie.  Stargate Atlantis is still the best of all of these Stargate shows."
B000IBUIS0 Stargate went ten seasons, this alone should tell you how good the show was. The military man, the alien warrior, the nerd and the sexy scientist. Get it them all and you will have entertainment for some time to come."
B000IBUIS0 This series is very adventure filled. Not only that but we love the concept of being able to travel to other worlds through a star gate worm hole. How awesome it that! in just seconds you're there. We watched several episodes a night and couldn't wait til the next time we were able to watch. It was fun to see what the team was up to next and what lie ahead on the next planet. You definitely won't be bored with this series."
B000IBUIS0 and everything in between during the 10th season of \"Stargate: SG-1\". By the way, this ISN'T the end of SG-1 as two direct-to-video TV movies are due in 2008 with stand alone storylines. During the 10th season we get to see the resolution of the conflict between the alliance and the Ori, the end of the Asgardians and the continuing blossoming romance between Dr. Daniel Jackson (Michael Shanks) and Vala (Claudia Black). The show went through a lot of change during the last three seasons as storylines were wrapped up, new storyarcs developed and new characters such as Lt. Colonel Cameron Mitchell (Ben Browder well known to sci-fi fans from \"Farscape\")and Vala (Claudia Black anther \"Farscape\" alum)providing the show with an additional injection of energy. Beau Bridges came on board adding spark to the show as well. Richard Dean Anderson is missed during the 10th and final season but his spirit is kept very much alive by Browder and Black in their roles. Michael Shanks, Amanda Tapping and Christopher Judge proved to the the strongest link in the chain between the old Stargate and new.The story arc episodes are among the best while some of the stand alone episodes are (with the exception of a few) probably the weakest of the 10th season seeming like filler at times. The stand-alone episodes may or may not appeal to you like those on \"The X-Files\" and \"Farscape\" these episodes stand or fall based on the strength of the plotting and how realistic the wrap up is within 45 minutes. Some episodes as a result are better than others with some abrupt resolutions using the old ex deus machina (represented as help from Stargate Command or other sources sometimes unexpected)where more time could have been devoted to the story expanding it over more than one episode. As a long time \"Farscape\" fan I was happy to tag along after the cast changes and found that if you gave the final two seasons a chance, they were extremely good at the best of times.The show experienced a lot of change during the last three seasons which would make one expect them to be lesser seasons than the previous 7. Nothing could be further from the truth. The new characters were perfect additions to the show adding after the departure of Richard Dean Anderson as Colonel Jack O'Neil. The addition of Beau Bridges as Major General Hank Landry to replace long time cast member Don Davis (Davis' character was promoted and he appeared in a couple of episodes during season nine)who played Major General George Hammond and various guest stars (Fred Willard, Robert Picardo a regular on \"Star Trek: Voyager\" started appearing in season 9) helped spruce up the last season of the show. It also helped that the Ori story arc was nicely resolved during the last season as well.The show looks pretty good but there are some digital artifacts evident in the transfers. Most of you won't notice them or care but for those that do keep in mind the amount of information packed on each disc. The 10th season has been packaged in the slimline packaging that was rolled out with season 8. I'm sure these will show up on Blu-Ray but the show looks fine here and is well priced.The DVD has commentary tracks for every episode except one (and I suspect that was probably an accident as one episode has TWO commentary tracks. They probably scheduled the wrong episode for the second commentary track), deleted scenes, featurettes in the Director's Series focusing on 1 director for 1 episode of each disc. We also got the usual assortment of photo and production galleries included as well. There is a trailer that for the first of the two Stargate direct-to-video movies \"Stargate SG-1: The Ark of Truth\" (the second one also coming in 2008 is \"Stargate SG-1: Continuum\" involving time travel and reportedly will feature Richard Dean Anderson).The 10th season varies b
B000IBUIS0 Not as good as season 5, 6 or 7 but okay too.But I was very disappointed with the ending.Stargate definetely deserved a big impressive ending.For heavens sake! - such an awesome TV show - we are talking TV HISTORY:and then this weak lame ending........zero stars for the creativity of the writers involved."
B000IBUP6A The very dated soundtrack hurts this otherwise OK 70s crime drama. All the suspense scenes are marred by the hokey Dave Grusin score, which sounds like a dippy 1960s TV show. Some of the dialogue is spoken so quickly and mumbled that I found it hard to make out. Some have made a bit much of the Boston accents here. I'm from Massachusetts. Mitchum's accent isn't bad, but it's not fully real. His performance as the small-time crook-turned-rat who fears going back to jail is fine, but it's no Oscar winner. I did like the depiction of early 70s Boston and its suburbs, replete with many of the horrible vintage 60s and 70s Detroit autos of the period. Seeing them again made me shudder. This was based on what was probably George Higgins' best crime novel. I've never read it. Don't expect today's production values with this film. Everything moves a lot more slowly, and many shots needed tighter editing."
B000IBUP6A I was very pleased to find this on Criterion's pre-release list, but not surprised - it's just the sort of little-known cinematic gem that Criterion does wonders with. In fact, I've been looking for a copy of this for some time, having first seen Eddie Coyle years and years ago, the memory of the film's stark realism and mood etched in my mind like few others. This is definitive 70's Noir and a title fully worthy of a pull-out-all-the-stops release that Criterion consistently provides.  What a fine addition to the Criterion title catalogue, the choice reflecting - as usual - an impeccable sense of film history on the part of Criterion's staff."
B000IBUP6A \"Eddie doesn't rob banks...He's about this high in the bunch but he gets around more than any man I've ever seen,\" says Dave Foley (Richard Jordan), a baby-faced Boston cop about as amoral as the wiseguys he hunts. Eddie Coyle (Robert Mitchum) is a worn out, two-bit gunrunner. He provides untraceable revolvers when required. He draws the line at machine guns. Eddie is honorable in his way. He loves his family. He's just a low life who isn't all that shrewd. The fix he's in, because he can't take any more jail time, is what this superb Peter Yates' movie is all about.\"Look. I'm gettin' old, y'hear?\" Eddie tells a young hood who deals in machine guns. \"I spend most of my life hangin' around crummy joints with the punks drinkin' the beer, eatin' the hash an' hot dogs and watchin' the other people go off to Florida while I'm sweatin' how I'm goin' to pay the plumber. I done time when I stood up but I can't take no more chances. Next time it's goin' to be me goin' to Florida.\" Now he's facing more prison time for foolishly agreeing to drive a getaway car when he should have asked his friends some questions. He'll do just about anything to cut a deal for no jail time. He's nearly 50. He doesn't want his wife to go on welfare, doesn't want his three kids made fun of because their old man is doing time. He's squeezed by Dave Foley to inform...and Eddie decides he'll rat a little. He's too believing to understand he might be tagged for ratting big time. It's all betrayal, but Eddie doesn't really understand betrayal. All those friends of Eddie's make us wary every time we meet them: Scalise (Alex Rocco), who robs banks, sometimes violently; Jackie (Steve Keats), the dangerous dealer in stolen machine guns; Dillon (Peter Boyle), owner of a low-life bar who knows more about things than Eddie does.The movie looks as hopeless as the Boston weather. It's the cold end of fall, filled with drab, chill days where parking lot asphalt is always wet. We're into Eddie's life in the low lane, where the anchors in the crummy strip malls are a tired Woolworth's and Barbo's Furniture Store. It's a lousy life and it belongs to Eddie Coyle. \"Have a nice day.\"Director Peter Yates sets up scenes -- an exchange of machine guns, a bank robbery, a family held hostage, a stakeout in a commuter train lot, a night on the town -- that are so naturally established that we might miss how skillfully they build the story and show us Eddie's life. We're never sure if things are as hopeless for Eddie as they seem. Yates keeps us on edge, and he adds layers of Eddie Coyle's sad and foolish trust.This is one of Robert Mitchum's best performances. Mitchum still looks like he might be a tough guy, but his Eddie Coyle is a man who has had the force of his life wrung out of him. He's been in the life forever. He does the jobs others ask him to. He doesn't ask very many questions. He's just not smart enough. Mitchum takes all the hard edges off his usual persona and gives us an aging loser whose life is on the skids, and who doesn't understand just how badly off he is.The Criterion release looks just fine. There is a commentary by Peter Yates."
B000IBUP6A This film was a minor letdown after reading all the five star reviews.  There's nothing intrinsically wrong with the film.  My theory is that after years of being out of circulation it's reputation exceeds it's actual artistic worth.  Everything here is aces, though.  Good direction, atmosphere and writing.  The acting is superb with the stolid Robert Mitchum leading the cast.  I particularly liked Steven Keats' gundealer and Richard Jordan's duplicitous fed.  I think we've been spoiled by the high quality of films in this genre with Sidney Lumet's \"Prince of the City\" and Martin Scorsese's \"The Departed\".  Recommended without reservation but not as enthusiastically as some."
B000IBUP6A An essay by David Mamet turned me on to George V. Higgins, and, completest that I am, I devoured all his novels.  He is the smartest dialogue writer I have ever read.  Last year's &#34;Killing Them Softly&#34; got the wit, zing, and poetry just right, and the delivery by Brad Pitt and James Gandolfini was  amazing.Robert Mitchum is more realistic in his approach, so, while the dialogue is not delivered with the great timing of Pitt and Gandolfini, his physical presence is completely believable as the low-level mobster, Eddie Coyle.Otherwise, kind of plodding."
B000IBUP6A this is one of those individualistic and remarkable films that for some reason has slipped under or past the usual critical and viewer recommendations -- hat tip to a.o. scott for highlighting it as a critic's choice in the new york times. \"friends of eddie coyle\" is in that peculiar variant of film noir where \"good and evil\" have been entirely extracted from the narrative dynamic, leaving only the tactical calculations of characters swimming a turbulent world of existentialist gray. it only gradually becomes clear that some of these low lifes are thieves, some are gun runners, and some are cops, or how exactly the thieves and gun runners are connected, or that acquaintances are hit men, and hit men will, for a price, take down even those they invite to enjoy a hockey game. the narrative shifts back and forth between set piece bank robberies or gun purchases and one on one conversations in which the protagonists alternately manipulate, flatter, wheedle, bluff, coerce or inform on one another -- all filmed in a flat, clinical, procedural style strongly reminiscent jean-pierre melville's \"army of shadows\" (1969). the whole is knit together by the fate of eddie coyle, embodied by robert mitchum in an unsentimental but nuanced performance, who attempts to balance the demands of treasury cops (who might help him in a forthcoming sentencing for smuggling liquor) and the needs of armed criminals (who provide eddie's livelihood). the film is a grim and tragic examination of human beings who must negotiate trust and threat as part of their daily survival, and where the winners are those who can do the most reliable service for \"the man\" (or for \"uncle\"); the weak are those who only have the weak to rely on."
B000IBUP6A Mitchum is always spell binding & he is again.  As a kid \"Thunder Road\" became part of my psyche (saw at a drive-in).  The song - I will remember to my grave.  Keely Smith as his girl friend couldn't have been more seductive or more in love w/her moonshine runner.  Mitchum always managed to be in trouble no matter which side of the law he was on.  His classic detective films are hard to find - \"The Big Sleep\" & \"Farewell My Lovely\".  AGAIN why do most reviewers blab it all?  Paragraphs & paragraphs & paragraphs telling one about a film...ever so boring.  Me thinks these folks have too much time on their hands.  I digress...this film is certainly worth watching.  Impossible to notice other actors - Mitchum w/his sleepy eyes & conspicuous laid back attitude could charm the fur off a pussy cat..."
B000IBUP6A Good movie especially if you like Mitchum."
B000IBUP6A Though often dismissed by critics as \"walking through\" his roles, Robert Mitchum) was perhaps Hollywood's most underrated actor.  True, many of his films were not worthy of his talent, but when he did get a good script (e.g. THE NIGHT OF THE HUNTER, HEAVEN KNOWS MR. ALLISON, CAPE FEAR), his performance was always mesmerizing.Arguably, Mitchum's finest screen performance can be found in THE FRIENDS OF EDDIE COYLE (1973), now available on DVD from The Criterion Collection.Directed by Peter Yates, who supplies audio commentary on the disc, the film is set in Boston and casts Mitchum as a small-time felon, a family man facing a 2-5 year sentence on a smuggling conviction.  His only hope of avoiding prison is to give an FBI agent (Richard Jordan) information that will help to bring down some bigger bad guys...like the men who have been on a bank-robbing spree and killed a teller during their last job.Mitchum's problem is that, if he \"rats\" on those guys, his life is not worth a plugged nickel.Peter Boyle co-stars in the picture, playing Mitchum's \"friend,\" a former felon who is now a bartender and also supplies confidential information to the Feds.Adapted from the novel by George V. Higgins by Paul Monash, this is a gritty, first-rate crime drama, shot in almost a semi-documentary style.  Mitchum's performance, particularly his first scene in which he explains to a young punk gun dealer how he got the nickname, \"Fingers,\" is unforgettable.The Criterion package contains a booklet of essays on Mitchum and the film. Michael B. Druxman"
B000IBUP6A \"The Friends of Eddie Coyle\", adapted from the novel by George V. Higgins, is exemplary of the kind of film noir that was unique to the 1970s. It shares the chaotic noir world with films of the 1940s, but protagonist is fast being rendered irrelevant by a rapidly changing world where even corruption isn't what it used to be, and he knows it. It's fitting, then, that the protagonist should be played by an aging Robert Mitchum, conflicted hero of more than a few films of the classic noir cycle. Eddie Coyle (Robert Mitchum) is a hood who runs guns for the Boston mob. Caught in a recent trucking job set up by his bar-owning friend Dillon (Peter Boyle), Coyle is looking at a probable 3-5 years in prison. He can't afford to do the time, so he considers snitching on his gun supplier to a federal agent, Dave Foley (Richard Jordan), but the feds are more interested in a recent string of bank robberies.Eddie Coyle is a man from another era. He ponders how much and whom he is willing to betray to keep himself out of prison. He paternalistically lectures his young gun supplier (Steven Keats) about how rough the business is and the importance of caution and reliability. Eddie is playing by some old rulebook that is no longer applies. He doesn't realize he's being played by just about everyone. He catches on too late to how the game of cops and robbers is currently conducted. \"The Friends of Eddie Coyle\" was an ironic title for a cynical and depressed era. Made the year the Watergate scandal broke, it's hardly surprising that law enforcement is portrayed as no more ethical than outright criminality. Shot on location in Boston, director Peter Yates' style is unadorned but includes a lot of procedure -how guns are obtained and banks robbed- that enhance the film's aura of authenticity.The DVD (Criterion Collection 2009): Spine #475. Bonus features are a Stills Gallery of 22 behind-the-scenes images captioned by director Peter Yates and a feature commentary by Yates, recorded in 2009. This is one of Yates' favorite 3 films of the 25 films he directed. He talks about choosing the locations, the cast and performances, including a lot about Mitchum's work on this film, his own \"style of reality and simplicity\", and the filmmaking process. Also included is a booklet featuring an essay by film critic Kent Jones and a 1973 profile of Robert Mitchum from \"Rolling Stone\"."
B000IBUP6A \"The Friends of Eddie Coyle\" is a 1970's crime movie, with great dialogue, acting, and intrigue. The movie reminded me of \"The Sopranos\" more than classic film noir. \"Eddie Coyle\" is more realistic and subdued than a lot of noir. It also has a lot of criminals interacting: pulling capers, making deals, and distrusting each other, like some of the criminals in \"The Sopranos\". It's centered more on the interaction of the characters and the story than on action. There are several great scenes, where the dialogue and the acting are engaging, particularly when Robert Mitchum speaks. I've never been a fan of Robert Mitchum, but here he's excellent, bringing a lot of emotion and weariness to Eddie Coyle. The story is also very good, as we see Eddie struggle to stay out of jail. The DVD is from The Criterion Collection, and looks good. There is a new commentary track from director Peter Yates. I don't think this film will appeal to a wide audience, because it's completely a crime film and nothing else, but fans of crime films might thoroughly enjoy it. Reviewed 8/23/2009 after watching on DVD."
B000ICRKLM Stargate Atlantis in my opinion is the best of the SG franchise.  The characters are excellent...lots of action, wit and even wisdom!"
B000ICRKLM As I've said in all my reviews, I love the Stargate shows SG-1 and Atlantis, not so Universe.  I like the way they spun off the whole Atlantis discovery as the foundation for extending SG-1 which was great, but ran it's course and was in decline at the end.  It allowed some new characters, albeit with familiar personalities, along with keeping alive some old favorites with vague tie in's to their ongoing lives as well as bringing Samantha Carter back for a season to head the program (in addition to all her guest appearances).  I think the 3rd season of Atlantis was its best.  I knew from the start it would have a shorter shelf life than SG=1 because the premiss had already been pretty thoroughly explored in SG=1. A whole new universe allowed for some new bad guys, but the SG teams and the predicaments they can get into are finite before they are like plots different show.  I enjoyed their greater familiarity with the ancient technology but being Hyperspace or Warp drives, the technology is simply a backdrop to the episode storyline and seasonal/show ones.  I couldn't have stood waiting as long watching Stargate for them to develop defensive technologies and fight the enemies effectively.  I enjoyed the show and season 3 was at its peak as it was becoming a formula rotated through the seasons by season 4 and season 5 it is hard to get enthused when it begins by them canning a long time character who was well liked by fans and characters, replacing her with someone that I would have enjoyed having run Stargate for two shows and then get eaten by a Raithe no matter how much they tried to make it fun watching him have to change his ways to deal with the realities of being in the field.  The characters had become familiar such that losing main ones was difficult in this season making for some heavy shows, but also began the rotation that made it less upsetting when one was lost.  The only thing that sort of always left me in question was how on Atlantis they dealt with exploring an entire Galaxy with a few SG teams while back in the Milky Way they had a ton.  I realize there were more finite resources in the beginning, but by season 3 they had the huge city fairly up and running and enough trade partners to support a much larger military presence which all things considered I think back home on earth they would have been cranking out as many starships as possible because in the big picture they would need a fleet not a couple of ships.  i know they added on, but over years given the stakes I believe an international governing body would be funding mass production of those things so there was always one by earth, one by Atlantis and others for missions and with force.  It is part of what started to become a little to familiar, the desperate situation with impossible odds solved by a miraculous discovery at the last minute.  Great for a show, or a movie, but when it becomes cyclical it eventually translates to a show formula and the interest just begins to wane.  I did appreciate the writing around the problems they faced were of their own making many times (waking the wraithe early, messing with the replicator programming, genetic experiments on the wraithe to make them human) and the moral questions they raise in parallel with the real world application of genetics.  How much knowledge is to much before we are dabbling in areas we don't have enough seem to be evolved enough to have in our hands as they represent to much power, to much danger.  But for Star Gate fans I think Atlantis was a comfortable spin off that allowed a few more years of enjoyment of their &#34;world&#34; but unlike the Star Trek franchise that dealt with all universes the &#34;world&#34; created via the stargates became to self contained limiting the growth of the plots.  Bottom line is by this season you know what your getting and enjoying it, where in the seasons to come it started to get old and thus the show faded away.  Good, even great for periods, but limited from the start by being set in the present.  Great run while it lasted."
B000ICRKLM Phenomenal set of writers who seem to know how to keep the series action packed and with characters who the audience enjoy watching.  Strongly recommended for the SCI-FI junkies in the world."
B000ICRKLM I love anything Stargate!!!!!  One of the very few scifi series left on tv.....sad  :o("
B000ICRKLM Season 3 is as exciting and suspenseful as season 1 and 2 even though I've watched this series before. Truly great Sci-Fi!"
B000ICRKLM The story lines and acting are superb in Season Three of Stargate Atlantis.  The best thing about the series is the varying episodes emotions from humor (Tao of Rodney & Irresistible) to sadness (Sateda & Sunday).  I really feel the actors are comfortable with their characters and are willing to explore more.  As always, I love the extras.  The behind the scenes and the commentaries are always good.  This is definately worth the purchase."
B000ICRKLM I love this series. This is the third or fourth time through for me. The characters of John Shepherd, Tayla, Dr Weir, Ronan and Dr. Becket and Dr McKay are unforgettable. It is a wonderful space fantasy. Whenever I want to escape into another world I go to Stargate Atlantis. I imagine how cool it would be to travel to other worlds through a stargate/wormhole and meet other people who of course speak my language, English. The SG-1 series is good too and was the beginning of the Stargate series. In the beginning of Stargate Atlantis Jack O'Neil passes the torch to John Shepherd. Very cool indeed."
B000ICRKLM Clean and fun Sci-fi. Not as dark and mature as Stargate Universe. Most of this felt like a clear good vs evil. Excellent effects budget and decent acting for a TV Sci-Fi. This was probably the best season for this series."
B000ICRKLM They should've created feature films for release in theaters of these tales.I hope we'll see more of these actors in the future."
B000ICRKLM At first I was hesitant to start watching the series because I really liked SG-1 and didn't want to be disappointed. After watching the first season I was hooked."
B000ICRKLM It is so good that i have watched it for a second time.  Just imagine if this were true.  Great cast."
B000ICRKLM i have loved all the sg series. it can get a little slap stick every now and then, but its still one of the great series of the last few years"
B000ICRKLM Tell us why you chose this rating? Well, there is really only one answer I can give, only one word that sums up my feelings about this show: yes."
B000ICRKLM I just finished watching the third season DVD set, and while Stargate Atlantis is still my favorite Sci-Fi show, I was rather disapointed.Here's why.(Warning!  Spoilers below!)First, story arc failure. I was expecting a huge advancement in the story arc concerning the Wraith, but it just didn't happen.  Sure, they appear in a few good episodes, but it didn't seem like the story with respect to them in particular moved at all.Second, killing off Dr. Beckett.  I really liked him.  Maybe I'm dating myself a bit here, but he was kind of like Scotty and McCoy rolled together but with a cooler head.  This very lovable character will be missed.Third, rehashing the replicators.  With an entirely new galaxy as our backdrop for this series, why do the replicator thing all over again?  It was original enough on Stargate SG-1, but I was amazed that Atlantis started a story arc with replicators too.  Are they going creatively bankrupt already?Fourth, rehashing old sci-fi standbys, like the \"weird alien thingy or disease that causes loyal comrades to start killing each other\".  Did the original Star Trek do this in the episode \"The Naked Time\" and wasn't it done again by Star Trek Next Generation as the second or third episode in that series?Fifth, bringing back a whole ship full of \"ancients\" just to kill them all off by the end of the two part episode.  So, the \"ancients\" have gone from being a great and mysterious race of humanoids from the past to an expediant plot device.  We can create them and destroy them at will just to get and episode or two.  Couldn't an \"ancient\" or two have been spared and used as secondary characters?  Wouldn't that have been interesting?  They could have helped explore the rest of the city.  Their ship could have been recovered.  There's so much that could have been done with them that wasn't.Sixth, lack of character development.  Tayla could be a full-fledged warrior princess with a rich heritage and tons of wisdom, but she seems little more than a pretty (to say the least) face with a great body who never uses contractions (reminds me of Barbara Eden in I Dream of Jeanie) and tilts her head a lot.  And then there's Ronan the Monotone Macho man who does nothing for me but must appeal to a certain demographic so he's still there.Still, the season ended with a special effects spectacular and a tightly written script that showed just what the Atlantis team is capable of.  And, of course there's the wealth of special features and commentaries that you get as part of the standard package with Stargate franchise DVD sets, and that greatly adds to the value of the set.I haven't seen any of season four.  Here's hoping."
B000ICRKLM Had some trouble accessing some of the episodes, but very enjoyable.(Might be my old DVD player).Linda Sheean"
B000ICRKLM Love this show and all the stargate series shows its a shame they only got 5 seasons because there was alot more you could do with the premise."
B000ICRKLM I really like Stargate Atlantis.  I like seeing the characters from the first Stargate series working with the current ones."
B000ICRKLM I'm a big fan of this series. The constant fight with the wraith is exciting and makes for good character development. No worries no spoilers here but expect Ann exciting season with very high stakes."
B000ICRKLM While this series hasn't reached the level as its predecess
B000ICRKLM Show starting to find reasonable plots hard to find, but I enjoy the actors and their characters therefore I found the series enjoyable."
B000ICRKLM Warning!  There are multiple spoilers in the following review!I've watched STARGATE ATLANTIS from the beginning and have more or less enjoyed it from the start.  I definitely plan on continuing to watch it, but I have some concerns about the show that I'm convinced have to be addressed for it to continue to be worth watching.First and foremost, ATLANTIS has always had and continues to have serious cast problems.  They have now had three complete seasons to address these problems and while they have played with it some, most of their decisions have been odd at best.  I really like Joe Flannigan as Sheppard and David Hewlett as Rodney, but beyond that the cast is mainly made up of liabilities.  There was one other actor I liked a lot on the show, Paul McGillion as Beckett, but inexplicably in remaking the cast they chose to kill off one of the few strong characters on the show.  Rachel Luttrell as Teyla is more baffling.  Her character has never been very interesting, but I'm not convinced that Luttrell is untalented.  I suspect that for whatever reason the writers have simply not been willing or able to come up with any interesting arcs for her (apart from having an interesting connection to the wraiths, which by and large has been underutilized).  My hope is that they will rethink Teyla and either do both her and us a favor and kill her off, or become more aggressive in writing her character and give her some significant arcs and character development.  Jason Momoa as Ronon, however, is probably a lost cause.  He is perhaps the most wooden actor on television today and they have done virtually nothing of interest with his character.  David Nykl, however, is good as Zelenka.  I always enjoy his scenes with Rodney.  Finally, I really want to like Torri Higginson (not least because she bears a scary resemblance to an ex-girlfriend of mine).  I love shows that feature strong and interesting female characters, but after three years she remains yet another character with whom they've been unable to do very much.  In her case, however, it appears that the producers have decided to either write her out of the show entirely or reduce her merely to a recurring character.  I will continue to watch and sometimes enjoy STARGATE ATLANTIS, but they really need to do some serious rehabilitation.Some help is on the way.  We know that Amanda Tapping and her character Samantha Carter will be moving over from the cancelled STARGATE SG-1 to become the new head of the Atlantis project.  I think she will bring more strength to the role than Torri Higginson did.  Normally I would also applaud the casting of Jewel Staite as the new base doctor.  I loved her on FIREFLY as Kaylee, but I still regret Beckett's leaving the show.  But I honestly feel that the cast needs several more major changes.  The show has had to rely far too heavily on Sheppard and Rodney.The end of Season Three did, however, leave hope for new and better things.  Atlantis has emerged as the name not of a location that cannot be moved, but of a truly mobile city that can relocate . . . well, to anywhere.  The season ends with the city blasting off into space.  I'm anxious to see what happens next.  But whatever they do, I would like to see the show continue the risks it started taking in Season Three.  Killing Beckett was an abominable mistake (especially given that there were some other characters who could have been killed with far greater profit to the show), but it at least started giving the show something that both it and SG-1 have always lacked:  a body count.  The good adventure shows have body counts.  SG-1 had next to none.  The only truly heartbreaking death in ten seasons was when Dr. Frasier was killed.  It is no accident that that the episode in which that occurred was one of the finest in the series' run.  If you don't have a body count, you get no sense of danger.  On shows like BUFFY, LOST, and BATTLESTAR GALACTIC they have killed off some important characters.  As a result when a character is in danger you get a degree of danger that you never, ever get on ATLANTIS or SG-1.  Well, at least until they killed off Beckett and at least seriously injured Weir.  I dearly hope they continue doing this in the future.I also hope that we see Season Four taking the stories of the Wraith and the replicators to newer and more complex levels.  The series has had some great moments over the first three seasons, especially when they let situations get really desperate.  Hopefully they will continue to do this.While Season Three frequently left me wanting more due to the weaknesses in t
B000ICRKLM Stargate Atlantis is a fun and intertaining series. Full of action, good characters and imagination. My husband and I both really love the series."
B000ICRKLM This is a great sci-fi fiction show for the whole family.  We enjoy watching it.  Very glad the whole show is on prime to view."
B000ICRKLM This is by far the best season so far. I kept looking forward for nighttime to watch an episode.One thing I like about this season is that some episodes follow on the previous ones. In other words, many episodes are not standalone. Many viewers do prefer standalone episodes, and producers certainly do. For producers, having standalone episodes means a viewer can jump in and watch the series at anytime during the season. This has the benefit of increasing ratings. For some viewers, standalone episodes are also an advantage since they can watch and enjoy an episode without having seen any other episodes. I, on the other hand, prefer continuity, sort of like 24 Hours. For this reason, I thought this season of Stargate Atlantis to be the best.I do have a few comments about this season:1. Dr. Beckett dies in a very simple plot. I was really very disappointed. Beckett was one of my favorite characters, and I often wished he was given more of a principal role. The writers also did a lousy job in the episode in which he was killed. They could have killed him off in two or three one-hour episodes that followed up on each other, thus adding more suspense and thrill. On the other side of the coin, though, killing off a principal character also means that all characters on the show are susceptible to death--none are superhuman. We know James Bond never dies in his movies. However, next time a character is threatened with death in Stargate Atlantis, we will be glued to our seats, wondering whether he or she will die! `Death in the air' makes the episodes more suspenseful.2. The character of Teyla (Rachel Luttrell) has not been developed, and she does not have much to say that is interesting. She is also dressed up in a way to make her look sexy. Shouldn't she be wearing a uniform? Can you imagine a female soldier in Iraq wearing her outfit?3. Jason Momoa as Ronon is another underdeveloped character. Sometimes he is annoying. He also is sparsely dressed, being topless most of the time. Like Teyla, I would imagine he'd wear a uniform. Don't they ever get cold?4. Dr. Weir's (Torri Higginson) character is also weak. She should be given more principal roles. There are rumors that she might be replaced in upcoming seasons.5. There is too much Rodney in this season, and this gets to be annoying at times.6. In one episode, a ship full of ancients is found. They reclaim Atlantis, and basically kick out the Stargate team from the city, who all return back to Earth. However, in the second episode they are all killed. That was really bad storytelling. As one reviewer pointed out, couldn't an \"ancient\" or two have been spared and used as secondary characters in latter episodes? They could have helped explore the rest of the city and reveal its many secrets. We could have also known more about the ancients and their culture. Furthermore, their ship could have been recovered and used to fight the Wraiths. There's so much that could have been done with the surviving ancients that wasn't.7. The episode \"Common Ground,\" in which the Genii kidnap Sheppard and enclose him with a Wraith was fascinating. We discover that the Wraiths not only drain another creature of life, but can also give life as well. For the first time, a bond is formed between a Wraith and a human. Wraiths are shown to be human after all. Humans hunt and kill prey (animals) in order to survive. Wraiths kill humans because we are prey to them, and they need to feed on us to survive. Viewed in this context, aren't Wraiths and humans the same? It all boils down to survival of the fittest.The season ends with the city blasting off into space. Having lost all power, it just floats in space. I can't wait for season 4!"
B000ICRKLM This is the best of the three shows (SG-1, Atlantis, and Universe).  Too bad they dorked with the actors in the last 2 seasons."
B000ICRKLM Yet again another fantastic &#34;Gate&#34; series. Intelligently executed script, an almost perfect cast and just enough babes and bullets to keep you coming back."
B000ICRKLM the entire series from the first season through the final fifth season is a marvelous creation of imagination. I love the characters and a course the city with all it's amazing technology listening leo's be under comprehension in some cases shouldn't even be in a position. The monsters better created each week or dangers of the universe springs both in outer space in technology lovers races that they came in contact with. The rating the central 1. I enjoyed the up organic feel the race very similar to the movie series alien having that to organic look to the interiors of the ship and there insect always of preserving food and consuming the life force of human being"
B000IJRK7O Good series  Very happy that William Fitchner joined the crew. He's such a good actor and adds a lot to the show."
B000IJRK7O I never watched this show on TV. I had heard about it but I couldn't add one more to my queue. Then the show ended after season 5, my shows went on hiatus for the summer, and I wanted a show to watch. I have to say, I'm not only glad I picked this show, I'm glad I actually waited until now. I blew through the first season real fast and thought maybe I'd take a break, except that didn't happen because of the nice cliffhanger at the end so immediately in went season 2.Like I said in the title, this show is like a drug. I blew through season 2 faster than the first season. They're out, they're on the run, the Fox River Eight. T-Bag is the villain you love to hate. Scofield is still the modern day MacGuyver. Sucre gets far more interesting. Burrows really is able to reveal his bad-@$$ nature, and the plot continues to thicken with \"The Company\". I'll warn you, you're not going to want to stop here, you might want to just get the entire collection and take a vacation so you can watch it all."
B000IJRK7O This is an addictive show. Suspense that leaves you wanting to fast forward to next week so you can find out what is going to happen next."
B000IJRK7O More fun from the behind bars, okay they are on the run now, oops hope that doesn't spoil it for you!!"
B000IJRK7O This is a very good second season. Granted they are not in Prison anymore. They broke out and are on the run with other prisoners. Added new people to the mix and they fit in well. This show has a lot of good action, drama and story.Has a lot of intense scences as well as surprises. The bond between the brothers is done well. The man that steals the Show is Agent Kellerman. A very good series to own."
B000IJRK7O This was my first try at rent a series which has, to me unknown actors.  Bice relationships between a few of the characters"
B000IJRK7O From beginning to end of season 2 Michael Scofield (Wentworth Miller) and his brother Lincoln Burrows (Dominic Purcell) are on the run from the police and government agents that want them dead. The other convicts lives are on the line as well since all of them have been ordered to be killed. They also want Dr. Sara Tancredi (Sarah Wayne Callies) dead or anyone else who has tried to help Scofield and his brother. To show that these guys aren't messing around, season 1 regular Veronica (Robin Tunney) is killed violenty at the end of the first episode of this season.William Fichtner plays Agent Alexander Mahone who we think just wants to catch them but it later turns out that he has been ordered to kill them. Plus that's not all that makes this guy a threat....he's extremely smart and always seems to know what Scofield's next move is going to be. Which is another thing that makes this season so thrilling. You never really know what this guy is going to do next or who he's going to find next. I was hoping he'd find and kill T-Bag (Robert Knepper) but that sleaze ball makes it through the whole season. I don't wanna see this guy die because Knepper is bad at playing him or anything. I wanna see him die because Knepper is fantastic at making you hate this worthless piece of garbage. He's a rat that kills innocent people and slizzers his way away through most the season.Paul Adelstein as Agent Paul Kellerman is back after Scofield and Burrows. But he makes some important decisions as the season goes on and turns out to be just what they need if they want to clear Burrows' name. So there's a lot of character development going on in this season. There's a lot of running going on this season but since this show has great writing it's always engaging and you never really know what is going to happen next. So it's not just a whole lot of brainless chase scenes through the whole season. It's always exciting and has you at the edge of your seat. Plus there is still some scenes where they are captured and have to figure out how to escape. Hell this season has everything really. It's really a must see!"
B000IJRK7O The first season of \"Prison Break\" was amazing and it solidified it as one of the best new shows on network television. When it ended, with the escape of 8 of the convicts; I wondered how they would keep the show going. Well, they did it...The 2nd season is different from season 1 in scenery and in story. And, I'm going to get this out of the way right now, it's not quite as good as season 1. The first season was smart, suspenseful, and entertaining. Season 2 is suspenseful and entertaining...But not a single episode on here captured the heart-pounding 2nd to last episode of season 1. Still, viewing all these episodes a 2nd time (I watched them all while they were airing); It's still an amazing show. When the show begins; Michael Scofield (Wentworth Miller) and his brother Lincoln Burrows (Dominic Purcell) have successfully broken out of Fox River. Along with them are John Abruzzi (Peter Stormare), Fernando Sucre (Amaury Nolasco),David \"Tweener\" Apolskiss (Lane Garrison, who's had a recent run-in with the law himself), Theodore \"T-Bag\" Bagwell (Robert Knepper), Benjamin \"C-Note\" Miles Franklin, and Haywire. With the entire world knowing their faces, they \"Fox River 8\" begin running...With new character, F.B.I. man Alexander Mahone (William Fichtner) guessing their every move. This season develops the relationship between Michael and Sara, the doctor who aided the cons in their escape, and also makes you feel more for the characters. One amazing aspect of this show is that you actually like the characters and want them to succeed despite their wrongdoings. The best example I have of this is the character T-Bag, a convicted rapist & pedophile who is easily the most dangerous of the bunch. Many viewers of this show have a strong connection to T-Bag and love the character. This is not a result of good writing, but a result of good acting. Robert Knepper plays this character so well, you root for T-Bag to succeed. You don't want to see him killed off or shipped back to prison. The fact that the Emmy awards haven't even acknowledged Knepper is a complete travesty. If this was a movie, Knepper would be nominated for an Oscar. But all the actors are good and with season 2, they've only got better at playing the roles. They're gotten under their character's skin and have really became them. The chemistry between Miller and Purcell is terrific. You believe that they are actually brothers. Fichtner as Mahone is terrific as well. He has that icy stare and intenseness that John Malkovich has and does an amazing job as the sympathetic F.B.I. agent that you love to hate. Like I said, the show isn't as smart as season 1...There's many episodes where they seemed to make up things as they went along (Michael's tattoo has become a ploy and a plot device. The writer's can make new tattoos appear whenever they wish) and the way they handled the Haywire character could have been better. There were times when they disregarded him for several episodes, when really he should have been caught by episode 3. There's no way that Haywire could've remained out longer than Abruzzi. But the suspense factor is way up there. Every episode has me on the edge of my seat, wondering what was going to happen next (Even though, I already knew which makes it even more impressive). If you haven't jumped on the \"Prison Break\" bandwagon yet, you should...I missed the season 3 premiere last night and I truly want to cry, because I can't wait to see what happens next. When you have a TV show that can you get that pumped up, you know you've found something special...And \"Prison Break\" is damned special all right. Fine acting, terrific writing, and nail-biting suspense. I said this is my review for season 1 a long time ago, but I'm going to state it again. If this was a movie, you can bet that Oscars would be involved.GRADE: A"
B000IJRK7O As the second season of Prison Break opens, things get moving along rather quickly.  Michael (Wentworth Miller), Linc (Dominic Purcell), Sucre (Amaury Nolasco), C-Note (Rockmond Dunbar), and John (Peter Stormare) have escaped from prison and are on the run.  After going their seperate ways, shady FBI Agent Mahone (William Fichtner) arrives on the scene with one main intention: stop Michael and Linc from escaping the country.  In the meantime, T-Bag (Robert Knepper) goes to some great lengths to get what he wants, and Captain Bellick (Wade Williams) is still hot on the brothers' trail.  The conspiracy that was apparent in season one is even more farther reaching here, as revelations are made that will cost everyone involved dearly, and by the end of the season, not everyone that has been here since the beginning will still be standing.  What makes Prison Break so good is that the show never relents from it's break neck pacing.  This could easily be a bad thing, but the minds behind Prison Break manage to keep the constant flow stable enough so you never know what to expect next.  Even with the major change of scenery for the main characters, the show stays more compelling than ever as it becomes a high octane game of cat and mouse.  Undoubtedly one of (if not the) best shows on prime time network television today (and on Fox), Prison Break just keeps getting better, and by the end of the season finale, you'll be salivating for more."
B000IJRK7O It was interesting how the roles became reversed.  Michael is now the prisoner in one of the worst prisons possible and the brother is now the free man.  Talk about twist of fate.  I was excited to see T-bag back in the second season.  He's a mean, rotten man, but somehow he just grows on you.  You kind of believe there's some good in there, some where."
B000IJRK7O Love this show. Plenty of twists and turns.really good, great cast and acting. Lots of great guest stars to keep it fun and interesting."
B000IJRK7O I vaguely remember it the first time. There was a lot of hoopla and you weren't normal if you couldn't converse about each weeks episode. This time I was ill and decided to have a marathon. It all melted together. The actors,the script,music editors producers. it made me scream at the tv like an idiot and laugh like\" haywire\" and cry as though my brother was going to the chair!!!!! Wentworth is amazingly beautiful! eye candy. &lt;sorry> had to put that in! One of the funniest quotes I have ever heard came from Balak's mouth\" omg you are slower than a bunch of stutterers at a spelling bee\" just the visual made me crack up! the only unfortunate part is season two! I hope it gets better the episodes aren't as nail biting and a little predictable and I did see the second season before!! give my review later for 2.."
B000IJRK7O Breaking out of prison is one thing.  Dealing with the inevitable and complicated fallout and consequences afterwards is another.In the second season of this series, the characters discover just how hard it is to regain a normal life, a life not spent on the run.  C-Note has a wife and sickly daughter who suffer to a degree because of him and he nearly kills himself.  T-Bag's twisted logic tells him that his former lover will take him back into her home, but he doesn't face reality.  Bellick thinks he can find the money but ends up imprisoned in a foreign country and has left Sucre's beloved woman locked up somewhere.Haywire ends up dead, as does Tweener, while Mahone and others involved in the conspiracy and the hunt create their own hell.Scofield and Burrows try to hide out in Panama with Sarah, but all goes asunder and Scofield is now in the hellish prison of that country.In such a bleak world, it's amazing that any of these people keep trying to carve out a life for themselves."
B000IJRK7O Just finished watching it - bought the UK version last week.Good but not as good as season one.Some lame weak writing there.More like a fugitive show than the very unique original first season.Great acting again from Michael, Linc and the crewPlus some good actionso I recommend buying it"
B000IK882Y I have kept up with Bones through the current season and I have to say that I think season 2 is my favorite season! The chemistry, the stories are especially excellent and enjoyable to watch!"
B000IK882Y My overriding impression of \"Bones Season 2\" is that perhaps Booth and Brennan were getting too close in season one, and forces needed to be put in place to put some distance between the two. The first was by replacing Jonathan Adams (Dr. Daniel Goodman) with Tamara Taylor (Dr. Camille Saroyan) as Brennan's boss, who, by the way, had a romantic relation with Booth when they were in New York. The second was to introduce a romantic interest for Brennan, in the form of FBI agent Tim Sullivan (Sully), who replaces Booth while he is sidelined for a psychiatric evaluation by the premier guest character on \"Bones\", Gordon, Gordon Wyatt, played by Stephen Fry.Wyatt and Booth have some of the most delicious scenes outside of the episodes where Booth and Brennan get close.In retrospect, it is just a bit hard to take the interchange between Brennan and Saroyan in the first few episodes. Booth is surprised at her arrival, and resists Saroyan's direction. I suppose the reason it's odd is because we all suspect from the outset that in the lab, and with Booth, Brennan will always be the alpha dog. After all, the show is named after her.Overall, I would say season 2 is as good as season 1, and better than season 3 (It is rated better than both seasons 1 and 3.) Season 1 had the \"getting to work together jitters\" and season 2 had the \"separation moves\". The main season 3 arc was simply not as good."
B000IK882Y The Bones tv series is a great show.  David Boreanaz and Emily Deschanel work so good together and even though it is a crime drama, there are also plenty of light moments that will make you laugh.  I love it and hope this series goes on for many more seasons."
B000IK882Y I admit that I found myself caught up in the TV whirlwind that is Bones.  But with good reason a show that focuses on solving crimes via skeletal remains mixed with humor, sorta romance and danger.  It all equals a wildly addictive TV show that has you coming back for more with each episode watched.It stars David Borenaz and Emily Deschanel as partners working together.  Along Dr. Brennan and her crew of coworkers who are just as important to the show as the two stars in it.  All kinds of things take place in the 2nd season with more storylines resolved and new ones opened up.  They are just as addictive and compelling as the first season and they even have an addition to the team as a whole in a new director (Tamara Taylor) for the Jeffersonian.I love the way the season progresses with the different members of the team reaching new personal goals and other things (marriage (sorta), promotion).  It's exciting to see a show this good actually stick around for more than a minute.  I can only hope that Season 3 picks up right where this season ended on a very high note and full of possibilities this time around.  That i'm sure will have even more people flocking to check out this all around well written, directed and acted show in Bones."
B000IK882Y Bones is a great TV show. Not like about 90% of the Trash on TV.. It is fun to watch, and keeps you going.. If you want a good TV show. THis is one to get!!!!!"
B000IK882Y I hadn't watched Bones until I picked up the first season on DVD when I was looking for something different to watch. Now it's one of my favorite shows--much more fun than CSI, a little gross at times, but over all one of the best shows on the tube right now."
B000IK882Y I think Bones is a very good show. I love all the characters and the chemistry between all of them is fun to watch."
B000IK882Y Better than the first.  Know a bit more about the history of the characters and their motivations.  Dr. Seroyan is excellent addition.  You get a hint of grossness of the murder victims but not over much. The writing is still excellent and holds your attention. Looking forward to the new season and more cases."
B000IK882Y I loved this season of Bones even more than season one, as more of the cast are developing to fuller characters, with new subplots to keep things tied together, and more really cool forensics.Dr Brennan (Emily Deschanel) continues to struggle with her desire to feel normal emotional connection, while her intellect keeps her from exactly getting there, and while the chemical tension with her partner simmers under the surface. Thrown into the mix are new moral dilemmas due to her developing knowledge of her birth family, and shades of gray start to infiltrate her world of black and white. Can one be a moral (justified) killer? Etc. Forgiveness and love are examined in rather unique waysBones is very good TV, that I can enjoy with both my wife and my teens.So if you have already watched season one, get season two (but really, watch one first for the character development that is quite good) and have a marathon fun weekend!"
B000IK882Y O Happy Day! As presented in widescreen, here's Season 2 of Bones. The great news is that there's no slack off at all from season one's most excellent run. Involving forensic conundrums and grim visions of death once again winningly meld with great drama, humor, pathos, and tenuous romance. Emily Deschanel as forensic anthropologst Dr. Temperance \"Bones\" Brennan and David Boreanaz as FBI Special Agent Seeley Booth (David Boreanaz) continue to dazzle as television's most electric investigative duo.Whereas Booth is the intuitive people person, Brennan is still mostly socially in the dark. She remains dispassionate and driven in her pursuit of her personal Holy Grail, the truth. As always, her ability for drawing accurate observations from ruined human remains proves invaluable in solving FBI cases. As ever, the perceptive Booth and her free spirited best friend Angela are her main conduits to understanding the, to her, bewildering labyrinth of emotions and social decorum. Deschanel is great at allowing the audience to glimpse the wounds just beneath Bones' supremely confident exterior. She and Boreanaz are magical, and their chemical synergy remains the overwhelming draw of this series.There's a barrage of big technical jargon used on each episode, but that doesn't keep me from being sofa-ed in rapt attention. This show is so clever that my attitude more or less echoes Booth's: \"Keep talking. I'll catch up.\" The mysteries are compelling enough, but when thrown in with the engrossing human elements, it makes me want to tune in to the show that much more. The squints, while intimidatingly brainy and toiling away on a wavelength drastically foreign from that of average folks, are nevertheless engaging and very sympathetic characters. The supporting cast is remarkably good and quirky, bolstered by this season's newcomer Tamara Taylor and by occasional guest stints by Ryan O'Neal, Stephen Fry, and the wonderful Patricia Belcher (as no-nonsense attorney Caroline Julian). It must be noted that T.J. Thyne (Hodgins) and Michaela Conlin (Angela) share an endearing chemistry.Season 2 introduces a couple of curve balls, beginning with the arrival of Dr. Camille Saroyan (Taylor) as Brennan's new boss at the Jeffersonian Institute, with whom Bones instantly clashes. Then mix in some office romances (except the one we're hankering for). Offer up a serial killer or two. And, thru all the cases she works on, Bones still fixates on her mother's unsolved murder and her father's disappearance. On this, some light will be shed.My favorite episodes are \"The Truth in the Lye\" (Tub of goo!! So cool tub of goo!! To quote Bones: \"Even for me, this is disgusting.\"), \"The Woman in the Sand\" (Booth goes ultimate fighting and, Omigawd, Bones in a sexy black cocktail dress!), \"Aliens in a Spaceship\" (Hodgins and Brennan are entombed in a car and must come up with makeshift ways to surviva as air runs out; raw-emotioned acting by Thyne and Deschanel), the nerve-wracking \"The Blonde in the Game\" and its equally harrowing follow-up \"The Man in the Cell\" features the return of clever serial killer Howard Epps from last season's \"A Man on Death Row\") and the season-ender \"Stargazer in the Puddle\" (Bones learns more about her mother).Special Features include optional episode commentaries on \"The Glowing Bones in the Old Stone House\" (with Emily Deschanel) and on \"Stargazer in a Puddle.\" Boreanaz doesn't commentate this time; perhaps, his effort last season was deemed too loopy. Disc 6 offers \"The Memories in the Season\" featurette; \"Visceral Effects: The Digital Illusions of Bones\" featurette; 8 minutes of deleted scenes with optional commentary by the Executive Producers; and the gag reel.By the way, the episode commentary on \"The Glowing Bones in the Old Stone House\" reveals that an unaired 22nd episode will debut in the third season. Does that mean there'll be 23 episodes in season 3? One hopes (but doubts)."
B000IK882Y This second season is exploring new ways and avenues where bones are of course multiplying at leisure and for our best pleasure. Yet this second season is quite new in several aspects.First and foremost the season is widely open to personal matters and it explores the private, and at times not so private, relations between the members of the team, after the boss has been changed to a woman, which rebalances the sexual ratios. Bones herself is courting and going out with an FBI agent who has temporarily replaced Booth while he was sort of suspended and deprived of a gun after shooting a clown on top of an ice-cream vendor's van. But in the end she will not go through the process completely as far as leaving the Jeffersonian for a life of full leisure and farniente.Zack manages to get his doctorate and to be hired in the job he was holding as an intern because he goes to Angela and begs for help on his  look and manages to become presentable, which means he can now stand in court and testify seriously in a deportment that can carry the agreement of the jury. So far he is no longer obsessed by sexuality but he encounters a great difficulty: he is summoned by the White House to go to Iraq. But this time this reference does not lead to any political dissertation or even cogitation on the subject. Political questions are systematically and carefully avoided in this second season.Jack and Angela are finally realizing they love each other and even decide to get married and they finally find themselves in front of a priest (in fact a black priestess) in some church for the last step when the State Department steps in and reveals Angela is already married in some kind of broom stick over-jumping ceremony. More later, I guess.Booth is entangled in the hands of a British shrink after his shooting the clown on the ice-cream vendor's van and he is a perfect sucker, building a full barbecue for the shrink under the shrink's blackmailing procedure of retaining the document he must sign. This same shrink will also step into Bones' psyche as some kind of private counselor. Agent Booth and Doctor Brennan will not be able to establish some kind of personal relationship, especially since Temperance's father reappears in her life and even saves the situation a couple of times. But he has to be arrested by Booth and be brought to court for his ancient crimes, including the attack against the deputy chief of the FBI, though this one was crooked to the utmost, his lips kissing the heels of his shoes or something like that.Booth reestablishes for a short while a relationship with the new boss of the institute, Dr Camille Saroyan, with whom he had had a liaison some time ago in another life. But that cannot last more than one or two episodes. This is characteristic of all these people: they are unable psychologically or administratively to build balanced and normal relationships. Is it a side effect of their jobs or professions, we can wonder, or simply  personal immaturity?That level of the season blurs out the various crimes and cases they examine and solve. And these cases do not deal with political issues or even with immigration, except one case about some strange Chinese practice of burying the bones of a man with the bones of a woman so that the man has some company on the other side of the road. Most cases are plain simple crimes in America and among Americans. But they often deals with social problems like the mother of a severely handicapped girl: what can the mother do to help her child the genetic victim of a deadly disease that keeps her retarded, even if it is only for a short time before she dies? Some of these questions are crucial: do we have the right to experiment on human beings new treatments that would enable astronauts to reinforce their bones that get highly decalcified due to prolonged sojourn in space?Some of the cases are plain vicious crimes and it is fun to catch the killers who are most of the time not at all the one or the ones we were expecting. Suspense is always with us even if the personal and more sentimental level of this season makes that suspense not as intense as I would personally prefer it to be.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, University Paris 8 Saint Denis, University Paris 12 Cr&eacute;teil, CEGID"
B000IK882Y These are the kind of replays that are always entertaining for the whole family. Enjoyable and good to relax in front of."
B000IK882Y Generally I'm not a fan of procedurals (shows without a continuing story, where each episode stands on it's own and isabout 'procedure'; legal, medical, etc), but this is as close to an exception as I'll get.Give credit to excellent writing, directing and acting, and having supporting characters that are rich and really addsomething to the show. When it's at it's best this can be downright terrific, bringing me to tears more than once, andmaking me laugh out loud a few times too. It can be very, very smart.While the 2nd season represented growth, mostly by focusing even more on our running characters and their ongoing stories,it can still be hit or miss. Every 3rd episode or so is really special.  That's a higher batting average than the first season.The other episodes are still good, almost always watchable, (one or two really don't work), but often you can see the twistscoming a mile off, or the jokes get a little stale.The show is at it's best when the episodes are really about the often funny, sometimes heartbreaking inner lives ofour running characters, and not simply about brilliantly (and inevitably) catching the bad guy/gal. Or when it's dealingwith the more human side of forensics - the grief and pain of those left behind. That's when this well made show moves waybeyond 'clever crime of the week' status."
B000IK882Y I tried the book series but couldn't get into it-both before the tv Bones began and after watching it-they are so different. The series is a wonderful mix of science, friendship,  sexual tension between the two leads and \"who did it\"- the murder that is, that I am getting each season til I have them all. Watch the show on FOX and get hooked as I did."
B000IK882Y Again I really Love this show and the people are great the story keeps you wanting for more each week..."
B000IK882Y Whiel the first season of Bones was slightly imperfect, partly due to the real geekiness of its actors, it was a pleasure to watch. Fortunately with Season two the craetors have managed to make this an even better series. Boreanaz' stigma of having played Angel in the Buffy franchise is now completely gone and we can identify him with agent Booth completely. Bones social ineptitude is also put more on clear display this time. These are the two main things that mange to make the chemistry between them even stronger than last season."
B000IK882Y The show is fast paced and a bit thin on story but it is still fun and better than many network shows.  Bones is based on the forensic science unit of the Smithsonian Institution.  The show always has a murder that the show has to solve forensically and the relationship between the workers who seem to work 24/7 adds some spice.  The stories of the Grave Digger and Brennan's father are my favorite."
B000IK882Y Fortunately, the second season of BONES mantains the high standards achieved int he first season.The chemistry between Bones and Booth only improves. Also, the additon of a new female head chief (Cam)for the Jeffersonian team was a clever idea and worked nicely. This, adding to intriguing plots, superb support roles by Ryan O'Neil and Stephen Fry, scaring villains like Eppes and the guy that buried BOnes (the first case to not be solved - probably until further episodes!)and the \"love angle\" with Hodgins and Angela conspired to make this great television."
B000IK882Y Bones are the best series if you like crime and love story then these are the best series for you"
B000IK882Y Season 2 explores the relationship and the background of the show's characters. Their relationships are tested by trials, tribulations, killers trying to get them and trying to save each other. This is a really good show. It is well written, interesting and captivating. David Boreanaz and Emily Deschanel have great on-screen chemistry. Dechanel portrays \"Bones\" very well. She is quirky in all the right ways."
B000IK882Y I loved Kathy Reichs' books centering on the Temperence Brennen character and read them all.  The show is somewhat different from the books but still very pleasing.  Reichs continues act as an executive producer/consultant and it shows in the forensic goodies.  Emily Deschanell is perfectly cast for her role as the tile character, and David Boreanz as well as her FBI cohort.  Plenty of humor to offset the gruesome details of the murders they investigate.  If you like crime procedurals, you won't be disappointed in this show.  There is also some nice romantic interplay among the various cast members as well.  A very attractive cast.  The shows are consistently enjoyable."
B000IK882Y Building on the momentum of its first season, this Fox series continues successfully combining the morbidity of forensic investigation with the intrigue of budding office romances.Spicing things up, an old girlfriend of Booth's, Dr. Camile 'Cam' Saroyan (Tamara Taylor) becomes Dr. Brennan's boss (\"The Titan on the Tracks\"). Initially uncertain they can work together, they soon hammer out a workplace agreement, creating a truce.Ironically, this hard-nosed boss's life later becomes endangered after she inhales a toxin in \"The Man in the Cell\". It creates a little drama in the workplace--and for viewing audiences--while she is recovering.Booth also has a personal problem of his own to deal with during this season His ex-girlfriend is letting her new boyfriend spend time with their son--whom he is very protective of (\"Mother and Child in the Bay\"). Boreanaz does some of his most convincing acting as the 'concerned parent of a young child'. I am shocked that the writers of this series haven't promoted it through more balance of Booth's parenting.\"The Girl With the Curl\" obviously drew it's inspiration from the still-unsolved Jon Benet Ramsey case. Brennan and Booth have to figure out who killed a child beauty queen before tragedy strikes again, and are visibly concerned. They've seen all kinds of stuff on this job, but learning what children undergo to be considered 'pretty' really pushes their limits. They are further surprised to discover the actual identity of the killer."
B000IK882Y I really enjoyed this TV series, and I found it superior to season one.In season two, the relationship between Dr. Brennan and Booth is well developed, albeit unpredictable, especially with the newly introduced and sexy new boss. There are a lot of tensions, thrills, passions, conspiracies, and sex in this season. Some episodes were extremely well though-off and intriguing. I did like the most the episode on the astronaut. Are there aliens from outer space, and did one just fall down to Earth? Watch the episode to find out.This series will teach you a lot of medical terms as well as how crimes are committed (and how not to commit crimes)."
B000IK882Y ...Season 2 is where Bones hits its stride.  S1 was a fanatastic season, and what hooked most of us who have continued to watch this series, which is, by the way, currently one of the most well-written, character-driven, comprehensive shows on network television.And it is the well written episodes (that frequently tie-in to the past season and also allude to the future) and the absolutely outstanding and superior characters that make this show pretty damn flawless.  From \"Bones\" herself, to the self-depricating and sometimes hilarious Agent Booth (if nothing else this show showed how much range \"Angel\" DIDNT give David Borneaz, which is not something I thought I'd ever write) to the supportive cast (like Jack and Zach, you find out more and more about them practically each episode) to the sometimes-present tertiary cast members (for my money, there is NOT a more appealing character on the show than federal prosecuting attorney Caroline Julian, who says things so nuanced and powerfully, you just want to hear her read the phone book) this show will make you a unshakeable believer by this second season.Its not perfect.  Some of the dialogue is a little too Lifetime for me, on occasion, but this is the exception, not the rule, and being so well rounded is probably why both my wife and myself can fully agree on this show as one of our favorites.If you aren't watching Bones, you are missing out on possibly the best prime-time show on TV."
B000IK882Y This show got even better in its second season, with the arrival of the tough new Cam as the boss of the squints, the wonderful Stephen Fry appearing as Booth's psychiatrist, Angela and Hodgins falling in love, and wonderboy Zach being promoted and getting a new haircut in the process.  The characters and the show are really coming into their own now.  I look forward to season 3."
B000IK882Y The interaction between Bones and Booth got even better this season.  The change in other characters helped develop the series."
B000IKP5AM Most British comedy always gives me a laugh or twenty, but one in which pretentiousness is skewered is especially enjoyable."
B000IKP5AM I continue to find a visit with keeping up appearances a delight.  Every one of these people are true professionals.  None of us would want a neightbor with hyacinth, but we love to watch others deal with her."
B000IKP5AM Love this series and watch it over and over.  I am sure many people who watch it know a person like Hyacinth, which makes it even more humorous.  I am so happy I can watch it any time I want a good laugh with my Premium membership."
B000IKP5AM This is one of my favorite comfort series and is great for a good cheer up.  Hyacinth's life revolves around appearing &#34;better&#34; than her station would really allow and is hilarious.  Having someone of high quality nod at her in her mind makes her best friends that she can brag about.  Patricia Routledge is excellent in her role as are the actors her play her husband, friends and family.  If you haven't seen this show, you need to.  You won't be disappointed!"
B000IKP5AM When life is busy or frustrating, I turn on Hyacinth and relieve stress.  Good laughs are helpful and she provides so many.  Feel sorry for Elizabeth, but she's an angel and we think Richard is wonderfully written and acted, poor guy.  Very entertaining."
B000IKP5AM I enjoy British comedies. The language makes me think and stay focused.This comedy has always gotten laughs from me."
B000IKP5AM I found this show by accident and fine it hilarious. I love Hyacith, Richard and the rest of the family.  A well written and acted show .  I miss some of the dialog due to the accent but the more I watch the better I understand.  A very funny sitcom."
B000IKP5AM If you enjoyed Season 1 of Hyacinth and her attempts to impress all her friends and acquaintances, then you will also enjoy Season 2.  Brother- in-law Onslow and sisters Daisy and Rose keep popping up just in time to overturn Hyacinth and Richard's dinner party plans or a visit to a nobleman' s estate. Neighbors, the milkman, and and the postman also try their best to avoid Hyacinth, but can't quite seem to sneak by her house without running into her and getting a lecture on having cleaner shoes, better milk bottles, finding lost mail, etc. Of course, having her 90 year old \"Daddy\" thinking he needs to protect the area from imaginary bomb attacks doesn't help Hyacinth in her quest to be the best hostess either. Enjoy another fun filled season!"
B000IKP5AM English humor can be a little hard to understand sometimes, but funny enough to keep me laughing & watching repeatedly until I began to get it"
B000IKP5AM Clean, funny and plain right down silly.  Great acting and fun to watch.  I would recommend this to a friend."
B000IKQX44 It could happen! But for me the story was tragic and bleak (that's the point, I know!). The visual effects were good, the acting was good, and the story was okay. It was a vary long opening to an attempted invasion of earth. And I felt it's main female character was short changed."
B000IKQX44 Dragged out in the beginning. Was interesting to a point. The others I have said are a bit better. Event, Defiance, and Falling skies where better. Hope that helps. Looking forward to seeing more of those and grim. This has the cast, just needs better to the story line."
B000IKQX44 Example: scientist walks into the bar where there is only 1 patron & the bartender.  That patron, the pilot who shot down the UFO asks the scientist to his table & in his second sentence, he's hitting on her.  Unexplainable given he had just been on the phone with his girl friend begging her not to break up with him.Example: scientist shows credential at the gate to a secure military base holding the UFO.  Guard doesn't have it verified. Really?  Then, scientist doesn't or can't go into the hanger & examine the UFO with the other scientists.  Why doesn't she verify what's she's seeing?Then when she & the pilot go to the hospital, they are admitted without it being verified they can have access.  Hunh?"
B000IKQX44 While I liked this mini-series enough to but all 5 parts- I was disappointed in the non-ending . Maybe there was supposed to be more story later? Major characters are tossed away. I wouldn't see it again."
B000IKQX44 Typical short series kinda sci-fi. Worth the watch if your looking for something easy to watch and have time to kill."
B000IKQX44 I remember seeing part of this miniseries.  It is a good one and worth watching.  Interesting plot and concept.  Plus the acting is really good."
B000IKQX44 Overall the mini-series was well handled and held my interest right up to the end. The end, however, was more of a stopping point than a wrap-up as it left most of the important questions unanswered.This one may be good to-rent for those who are die-hard science fiction fans but will have a limited audience in others. I enjoyed watching it once but will probably not watch it again."
B000IKQX44 The story was interesting but effects and budget where low by BBC standards.  It was nice that it's all wrapped up in just 6 episodes."
B000IKQX44 British actors do a great job with this unusual alien invasion story.  What is it like?  Well, don't expect state-of-the-art special effects; don't expect elaborate costumes, spaceships, or aliens.  Rather, you will find a delightful British cast who makes the story line work, because you like the characters.The storyline?  It starts with WW-II when a strange craft and \"being\" crash... but very soon we are transported to out current time period and must figure out what happened with the WW-II discovery.  I won't share much more of the detail of the story except to say that aliens have come to invade...both good and bad aliens.Note well: it is a short series, but I was involved in it after the second episode.  The storyline builds from episode to episode, as does the excitement.  For anyone who likes Sci-Fi and also for those who like good acting, this series is worth the watch. It isn't spectacular like \"Falling Skies\" on TNT, but it will pleasantly surprise.  I give it 4 stars."
B000IKQX44 Fans of Phyllis Logan, who plays Mrs. Hughes on Downton Abbey, will enjoy seeing her in this show. She plays the often tough, but ultimately heroic Squadron Leader Helen Knox. The story has a few puzzling twists, and there's way too much military trigger-happiness. The sets have that \"BBC Drama\" familiarity, yet they somehow seem out-of-place for this story. Nonetheless, if you like Phyllis Logan and/or Downton Abbey, then this show is definitely worth watching!"
B000IKQX44 This is one of the more campy and fun SciFi shows to come from the BBC. It has some of the same arch sense of humor that makes the Dr. Who series so beguiling, but with a slightly darker and more dangerous edge."
B000IKQX44 Science fiction is one of my favorite themes. It can be smaltzy or realistic, it doesn't matter as long as the plots are moving forward realistically and the acting is decent. More often than not,  most Sci Fi hasn't developed varied plots, but for now, until the industry has more imaginative writers, it is ok. I prefer real science fiction, not blurred into fantasy of mythical beasts and vampires, which end up moving the imagination back into reality and snuffing out the momentum of plot advancement.My only suggestions are: keep it real with emotional responses, don't overdo it with fake shooting scenes, devise unique ways to solve problems (McGiverish), and grow the the characters relationships.  There is nothing wrong with a good &#34;McGuffin&#34;.If a series can develop over time, I'll be a faithful watcher. If not, once episode or less is enough."
B000IKQX44 Invasion Earth is a very slow moving Sci-Fi that you really have to try hard to get through the first few episodes. I would not recommend this series."
B000IKQX44 The show is done in the 1990's, but it looks older than that.  I didn't relate to the characters and I don't like to gross alien testing.  I like my invasion stories to have characters I care about and watch them grow."
B000IKQX44 Well, I think this series would be great for mystery science theater review.  I like the campy quality of the series  but die hard scifi fans probably won't like it.  I would like to give a nod to a Downton Abbey star who plays a significant role in this series.  Can you pick out the actor?"
B000IKQX44 I have given this 4 stars for only one reason; it has an excellent ending in the tradition of the best classic science fiction tradition. That's what really saved the series for me. It's not a huge time investment, and it's worth watching despite the terrible acting (even the good actors are appallingly bad) and the bizarre plot (it's as if the writers wanted to cram several completely different plots into one short mini-series, leading to a real mess). If you love classic science fiction I think this is worth a try, but if you stop before the end you'll probably be left disappointed, as in all other regards this is a 2-star show."
B000IKQX44 I wish it had continued and gave more back story on the bad aliens and the good aliens that sent the Lieutenant from WW2 to warn them. It did prove Einsteins theory of relativity was correct. The show would have made a great television series. I won't give any more spoilers. Happy watching"
B000IKQX44 I like scifi.  Looked for series 2 but wasn't available.  I'd like to know what happened to her and her colleague!"
B000IKQX44 Am enjoying it but wish that more of the scenes were better lighted.  Hard to see sometimes.  A range of accents makes adds to the interest."
B000IKQX44 Brit show with several downtown abbey regulars in cast.  Ok for middle of night insomnia.  Fred ward should have been a bigger star."
B000IKQX44 A lot &#34;off the wall&#34;.First thing I noticed was the Alert response time (at the beginning) of nearly 10 minutes is TOTALLY wrong. (Seriously folks, it's under 60 seconds!!)  and to place the ONE GUY responsible (for the whole debacle) in a position of leadership!?! NOT HAPPENING!!! And there's not a way -- good or bad -- to 'spin' it.The story was very good, but what this series lacked was a director."
B000IKQX44 Starts out as what you may think is a typical alien film. But, as you get into it you may find yourself enjoying the unexpected turns. I would have given 5 stars if the effects were just a bit more realistic."
B000IKQX44 I watched this because the Brits usually do a good job with good production values, casting and story lines.  However, in this case it proved a waste of 5 hours. The writers, directors and editors should be ashamed to put their names in the credits.  Important things happen with no apparent reason and the watcher is left scratching his/her head wondering what was the point.  The American general is miscast and not believable.  Lots of clicking of computer keyboards for solutions that never seem to work out. The ending stinks!"
B000IO3OBK unfortunatley, I seem to be watching the seasons out of order (i can get several seasons on amazon, other ones from different places) - but the season is great - good twists & change-ups - now just get amazon to make all the seasons available..."
B000IO3OBK Wow the season with Ozzie.  Watching him swim and do so many of the challenges was fun.  Definitely one of the good seasons!"
B000IO3OBK If you love survivor then you will want to checkout this season. This is one of the better seasons.Love it."
B000IO3OBK No spoilers.I LOVED this season. The division in the tribes was incredibly entertaining and I loved seeing the drama that played out because of it. There's several big name players that come from this season and for good reason - they're amazing Survivors and a lot of fun to watch.If you're looking to spend money on a season of Survivor, it doesn't get much better than this. I highly recommend."
B000IO3OBK I'm loving the ability to go back and watch the seasons of Survivor I missed! I was especially looking foward to this season because one of the castaways is from the same small town as I am. Please Amazon, get more older seasons soon!"
B000IO3OBK This is another great show with scenery that is not to be missed.  The challenges and rewards allowed the contestants to enjoy the native island culture."
B000IO3OBK Wonderful. Need all seasons available to buy."
B000IO3OBK Yul is a great Survivor and is the mastermind of the entire season and deserves to win. Jeff Probst declares he was disappointed that Ozzy didn't win because of how well he dominated all the challenges. Ozzy is one of the best players to ever play the game and his game is pure according to Yul. He doesn't screw anyone in his alliance over and physically is a step above anyone else in the game. Yul is much smarter than Ozzy and gets more respect from the other players. Jonathan Penner is pretty funny and owns Probst in some of the back and forth at challenges. In the start of the game the tribes are divided by ethnicities into 4 tribes, which has never happened in Survivor. After the Asians dominate the first 2 challenges the tribes are mixed up. The hidden immunity idol plays a big role in this season. It's pretty cheap that you get to play it after the votes are read, so the person with the idol never gets any votes. This is a great season of Survivor, you should buy it."
B000IO3OBK playback is horrible.is pauses all the time and makes watching it a pain in the A&#34;&#34;&#34;&#34;&#34;.if this was a dvd I would return it for a new one, but it is instant video purchase."
B000IO3OBK if for no other reason, select this season and admire oscar in all his glory! this man's smile will break hearts around the world..."
B000IVUL64 Horatio and his crew just keep on doing what they do best, convict the folks that think its easy to get away with killing folks.  They do it with style, class, determination and sometimes a sense of humor as well.  Really loved the season 5 opening episode in Brazil that was really cool to see them go there and take down a criminal that thought he was getting away with killing someone dear to Horatio.  Very solid season 5 throughout with various crimes and different drama that affected everyone at the CSI office from gambling to ex's that just won't go away.  It has something for everyone especialy loved the special features with Wolf (Ryan Togo) showing us the ends and outs of the real CSI Miami office and what goes on there very cool.Looking forward to season 6 with the way this one ended, i know it come out in typical CSI Miami fashion with a bang."
B000IVUL64 This season slowed down a little bit compared to season 4.  Intensity was there, but as the season progress, less chaos between episodes.  Opening was cool in Brazil.  Season closer wasn't that hyped, though the story was good.  Highlights:  Delko almost dies, Horatio saves a stripper, Wolf gets fired, and nicer looking cars. . ."
B000IVUL64 Loved the characters, their interactions, the crimes and how they were solved.  Love to see this show renewed.  Great fun, entertaining, and educational (for those of us who know nothing about catching the criminal)."
B000IVUL64 The first couple of episodes weren't the best b
B000IVUL64 This is another great police show,it also gets better each season and you also learn more background each season.Some of the eposides get emotional at the end  of them this season."
B000IXUOP0 Well one after another, I enjoy them all usually. The lighter ones give me a break from the intensity. That can help, especially watching before going to bed."
B000IXUOP0 To me, season four is the last of the great NCIS seasons, until season Nine. Gibbs is in Mexico, Ziva is on the run after being framed by a former massad officer who everybody thought was dead. Tony is the team leader, and Mcgee is no longer the probie. Ziva calls Gibbs in mexico, and he agrees to come back to the states to help. The F.B.I gets involved. But in the end, Ziva proves that she's an Investigator first now, and gets the killer to talk. Which clears her, and allows Gibbs to go back to Mexico. But not for long, as Fornell asks Gibbs's help in solving a case, which he does. And decides to come back to NCIS for good, the stories in season four are outstanding. The Halloween story alone is worth watching, as a marine is attacked in his home. And his daughter is kidnapped, and all throughout the case, Ziva thinks that the Daughter's mother is the one who kidnapped her own daughter. But alas, in the end she is wrong.  Or the creepy episode, \"Smoked\". Where a body is found in a chimney, the body of a sadistic serial killer with a toe in his stomach, only come to find out his wife was the actual killer. As she buried the bodies in their yard, and the episode ends with Gibbs asking fornell how he thought the toe got in the guys stomach. There are two threads of stories throughout this season, one is Tony has a new girlfriend, and Gibbs has a Girlfriend Col. Hollis Mann. We also find out, that Mcgee is a fictional writer. We're introduced to Shariff, in two incredible episodes, where they stop the terrorist the first time, and Gibbs is almost killed the second time they meet. Also in this season, we eventually find out that Tony's girlfriend is his undercover assignment for Director Shepard. As she tries to get an international arms dealer  La Grenoulle, now Ducky had been mad at Gibbs for quitting, but eventually they become friends again. And Paula Cassidy and her team are killed in an explosion, in a really powerful episode, season four ends with Jeanne and Dinnozo getting in a limo, which is her father's, and there is La Grenoulle. Season four again, is the last of the great NCIS seasons."
B000IXUOP0 For some reason, we had never watched this show.  Once we saw it we fell in love with it and have now watched season 1 though season and are anxiously awaiting season 11."
B000IXUOP0 I hated Mark Harmen for years.  I saw him in 2 roles where he was a really bad dude, and so convincing I decided he must be a bad dude for realz.  When NCIS came along I said &#34;I'm not watching that A hole&#34;.  The everyone kept telling me how much fun it was and how I was missing it.  I got the first couple seasons on sale and decided to give it a shot.  All is forgiven Mark.  The show is smart, funny and fresh every time.  they do not go too far on gore or violence and they always look good, even in a prison camp which is not easy.  You can start with any season and still enjoy but I suggest begining at the begining."
B000IXUOP0 Love NCIS - enjoyed Season 4.  Watching every episode of every season to date to have a better understanding of the characters.  This is an awesome show."
B000IXUOP0 The first two episodes' guest stars are Eyal Podell and Brandon Barash - both sleeper stars biding their time in the land of Daytime Television aka soap operas."
B000IXUOP0 Love this show and love having the DVD's to watch anytime I wish. I am looking forward to purchasing seasons 7, 8 and 9 (when available) to complete my collection. We purchased seasons 1-6 for Christmas :-)"
B000IXUOP0 as we all know Season 3 leaves us with Gibbs gone from his position as the head of the NCIS team.  He's out of the fold but comes back in a case by case basis for the first few episodes.  As Tony is in charge of the team since Gibbs has been gone and isn't really too keen on giving that position back.  Among them being Ziva gets framed for murder when a bombing takes place while she's out on the town.  It only takes another episode or two and Gibbs is back and running things.  All the actors/actresses come together to make this show what it is.  A throughly engaging, story driven and all around fun show to watch.It just clicks from episode to episode with various cases in need of solving and a couple that delve deeper into the inner workings of the Director.  As she has a history with one of the criminals that the team is trying to apprehed.  The fourth season of NCIS continues to roll on and bring us excellent stories.  I'm looking forward to checking out the next couple seasons on DVD very soon.  Keep the show going it is one of the better and more interesting shows out there."
B000IXUOP0 My wife has become incurably hooked on this show and the eclectic cast of characters. It is entertaining to watch as a result of clever writing and convincingly portrayed characters.  The plots are extremely varied even though they all boil down to the same crime scene investigation theme. There are both ongoing story lines as well as satisfactory resolution of crimes in each episode. The person who dreamed up the character of Abbey deserves a gold star and the role is convincingly as well as entertainingly played."
B000IXUOP0 \"NCIS: The Fourth Season\" will delight fans with the entertaining mixture of tight police procedural and humorous team interaction they have come to expect.  This season will bring something extra, what exective producer Don Bellisario terms \"a season of secrets.\"The opening three episode story arc concerns the return of Senior Agent Gibbs from his hiatus in Mexico recovering from injuries, including partial amnesia, suffered at the end of Season Three.  Along the way, we will learn that Israeli Mossad Agent Ziva David and acting team leader Tony Dinozzo have secrets from Gibbs.  In the course of the season, we will learn of Abby's secret romance and McGee's secret hobby.  Most importantly, we will learn of Director Shepard's secret vendetta against the arms dealer named Le Grenouille, for which she is prepared to bend and beak rules, and which will place Gibbs' team at risk by season's end.\"NCIS: The Fourth Season\" includes eight special features on the production of the show, of which the most entertaining may be a two-part roundtable with the cast.  The cast answers questions about the show put by viewers, and the viewers may come to appreciate just how well cast the show really is.  \"NCIS: The Fourth Season\" is very highly recommended to its fans."
B000IXUOP0 Great fun to enjoy again and again.  Enjoy the characters, especially Abby,Ziva, and Ducky."
B000IXUOP0 This is a season of on-going story linesGibbs could not be allowed to retire and the first couple of shows bring him back to active duty.This season has several strong individual episodes.Witch Hunt has the famous Abby as Marylyn Monroe at Halloween.The episodes Once a Hero, Driven, Dead Man Walking and Smoked are excellent stand-alone stories.Twisted Sister and Friends & Loves present a McGee in a new light and are major steps in this characters development.Their are a number of story lines, some major and some just fun, in this season.Special Agent Lee and Jimmy have several encounters in less than appropriate places lending some comic relief.The publication of McGee's first book has some team members upset with how their portrayal.The decision to retire creates problems for Gibbs; Tony became team leader and is involved in special projects for the director.  These are ongoing stories during the season as problems are \"resolved\".Tony falls in love.Director Sheppard establishes her authority and hate for an arms dealer known as \"La Grenouille\".The producers call this the \"season of secrets\" and season five the \"season of answers\"."
B000IXUOP0 I don't have television, haven't for 11 years. When I learned CBS was allowing free viewing over the internet I checked it out and started watching episodes of CSI, CSI NY, CSI Miami, and NCIS. I found NCIS to be my favorite and this particular show Dead And Unburied is my favorite so far. I enjoy the light-heartedness of NCIS. So I decided to download this episode from Amazon Unbox.I really wish Amazon Unbox would allow me to burn shows I've purchased. As it is they are restricted to viewing on my computer. When Unbox expands this service to allow me to burn DVDs I will likely purchase many more shows this way. I like selecting individual shows."
B000IXUOP0 I have ordered all the seasons of NCIS so far and have had no problems with any of the DVDs. All have come fast and when they said they would come."
B000IXUOP0 another great season. My only complaint is how it ended. it was just over. It was like the writers just ran out of steam and left us hanging. The development of the characters in this season has been a great."
B000IXUOP0 If you  like comedy  and drama the show is for you.It is a spin-off of the jag series that was on a few years ago,and both shows show you how military law is enforced.It is so well written that the hour thier on passes on so quickly."
B000IXUOP0 I have not had a chance to view this DVD yet but it appears to be in good condition.  Thank You"
B000IXUOP0 Great series and would recommend it to anyone over the age of 18 years  I gave it a five star rating"
B000IXUOP0 Season 4 of NCIS comes off as more a labyrinth than \"The Season Of Secrets\" as CBS promoted it.  The main characters all seem to start in different areas--Gibbs in Mexico, Tony as Team Leader, Tim no longer the \"Probie\", Ziva being Ziva...but as the season rolls on, all the lines start coming together.  Jethro's return from Mexico isn't exactly greeted by Jenny Sheppard, and Ducky Mallard's indifference to Gibbs is puzzling.  Tony is in a serious relationship (Or is he?), and it's driving Ziva to distraction.  Tim has suddenly come into money--lots of it, evidently.  Abby is falling for a little person.  Ducky's assistant Jimmy Palmer is finding himself in a hot affair with the new Probie.And Jenny is running an off-the-books investigation that gets the Christians In Action (Initials, folks) upset at NCIS.It's a complicated season where all the characters undergo some changes; mostly pleasant but some not.  Mark Harmon brings Gibbs back from Mexico a little softer (Though not to the team)--enough to allow himself a relationship.  Michael Weatherly gets to have Tony grow up--some--and have his well-known intrusiveness into his coworker's private lives flipped on him by Ziva.  Cote De Pablo allows the Mossad liason to fall for an ill-fated nuclear inspector in \"Dead Man Walking\", but Ziva starts having \"Tony issues\" that don't slap her in the face until the end of the season.  Pauley Perrette's Abby is as she ever is--the attempt to give up \"Kaff-Pow!!\" was classic.  David McCallum's Ducky allows some hurt to show through in his relationship with Gibbs early in the year.  Brian Dietzen and Liza Lapira's sequences in-and-around the morgue were wonderful asides, and made up for the missing \"head slaps\".But Lauren Holly was most intriguing in this season.  She took a character which some viewers considered cheesecake in Season 3, and gave her a very uneasy edge.  The investigation of La Grenouille seemed legitimate, but as the season went on, Jen's personal stake--and what it could cost NCIS--became apparent.  This led to Sheppard not being cast in a good light through much of the second half of the season.This season also became a good spotlight for many of the recurring characters.  Certainly key to the season were Susanna Thompson--Hollis Mann, the CID investigator who got Gibbs' attention--and Scottie Thompson as Jeanne Benoit, the doctor who made DiNozzo settle down.  Joe Spano's usual visits as T.C. Fornell, the FBI agent/friend/rival to Jethro were a delight.  But Muse Watson's Mike Franks--Gibbs' team leader when Jethro first joined the then-NIS--was a treat; an old-fashioned type who got things done not within the rules (Wonder where Jethro got that from?).  We lose Jessica Steen's Paula Cassidy in \"Grace Period\", and that's a shame.  But Armand Assante's was insidious and slick as \"The Frog\", and David Dayan Fisher's turn as Trent Kort--the CIA operative in with La Grenouille--is also notable.In it's run, NCIS has always had an ongoing storyline that gets buried in the usual action--the identity of the terroist who infiltrated the MTAC in Season 1, the return of Ari leading to the two words (\"Sorry, Caitlin\") at the end of Season 2, and the uncovering of Jethro's life story in Season 3.  Season 4 becomes about Jenny's  investigation/obsession, and how it affects the whole office.  It is aninteresting and ominous turn in the series.  It does require the viewer to follow along closely, but in the end, all the main characters find themselves at the center of the puzzle."
B000J0Q1KO I am one of those people who chooses not to pay for cable so I buy the programs I enjoy and know that will enjoy watch many times.  This series is one of my favorites and I have just about all of the seasons.  I really like William Peterson so I am not sure I will buy any more once he leaves in season 8 or 9.  I find that when I watch them again I see something I missed the times before so it is well worth the money to be able to have control over what I watch and when I watch it."
B000J0Q1KO This particular season is excellent. I cant wait until season 8 lands on Amazon.CSI is far superior to the other CSI shows (New York & Miami). Season 7 ends with a bang and leaves you drooling for more, like every other season.Great series, great acting, great stories!!!"
B000J0Q1KO Just about the time that I thought just about every possible variant on the TV cop/detective/crime solving show had been explored by the creative geniuses who provide our nightly broadcast television ration of pap, piddle and trivia -whoa - here came a show that tickled our Sherlock Holmesian/forensic knowledge fancy.  Whoever would have thought that poking around with microscopes and spectrum analyzers and picking up little bits of fluff at a Los Vegas crime scene with a set of tweezers could be interesting? But yes, it was and has continued to be for going on eight seasons now and has given rise to a couple of variants set in New York and Miami. All three of the CSI iterations offer a distinct challenge to a viewer who possesses a decent ration of curiosity about puzzles and mysteries but a very, very low gross-out threshold. CSI season 7 mercifully let up a little on the really gross visualizations and focused a little more on the puzzles. Nothing I watched this season sent me gagging from the room, so either they let up or I have gotten a little more used to maggoty corpses.Three of the special features in this collection focus specifically on episodes which made season 7 stand a little apart. The first is  a `making of'  \"Built to Kill\" a two part episode set backstage at the astonishing Cirque d Soliel, another covers  the definitive stunt-casting of all time;  Roger Daltry playing five different guest parts in \"Living Legend\".  And a third extra feature focused on the hunt for the \"miniature\" killer, which continued intermittently all though the season. I found the \"Miniature Murders\" feature to be especially fascinating, as I had built many inch-to-a-foot scale model interiors and buildings. Having a series of perfectly replicated half-inch-to-a-foot murder scenes showing up within hours of a real, full-sized murder offered a puzzle to Grissom and his crew that lasted all season. Very obviously, it would have taken an artisan of miniatures days and weeks to build such a detailed replica, and the feature made it very clear what a challenge it was, even with the resources available to a television studio. Other extras include commentary tracks for seven episodes, and a tour of the real CSI-Las Vegas offices; which, astonishingly enough, are very much more cluttered and not nearly as plush-looking as the series sets."
B000J0Q1KO Excellent!"
B000J0Q1KO There are various things going on with the people this time around.  Whether its Gregg witnessing a gang beating and becoming a victim himself \"Fannysmackin\".  Katherine having a little too much to drink and winding up in a motel and wakes to wonder whether she's been assaulted or not.  It's a lot going on in other episodes as well with various issues.  It goes without saying that you won't be bored anything or character in Season 7 of CSI as they continue to up their game and keep finding more interesting cases to tackle and underlying stories between the office as a whole.After 7 seasons one would think that CSI would be slipping up or become complacent about its longevity.  But that is so not the case especially with Season 7.  Each episode has a little something different to it whether its \"Lab Rats\" where the other workers in the CSI office take a front seat to try and help Grissom solve the mystery behind the miniature killer.  This is an ongoing arc throughout this Season and it requires all the characters help in piecing together exactly who's doing this and better yet why.\"Living Doll\", it ends with a cliffhanger as Sarah has been kidnapped by the miniature killer leaving things wide open on what will actually happen to her will Grissom, Katherine and the others make it to her in time.Some of my favorite episodes from this include:\"Built to Kill, Part 1\"\"Fannysmackin\"\"Living Legend\"\"Lab Rats\"\"Living Doll\" the season ender with a big cliffhangerThe whole season is worth purchasing in any respect as in also includes Special Features-\"Inside Built to Kill\", \"Miniature Murders\", \"Who Are You? Inside Living Legend\", \"Las Vegas: The Real Crime Solvers\", \"The Evolution of CSI: Season 7\" and \"Smoke and Mirrors: Directing Feature Television.Excellent in all respects from the writers, storyline, actors/actresses, guest stars, lighting, various backgrounds and mainly the attention to detail.  That everyone involved puts into this show on a daily basis, i'm impressed.5 out of 5 stars"
B000J0Q1KO C.S.I. Crime Scene Investigation - The Complete Seventh Season DvdQuick Delivery! New Condition. Excellent series.HIghly recommend Amazon!!"
B000J0Q1KO Am enjoying the entire series - once you get into the characters, you just want more.  Came to me quickly and in great shape."
B000J0Q1KO This, by the way, is the second review I've written for this - don't know where the first one is.  Having said that ...Each season I keep saying the same thing, - this show keeps getting better and better. I feel this show always manages to stay fresh and interesting and I love it more and more with each new season. I can't wait for this release.The first episode in this season is Built To Kill where we are waiting to see more of what we found out in the last episode of season 6 - that Grisolm and Sara had gotten together. My favourite episode is Happenstance where identical twins have been seperately killed and the team try to work out whether the case is related or not. If you want a total recap of each episode then here it goes:Built To Kill 1 - Foul play is suspected when an apparent suicide victim still has the gun in his hand, and a flower delivery woman is found crushed to death in the middle of a Cirque du Soleil performance. (Look for a special appearance from John Mayer.Built To Kill 2 - Grisolm investigates the murder of a rock star, which is complicated by the discovery of a miniature replica of the crime scene at the house. And Catherine tries to determine if she was raped after waking up nude in a seedy hotel.Toe Tags - A group of dead bodies in the Las Vegas morgue get to know each other while CSI tries to solve the crimes that got them there.Fannysmackin' - (another favourite of mine) A gang of street thugs is beating and killing people all over the city. Greg witnesses one of the crimes taking place and becomes a beating victim himself.Double Cross - A lounge singer is found crucified inside a Catholic church, and the church's new pastor fails to disclose that he knows the victim from all the way back to high school.Burn Out - A pedophile arsonist maintains his innocence in the disappearance of two young boys, but he is also willing to help the investigation by giving Grissom insight on the potential kidnapper's mindset.Post Mortem - Greg has his day in court for running over and killing a street gang member right before his own beating, and a second crime scene replica is found--this time after the murder of an elderly woman.Happenstance - CSI investigates the deaths of estranged identical twins: one from a gunshot wound, and one from an apparent suicide. The two deaths do not appear to be related, but are they?Living Legend - (the only boring episode) The team searches for a link between a current string of murders in Las Vegas and a notorious mob boss who disappeared in the 1970s.Loco Motives - Gil finds a third miniature crime-scene replica at a murder site, and CSI tries to find a link between the three otherwise-unrelated murders.Leaving Las Vegas - Catherine tries to link an accused killer to a second similar crime in a small town after he is found not guilty in the first trial, and Gil announces that he is going on sabbatical.Sweet Jane - The C.S.I. team doesn't know what to make of their new member ( Liev Schreiber), who joins them in the hunt for a serial killer, active since the 1970's.Redrum - Keppler proposes that Catherine create a phony crime scene to help catch a murderer, and to keep it secret from the other investigators. However, Nick quickly figures out that something is fishy.Meet Market - The discovery of a badly burned corpse uncovers a plot to illegally harvest bones and tissues, and the death of a middle-aged wife appears to be connected to her relationship with a high-priced male companion.Law Of Gravity - When one Trenton cop is murdered in Las Vegas, a second threatens to expose Keppler's past if he doesn't make the case and the evidence go away.Monster In The Box - Grissom thinks the miniature killer is dead, until he receives another miniature crime scene. However, unlike the others, this one predicts a crime scene that hasn't happened yet.Fallen Idols - A star high school basketball player disappears, and the investigation reveals that he gave an STD to a couple of his classmates.Empty Eyes - Six showgirls who live together are murdered in their home, and Sara is distressed when the final victim dies in her arms. However, she may have left Sara a vital clue that could help her ultimately identify the killer.Big Shots - A death in a drive-by limo shooting and the dragging death of a young woman turn out to be related crimes, and Greg discovers that the brother of the young man he ran over may have been involved.Lab Rats - With Grissom out of his office and all of the detectives out in the field, Hodges and the lab other techs try to discover new clues in the miniature killer case.Ending Happy - A washed-up boxer is found dead at a nearby bordello. There are several suspects, motives, and signs of injury. But the medical examiner is having a hard time figuring out which blow was the actual cause of death.Leapin' Lizzards - CSI discovers that a woman may have been murdered, and her head mounted on a wall as a trophy, because the killer was convinced that she was actually a powerful alien reptile. (Quite a bizzare episode and a bit of a departure from what you're used to seeing on CSI).The Good, The Bad And The Dominatrix - After an unsuccessful attempt on Lady Heather's life, Sara discovers Gil's prior relationship with her. Meanwhile, Nick investigates the death of a woman apparently hit by a taxicab.Living Doll - The miniature killer is ready to strike again, and Sara will be the next victim. Will CSI stop her in time?Throughout the season you see the theme of the miniature killer. It started out slowly and built up speed toward the end. Because of the killer and what he/she has done to Sara, Grisolm ending up blurting out to the others about their relationship. At first the team aren't sure if they heard right or not, but it becomes apparent that they are a couple and that's almost as exciting as working out who's behind these miniatures.If you are a CSI fan, you are bound to love season 7. It truly gets better always and I already can't wait for season 8."
B000J0Q1KO As many people said this show kept getting better each year.The crimes are interesting and the cast is believable and solid.The introduction of the new Character Keppler was a great move although his sudden demise due to a corrupt cop is this seasons one strained aspect. After all if the corrupt cop was going to kill his partner he would be unlikely to do it in Vegas when he's from Trenton. However that's not implausible and he was after all blackmailing Keppler. So  people do things all the time that don't make any sense even bad cops. So even a strained episode of \"CSI\" is still top rate entertainment.Overall the series was at it's peak during this season and the next.The ninth season is excellent too but long time viewers are without three of their favorite characters.  As many posters pointed out this is one of the entire series best seasons and that's true enough because it remains a fascinating show and thankfully there's no techno soundtrack like on later episodes of \"CSI New York\". (which is a great show otherwise).  And that's just another reason to enjoy this wonderful show."
B000J0Q1KO THis season is better than the sixth!! More story is given about Grisham and Sarah. The miniture killer was strung all the way through the season. It was great! It seems like the show is going to continue to get better. The ending is left with a cliff hanger and that is the only negative."
B000J0Q1KO If you like to watch police t.v. shows  this series is great for learning about police investigations. This is also the season were the team is  played with by the minature killer  that leaves a model of the same  crime scene  the CSI team is investigating,and you also learn more about the series characters."
B000J0Q1KO The seventh season of the smash hit, original C.S.I. found the show still going strong, as opposed to when many network hits fizzle out by this time in their life.  The season opens with Grissom (William Petersen) and Sara (Jorja Fox) keeping their relationship secret as a mystery unfolds regarding a killer who leaves behind exact, incredibly detailed, miniature replicas of the crime scene.  As the rest of the season unfolds, Greg (Eric Szmanda) finds himself in a predicament he never foresaw, Catherine (Marg Helgenberger) finds herself playing the role of victim, and when Grissom goes out of town, a shady transfered cop named Keppler (the excellent Liev Schreiber) arrives on the scene; culminating in one of the best storyarcs the series has ever seen.  As the season winds to a close, the CSI's close in on the miniature killer, and the season concludes with one of their lives in jeopardy, and the others desperate to make things right.  Undoubtedly one of the best seasons of the show in it's entire run, the original (and best) C.S.I. remains one of the best crime dramas to ever grace prime time network TV, and the seventh season is a prime example why."
B000J0Q1KO This CSI Season is another great one!  Stories are always interesting and enjoyable. Peterson is one of my favorites. Would highly recommend!"
B000J1B1PI I have all the seasons currently available on DVDs - watching the 3d season right now and it never dissapoints. I am not even pretending I could understand most of its mathematics, but the \"adaptation\" is done with real elegance so that your average non-mathematician is often nicely tickled by understanding so much :) The series also keep a careful and well balanced proportion between brain part and emotions part, so the relationships and friendships are interesting to watch but they do not drag a clever and fascinating crime series into a family drama.One of the best crime/investigation series around, together with Criminal Minds, Without a Trace and CSI. Hope it stays around for many more seasons."
B000J1B1PI This season's writers and the regular actors continue to produce exciting and engaging stories and roles to yield another interesting season. It may not be the same caliber as the previous ones but it continues to provide entertaining episodes and peek my interest in the characters development (and love interests)."
B000J1B1PI I am a big fan of this series, each new season brings something new to the back stories of each character. I highly recommend."
B000J1B1PI I enjoy this series, especially the interaction of the two brothers and their father. I recognize it is not especially realistic, but it is nonetheless, thought provoking and enjoyable."
B000J1B1PI who thought that a show about mathematics and crime solving would be both interesting and engaging to watch at the same time.  Season 3 is chock full of engaging characters, situations and stories that will keep any and all interested in this ever growing and popular TV show.  Numb3rs is on the way up and Season 3 has more than enough intrigue, mystery, romance and quite a bit of betrayal in it (The Janus List) a lot of things get brought out into the open and one surprise that i didnt ever see coming at all.Enjoy this one because from the looks of it Rob Morrow, David Krumholtz, Judd Hirsch and the rest of the gang are in for heck of a ride in Season 4."
B000J1B1PI With every episode it seems to get better, the story lines are excellent and the characters are great. I love the family dynamic that is shown in each of the stories told."
B000J1B1PI My son is a statics masters student going onto his PHD, this show so reminds me of him and the math that he does, it just makes you realize that math is everywhere no matter where we are, sorry to see that the series ended so soon"
B000J1B1PI We have enjoyed all of the episodes, like the characters, content is educational, love Professor Epps! Recommend to all viewers."
B000J1B1PI I loved it. Good action, great characters and educational if you are into math and equations. I would watch it again too."
B000J1B1PI An excellent program if you enjoy math and science. If not, the characters are fun to follow through the ups and downs of work and college life. You have to love Finehart(?)."
B000J1B1PI A friend of mine recommended that I watch this show. I love the characters plus it has a little bit of everything, action, romance, 'smarts'..."
B000J1B1PI Again, it's all about the numbers! Numbers bring in the bad guys! Brother duo are still offering up great sleuthing situations using FBI technics with plenty of math formulas. This season add more story with some sad news and some funny surprises."
B000J1B1PI Great series and enjoyable to watch.I like how math is used to help solve the different cases.The characters are really down to earth and this series showed life outside the F.B.I.office. Mike"
B000J1B1PI It's always difficult starting a review you know most people won't like but here is goes.What I really like about numbers: it makes geeks cool, no hot steamy scenes (ie family oriented), main characters are decent people, it isn't gory, good story lines.The main thing I don't like about numb3rs is that it' missing some vital connection with the characters. Because I can't stay involved with the characters I tend to notice the poorly played / directed moments in the show. I also wonder about how reliable the technical stuff is, I've goggled some of the smaller thing (that I thought were cool) and can't find them or they don't pan out. I wouldn't worry about any of that if while I were watching it I had enough emotional involvement to care if one of the characters died but after 3 seasons if a main character was killed off I'd just wonder how that would change the shows dynamics.One other thing that drive me a bit crazy is that the show acts like the FBI can't even use the bathroom without \"Charlies\" help. I understand its a tool to show how vital he is but he gets 911 calls and guilt trips from his brother before it's necessary, like at the very beginning of a case.So, while I recommend this show, especially for family viewing and believe it's well above average, I still can't say it's great."
B000J1B1PI We watched this show every weeek when it was on.  Well, may have missed a few.  The shows are memorable and we mostly recall them very well and enjoy them as much as the first time.  Some things just wear well and this show has something."
B000J1B1PI The storylines in this season are awesome!**SPOILER**My favorite part of this season is Charlie and Amita finally get together officially."
B000J46A6K I give this five stars because not only is this series funny, but it is insightful into the nature of governments and bureaucracies.  While this show is poking fun at the British government, it would be easy to envision something quite similar in Washington."
B000J46A6K ordinarily I love British comedy but there was really nothing funny that I could find in this sitcom. . ."
B000J46A6K My favorite characters are Sir Humphrey and the Minister.  Sir Humphrey can twist a simple sentence or command of the Minister in such a way that you cannot remember the question at all.  He is a riot."
B000J46A6K great series, the casting and acting is terrific.  the &#34;yes, prime minister&#34; series is also excellent.  anyone who enjoys political satire will like these shows."
B000J46A6K Rarely do I give a rating like this to anything but British comedy is a weakness of mine and the actors in this series was always first rate."
B000J46A6K I usually watch a more serious program, but end the night with one episode of this program. The humor puts me in the right frame of mind for a good night's sleep.Anyone who likes BBC comedy will thoroughly enjoy this program."
B000J46A6K &#34;Yes Minister&#34; and &#34;Yes Prime Minister&#34; are excellent BBC programs. Intelligent, entertaining, enlightening, witty, and fun. The one-breath convoluted statement that bureaucrat Humphrey delivers in each episode is delicious."

B000JEZBNI I bought it and it is on my computer... I love the ingenuity of these men and the children who went with them.  This was a great and inspirational story of survival and the continuity of life, the good life, the healthy life.  The actors expression was quite believable and I say it was very well done.

B000JEZBNI This was my intoroduction to sci-fi when I was in 2nd grade.  Certain episodes were so vivid that they etched themselves permanently in my memory.  Upon watching them again, I see how they are also emotionally appealing and surprisingly sophisticated, both in their science and in the lack of \"feel good\" deus ex machina endings that mar so many otherwise excellent Star Trek stories.I think by far the best story of this lot is \"The Man Who was Never Born\", which exudes a kind of timeless anguish.  It still moves me to think of the deformed Landau, who was truly brilliant.  But the \"Architects of Fear\" is also wonderful, with the good man sacrificing himself in vain and communicating his love to his wife from his horribly altered form.  They are both tragedies with grand conceptions behind them, truly unique. \"The Galaxy Being\" and \"The Sixth Finger\" are also deeply affecting and believable in their way.  These are all timeless themes in hard sci-fi, done extremely well.There are some bad episodes too, b
B000JEZBNI I bought this episde of the Outer Limits purely from never forgetting watching it back in the 60's.  It was one of my favorites then and still is."
B000JEZBNI The first season of \"The Outer Limits\" was the best. Sure the second season had some classic episodes (among them \"Solider\" and \"Demon with a Glass Hand\" which inspired James Cameron to come up with \"The Terminator\". I'd give the shows here 5 stars but 0 stars to MGM for this reissue. Why? Because these are the exact same digital transfers as last time. They haven't been enhanced with any thing AND there are no extras. I'd average that out to 2 stars for this set.Don't get me wrong--the first season was terrific for the most part. This set (like the first season set) features the moving \"The Man Who Was Never Born\" with Martin Landau as a scarred victim of a viral holocaust who is given the chance to go back in time and prevent the birth of the man who created his sterile world. Featuring a rich score by the late Domninic Frontiere (among his best), this was \"The Outer Limits\" as its best. Also we get \"The Galaxy Being\" with Cliff Roberson who unwittingly brings an alien creature he has been communicating with from a world made of anti-matter into ours causing destruction and death. David McCallum in \"The Sixth Finger\" about the results of an experiment to push humanity to evolve to the next level but how, in the process, we lose the essence of what makes us human.\"The Zanti Misfits\" like much of Stefano's work provides a neat allegory about human nature. We also get \"The Borderlands\" and many other classic episodes mixed with claptrap like \"Human Factor\" but almost everything here is terrific even if we're only getting half a season at a higher price than before.Why not include a commentary track from surviving actors or David J. Suchow the author on the definitive book on \"The Outer Limits\"? Because MGM is convinced that you'll buy this set and the second one coming out in August AND pay more in the process because they've split them up. Heck, the least they could have done was got rid of those dreadful dual sided discs. Nope. These are dual sided as well.So what do you get? 16 episodes--half the first season of the series. In August you can get the second half of the first season. I'm at a loss here--why release the exact same thing as before only in a different package? The only reason is so that retailers (such as Best Buy) who return things after a limited shelf life will carry this again. If you're going to do this at least give us some extras (a featurette on the visual effects, vintage interviews with the late Joe Stefano or Leslie Stevens, commentary tracks with Suchow discussing the making of the episode.The show deserves 5 stars but Sony/MGM deserves 0 stars for this reissue. Get this instead.The Outer Limits - The Original Series, Season 1"

B000JO9JHW I never would have thought I would enjoy a show like this. WOW...what a show. Honestly, I could do without the foul language and the nudity and in most cases such would cause me to go elsewhere. But this show is one of the BEST crime drama's I've ever seen. The main character, Dexter Morgan, is one of the BEST lead characters ever. The supporting cast of characters (everyone from his sister to girlfriend(s) to the many police officers) are all excellent as well. But wow...the story is soo good! It just pulls you in and keeps you wanting more."
B000JO9JHW Michael C Hall, hot off the HBO series Six Feet Under, plays the title character Dexter Morgan in this series from Showrime Entertainment. A crime scene investigator from Miami who is an expert on blood. He also likes to seeking revenge on those criminals who escape the law by loopholes in the justice system. Believe me this is no CSI show!Created by novelist Jeff Lindsay, Hall and his supporting cast (including Lauren Velez, James Remar, Julie Benz, and Jennifer Carpenter)create an interesting portrait of man whose blood is dipped in both worlds. Hall's baby face showcases an evil side underneath his devilish killer smile. The show is an interesting character study as well as a great murder mystery.There is the  Ice Cream truck murderer who is stalking Dexter and leaving killer clues. The mystery unfolds in these 12 episodes and you will be intrigued by the last episode. This is like a good British televsion series, a full complete story unfolded in 12 parts.The extras on the fourth disk are  two episodes of Showtime's The Blotherhood (which is also available on DVD), audio commentary on the 12th episodes, and a true life crime story. Those of you with computer can read the first two chapters of the latest Dexter novel and a download of the Showtime show the Tutors (soon to be on DVD)Even without the extras, this is a five star killer show...its a bloody good time. This , like House, is what great TV is all about!  I can not wait until October for season twoBennet Pomerantz AUDIOWORLD"
B000JO9JHW I just finished watching Dexter : Season 1 and it is phenomenal!I'm an avid movie watcher and TV series watcher! Ive watched all the seasons of CSI Vegas and Law & Order SUV, The Shield!Dexter is far superior to all of them. Season one starts out good, gets alot better half way through as the characters develop and ends with an amazing season finale!Showtime hit a homerun with this one! Im looking forward to Season 2 and have already lent my Season 1 set to a friend!"
B000JO9JHW Loved it. I have always wondered what was the hype around this show. Now I know. This show is amazing."
B000JO9JHW I will admit to some hesitation at even wanting to watch this show.I sit in Dialysis 2.5 hours a day 5 days a week. Sitting in Dialysis is hard, the recliner chairs are most uncomfortable having two 15 gage needles stuck in your arm is at best painful. Nor having anyone to talk to is the pits.what i did is bought (what was at the time) the only portable blu ray player on the market and started watching blu ray movies.i was told about Dexter by friends and everyone that told me about it loved t. \"it's about a cop that kills on the side\" they would tell me. after a few of them talked me sensless about it i thought i would try it.I loved it from the first show.Set in Miami, Dexter works for the police department figuring out how blood splatters from the victems of knife or gun shot wounds. but he has a darker side. he himself is a killer. his step father taught him how to channel his instincts and kill thoughs that are \"unworthy to live\".It;s dark, often funny, and very bloody. this is not recomended for those that can' stand people screaming and bleeding a lot. but it is for those that have a dark sense of humor"
B000JO9JHW This set has been reviewed extensively so I won't get into too much detail except for why I gave it 5 stars. There are a lot of repetitive shows out there, about 100 regarding vampires, another hundred crime or law shows, etc. Yes, this is a crime show but they put a spin on it like no other. A serial killer who kills serial killers, rapists, murderers, etc? Awesome. The narration is actually amusing. The storytelling is amazing. I love it. It gets my 5 star vote."
B000JO9JHW or those that can't stand the sight of blood because it is in abundance in this show.  Along with Dexter (a guy with more skeletons in his closet than a graveyard) and his repressed memories of a violent tragic indicent early in his life.  As the season builds we get to see glimpses of it with more and more being revealed until.  It builds up with a face to face confrontation with the Ice Truck Killer (a few surprises) abound in the first season finale and it leaves things wide open.  For the series and all of its characters.I believe that Season 2 will continue to impress and draw in new folks in the process.  Excellent story, lead and supporting characters and backgrounds leaves you with the first season of Dexter.  An up and coming show that gives those established shows a serious run for their money."
B000JO9JHW Dexter is an interesting watch. We get the outside looking in as a monster tries to live camouflaged among its unwitting prey. Along the way, we see many layers of psychosis and neurosis flayed away. Maybe there's more to Dexter than is immediately seen.The story for the first season bares only the most simplistic resemblance to the first novel in the series. Though I've read the book and watched the show quite a few times, I would be hard-pressed to pick one over the other. The cast is amazing, and the intro sequence tells you everything you need to know about the series.The special features for the DVD set falls to the abysmal side. Slim pickings for commentary tracks, no deleted scenes, but we get a handful of other Showtime series episodes. I don't know about you, but I bought Dexter to watch Dexter, not to watch episodes of the Tudors or whatever else they threw into the DVD set. And they did all this sans English subtitles (which matters to a guy like me, being partially deaf).The only thing worth while about this set are the 12 episodes of Dexter. If that's all you are shopping for, go at it. Me, I'm looking at getting the series on BD and hoping for better material. But the show alone is so good, I can't rate this lower than 4 stars."
B000JO9JHW Dexter Morgan is good at his day job, that of a blood spatter analyst in Miami PD's forensics unit. But he's bloody brilliant at his other job, the one where he gets to murder. Whatever effed up sitch it was that caused Dexter's amnesia regarding his early childhood, it's left him dead inside, an empty shell, a calculating cold fish. He co-exists with something he calls a \"Dark Passenger,\" essentially this urge that compels him to kill and kill. Recognizing the predatory beast inside Dex, his ex-cop foster father, Harry (James Remar), took the boy under his wing, reoriented his twisted appetites to a more productive cause. He instilled in Dex an elaborate code of ethics, taught him to target only other serial killers. He taught Dexter how not to get caught, how to blend in. Dads are awesome. And Dexter has steadfastly abided by the Code of Harry. His kills have been righteous kills.This Showtime adaptation is based on Jeff Lindsay's riveting series of books, and if you haven't read them, well, what's the hold up? Dexter Morgan is so emotionally detached he makes Dr. Temperance Brennan seem positively warm and cuddly. Social cues to which we effortlessly respond are baffling puzzles for him. Perversely, there is something innately likable about Dexter. Michael C. Hall plays him with stunning complexity. It helps that, like in BURN NOTICE, we're privy to his inner musings. Dexter is often humorous and whimsical. The girlfriend (Julie Benz) he pretends to care for doesn't suspect a thing. Even Dexter's jittery, potty-mouthed cop sister, Deb (Jennifer Carpenter), doesn't have an inkling.DEXTER THE FIRST SEASON hooks you in straight away as Dexter finds his bragging rights as Miami's resident monster challenged by an innovative fellow serial killer whom the press eventually dubs the Ice Truck Killer. It's an edgy cat-and-mouse game that would span the entire season and cause Dexter to ask serious questions of himself. The lovely twist is that Dexter accepts the Ice Truck Killer's tauntings with glee, perhaps like calling to like. For Dexter, it's an opportunity to play with someone just like him. Never mind that it's readily apparent that this rival knows everything about Dexter Morgan. Dexter shrugs this off. He's having fun.The Ice Truck Killer's modus operandi is eye-catching. He drains his victims completely of their blood and he freezes the corpses, amputates their limbs to a precise measurement. It's fun - and creepy - watching Dexter try to contain his excitement as each perfect frozen body part surfaces, each bit a gauntlet thrown in Dexter's mug.Most each episode also features a \"serial killer of the week\" motif, some heinous repeat murderer targeted and eventually carved up by Dexter, and these lesser villains are required so that we don't lose faith in Dex as a badasss dude, given his inability to track down the elusive Ice Truck Killer. It's a pretty good supporting cast, too. It wasn't long before I was keen into what these other characters were up to. Jennifer Carpenter is my second favorite actor on this show. She is one sexy, combustible, never-stop-cussing cop chick. But I do question her instincts. She's Miami PD - an ex-Vice, newly minted Homicide Detective - and yet in all these years she hasn't caught a whiff of her adopted brother's true nature? And then she does something else which ends up absolutely mortifying. And then there's Erik King whose angry, loose cannon character, Sgt. Doakes, is the only one who gets the heebie jeebies from Dexter. Doakes bullies Dexter so much, I sort of wish Dexter would just disregard the Code of Harry for once. Except that Dexter remains as cool as the other side of the pillow. He's a monster who's got his priorities straight. You need to not miss this show. It's wicked funny, cleverly written, and terrifically acted (especially by Michael C. Hall). Rife with moral ambivalence, DEXTER rewards its audience with unexpected - and frequently unsettling - moments. And you're hooked before you know it.The DVD set's bonus features:- 2 Audio Commentaries by the Cast & Producers: \"Return to Sender\" (with Jennifer Carpenter, David Zayas, Lauren Velez, and Erik King) and \"Born Free\" (with producers Sara Coleton, Clyde Philips, & Daniel Cerone)- \"The Academy of Blood - A Killer Course\"- \"Witnessed in Blood - A True Murder Investigation\" - feature on a real-life police investigation in 2001 with particulars on blood spatter analysis- 2 Free Episodes of Showtime's Hit series BROTHERHOOD- A computer-compatible function which allows you to stream two episodes of THE TUDORS, to read the First 2 Chapters of Jeff Lindsay's newest novel DEXTER IN THE DARK, and play the newest CSI Video Game \"CSI: HARD EVIDENCE\"- Cast Biographies"
B000JO9JHW Had a friend who loaned me season 1,and after watching it I ordered seasons 2-4.This show has plenty of drama,to many twist's and turns to figure out what's next. Lot's of humor (you can't help but like Dexter's one liners!)Just waiting for season 5 to come available!"
B000JO9JHW What a clever premise!  A sociopath with serial killer tendencies is spotted at a very early age by a seasoned police officer (while the child is up for adoption).  The Officer adopts the child and takes the opportunity to carefully ingrain in him that he is ONLY to kill others like him...serial killers....who have managed to slip through the system and remain free.  Dexter learns to be one of the best blood spatter experts at the police station.This is extraordinarily interesting as Dexter narrates his inner most thoughts, and we get to learn how a sociopath, with no empathy or understanding of how \"normal\" people feel, navigates through society mimicking how people behave.  That is fascinating.  The acting is dead-on and the writing is crisp and taught.  My ONLY issue with this series is the foul, gutter mouth of Dexter's sister...it is so extreme that it feels like slaps in the face.Really good television."
B000JO9JHW This concerns only the first season of this series and I know some of the things will not seem right to those who have watched the next seasons. But that is just the point. The first season has characteristics that will change later and the meaning will change too. I will keep within the very limits of that first season. What we gather from the first episodes is that this blood technician working for the Miami PD is the adopted son of a police officer. He was adopted at the age of four by this police officer because he had been traumatized by the killing of his mother with a chain saw by some drug dealers. At once the series insists on the fact that this trauma caused an irreversible damage in the psyche of the child who is fascinated by death and needs killing just like junkies need their drugs. He is addicted to inflicting death to other people. We will only learn quite late in this season who his real father was, after his death actually, so we will never know the man really. We will not be given in this season any detail about the death of the mother beyond what I have said. And all the detail that comes up now and then is always flashbacks in the memory of the child that Dexter was. Dexter recovers that memory little by little just like any child or even adult would do in the case of a traumatic event. His foster father just tried to bring this death impulse of his within some acceptable limits, within a certain code: you can kill but to survive hence you have to kill people who are just plain dirty (I sort of remember this is the code of Anne Rice's vampires). And that's what he has been taught and trained to do. First hide your impulse. Second pick the proper criminals. Third do it so professionally that you can never be suspected. This ideology then is very typical. You can survive any trauma if you know what you are, if you accept what you are and if you find out why you are what your are. When you finally know, then you are clear. The term comes from Hubbard but it is the one that is needed here. It may change later. This concept of clarity is doubled then with the Skinnerian concept of absolute determination of your whole being and future by the mould into which you have been cast in the very first years of your life. In this case, Dexter is a killer because of his trauma that happened when he was four, hence he will be a killer all his life. No one can change that. One can only teach the kid a code, a method, an art to do things along a certain ethical line and not to be caught. That is pessimistic but that is not the main interest of this first season. The main interest is that another serial killer, the Ice Truck Killer, though not being a copy cat, is obviously aiming at this Dexter. And his crimes that are very special in their style, method and delivery are there to titillate Dexter, to chase or bait Dexter into a trap or a corner. Little by little we will learn the connection between the two and that I won't reveal. In the end Dexter will have the upper hand and kill his competitor, along his own method, more or less.  The second interest of this series is how Dexter can keep his secret for himself in his own private life, hiding it from the women he is going along with, from his own sister (foster sister for sure but sister anyway), from his direct colleagues, from his department, etc. It is subtle and difficult and there the actor is doing quite a good job, though the series is more building the meaning with the environment of the character than with the acting of the actor. As usual in American series the actors are rather static and the stage director, the series director and the set designer are building around him or her a composed visual moving environment that builds the meaning of the expression or speech of the actor. Note in this case most of the discourse of the main actor is his own voice over the pictures. He is telling us a story and it is often a commentary of what we can see. The next and essential quality of this series is of course the real artistic and artful suspense that is built in each episode and in the twelve episodes of the season and that lets us absolutely breathless most of the time, even when we finally know who the Ice Truck Killer is, and then the suspense does not go down one iota. In other words this series is so far, first season only, Dionysian, quick, fast, dense, exhilarating, inebriating, intoxicating and many other things of that sort. In one word it is addictive and habit forming. You may, if you have ten hours and a half at your disposal watch the twelve episodes in one go and you will never be bored, tired, de-concentrated. Try it and you will like it I am sure.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines, CEGID"
B000JO9JHW Don't get me wrong, its an entertaining show, and at 20 bucks, you should definitely grab it.  To compare it to shows like Six Feet Under is absolutely ridiculous though.  The idea of Dexter being a sociopath is not exploited to its full potential, IMO.  Too much of the time he blends in so much you forget all about it, then you have to be reminded by forced voice overs and flashbacks.  This is a good DVD set though, I see lots of folks complaining about the transfer.  What can I say, don't spend 50 zillion bucks on your TV/Home theatre and you won't be so disappointed.  For 20 bones you get 12 doses of Dexter, AND two episodes of Brotherhood, and one of The Tudors if you have the time to screw around with the PC feature.  Not bad considering that people were lining up out the door to fork over 100 bucks for The Sopranos not too long ago."
B000JO9JHW a relative recommended this show to me, and I'm glad she did (because since I don't subscribe to Showtime)...I wasn't aware that this series existed, until recently.  Thankfully, Netflix took care of that little problem for me.Dexter plays a vigilante of sorts, a hero with a very dark side...he gives justice to those that the criminal justice system can't find or put behind bars.Michael Hall is a great actor, balancing a killer on the one hand and a likeable, lovable professional forensics expert on the other.....as he interacts in his various relationships.The show has comedy, drama, tension....it had just about everything...I guess one would label this a \"dark comedy\" type of series.  Very dark.All the other characters in the show are interesting and fun to watch, and we see the dramas played out in their life through the eyes of Dex.This is a truly original series that hooked me quickly with its stories and interesting characters- highly recommended!"
B000JO9JHW This is the introduction season.  They want us to learn about the characters and take an interest in them.Dexter is a sociopath serial killer.  Adopted and raised by a police officer, Dexter learned to appear \"normal\".Training as a forensic specialist, coupled with his Father's training keeps his killings from official notice.Set in Miami, Dexter works for the police helping them solve cases.  Along the way, Dexter kills the bad people that have beaten the system.This season revolves around \"The Ice Truck Killer\" and how this affects Dexter.The humor is dark.  The dialog is witty and cutting.  The acting is above average, no one is miscast and all work well together.The story line is not overly complex.  If you think about it, you will see where the story is going.  Even with that, it is fun.If you find the idea of a serial killer working for the cops funny, you should enjoy this."
B000JO9JHW Well, I have to say, when I heard about this show.....I detested the idea, thought it was gloryfiying serial killers....SWORE I would never watch......happened to be trapped working out and watching TV when a episode came on....I thought Meh....just get it over with....well I was hooked from the first scene....I couldn't hardly wait for the next weeks episode, so I decided to give in to my \"dark side\"....lol...and buy the first and second season.  I REALLY like this show, it is slick, entertaining, innovative, well written and acted.....over all as stated in the title this is just a BRILLIANT show and I am really glad I was forced to give it a chance and not miss out on this stellar show!"
B000JO9JHW I have read the entire series of Dexter novels and was pleasantly surprised to find out that Showtime has dramatized the series. Ye potential readers and viewers, be aware!! The Showtime series differs from the books in several ways. The ending of the first book and the first series are not the same. The TV version fleshes out the other characters, such as Rita. the girlfriend and the police lieutenant, La Guerta  and introduces a new character in the person of Esme. The book is an intense ride within Dexter's mind with a focus on his relationship with his Dark Passenger. The details of his relationships with other humans are not as detailed as in the series.Having said this, I highly recommend both. It will be interesting to see how Showtime adapts the second novel.I think Showtime has done a great job of casting in this series. I remember Michael Hall from \"Six Feet Under\" and I think he makes a perfect Dexter.Also, CBS is now showing Showtime's Dexter on Sunday evenings at 10 pm. It cuts too much from the Showtime series for my taste, but it is better than most of the junk on TV."
B000JO9JHW If you don't start out liking it keep on watching it gets better. Below are my ratings of each individual season.Season 1: 7/10Season 2: 8/10Season 3: 6/10Season 4: 10/10Season 5: 9/10Season 6: 9/10Season 7: 10/10Season 8 (the final season) is hopefully good."
B000JO9JHW This is absolutely one of the most original series around. No surprise there because Dexter first appeared in  book form (see link below). If someone had told me I would be riveted by a book written from the viewpoint of a serial killer, well...I would never believe it. But Dexter was almost...loveable and he has a certain morality, believe it or not.The series is different but I found it equally intriguing and quirky.Here's the real irony in this series: someone who is so far from having normal human traits, who really doesn't understand love or sexual attraction, can reveal insights into what it means to be human in a way that a more stereotypical series doesn't. It is similar to the way the dark parts of paintings illuminate the light, each complimenting the other. Dexter is dark but he isn't simplistic and he has a wry sense of humor.I was pleased that some of what had attracted me to the books managed to get on screen as well, including Dexter's unique humor and a certain presence that resonates from page to film. That pleased me. What is most amazing to me is how this series actually reverberated emotionally and touched my life in ways I never believed possible, considering the focus of the series.This could have been a flop. It was a brave move to put something like this on the air and I feared (before I saw the first episode) that the depth and complexity of Dexter, hiding beneath that slick, seemingly inhuman surface, would be lost. But my fears were groundless, thank goodnes.Dearly Devoted DexterDexter in the Dark: A NovelDarkly Dreaming Dexter"
B000JO9JHW Always thought serial killers are scum but I kinda like having Dexter around just to even things out, balance the bad with the...whatever."
B000JO9JHW The acting the writing the concept.....it has great replayability as well for viewing a second time. It's like silance of the lambs/six feet under/CSI all rolled into one quality show."
B000JO9JHW 4.7 starsThis show is excellent mainly due to the tight bond Hall makes with this character. I'm not crazy about any of the acting here except Hall's, but he's flawless throughout, bringing a subtlety that few actors on the big or small screens ever master to this degree.Nearly every episode is well-written, paced, and directed; the season arc is a good one and plays out nicely, no need for spoilers here!It does get a little gory at times, but the series is about a serial killer, after all. I have some very queasy thoughts about why a series this twisted is so popular, but I guess it's just another Clint-type revenge drama where psychopathic violence is justified by (a vaguely) moral imperative; we do need our foreign policy to start somewhere.Hall is even better here than in Six Feet Under, where he was superb. He carries Dexter effortlessly on his shoulders, but one can feel the amount of work and care he's put into this role. It's as impressive as Gandolfini's Tony Soprano, and that's saying a lot. As is usual for most of the best cable dramas, the first season seems to be the best, so savor this one if watching it for the first time.Miami hasn't looked this good and this bad since Michael Mann was in town."
B000JO9JHW I love Dexter, who knew being so bad could be so good. love the concept of the show, its something different for me to watch with all the detective shows out there. Would most surely recommend. The show is about a serial killer who only kills bad people and serial killers."
B000JO9JHW The first few seasons really shine, Dexter is a fresh storyline, with suspenseful plots, and great acting.  This show stands head & shoulders above most of what else is out there."
B000JO9JHW Dexter is the most amazing, clever, funny, dark and thrilling program I've almost ever seen.  It is brilliant and unique and interesting and thoroughly enjoyable.  The fact that we can actually like a serial killer is amazing in itself.Michael C Hall is fantastic as Dexter.  He is intelligent, lost, and almost unable to feel love for another human.  The story lines are chilling and keep you on the edge of your seat - you are always guessing.  The writing is superb and witty and smart.  I never read Jeff Lindsays books, but now I think I'll go buy them and read cover to cover.Trust me; this show is one that grabs you and won't let go till the ride is over.  Just when you think you have things figured out, they might take a different turn.  It's addictive and one of the best programs you'll ever see.  It's great and I love this."
B000JO9JHW I loved Michael C. Hall in Six Feet Under so I was excited when he chose to do another cable TV show.  This show turned out to be even better than Six Feet Under.  Michael C. Hall plays a serial killer who kills only bad people.  This creates a moral ambiguity that the show plays up nicely.  Is Dexter a good or bad person?  How do we really feel about him?  How does he really feel about himself?  At the time we are exploring the story, Dexter is evolving from a character who states he lacks human feeling to someone who seems to feel more and more with each passing day (or episode).  The show is brilliantly done.  I've read the book and it is a pretty straight forward story.  To build the story up, the writers of the show build up the characters and made them even deeper characters.  I am just so impressed with the work.  They can even make me angry because I'm so involved and one of my major characters is affected in some way.  I am attracted to Dexter and repelled by him at the same time."
B000JO9JHW Showtime's creative and terrific series of DEXTER is so fresh and uber-cool that we just have to applaud everyone who works on this awesome cable TV series.It is so rare to watch a television show that rivals or even feels like you are reading a rich novel. Usually they screw it up, whether it be Hollywood big screen adaptations of the Sci-Fi channel - they all usually suck eggs.But not Showtime! They are currently way better than HBO. With the richness of feel and look at the miami-based Dexter, the actors and writers here truly shine above most others of all arenas of television and/or Box Office standards.And the 2nd season thus far is just as good - if not better!"
B000JO9JHW Television has been called a vast wasteland. I've heard people rant and rave for years about having so many channels and nothing to watch on TV. And then I started looking at two things. The first was my television watching schedule which has actually begun cutting into my DVD watching schedule (so little time, so much to watch). Then I looked at my shelving unit and noticed the number of TV series collections there. People are wrong. There is plenty good to watch on TV. And DEXTER is an example of it.For those who aren't aware, DEXTER is a series on Showtime, so many of you might not have seen it. If that's the case you're in luck because the series has been released on DVD. While season two has just hit shelves in blu-ray format, the focus here is season one.Dexter Morgan (Michael C. Hall) is a forensics blood splatter expert for the Miami police department. His job is to help collect and understand evidence found at the scene of a crime that involves blood and blood splatter patterns. Oh, and on the side, Dexter is a serial killer.Stay with me here because he's not a bad guy really. Well...then again maybe he is. After all he is a murderer multiple times over. The difference is that Dexter only kills bad guys. Dexter kills murderers, pedophiles, arsonists and the like that got off due to some technicality. But he always verifies that they were guilty before taking them out of the picture.Dexter's foster father Harry (James Remar) was a police man who found Dexter at the scene of a crime before adopting him. Harry recognized the killing instinct found in Dexter at an early age so he helped him to channel that, to use rules that he established for Dexter, to get through life. And via Harry's rules, Dexter now kills bad guys using his job as a means to find just the right victims.So there is the basic set up for the series. But it's so much more than that, filled with layer upon layer of subtext and inner meaning that is revealed as the series progresses.Season one focuses first on letting us know who Dexter is and who the surrounding cast of characters involved with him are. First off is his sister Deb (Jennifer Carpenter), a seemingly spastic patrol officer dying to become a homicide detective. Deb's enthusiasm for the job is off set by her self deprecating ways and the giddiness she exhibits for all things.At the stations there are two main characters who affect Dexter. The first is Lt. Maria Laguerta (Lauren Velez) his direct supervisor who at times seems to have a personal interest in Dexter. A woman who's made it where she is by hard work, she has a storyline of her own involving police office politics as the series progresses.The second is Sgt. James Doakes (Eric King), Dexter's apparent nemesis. Doakes is a hard boiled cop from top to bottom, a no nonsense sort who wants answer and wants them now. Doakes is constantly badgering Dexter, offering everything from name calling to in your face attitude. One would think that eventually the two of them would reach a point where there wouldn't be room for both of them in Miami. One would think.Along with these major players there is an assortment of cast members in the squad who round out the ensemble in the best way possible. And each gets enough screen time in season one to make them a character to care about. The interaction between them on a personal level comes into play as the layers of Dexter unravel.On the personal side, Dexter actually has a girlfriend. Normal on the outside, but not within. It seems Dexter has taken her as his girlfriend to help appear normal. It is through his thoughts (voice over into Dexter's mind runs throughout the series) concerning her that he lets us know he is devoid of emotion, that he has no feelings. His involvement with her is purely as a means to offer him cover.Rita (Julie Bienz) is a battered wife, or at least she was. Dexter's sister was on call when her ex was arrested. Paul, her ex, was a wife beater extreme and a drug user to boot. Now in prison, he gets release part way into season one and a subplot here involving him trying to reinsert himself into his family's life crosses Dexter's life as well.With characters and plot lines established, you would expect the series to kick off with Dexter showing what he can do. Instead, Dexter finds himself in a competition of sorts when a new serial killer hits Miami. And this killer is leaving calling cards that Dexter not only finds discomforting but amazing as well. He's impressed with the style and artistic ability of the killer who leaves his victims in pieces and drained of blood.As each episode continues the tale, we find that this new killer referred to as the Ice Truck Killer (when it's discovered that he uses one to haul victims from their murder location to where he leaves their bodies) knows something about Dexter. He leaves small clues at first for Dexter to find. Eventually he leaves Polaroid's of Dexter's past as well. It seems that the perfect serial killer is being stalked by his own serial killer.Season one not only defines who the character of Dexter is it offers the world he lives in and tosses in his biggest match to boot. How Dexter became who he is and what influences him is told in flashback. His motivations are shown by the end of this season as is the identity of the Ice Truck Killer. But will that change who Dexter is? Doubtful since season four begins soon.What makes this show so unique is that it combines one of the most frightening characters one can imagine, a soul less who cares serial killer, with one of the wittiest funny line spouting people seen on TV. Dexter tosses off subtle one liners non-stop and each one offers a glimpse behind the mask and a laugh as well.But the amazing thing is that not only do we find ourselves repulsed and attracted to the same character, we find in the writing that there is more to him than is even he realizes. The character of Dexter may think he possesses no emotions whatsoever but his emotions run deeper than he realizes. And it seems as though his journey of self revelation may be what's driving the series forward in later seasons.Also Dexter offers something that many of us would never want to admit we seek. An avenging angel out there doing what so many would love to know is going on but at the same time turn their head and condemn on the outside. Like Jack Bauer of \"24\", a hero who uses tactics we claim to hate while hoping someone like him exists to protect us, Dexter is the privately admired solution for those who feel that the worst of criminals are let lose on technicalities. We would fear someone like Dexter while at the same time would love to see someone who doesn't let the bad guy get away with murder. Even though this is what Dexter does, murder.There is no way to offer up in this short space just what it is that Dexter is about. Police procedural. Police politics. Serial killer. Murder mystery. Family complexities. Killing tutorial. Hilarious dark comedy. All are a part of Dexter and all come together in a fantastic package.If you're not afraid to try something a little different, then you need to give Dexter a try. I know the season one set I watch belonged to my son. After watching I intend to get a copy of my own. And to continue with it down the line. I'm already hard at work watching season two on blu-ray to write about. Unusual, quirky, off beat, scary, normal...all are words that define Dexter. And yet none can explain what this series is all about. Watch and see."
B000JO9JHW Who knew a serial killer could be so charming?"
B000JO9JHW Once you watch one, it will be tough to stop watching them. Great mix of having a per episode mystery of sorts and having a season long build-up."
B000JO9JHW Wow! I finally watched my very first episode of \"Dexter\" last weekend, and I ended up finishing Season 1 in its entirety within a few days. This is an amazing show about Dexter (Michael C. Hall), a Miami-based forensics experts who also happens to be a serial killer. However, Dexter is a NICE serial killer in that he has a strict moral code that he always adheres to: He only kills people who are violent criminals themselves and deserve to be punished. The first season of \"Dexter\" revolves around another serial killer that's been terrorizing the state of Florida. The Ice Truck Killer has a nasty habit of murdering prostitutes, cutting them up into pieces, and arranging their bodies artfully in very public places. Dexter works with members of the police department, including his adopted sister, Deb (Jennifer Carter), to find the killer. However, Dexter can't help being fascinated by the Ice Truck Killer's meticulous technique. He soon begins communicating with the killer, who seems to have an uncanny connection to Dexter and starts using his murders to trigger painful, repressed memories from Dexter's past.I became hooked on this show very quickly. Hall is amazing as Dexter, who is probably one of the most complex characters in television history. The supporting cast is excellent, especially Carter, Erik King as Sergeant Doakes (the only person who suspects Dexter of any wrongdoing), and James Remar, who portrays Dexter's father in flashbacks. I'm not particularly fond of Rita's character (portrayed by Julie Benz). She's incredibly wishy-washy, but I can definitely see why Dexter was drawn to someone with her personality. I also think the whole Ice Truck Killer identity revelation, intriguing as it was, could have been a bit less obvious. (I figured out his real identity and true connection to Dexter right away, so either the story was a bit too predictable or I am just incredibly brilliant.)Overall, though, \"Dexter\" is a very unique and compelling show. I have no idea how the program will manage to surpass its first season, but I can't wait to find out."
B000JO9JHW I had never seen Dexter before not having showtime but after seeing the show on a regular station I was hooked and ordered the first season,loved it and am waiting for the second season which I ordered to ship. It's definitely addictive. The show is well written you actually like this serial killer"
B000JO9JHW Sometimes I find connections to Hollywood in the strangest places.  In the case of Dexter, it was at my day job. Now my office job is not normally the place one associates with a show like Dexter, but it turns out that the sister of the guy I worked with worked on the show. The fact that the show is on Showtime and thus can portray gore and violence as appropriate to the medium (like HBO's Rome, for example) piqued my curiosity. Unfortunately, it took me over a year to actually view season one.  I'm sorry I waited so long.I've done enough research on serial killers (and their fictional cousin, slashers) to know that they're easy to mess up.  And an entire season about a serial killer from the serial killer's perspective is fraught with peril. Fortunately, Dexter hits all the right notes to keep an audience engaged for the entire season.Dexter Mogran (Michael C. Hall) is a serial killer with a cause.  His father, Harry (James Remar) recognized his adopted son's homicidal tendencies and trained him to stalk the most despicable of prey.  These were the lowest of the low, the scum that Harry in his job as a cop saw frequently escape justice.  Dexter became a Final Solution of sorts, eliminating people neatly and efficiently while at the same time fulfilling insatiable desire for bloodshed.  Literally.In his day job, Dexter is a blood spatter analyst.  He works side-by-side with his adopted sister, Debra (Jennifer Carpenter), probably the most annoying character in the show.  And yet, she's annoying on purpose - her frail, waif-like reactions to men and the rigors of her job make her alternately pathetic and vulnerable, feral and misguided.  In short, she needs Dexter's calm, creepy presence. Rounding out the cast is career-climbing Maria Laguerta (Lauren Velez), coworkers Angel Batista (David Zayas) and Vince Masuka (C.S. Lee, formerly of the show Chuck) and my favorite character, foul-mouthed Sergeant James Doakes (Erik King).  Doakes is the only person who sees Dexter for what he is, but he can't prove it.Dexter feigns a personal life as well.  He has a girlfriend, Rita Bennett (Julie Benz), whose last relationship was so emotionally scarring that she fears intimacy, which suits Dexter just fine.  Indeed, all of Dexter's life is an act, from the jokes he cracks to the donuts he brings to the pleasantries he exchanges with Rita.  He's a monster masquerading as a person, and the only reason it's not more obvious is because everyone else has more pressing problems.Dexter's job puts him in a unique position to both appreciate the art of the kill and find new victims. Despite his penchant for murdering his victims, Dexter's murders are relatively clean - he drains his victims of blood, hacks the pieces up, and tosses them into the ocean.  And so it goes: find some sleazeball who escaped justice, kidnap him or her, murder, dump the body, repeat. Until one day, another serial killer who seems to know intimate details about Dexter's past begins sending messages through his own unique style of doll-like murders.The ending of season one won't be a shock to observant viewers.  It's not the actual ending that matters but the journey getting there. Dexter's narration is amusing and wry, his cadence just off enough that he comes across as disturbed yet functional. Surprisingly, the show isn't very gory at all.  Dexter would probably be less sympathetic if we were subjected to every grisly detail.  In fact, by cutting away from the most gruesome scenes, Dexter has to remind us that he's one of the bad guys - the Code of Harry is as much the anti-hero's code that we see in a multitude of other crime-fighting shows.  It's a credit to the writers that Dexter is both a monstrous, damaged human being and yet still human.Can't wait for season two!"
B000JO9JHW This is the leader of the pack in terms of Showtime's original series. This is the only show they have that I feel can compete with HBO. The acting and writing are amazing, especially Michael C. Hall (who got an Emmy and Screen Actors Guild nomination for this part).If you can handle the macabre, allow yourself to enter Dexter's world. You might find it hard to leave until the first season is over."
B000JO9JHW Dexter has finally made his Blu-Ray debut, and the glossy, well-made series looks wonderful in the format.  Besides some relatively small BD-Live features (including seeing the first episode the third season), there really isn't anything here that wasn't on the standard-def version of the Complete First Season, but for Blu-Ray owners who haven't taken the plunge into Dexter's world, this is definitely worth checking out.  Below is my original review for first season.The interesting concept of this Showtime series makes it reason enough to check it out.  Michael C. Hall (Six Feet Under) plays the title character, who works in forensics for the Florida police by day, and is a serial killer at night. Because of his job and upbringing by a police officer foster father (James Remar), Dexter knows how to cover his tracks while wearing his mask of humanity by day.  Slowly though, things start to take a turn when another serial killer with connections to Dexter's own mysterious past rears his head, and soon enough our title character is caught in a bloody game of cat and mouse.  What makes Dexter so good is the approach taken to the theme of the series by the creators and Hall himself.  What could have easily flopped and failed miserably instead evolves episode by episode as we attempt to see what makes Dexter tick.  The rest of the cast is excellent as well to say the least. Julie Benz (the vampiric Darla from Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Angel) is superb as Rita: Dexter's rape victim girlfriend whom he keeps around so he doesn't have to bother with sex, HBO's Oz veterans Lauren Velez and David Zayas as fellow cops, and hottie Jennifer Carpenter (whom Hall has recently married, seriously) as Dexter's sister.  Not since Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer has there been an interesting and above all chilling glimpse into the mind of a madman that walks among us.  Spectacular, and definitely worth picking up even if you never caught the show on Showtime during it's first season run."
B000JO9JHW Coming off some serious withdrawals from both Six Feet Under and The Sopranos (the only reason I subscribed to HBO), I took a \"stab\" at Dexter. It took a couple of episodes for me to warm up to the character, but I did.I soon found myself rooting for a serial-killer who works for the cops which, to me anyway, means the writing is pretty good. The setting of post-Miami-Vice Miami is a visually interesting backdrop - although a little too much at times. Dexter has my interest and I'm devouring DVD after DVD as fast as they can be delivered. So far, it's scratchin' my itch for a solid cable series."
B000JO9JHW OK, so the show has some major flaws, its not well written, nor particularly well acted. Dexter is still entertaining and very addictive. It is definitely a &#34;god, its already 1AM, ok , just one more episode&#34; show.Taking a step back after watching it, Dexter is way too capable (getting evidence from the garbage disposal in 3 minutes?), the plot lines are 'predictably unpredictable&#34;...but all the same, put the blinders on and enjoy, I did"
B000JO9JHW I bought this dvd and 5 other seasons on the recommendation of my back doctor. So, far the first episode has been very dry and dull. The second episode picked up nicely. I am up to the fifth episode and still unsure about this show. At times, it's a series about a psychotic serial killer with morals. Other times, it's about a man who has no feelings but shows emotions like anger, frustration and fear. Oh, and there's the relationship between the main character and his damaged girlfriend. Who he feels is as damaged as he is. Now, I do hope these are not considered spoilers, as they are the central focus of the series it seems. There are more things going on in the series, such as his past relationship with his foster father, he relationship with his foster sister, his relationship with his coworkers etc. At this time, I can see the character developing into a very interesting but bizarre person. And of course the series will follow suit. We hope. After all, I have 6 seasons to watch. Can I recommend this series, sort of. I am not quite certain it is for everyone. It's growing on me though. So, I gave it three stars. Perhaps I should give it four, but time will tell.Ralph J. Fitcher."
B000JO9JHW One of the best seasons of Dexter besides 4 and 7 in my opinion. With a great villain and awesome story this was a perfect start for everyone's new favorite serial killer."
B000JO9JHW I guess my biggest complaint about DEXTER is that it isn't nasty ENOUGH.  The premise if phenomenal...Dexter is a blood-spatter expert investigating murders by day and a murdered of killers by night.  By channeling his impulses to kill in a \"helpful\" way...he is actually a hero.  I know, I know, anyone who kills is bad...but seriously, the people Dexter knocks off are mostly brutal serial-killers themselves...killers who knock off children and other innocents.  Dexter is doing the world a favor.  And that's the problem...he is so meticulous in who he kills that his dark side is really never more than a naughty wink.  There's no real ethical dilemma for the viewer in rooting for Dexter.But don't get me wrong...the show is a blast nonetheless.  From it's super-saturated Florida colors, to its sly & witty narration, the show is top-notch and very entertaining.  Michael C. Hall is perfect as DEXTER.  While his performance isn't exactly a tour-de-force of evil (like Anthony Hopkins in SILENCE OF THE LAMBS, for example)...it is a lovely, inventive performance.  He brings nuance to the role of a guy who has to fake smiling...and because we know he's faking, we're kinda in on the joke.  We can be \"amused\" along with Dexter at his ability to fool most of society into liking him.The only true \"dark side\" to Dexter is his inability to love.  He has a girlfriend, but only to help himself look normal.  He is very good to her and her kids, and the poor girl (damaged from a previous, abusive marriage) just adores Dexter in return.  But he doesn't really have feelings for her, and this colors all their scenes together.  This is the ethical quandary that I wish Dexter's killings also had.The other thing I really like about the show are the flashbacks, showing Dexter being raised and groomed for his work by a very understanding foster father, who happens to be a cop.  James Remar plays this part so well...it's probably the best role this long-time character actor has ever had.  It's a small part, but he brings great strength to it.  And great love and concern for Dexter.  You always hear that parents will do ANYTHING to protect their kids...Remar's character is the ultimate example of this.Also, the opening credits of the show are AWESOME!!  Creepy and clever.So, while the show, to me, isn't perfect (I would prefer it a little darker), it is still HUGELY entertaining, well-acted by its lead and well-filmed for a relatively low budget.  If it sounds like your cup of tea, I think you'll like it a lot.  If the basic premise turns you off...then don't even bother watching!"
B000JO9JHW Season one sets the tone, pace and wildly engrossing phenomenon known as 'Dex'; a doughnut buying, deftly sincere serial killer who lives by a code.I'm often asked 'how can you watch a show about a serial killer?&#34; Easy, if the plots are interwoven, the circumstances bizarre and the outcomes unpredictable. I hope it stays off network TV, they don't deserve Dexter."
B000JO9JHW I love this show. It definitely creates a yin and yang to the serial killer persona. Plan on ordering the other seasons. Item arrived on time, packaged well and as expected."
B000JO9JHW Honestly was surprised how watching a serial killer who kills other serial killers sucks a person into the show so easily."
B000JO9JHW To this day I still believe the 1st season is still the best season out of all the dexters. The future seasons tend to drag on too much and dexter doesn't get enough kills by taking out bad people from the world. The first season has nearly one bad person in each episode that dexter eliminates but as the season progresses to 2,3,4,5,6 etc you find that Dexter starts to get bored and is surrounded by so much life drama bull crap that he can't even kill anymore bad guys!"
B000JO9JHW ...I dont know what it is.  It would be easy to drop the ball on this subject and make a bad series.  It is, after all, something that most people (fortunately) have little knowledge about, and it could attempt to be written for the masses, and \"dumbed-down\".  But its not.Dexter is chilling, but in an informative, eye-opening way that a good documentary does.  Michael C. Hall, who I thought was pretty wooden in Six Feet Under, plays the conflicted sociopath brilliantly.  A strong supporting cast strengthens and already strong show.I realize that being sympathetic to a seriel killer seems counter-intuitive, but it is the intelligence of the writers that draws you in to Dexter's world.  You ALMOST feel bad for the guy for the hand he's been dealt, and SOMEWHAT admirable for the way he's made lemonade out of his life's lemons.This show couldn't exist on network TV, and like many other \"rawer\" shows, needs a lot of room to run.  I'm interested to see how far they can take this series from a consistency standpoint, but if S2 and S3 are a fraction of S1's quality, I'll be there for the ride."
B000JO9JHW This Showtime series stars Michael C. Hall as a sociopathic serial killer who targets only individuals he feels deserve his attention because of loopholes in the justice system.  Dexter is an expert on crime- scene blood splatters.  We often see him at crime scenes as the police and forensic experts put together how a crime was committed.Dexter is a sullen, strange guy who does his job well but has trouble relating to people.  In Season One, we learn his backstory.  His father, sensing an unnatural desire in his son to kill, councils the boy on how to channel his feelings so that innocent people aren't harmed.  These scenes reminded me of a superhero \"origins\" tale.  Depending on how you look at it, Dexter is either a hero who rids society of reprehensible, murderous villains, or an elusive criminal whose killing rampage must be stopped.  One thing, however, is certain.  Dexter is very cool, and is unlike any character on television.  Hall heads a fine cast in a sort of \"Law and Order\" series with a touch of the Grand Guignol.  Blu-ray bonus extras include the featurettes \"The Academy of Blood - A Killer Course\" and \"Witnessed in Blood - A True Murder Investigation,\" and the first episode of \"Dexter,\" Season Three."
B000JO9JHW Dexter Morgan - blood Spatter Expert and Serial Killer. He's been living a double life for a while now and has kept that paart of himself shelves and out of the way. The only person who knew was someone from his past, and that person taught him a great many things on staying alive in such a mad world. Dexter also has a squad of people aroudn him you will get to know, a sister you will get to know even more, and a case you will grow to love featuring The Ice Truck Killer. In this episode we see Dexter (and see the overlap better book 1 and this season) and the way he sees blood, not to mention the Dark Passenger. We also see the ITK and the way he kills and the way Dexter admires the person's style.Its like living in Dahlmerland - that's how the book put it - except there are no rides (thank goodness).M.C. Hall is the PERFECT Dexter. After 3 seasons of him I can say he is the reason that Dexter connects with people and is not a monster to us. Watch the show - you will see. Jennifer C - his sister Deb - is also a unique personality here and you will grow to enjoy her. She has a sailor's mouth and keeps in shape and loves to pick the wrong type of people. She plays it to a tee. And the rest of the cast are great as well and, if you think you know how it all ends because you read the book, you are wrong. The book and this are different in a lot of ways AND the end is a strong part of it. So, readers, watch this as well.Closing this up, the twists and turns are great and learning about Dexter's past is a wild ride. You learn a lot in this season, too, and you see how Dexter was \"made.\" You also see other things, bits that are spooky and the things he does away with, making you wonder exactly what the Dark Passenger is doing riding shotgun with Dexter.So many rules - so many graves. He is in the perfect place to be himself, that's for sure."
B000JO9JHW A Showtime production, Dexter is an anomaly.  It is a brilliantly written, intriguing, and totally engrossing series, that is seldom predictable.  Besides a compelling storyline, and characters that seem real, what makes the series even more unique, is that the protagonist, Dexter Morgan (Michael C. Hall), a blood spatter expert for the Miami police, is a cold blooded murderer.Hall's unusual role is the key to the series, and his performance is a riveting, and captivating character study, that makes Dexter a very hard show to turn away from.  Morgan is guided by the `Code of Harry'.  Harry (James Remar) was Dexter's adoptive father, an ex-cop who recognized that his traumatized son, had homicidal tendencies.  To help him survive, Harry trained Dexter to channel his desire to kill in a 'positive' direction, by instilling the directive to kill only those who truly deserve to die.  This twisted morality is quite bizarre, and makes for fascinating viewing, as Dexter kills ceremoniously.Presumably to contain any spilled blood, plastic sheeting is typically spread all around the area, and Dexter himself is also covered with plastic sheeting.  Victims are taped down naked to a table top face up, helpless and unable to move.  After drawing a blood sample for his collection, Dexter gets to work.  The dead body is chopped into pieces, and the remains placed in trash bags.  Few of the grisly details are actually shown, but the presentation is still pretty chilling.  The series has a wicked sense of humor, as Dexter discusses his thoughts through narration, as he nonchalantly goes about his business, which includes murder.  Harry is dead, but appears frequently, in flashbacks.  Harry's biological daughter Debra (Jennifer Carpenter), also works for the Miami PD in homicide.  She is eager, enthusiastic, loves to swear, and has a problem with authority.The twelve episodes play like a chapters in a book.  Unlike most weekly series, the format does not always involve solving a particular case within the episode.  Instead, the story unfolds broadly and more naturally, with information about Dexter and his past, coming in small bits.  Dexter is dealing with coming to terms with his emotions, or lack thereof, and watching how this affects the evolution of his relationship with his girlfriend Rita (Julie Benz), is fascinating.  Benz's performance is pretty amazing, playing an abused woman trying to start a new relationship.The central underlying story concerns a serial killer known as `Ice Truck Killer', who specializes in neatly slicing up his victim's bodies into bloodless pieces.  The whole concept is diabolically macabre, and well executed.  The killer has taken a special interest in Dexter, and tension and suspense grows more intense, after the killer's identity is revealed with a few episodes left to go.  The killer has an elaborate plan, though he is forced to improvise when the pursuit begins to close in.  As Dexter begins to recall the horrific circumstances surrounding his mother's death, the killer makes his play.  The writing is outstanding, and keeps you off balance.  Approaching the conclusion, things get a little shaky in the turn, but control is reacquired, and Dexter finishes wildly and dramatically, with a stylistic flourish that does not cheat the viewer.Dexter is refreshingly different from most forensic procedurals.  Although dealing with violence and death, there isn't a lot of fighting, shootouts, or chases.  The focus is on character and story development.  While there are things that go over the top, or are illogical, unlike programs like the CSI franchise, the level of drama isn't routinely pumped up by threats, flashy violence, condescending dialog, or music.  The police in Dexter work `normally', with no overly dramatic background music, while routine tasks like, processing the crime scene, performing tests, or analyzing evidence take place.  The level of acting by almost everyone involved is excellent, from the minor characters to the leads.  The writing is not perfect, but the characters and their dialog, are mostly credible, showing the audience some respect.  There are no long winded pretentious speeches sprouting psychobabble, phony overdramatic situations, and characters trying to top each other, or engaging in supercop behavior.  Criminal Minds or CSI Miami, this is not.The series is far from perfect, and doesn't escape being ridiculous.  While a darkened room, draped with plastic sheeting, with a naked victim tapped down helpless, is a terrifying scene, it makes little sense, unless Dexter has giant rolls of plastic sheeting, and maybe a case of packing tape in his car.  The time it would take to actually prepare the scene, and put up all that sheeting would be ridiculous.  Tape and plastic sheeting are excellent for retaining evidence like fingerprints, would have to be destroyed.  Dexter disposes a couple of bags of body parts per kill, but what happens to all that tape and plastic sheeting?  Over the course of the season, Dexter takes chances, makes mistakes, and has several close calls, and is clearly under suspicion, at the conclusion, setting the stage for the next season.One of the few negatives is the lack of subtitles, and the inappropriateness of the extras.  Two episodes have commentary tracks, but some of the other bonus materials, are not directly related to the series.  The mini-documentary Witnessed in Blood, covers the forensics for an unrelated criminal case.  And two episodes of Showtime's series Brotherhood are included, presumably as an attempt to promote that series.  More material specifically relevant to Dexter, would certainly have been preferred.  Otherwise, needless to say, the series is highly recommended to fans of the forensic crime genre."
B000JO9JHW I was hooked after the first episode.  I love the concept: a blood splatter expert who seconds as a serial killer that preys upon other serial killers.  Michael C. Hall seems as if he was born to play the role of Dexter.  Every season there seems to be one central character that Dexter must hunt down, amongst various other serial killers and murders that end up getting chopped up on his table.  This season follows Dexter&#8217;s pursuit of the Ice Truck Killer&#8212;a sadistic serial killer that chops bodies into pieces after draining all of their blood.  He&#8217;s named the Ice Truck Killer because it is believed that he drives around in an ice truck before dumping the bodies off.  Great pilot season.  If you have not seen this show, this is definitely one you do not want to miss."
B000JO9JHW This isn't one of those shows or movies about a serial killer who just does it for fun.  Dexter Morgan targets people very specifically and only those whom he believes have crossed a line or violated one of his standards.  For example, Dex would never molest or kill a child, so he kills a man who has done such things to choir boys.  This is not a defense of Dex, just a clarification.What makes him even more complex is that he did not suffer abuse at the hands of his loving foster parents; he maintains a good relationship with his sister, a cop; he works as a forensic examiner for the police; he fakes emotions as best he can with  his girlfriend and her kids; and feels nothing at all, most of the time, unless it's a sense that he must get rid of someone.Michael C. Hall's performance and voiceover work are very strong. He's stretched out further than he could with his character on the late, great Six Feet Under."
B000JO9JHW If you're reading this you either are 1) a fan of the show 2) want to know more about it to see if it will appeal to you. Michael C. Hall (\"Six Feet Under\") plays Dexter a vigilante serial killer. By day Dexter works as a splatter analyst in the police department using blood patterns to help determine exactly how a crime occurred.We have a true anti-hero as the focus of the series--a serial killer who almost seems to have a conscience because he focuses on dealing out justice (and focusing his urges)to those he feels are evil. His father a police officer instilled a code to help him direct his \"urges\" and distinguish between good and evil.Showtime has attempted to improve the quality of their shows and their DVD releases with some mixed results. I found the image quality to be anything but subpar for a DVD. It's a very good transfer. Is it high definition? No, but this isn't an HD-DVD and the quality for a standard DVD is very good although there are some digital compression issues that crop up occasionally.The one complaint I have is simple--no chapter indexing where you can see specific scenes for each episode. Sure you can skip through it by hitting the next button but it's kind of unusual in this day and age for new shows to NOT have this. The second is minor and others have pointed it out--the menu is a very basic design that looks like it could have been done by an amateur.You also have to reset audio for each disc as you watch it for 5.1 as it automatically defaults to 2.o. To be sure many of these are minor points but they do contribute to the enjoyment of the show if handled well.The special features are an improvement over some previous Showtime series but far from perfect. We get two episodes of the excellent Showtime drama \"Brotherhood\". We also get \"Witnessed in Blood - A True Murder Investigation\" a very good featurette that focuses on splatter analysis and what it reveals about a murder. It ties in to \"Dexter\" because that's what Dexter does for a living on the show and it also helps him to break a number of cases. We also get a commentary track that I haven't listened to yet as well as an online link to watch two episodes of the new Showtime series \"The Tudors\" and a pdf file with the first two chapters of the new Dexter novel. I suspect that \"The Academy of Blood: A Killer Course\" is along with the DEXTER novel excerpt buried in the DVD-Rom portion of the disc. You won't be able to watch it or access it on a regular DVD player which is just plain sloppy as this isn't indicated on the package.We also get biographies for the actors. While the extras here (including two commentary tracks on the set are very good, the show could have used more commentary tracks and the involvement of star Michael C. Hall on at least one of them. Also, the special features really need to be more clearly indicated as to whether they are DVD accessible, PC accessible and where you might find them on the disc.Minor Plot Spoilers:Dexter's father a police officer recognized early on his son's proclivities and tried to give him moral guidence and boundaries so that he can function in our world but, more importantly, use his \"skills\" to hunt down those that prey on others.Dexter is conflicted--he knows that he's not normal and he also knows he doesn't fit in (he has difficulty with emotions having to fake his way through it). He also recognizes what he is and how his father tried to shape him into something \"better\".When he goes toe-to-toe with the Ice Truck Murderer and tries to track down this nasty serial killer he gets a glimpse into his own soul but also recognizes that unlike his evil doppleganger he can choose his actions and not just act on his instincts.END OF PLOT SPOILERS:Overall, Dexter is a terrific show. The second season has also gotten off to a bold start. The first season used the novel DARKLY DREAMING DEXTER as a starting point. For the second season the writers/producers have chosen to depart from the novels which should make for an interesting move. This is a solid set that could be improved with future seasons."
B000JO9JHW \"Dexter\" is built on an intriguing premise: a man with antisocial personality disorder experiences murderous impulses but lives by a code - he can only kill murderers.  Kind of a twisted play on Freud's concept of sublimation.  The series didn't initially appeal to me, b
B000JQYE4I This series is absolutely one of the best cop shows I have ever seen.  One reason is because Vick goes beyond what is dictated by the law and this is what a lot of citizens would do if they had the chance.  At first I couldn't decide if he was a good cop or a bad cop but by the end of the series I came to believe that he is just a mix of both.I can not really rate season 5 by it's self because I actually do not see any difference in any of the seasons.  They are every one a spell binding, can't wait till I see the next one kind of a series.  One of the things that make it outstanding is that they don't use an episode as a stand alone show.  There are plots that continue through many episodes and mini plots that get solved in one episode.My wife and I stayed up way past our normal bedtimes many nights because we kept saying... lets watch just one more!"
B000JQYE4I Vic and the crew are a good ensemble cast who have so much going on in their lives you wonder how they'll pull it off"
B000JQYE4I Each episode builds the crescendo of anticipation of how Mackey and his Strike Force is going to out-do the previous episode of ball busting and head knocking."
B000JQYE4I I have watched all six seasons and I am about to finish the series.  Every episode keeps you on the edge of your seat.  The roller coaster ride is never ending and I am going to miss the series when I finish.  I wish that there was something to take it's place.  Michael Chiklis and the rest of the cast step out of the story and grab you by the shirt and never let go."
B000JQYE4I This series is one of the classics of all time. The characters are unforgettable and painted from  the broad strokes of good and evil and many shades in between.  The themes are here to examine the human condition on so many levels that at times it makes your head spin, particularly when you compare it to todays events. What a show!!!!"
B000JQYE4I Good writing and acting make this show engaging season after season.  At the end of each you wonder where it could possibly go next, and yet the writing team always pulls it off."
B000JQYE4I I loved this show. I had never heard of it until recently and I'm glad I started watching it. Addicting."
B000JQYE4I A great series and this season turned everything upside down. Mackey and his crew are under fire and Forrest Whitaker is out to get them and bring them down. This was was one of the most emotional and shocking seasons ever for this great show. A must buy series if you love cop dramas. This is the best cop show. It is dark and it pulls no punches. Once you watch it you will want to see more. Show will have you hooked."
B000JQYE4I Season five sees the strike team under investigation yet again.  You know the writing is good when you want the do anything it takes cops to succeed. While every episode is great there will be some big shockers at the end of the season. I am really glad I have the chance to catch up on this well written if gritty show."
B000JQYE4I Season 5 takes a turn with the introduction of Forest Whitaker as LT Jon Kavanaugh.  Prior to his departure, Kavanaugh had been tasked by Captain Aceveco to find the dirt on Vic.  Hellbent and determined, Kavanaugh does his best to do so.I don't know whether it was his character, his acting or the side story, but I didn't like the introduction of Kavanaugh to the series.  Sure, I believe many think the introduction may have been needed, but the subplot was often way too distracting."
B000JQYE4I Since this has been out for a while, and if you're researching season 5, hopefully you've already seen the 4 before it, I'll make it short.I've seen every episode of The Shield, and the finale of this season is one of the best episodes of TV - of ANY show - that I've ever seen.I think it's the second best season (second only to season 1) that this show has ever had.If you're a fan of the show, what are you waiting for?"
B000JQYE4I I own all seven seasons of The Shield; if you like the show, this was one of the better seasons."
B000JQYE4I Great show always full of action and on the go. Its not a show for kids and some adults may find it offensive but if you can get past that you wont want to miss the next episodes."
B000JQYE4I This season was good, but not up to par with previous seasons, partially because it was only 11 episodes long.Synopsis of the season: Jon Kavanaugh (Forest Whitaker) has been brought in to check on the Strike Team. He goes after Lem and tries to get him to turn on the rest of the team. The main story is basically the team trying to keep Lem out of jail. There's also some cameos of Anthony Anderson as Antwon Mitchell. Also, Danni is pregnant, Billings has become Captain, Julian is partnered with a new trainee, and Claudette and Dutch's relationship is strained due to a secret she is keeping from Dutch."
B000JQYE4I Great show lots of suspense good acting keeps you Awake and goes quick fast pace show to bad it's off the air"
B000JQYE4I I gave this rating due to a lot of reasons, one being the level of excitement to keep you wanting more, the other for how the series so far turned out."
B000JQYE4I If you purchase this DVD, make sure you watch the extras on disc 4. Forest Whitaker discusses how the Kavanaugh character was conceived as someone who \"becomes\" Mackey as he pursues him, and you will certainly see a transformation over the course of Season 5's eleven episodes. It would be very easy to over-hype Whitaker's contribution if it weren't so spot-on perfect. On DVD 4, series creator Shawn Ryan states that he wanted Whitaker for this character and there \"was no second choice.\" If you remember the famous 1998 episode of NYPD Blue called \"Raging Bulls,\" in which Dennis Franz's Sipowicz and James McDaniel's Lt. Fancy come to explosive blows after a long, slow simmer, imagine what happens immediately after Kavanaugh asks Mackey in a rage-filled voice \"Are you happy NOW...Detective Mackey?\" There was a strong undercurrent of racial tensions between the NYPD Blue characters, which led (in a large part) to them both reaching the breaking point, but Mackey and Kavanaugh are not at odds with each other because of their ethnicity. Over the course of the entire season, the subject is never approached and it is not a relevant detail in the conflict. They're two men who began with the right motives and slowly let their circumstances determine their mission. There are mixed opinions surrounding the Glenn Close \"Capt. Rawling\" story arc experiment from Season 4. In a few short days, Whitaker is back for a second season as Kavanaugh, and the events of Season 5 were grounded more in risk taking than stunt scripting. The Shield is a brutal, intensely creative show with one of the best casts and creative teams on TV. By creating synergy with the events laid out in the pilot episode (and multiple references in the \"extras\" portion of the set to \"Shakespearean\" drama), it's clear that this series aims very, very high and more often than not hits the target."
B000JQYE4I At the close of the fourth season of the Shield, there was reason for celebration.  As season five begins, not much seems to have changed.  Corrupt cop Vic Mackey (Michael Chiklis) and his Strike team are back together again, Antwon Mitchell (Anthony Anderson) is in prison, Rawling is gone, Aceveda (Benito Martinez) seems out of reach; it seems like it's business as usual.  Then everything changes.  Enter Forest Whitaker as Jon Kavanaugh, an IAD lieutenant who is making it his sole purpose in life to bring Vic down.  His method: using Lem (Kenny Johnson) as a blackmail tactic to rat out Vic.  But as we learn as the season progresses, not only do things not go as planned, but everything comes to a shocker of a conclusion that will have you beating the walls in anticipation for the sixth season.  Also going on during the season are a variety of things: Julian (Michael Jace) breaks in a new partner (Paula Garces) because Danny (Catherine Dent) is pregnant, Wyms (CCH Pounder) looks to take another shot at being the Captain, and Shane (Walt Goggins) makes a choice that will alter the course of the show forever.  As the credits roll after the season finale, it is clear that the end is quite near, which is bittersweet in a way, because if it's one thing that Shawn Ryan's gritty cop drama has proved, it's that prime time cable TV can be nothing less than spectacular."
B000JQYE4I THE WRITING AND THE ACTING ARE SUPERB. IT JUST KEEPS GETTING BETTER. THE BALANCE BETWEEN GOOD COP AND REALLY EVIL COP IS ALWAYS SURPRISING. IN SPITE OF ONESELF ONE ROOTS FOR THE BAD GUYS BECAUSE THEY ARE THE ONES WHO WOULD LEAP INTO FLAMES TO RESCUE A VICTIM. THE BUILDUP OPF SUSPENSE MAKES BINGE WATCHING ALMOST A NECESSITY. AGAIN, MY ONLY CAVILS ARE THE EXPLICIT SEX AND NUDITY WHICH ARE GRATUITOUS AND NOT NECESSARY IN AN OTHERWISE SUPERB SERIES."
B000JQYE4I Good show.  You get attached to the character's.  Not what expected in a cop type show.  Watching all the seasons on amazon prime has been great."
B000JQYE4I This show isn't about feelings, but one of the best scenes in tv history makes two actors at the end really stretch their credentials. Shane and Lem really pull it off. The noose starts tightening for the strike team and their cheating ways."
B000JQYE4I If you have watched the previous 4 seasons you wont be disappointed with season 5. The characters are expanded upon and some new ones are introduced to keep things fresh."
B000JQYE4I They hit a slump here. I also think they really miss Glenn Close. When she joined the show the number of viewers went up 30%. With her gone the show really struggles."
B000JQYE4I I started at the beginning and am working my way through watching every season - when it first came out I did not think I would like it and now I am hooked - great acting and entertainment!!"
B000JQYE4I Vic continues to walk on thin ice and make it to the other side.  A fond farewell to Lem.  We will miss you in Season 6."
B000JQYE4I Another season demonstrating the mix of good and not so good that makes up all people.  Adults only please - not a show for the kiddies or the timorous."
B000JQYE4I My two favorite shows of the past ten years have been \"The Sopranos\" and \"The Shield.\"  As \"The Sopranos\" limps into its final season--let's face it, that show hasn't had the same compelling intensity since its first three incredible seasons--\"The Shield\" is still kicking major butt.The quality has never let up and I would highly recommend that you watch every season from the very beginning.  The writing is so inventive and the acting is just dynamite.I can't wait to see where they're going with this!"
B000JQYE4I All roads for Vic Mackey (Emmy winner Michael Chiklis) lead to this. After Mackey killed Terry Crowley during the first season of \"The Shield\" karma was going to catch up with him sooner than later and now the Strike Team is under I.A.D. investigation by Jon Kavanaugh (Oscar winner Forrest Whitaker). Mackey seemed on the road to redemption during the fourth season when the new captain (Glenn Close)gave him the chance to reassemble his team and make a difference in the Farmington police district. The investigation that she instigated which was designed to exonerate members of her team has turned into crusade where Kavanaugh will use any and all teams to bring down Mackey and his team.By the fifth season of \"The Shield\" I was afraid the show would jump the shark--in fact it has done anything but that with writing that is still among the best on TV with morally complex characters sporting shades of gray to their personalities vs. being simple black and white caricatures of good guys and bad guys. Chiklis proves as he has over the last four seasons to be one of the best actors on TV with his complex portrayal of Mackey. Chiklis though wouldn't be where he is without the terrific supporting cast. During the fifth season Mackey's nemesis begins to resemble him as he tries to bring down Mackey and his team. Mackey may be morally corrupt person but there is still a decent person buried somewhere within his soul which allows fans of the series to be rooting for him even if he is often the bad guy (hey, he killed a cop in the first episode of the first season!).The show looks grainy and dark which benefits the cinema verite/documentary look of the show with its handheld cameras and unexpected pans. As always Dutch(Jay Karnes) and Claudette (CCH Pounder)continue to be the moral center and conscience of the show and as fascinating as Mackey and his team are, these two detectives are equally as fascinating as they bring down a serial killer with perfect alibies and other difficult to crack cases. The politically astute former Captain of the station David Aceveda (Benito Martinez)continues to have a darkness to his \"moral\" character particularly after the physical assualt at the hands of an ex-con that occurred during the third season.The DVD has some great special features including commentary tracks with a nice mix of cast members, a featurette on the productio of the fifth season, a tribute to executive producer/director Scott Brazil who died during the sixth season and a Q&A; session with Chiklis, producer/writer/creator Shawn Ryan and Forrest Whitaker discussing their characters and the development of the series. We also get deleted scenes as well as the sixth season \"prequel\" that sets up season six.The seventh season (which will air this spring)is reportedly the last season for the show so if you've caught the bug for \"The Shield\" but fallen behind in watching the show, now you can spent time either catching the reruns or watching the DVDs in plenty of time for season seven.Highly recommended."
B000JQYE4I Every episode was great!"
B000JQYE4I Gritty action and lots of it.I detest crooked cops but these guys made you feel for them.Beware lots of blood...."
B000LVIIUC As a brand name, as a product, I trust South park to deliver entertainment quality more than any other.  the Simpsons were great at one time, but the tired series drags on, so DVD's of its latter years are as tired as its writing staff.  South Park on the other hand is as vibrant as it ever was.  The incredibly audacious creators of the series are the two most insolent creeps to ever blacken a studio.  However, funny is funny.  Moreover, whereas the Simpsons do not make many polical points (being in prime time on network tv), South Park makes few shows that do NOT have political points.  They skewer virtually everyone.  Who else would show Gene Siskel, the harmless affable film critic,and JFK, in hell?  They are at their best when WE are at our worst.  As we cower before threats from overseas, they did a brilliant piece about literally putting your head in the sand."
B000LVIIUC With season 10 the South Park creators set out to give us something that would challenge the creators of Family Guy and would set out in challenging those who like the Family Guy comedy. They also set out in making a point about the whole showing an image of the Prophet Muhammad on national TV, they set out in making a point about freedom of expression and not allowing terror threats to scare them. Did they win that war? You'll have to watch this season to find out.Episode 1: The Return of Chef: In this episode we see Chef return to South Park after a time with the Super Adventure Club who we later learn that they are a group of explorers that show a special interest in the children of remote tribes. The boys have to cope with this change in Chef and the influence that the Super Adventure Club had on him. In reality this is the episode where we say goodbye to Chef for good, as in season 9 South Park had an episode called Trapped in the Closet which made fun of the \"Religion\" of Scientology. Isaac Hayes who was the voice of Chef is a Scientologist, he seemed to hold a double standard when making fun of religion. It's OK to make fun of Christianity, Judaism, Mormonism etc but as long as you don't make fun of Scientology it's OK but if you do then Hayes said goodbye to South Park. This is an amazing episode and is really enjoyable listening to Chef speak as it's chopped together dialogue from previous episodes.Episode 2: Smug Alert: \"I know, for this episode let's make fun of those people who drive environmentally friendly cars and suddenly think they're better than everybody else.\" This is what Stone & Parker would have thought when coming up with the idea for this episode as they do just that. They pick up on the smugness of these people and tear them apart which is a very intelligent move by the creators. The story is simple; Gerald, Kyles dad is now the owner of a hybrid car and he suddenly feels it's his duty to insult those who have gas gusler cars. Gerald moves the family to San Francisco where everybody drives a Hybrid, but Stan being upset with this decides to write a song that will encourage more people to buy Hybrids which should get Kyle to come back home. This is a great episode with a great message about those people who to drive the hybrid cars, it takes the subject and says to those people \"I know you drive them, and I don't care.\"Episode 3 & 4: Cartoon Wars Part 1 & 2: This is an episode that stirred up a lot of controversy as these two episodes were based around the whole image of Muhammad hysteria that was surrounding the media at the time. Stone & Parker had made the episodes with the clear intention of Comedy Central showing the image on TV and setting an example about freedom of speech but unfortunately it wasn't to be. The story of the episodes are that Family Guy are set to show an image of Muhammad in one of their episodes; Cartman being utterly offended by this sets out to put an end to Family Guy once and for all but he has one obstacle; Kyle. These are a great set of episodes that just rip Family Guy to pieces when talking about their comedy, the whole notion of Family Guy being written my Manatees is brilliant and when you really give it some thought you start to think to yourself, \"Well maybe this is possible.\"Episode 5: A Million Little Fibers: This is by far the weakest episode of the bunch as it's an episode focusing directly on Towelie. He decides to write a book about his life but everything keeps going wrong and he can't get his book published because he's a towel. He assumes a human personality and changes his book around which becomes an instant success and Oprah Winfrey wants to put her name on this book. This is really one of the weakest episodes out of them all and I think was just a filler to get to the next great idea.Episode 6: Manbearpig: This is the typical insult episode that rips apart Al Gore over the movie he made called an Inconvenient Truth, it makes fun of the whole \"Look at me I'm an ex-president trying to keep the limelight\" that seems to surround Al Gore. He has a new theory in South Park and that's a monster that will be a danger to everyone, Manbearpig. Half man, half bear and half pig, he can't prove it but he's super serial.Episode 7: Tsst: I honestly don't think I've ever laughed so much at a South Park episode, Cesar Milan of the Dog Whisperer fame is called in to take control of Cartman and his bad behaviour. Using some techniques that would only usually be performed on Dogs, Cartman isn't happy about being humiliated and resorts to making some drastic plans for revenge.Episode 8: Make Love, Not Warcraft: Everybody has them, everybody has that one friend who would quite openly admit that they would rather spend the day on World of Warcraft than go outside and play. Parker and Stone set out to make fun of these kids and show them that they need to get out more, some people may find it harsh but some people like myself would find it utterly hysterical.Episode 9: Mystery of the Urinal Deuce: The world's biggest conspiracy of all time will finally be uncovered when Eric Cartman exposes the true culprit behind the September 11th attacks. How will that person prove his innocence and who really was behind 9/11. This is a funny episode that gives a big slap in the face of the conspiracy theorists, I can't help but think that Parker and Stone wanted to give their opinions on the subject in this episode rather than just be intelligent about it.Episode 10: Miss Teacher Bangs A Boy: Eric Cartman is selected to become South Park elementary schools hall monitor, so he dons the look of a bounty hunter and sets out to clean up the halls. He accidentally stumbles upon a teacher in a relationship with a student and wants to put a stop to it. A very good episode with some strong home truths.Episode 11: Hell On Earth 2006: Satan is throwing the biggest Halloween costume party ever, and no one will be admitted without a wristband. Every detail must be perfect for the prince of darkness. But even Satan can't foresee everything. A prominent religious organization, an ex-lover and the antics of the most notorious serial killers of all time threaten Satan's fun. A complete slaughtering of the my Super Sweet 16 girls which I personally feel was long overdue from the South Park guys.Episode 12: Go God Go Part 1: South Park Elementary faces strong opposition to the topic of evolution being taught to the 4th graders. The most vocal protests are from Ms. Garrison who has to teach it. Eric Cartman can't be bothered with what's going on in class. He's busy manipulating his own personal time-line to align with the precise release date of the Nintendo Wii. A great satirical episode that this time doesn't poke fun at the notion of religion but pokes fun at a world without religion, would we all really get along like Richard Dawkins says we would?Episode 13: Go God Go Part 2: Last week Eric Cartman froze himself in an attempt to make his three-week wait for a hot, new, gaming device pass quickly. A freak accident landed him over 500 years in the future and now he's stuck there. The future is a tumultuous place with warring factions, angry sea otters and no Nintendo. Will Cartman find a way back to his own time? A humorous look on a future without religion, how would we find a way to keep fighting if we don't have the excuse of religion.Episode 14: Stanley's Cup: Stan Marsh has hit rock bottom. He's got no job, no bicycle and his only way out of a bad situation, is to coach the local pee wee hockey team. Once a hotshot pee wee hockey player himself, Stan Marsh has tried to put those days behind him. But he's still living with the memory of how let his team down when he missed the winning shot in the big game. Now, he's about to find out that being a coach means facing your past. He's determined to show his kids what it's like to be a winner! Personally I didn't understand this episode and it wasn't very good, the whole children having cancer thing I think was simply for shock value.A really good season with two 2 parters that would have you thinking and laughing at the same time which is a trademark of South Park."
B000LVIIUC South Park is about the only consistently dependable TV show and the \"Go God Go\" 2-parter carries all the hallmarks of the franchise's best episodes. Somehow the A and B plots of this story involve an impatient Cartman freezing himself into the future because he can't wait 3 weeks to play a Nintendo Wii, Mr(s) Garrison dating Richard Dawkins, and an atheistic future war involving humans and otters. If you're a South Park fan, this is a must-watch episode."
B000LVIIUC These guys don't pull any punches and that is why I love this show so much. This is another great season with up to the moment topics on real life! With all the pussyfooting around these days, this is a breath of fresh air....even after 10 seasons!"
B000LVIIUC OK, there are a few episodes in this season that are a little much.  The social/political satire is still as strong as ever but the episodes are stretching more to make their points.  Instead of being absurdly funny and clever, some of these episodes are just absurd and go out of their way to say, \"Look at me, look how shocking I am\" (\"The Return of Chef,\" \"Smug Alert!,\" \"A Million Little Fibers,\" \"Stanley's Cup\").  Still, this season offers what I believe is the greatest SP episode of all-time and maybe the best thing I have ever seen on television: \"Make Love Not Warcraft.\"  This episode is so well-done in animation (yes, excellent SP animation) and story-writing that I cannot praise it enough.  Plus, it includes music from one of my favorite singers ever: Paul Stanley!  Then there are the excellent two-parters when Cartman goes to the future (Mrs. Garrison and that scholar guy are hilarious!) and  \"Cartoon Wars\" where SP takes on Family Guy with references to other animated shows. \"Miss Teacher Bangs A Boy\" takes the female teacher/boy student love affair controversy to a level only SP can. The positives outweight the negatives here but it's not perfect, so I can't give it 5 stars no matter how much I love the World of Warcraft episode. The cover of the box (Target edition) is awesome.  You see the SP boys fat and pimply and, by tilting the box, you see their World of Warcraft characters.Disc 1:\"The Return of Chef\"--Controversial episode that got back at Isaac Hayes for leaving SP when it tackled the Scientology issue. Hearing old Chef audio clips, the SP boys notice something has changed drastically in Chef after his return from an adventure with a mysterious club.  Yikes!\"Smug Alert!\"--People of SP start buying hybrid cars and find out they're threatening the planet with emissions of another kind.  The beginning of this episode with Gerald acting all high and mighty in his hybrid was great.  I thought it was going to be another excellent episode.  At the point where the forest ranger explains what's going on to Stan, things went downhill.  Here, the episode tried a little too hard to make a statement.  It is very contrived.\"Cartoon Wars Part 1\"--Fear engulfs SP when a Family Guy episode showing an image of Mohammad threatens holy war.  While the nation buries its head in the sand (literally), Cartman goes on a mission to cancel Family Guy and Kyle tries to stop him.\"Cartoon Wars Part 2\"--Pre-empted for a Terrance and Phillip television special...just kidding.  Cartman finds out something shocking about the writers of Family Guy.  I'll admit that show makes a lot more sense now.  The Muslims' retaliation was going in the right direction but ended up going the way of \"The Passion of the Jew\" which is unfortunate because it became stupid instead of funny.\"A Million Little Fibers\"--Towlie promotes his memoirs but hits a snatch...er...snag when he lies to Oprah Winfrey.  This episode is way over-the-top for my tastes and is not re-watchable.Disc 2:\"Manbearpig\"--Al Gore is super serial about a new threat to the planet.  Can the man who invented the Internet save the earth from the vicious Manbearpig? Wait...isn't manbearpig an endangered species?\"Tsst\"--Mrs. Cartman has had it with her out-of-control son but, after failing on several nanny reality shows, has to resort to hiring a dog trainer.  One of the better episodes of this season.\"Make Love Not Warcraft\"--The best thing I've seen on TV, period.  Brilliant! It's interesting that here is one of the few times Cartman is a good leader who isn't a jerk to everyone...except Butters, of course.\"The Mystery of the Urinal Deuce\"--An unwelcomed sight in the boy's room somehow leads to the unlocking of a 9/11 conspiracy.  We get to meet the Hardly Boys who seem to be hardly ever not hard.  The funniest part of this episode is how Mr. Mackey keeps hounding on finding more than a cake in the urinal.\"Miss Teacher Bangs a Boy\"--A teacher at SP Elementary is having an affair with a student...a very young student.  Meanwhile, Cartman gets some real \"authoritie\" as a hallway monitor and treats his job as if he is a certain television bounty hunter.  His assistant Beth with the big knockers is hilarious.Disc 3:\"Hell On Earth 2006\"--Satan wants a Halloween party just like the Super Sweet 16 parties those snotty rich girls on MTV get.  Meanwhile, the folks of SP keep summoning Biggie Smalls back to earth.  A ho-hum episode. The Three Stooges take-off with Ted Bundy, Jeffrey Dahmer and John Wayne Gacey doesn't do it for me. It just doesn't make sense as Bundy would never hang out with those guys.  Plus, Gacey would want to kill children, not adults and Dahmer would be killing young, dark-skinned men.\"Go God Go\"--Mrs. Garrison is against teaching her class evolution until a handsome atheist scholar is hired to teach her class.  Meanwhile, Cartman can't wait for the release of the Nintendo Wii so he has himself frozen but his defrost took longer than he anticipated.  Tears came to my eyes when Mrs. Garrison described evolution to the class I was laughing so hard.\"Go God Go XII\"--Cartman is stuck in the future where there is no religion and, therefore, no war...yeah right!  I like how they say \"science\" in their slurs instead of \"God\" or \"JC.\" When Cartman calls himself in the past it is hilarious!  He finally gets to encounter his awful self but, of course, doesn't learn anything from it.\"Stanley's Cup\"--To get his bike out of impound, Stan coaches a peewee hockey team that includes a player dying of cancer.  This episode tries too hard to be heavy, but I guess that was the goal, er, point."
B000LVIIUC The landmark season of South Park saw Matt Stone and Trey Parker's animated series back on top thanks to some scathing, satirical moments and just plain animated lunacy.  It also saw the departure of Isaac Hayes, the voice of Chef, who departed after the previous season's lampooning of scientology and Tom Cruise.  His departure is spoofed in the opening \"Return of Chef\" which uses archive sounds of Hayes' voice as Chef returns to South Park brainwashed by the Super Adventure Club, and seeling to \"re-connect\" with children.  Things only get better as Kyle's dad buys a hybrid car in \"Smug Alert!\", Al Gore seeks attention from anyone with \"Manbearpig\", Cartman's mom turns to the Dog Whisperer in \"Tsst!\", Satan has a killer Halloween party in \"Hell on Earth 2006\", and Cartman seeks to freeze himself in anticipation for the release of the Nintendo Wii in \"Go God Go\".  The best moments of the season however came with the two part \"Cartoon Wars\" which hilariously lampooned Family Guy, and it makes sense in a way you've never imagined.  \"Make Love, Not Warcraft\" satires the players of the incredibly popular online RPG, and \"Miss Teacher Bangs a Boy\" finds little Ike having an illicit affair.  The only downpoint of the season is the closing \"Stanley's Cup\" which finds Stan coaching a terrible pee-wee hockey team, for no apparent reason.  This episode just isn't funny, at all.  Despite that though, every other episode here in the tenth season is a winner, and ten years and still going strong, South Park proves that these kids are quite alright."
B000LVIIUC This season is not as good as other seasons, but it's still alright. One of my favorite episodes is when it's HALLOWEEN and Satan is throwing a big Sweet Sixteen party and acts like a spoiled rich teenager. Also Stan, Kyle, Cartman, and Kenny deal with the death of their friend Chef, stop Manbearpig, try to get a Family Guy episode pulled, defeat a nerdy gamer on World of Warcraft, and stop Ike from having sexual relations with his smokin' hot teacher. (Nice!) All this and more happen in SOUTH PARK: THE COMPLETE 10TH SEASON!!!"
B000LVIIUC Episodes like \"TSST\" (the Dog Whisperer episode) and \"The Mystery of the Urinal Deuce\" (featuring the Hardly Boys) are funnier the second and third time around.  The show is uneven, sure, but basically an American treasure.  The real prizes in this season are the 2-parters, the \"Family Guy\" 2-parter and the \"Go God Go\" 2-parter featuring Cartman in the 25th Century.  If you haven't seen either of those, you've missed out on some of the best TV ever aired."
B000MMX5E4 this was a well written account of the concentration camp of auschwitz.  Withoudt making it overly grapic, it showed the horrot of what went on and the people who made the idea work.  It covers the beginning of the effort to rid the world of Jews and other undesirables and continue until the trails after the war.  If you have an interest in this subject, you will find this once of the better accounts."
B000MMX5E4 A heartbreaking but realisitic version of the suffering of the Jews and the misconception of what should have been and turned out to be something more horrible. Great photos and exact images made you feel like you were right there in person."
B000MMX5E4 Exceptionally well presented documentation of the pathway to Auschwitz (Poland). This presents the Nazi ideology from the inception of the T-3 euthanasia program for disposing of those (ethnic Germans) who were mentally ill or suffered from other medical problems to the extermination of all peoples considered 'unworthy of life' and prisoners of war. . .  Poles, Russians and Jews. From a small pre-war barracks for Polish soldiers, it follows the path to the mass slaughter house it became during WWII. Included are multiple aspects of the killing process and how it evolved. Original architectural designs, diaries and personal interviews with both the SS and survivors accompanied by original footage (Ukrainian) and psychological profiles offers an overview of all that became Auschwitz.Video and narrative are well suited for those who prefer not to be exposed to all the sensationalism and gore often found in so many of these documentaries. Education and informative, an accurate presentation of Nazi ideology and euthanasia.The BBC series offers the opportunity for a comprehensive review of the consequences for both perpetrator and victim. For those that survived death, the path 'home' wasn't as simple as one might think. Russian POW's were suspected of being 'spies' and relegated to the Gulags of Stalin's era. Others trying to return home found themselves victims of the Russia army and perhaps worst of all, deprived of their homes and possessions without any legal recourse.  A tragic end to what is still considered one of humankind's worst nightmares."
B000MMX5E4 Still horrifying due to its nature but very informational. A watch for history buffs and to never forget one of our darkest tragedys"
B000MMX5E4 Taken from this perspective and from the notes of the Nuremburg trials, excellent 'history' lessons.  Made me want to read more of what actually took place that modern history books don't really address."
B000MMX5E4 The producers of this program really attempted to accurately portray historical events, so much so at times it was difficult to remember that the program was an reenactment."
B000MMX5E4 I knew about Auschwitz, of course...conceptually I knew what had been done there and I knew the horror of it.  I just didn't grasp the full depth of WHY, nor did I realize how things were done.  This documentary series is mind opening.  It uses recently discovered plans and recreates what things would have looked like, it interviews people who made it through, it tells the story of the countless people who did NOT make it through and it helps us see with even greater clarity that this kind of atrocity must never ever be allowed to occur again."
B000MMX5E4 This is a very interesting documentary regarding the infamous Nazi camp.  I didn't know that the camp was used for anything other than the containment and murder of Jews, Gypsies and other people that the Nazis believed to be inferior.  It was well worth the time to watch the series.  I will probably watch it again at some point."
B000MMX5E4 I thought I have seen all there is to see about the insane horrors of this place but this series tells a little more about why and how these people went through more than you can imagine and some survived to tell us.  Man cannot rule man."
B000MMX5E4 If you were not altogether up on the Nazi period or if you were to young to really know about the Nazi's &#34;final solution&#34; this series will certainly bring the horrors of that preriod front & center!!"
B000MMX5E4 how horrendous that such cruelty and depraved indifference not only occurred BUT was then perpetrated again and is still happening in the world. We will never know the gifts to humanity that were destroyed there.....the brilliant minds, the spectacular voices, the symphonies unwritten, the cures not found....it reminds me of the holocaust of abortion here in the U.S."
B000MMX5E4 The subject matter is appalling in itself.  It is difficult to detach yourself emotionally from the horrors that were inflicted at Auschwitz.But, it is a BBC production and with that comes thorough, authoritative, accurate and objective presentation of the subject matter.It is worth watching as an historical document and not for entertainment, which it certainly is not!  I believe everyone should see this from the standpoint of understanding what a despotic and/or dictatorial regime can accomplish if left unchecked.  When one person can rule an entire nation by personal decree as opposed to a balanced law making process, then anything and everything is possible, even to declaring a portion of your own population to be a dangerous enemy.  There are lessons to be learned here."
B000MMX5E4 Having been there as a child to visit, I wanted to see more of the history of the halocaust.Some things you need to remember."
B000MMX5E4 Auschwitz: Inside the Nazi State makes for compelling viewing. It is divided into 6 chapters. The first chapter is titled \"Surprising Beginnings\" which basically introduces us to the origins of Auschwitz and how it was not initially designated as an extermination camp for Jews, but basically to house Polish political prisoners and later Russian POWs. In fact, the first gassing experiments in the camp were targeted at the Russian POWs.In the second chapter \"Orders and Initiatives\", we learn of the plans of Hitler, Himmler and Reinhard Heydrich to kill the Jews on a massive scale. Auschwitz is prepped for this purpose by the construction of gas chambers and the use of Zyklon B, a form of poisonous gas that was initially used to exterminate vermin and a disinfecting agent. We also learn about the Lodz Ghetto and its infamous Jewish leader, Rumkowski who seemed a controversial character in oppressing his own people, though not spared death himself, in the end. The crude initial gas chambers at Auschwitz are also shown, in reconstructions.In the third chapter \"Factories of Death\", the documentary explores how the systematic annihilation of the Jews was put into full operation, stretching all over Europe with Auschwitz being the center of extermination. The French authorities are also portrayed as being complicit in helping transport masses of Jews out of France to the \"east\". The other camps of death are also discussed such as Treblinka, Belzec and Sobibor. It also mentions what happened to children of adult Jews who were sent off to work in the camps.The fourth chapter \"Corruption\" focusses on the blatant appropriation of murdered Jews and other peoples' belongings and valuables for the use of the Third Reich. Rudolf Hoess, the commandant of Auschwitz himself was removed from his position under charges of corruption [though he would return later to oversee mass killing on an astronomical scale]. This chapter also mentions Dr Josef Mengele, the infamous Nazi doctor of death, and also about the setting up of a brothel in the camp. Most importantly, this episode also deals with the resistance against the Nazi oppressors, most famously the uprising in Sobibor.The fifth chapter \"Murder and Intrigue\" deals with the playing out of international politics during the last nine months of 1944 and how nothing much was done by the Allies despite knowing by then that the jews and other innocents were being systematically and mechanically murdered by the Nazis. This was much to the detriment of the Hungarian Jews in particular, for they were deported to their deaths at a time where the gas chambers and crematoriums at Auschwitz in particular were operating at their optimum capacity. It also focusses on the Sonderkommando, the Jewish inmates who were forced to help process new arrivals designated for gassing, collecting their possessions, and disposing of their corpses.The final chapter \"Liberation and Revenge\" deals with how the Nazis tried to conceal their atrocities towards the end of the war. It also covers some of the trials of the Nazi war criminals after the war, the impact of liberation on the surviving camp inmates etc.Each chapter has at the end an interview between Linda Ellerbee with various personalities, mainly members of faculty of universities about the issues raised by each chapter.The series is not only well-put together with the extensive research compiled, but also the reenactments of historical events with actors and actresses [which I felt enhanced the series and not detract from it], the computer generated graphics of the camps as they were [they are mainly ruins now], and also most importantly, the testaments of the survivors in the present. It is a truly heartwrenching experience to see and hear these brave souls relive their horrific memories of such a bleak period in the history of mankind. A must-watch. I would also recommend \"Shoah\", a documentary that has more testimonies by survivors on the horrors they endured during World War Two."
B000MN4YR0 The answer to the riddle is in the tittle. Once again Aunt Jane has to sort things out when a friend Ruth asks her to look in on her sister, Carrie Louise. You anticipate that Carrie has had it. And you meet many unbalanced and speedy characters. While you are watching you can miss the whole thing as they do it with mirrors.Well paced and the perfect English actors to match each part."
B000MN4YR0 Did not like this one at all ... the actors lacked passion for the work they were doing ... camera work wasn't that great either."
B000MN4YR0 This Agatha Christie mystery had an American actor (or a British actor portraying an American).  I was intrigued with the women's fashions, as well as the culture.  The premise was interesting as well - a murder at a &#34;disadvantaged youth&#34; home, which also happened to be a grand mansion."
B000MN4YR0 I'm not giving away any plot information!  Suffice it to say that, as always, Hickson gives a superb performance and I hope to eventually own all the Miss Marple's with her in them.  You won't be disappointed with this movie as it stays fairly close to the book."
B000MN4YR0 Very slow moving story...not very enticing...sound quality not great.  We did not finish this movie as it did not hold our interest.  Unusual experience at best."
B000MPGI68 Honestly! Can we have a different story line than terrorist, mole in organization, rotten government..blah, blah. Will I keep watching? Yes, still have two more seasons to go. Jack almost gets a little pathetic, perhaps that doesn't help. After watching both this and MI-5, I prefer MI-5. More emotion, more attachment to characters and better story development."
B000MPGI68 i started with season 1 friday the 11th of april. just got done with season 8 ..thuday april 18...i gorged myself with it..and fell in love with Keith Sutherland.. i hear he's coming back.. season 9 can hardly wait."
B000MPGI68 Yet another blazing, edge of your seat thrilling 24 hours in LA.  We lose a few more personnel but still manage to muddle through large scale corruption and the worst terrorists ever"
B000MPGI68 A good story line and good acting.  It's a good thing I don't have to wait for a whole week before catching the next episode.  I was working nights when this was originally on TV so never got to watch it then.  It would have been very hard to wait for a week before seeing the next episode.  This series is very addictive."
B000MPGI68 More exciting than any current TV show!  I watch this on my tablet every night...never miss if I can help it."
B000MPGI68 Each season is better than the last one, and that is saying a lot because they are ALL unbelievable!  I recommend this show to any age.  I am so addicted to this show!"
B000MPGI68 This dvd set rocks! This whole season is killer! Buy it people you won't regret it period! Plus it came in great shape! I would recommend this series to anybody!"
B000MPGI68 Every episode has some serious problem that Jack Bauer seems to solve at the risk of his own life (and others also). Love this show."
B000MPGI68 When &#34;24&#34; was on weekly we didn't start to watch it at the beginning and then often forgot to watch it, so it was hard to really get into it. BUT now that we are able to watch every episode from the beginning and in order without interruption have we loved it and are watching it again."
B000MPGI68 When this first came out I said bah! don't like donald sutherland, probably won't like his son, so I never watched it when it was on tv.When I got amazon prime, I was watching Life, loved that, 24 kept coming up as a recommended show, so I said what the heck?? Wow, it is so engaging, I'd stay up til 4am watching episode after episode.It would be nice if 24:Redemption was free to watch too, anyone want to loan me theirs? was it made into DVD?Some of the twists in season 6 seemed rather implausible but whatever, I won't go into it. Love the show, looking forward to watching the rest of it."
B000MPGI68 I'm a huge fan of \"24\" however I must say that whoever wrote the 2-3 line synopses of the Season 6 epidosdes should ask for his or her money back from whatever institution of higher learning they attended.  The introductory sentences that tell about each new episode on the roster should really give some good information about what's in that segment and it can be done by almost anyone who learned even the basics of writing in grammar school. I can't imagine that Amazon and the people who produce \"24\" would allow some imbecile to degrade their work even with something as small as this."
B000MPGI68 What can you say...Jack Bauer is awesome!  You may have to suspend reality about the believability of the scenario, but the writers always play it out well."
B000MPGI68 It pains me to trash this show on Amazon, because seasons 1,2, and 5 are truly great.  This season feels like a made for basic cable action show that would air every Sunday at 2 AM.  Every plot device, formula, etc., is recycled here from the other seasons, almost to the point where they feel literally cut and pasted."
B000MPGI68 I was incredibly disappointed in season Six of 24. The reason I give this a three-star review as opposed to a two is that I think that perhaps the standards for this season to live up to were very dificult coming off of season Five, which is easily the best season of the show thus far. The plot seemed to go in far too many different directions, far too many relationships unresolved and there were far too many questions that remained unanswered. I applaud the show for being ambitious and trying different things, but there were too few moments of Jack doing what he does best and too many moments where the show felt like a long and very boring civics lesson in terms of presidential power and the transfer of it.Also the problem that seems to be facing this show right now is that Jack has little to no emotional investment anymore in CTU or in his own life. His best friends are all dead (and he's had to kill one of them himself), and his lover is practically catatonic. All he really seems to have left is the job (and his daughter), but that just doesn't seem like enough. The brains behind this great show had better find someone or something fast to get Jack to reinvest himself in emotionally or else this season could be the harbinger of doom for the Hour of Bauer's Power!!"
B000MPGI68 Season 6 has varied reviews and a number of unhappy people, who claim that 24 is falling apart.  I feel killing almost everyone in season 5 resulted in much of the dissatisfaction with season 6.  The new people have no history and no claim to our affection.  If we are not watching someone we like and care about, we night think to much.  This is something the writers need to consider, the people are what makes the show and they need to be preserved.The story line is standard and not deep.  This is not a \"who done it\" or a deep thought provoking drama.  Plots and sub plots have been taken from past seasons and put together for a new story line.  During any hour, something occurs designed to make us want to watch the next hour.  As the clock ticks down 59:57, 59:58 something is happening that requires us to watch the next hour.  This is a cliffhanger and a darn good one!Jack, I agree with Secretary Heller.  You are cursed to provide us with high-energy entertainment that is great fun as long as we don't think to much.  The series is much better on DVD, without commercials and waiting for next week."
B000MPGI68 Jack Bauer comes to the government's rescue once again! This is another great season of 24 and what is awesome about this season is we finally meet some of the main antagonist that are responsible for many of the tragedies that have occurred in Jack's life! A must see season of 24!!"
B000MPGI68 I've been addicted to 24 since the first season. The writers have a great sense of the Homeland Security, FBI and CIA. Just when you think you have the episode figured out, they throw a twist in and changes up everything. If you haven't had the opportunity to see this awesome program give yourself a treat and check it out. I promise you will enjoy 24 very much and possibly become addicted as I have become.It's really a great TV program."
B000MPGI68 I liked all the seasons of 24 because of the fast moving action, never bored, always something happening. I would recommend it to anyone who like action movies."
B000MPGI68 How they even come up with this stuff is beyond me!  This show is great and it is even more awesome that it is included with Amazon Prime!  Thanks Amazon!"
B000MPGI68 OK, this one is kind of over the top. Jack Bauer comes back from Chinese captivity a broken man. Then he is confronted with a series of terrorist attacks culminating in the explosion of an atomic bomb. The show also has turned somehow more gruesome since we early on see Jack bite the neck and kill one of his captors (Jack as vampire?)  and then eventually he will kill one of his friends and torture his brother. His father also turns out to be an enemy. And we get to know this pretty early on in the series. While the performance of Jack Bauer as burned-out is particularly well done at the same time it is distracting and the show suffers from his lack of motivation. There is also an unnecessary emphasis on a multitude of subplots which tend to cause more of a headache and do not contribute to the storyline. That said it is not bad, it is simply not as good as season 5. As other reviewers have noted, the loss of many central characters has also weakened the interest for the series."
B000MPGI68 I gave it this rating for many reasons, it was a good season to watch and it keeps the viewer interested."
B000MPGI68 In the time since Jack Bauer (Kiefer Sutherland) was kidnapped, the United States has become a dangerous place.  Suicide bombers hit the country on a regular basis, and no one is safe.  New President Wayne Palmer (D. B. Woodside) has arranged Jack's release from a Chinese prison camp.  Jack is to be traded to the terrorists in exchange for a promised cease fire.Jack agrees to give his life for the peace of his country.  But when he finds out that it was all a lie, he escapes to begin another cat and mouse hunt with the terrorists.  Only this time, they've already struck once, leading to a calamity.  Meanwhile, the trail leads Jack to his own family.  What secrets are his dad and brother hiding?  Can he stop the terrorists before they unleash even more terror on America?And more importantly, what happened to this once great show?  I've been a fan of this show since season one.  While my favorite season was the third, I've thought all of the previous seasons were great.  But not this one.Part of the problem was the been there, done that factor.  The writers seem to be out of plot twists, so they are relying on the same one stand bys.  Unfortunately, loyal viewers can see those coming.  There was very little here that we hadn't seen before, which made the season boring.The other big problem was the dropped storylines.  Several times, a story was introduced and dropped in a matter of episodes.  Sometimes, they came back, sometimes they didn't, leaving us hanging.  Add to that the increase of personal drama over suspense, and you've got a lack luster season.Now, it wasn't all bad.  This season was still entertaining.  But compared to the previous years, day six was a real let down."
B000MPGI68 Season 6 has been eclipsed my more modern series such as Lost. The formulaic plotline is old hat and getting long in the tooth. 24 was a groundbreaker but is okay for my treadmill workouts."
B000MPGI68 Man, things were going great for the most violent prime time TV show ever (less the killing of Curtis - one of those moments where clearly the writers simply wants to shock the audience or need to get rid of the actor for some reason). Things went downhill (in my humble opinion)after the Fayed plot was solved. By \"downhill\" I don't mean disater, because a show of this magnitude, where each episode has so many differnt scenarios, shot on locatiosns cenes, special effects, etc, rarely is mediocre. You get the feel that the everyone involved is giving their best.What I mean by downhil is the above mentioned people (cast, producers, technical guys, writers) giving their best for a flawed premise. The Chinese / Russian plot was so farfetched, so forced, so  unplausible. After all, the advantage of obtaining some secret technologie about your enemy is useful since he does not know that you possess his defense technology! Also, to see Audrey Raines appears only briefly and as a \"zombie\" was a bad call.Well, that's it. Anyway, I think the show still did not jump the shark, but this will happen soon."
B000MPGI68 A newcomer to 24, in that I've only been experiencing it through DVD, I was particularly impressed with how the show seemed to improve with each season.  This was why I was a bit surprised that season 6 had such a dip in quality.  (Spoilers)  Season 6 begins with a situation beyond the usual \"reality\" of 24, an america besieged with constant terrorist activity.  Bombings are frequent, and apparently common place.  This alone was a turn off, given the shows ability to feel real and unique.  I wasn't interested in an america under seige.  Add to that other unrealistic moments such as a nuclear bomb going off, and apparently no fallout or worry, as well as someone tortured with a drill returning to work, and you have a season that was particularly unrealistic.  Also, the characters, most of which were unlikeable, seeming to exist only for sake of moving a plot device along.  One moment the presidential aide is in favor of a harsher stance against terrosits, the next he's fighting against those who are.  Jack starts the season traumtized by a couple years in prision and tortured, but quickly is fine.  Oddly, though he spent really only one (1) day with CTU in the last three and a half years (after season 4, he only spent day 5, until day six with them), its shocking how well he know the technology and protocols of CTU.  They never change?  Even the twists were boring and unexciting, mainly as they come from a previous season.  Girl having an affair with a spy? seen it. Threat of nuclear bombs? seen it.  Heck, even the use of the good cop/bad cop president and vice president and invoking of the 25th amendment have been done.  (end spoilers).I guess the issue comes down to writing.  Its not that the actors did not work hard, they had little to work with.  The writing feels almost lazy this time around, as if trying to reycle old stories in a slightly different way.  Sadly, the twists weren't shocking, and usually not interesting.  The characters weren't as likeable, and the plot was a bit of a mess.  While I was able to watch it, I don't know if it is a season I'll rewatch, like the first five seasons.  Only for 24 fans."
B000MPGI68 Jack Bauer is a moral avenger and  just when we need such a phenomenon.  Jack treats terrorists like they treat others.  Also the series allows a lot of good acting and shows off a lot of articulate minds.We get to see justice, something the federal government is in the business of squashing."
B000MPGI68 When season 5 ended we left Jack on a freighter headed towards China.  When season 6 started Jack is being returned, complete with scars and a dazed expression, to be traded in a \"Bauer for Bombs\" exchange.  \"President Palmer the lesser\" bows out in the middle of the series to let the vice-president, who is diddling his turn coat assistant, run amock and make a lot of bad decisions that keeps the plot rolling along.  His chief of staff handles the dual role of good guy/bad guy (at the same time) well.  Back at CTU Mary Lynn must still have that bad smelling limburger cheese sandwich in her desk as her expression remains puckered again this year.  I'm not saying I didn't have fun watching the current series - just that it may be getting a little chiche (but we still haven't jumped the shark)."
B000MPGI68 I give Season 4 of \"24\" four stars not rated relative to it's own normal standards, but in comparison to everything else on TV.Simply stated....... even during a weak season like Season 6, \"24\" is still better than most other crap on TV these days.In other words, even at it's worse, \"24\" is better than most modern shows at their best.So many other shows on TV have become simple one trick pony and non-stop sex joke one liners that they have no substance except the cheap laugh.No wonder we now watch very few modern shows outside Court TV crime shows and exist primarily on DVD collections of past shows like........ Cheers, Wings, Silk Stalkings, Seinfeld, etc..etc.."
B000MPGI68 We are catching up no 24 so we can watch the new series.  We have become hooked on the drama of this show and are sorry we didn't watch it while it was such a big hit.  it is now a BIG hit for us."
B000MPGI68 Nonstop action.  Fascinating PLOTS all interwoven during the course of a day.  Top notch ACTING of fully believable and  intriguing characters."
B000MPGI68 I am re-watching the last three seasons to refresh myself.  With the new season coming up I can't wait.  Such an awesome show it really is top notch."
B000MPGI68 Season 6 is OK but the novelty is wearing off.  Jack is superhuman, of course.  Supporting characters Morris & Cloe are interesting. The rest are basic carryovers.  We will see if the new (12 hour) 'Live another day' comes up with something new.  I have been working my way through from season one over the last few months.  Could be better with long breaks between seasons so you get ready for a fresh Jack Attack fix?  That's how I see it.  Have fun watching!"
B000MPGI68 After two years in a Chinese prison, Jack Bauer is returned to America in order for C.T.U. to get the location of the man putting off bombs. Jack finds out it's all for nothing and escapes to help save the day. Throughout this day, Jack teams up with terrorist who wants peace, there is an attack on President Wayne Palmer, the Vice President wants to bomb another country, Jack must find 5 suitcase nukes, stop his dad and brother, help his nephew, and a whole lot more! This is one of the better seasons. One of the characters I don't really like at first is Tom Lennox, then later in the day, I start to like him. Then, I don't really like Vice President Noah Daniels, but toward the end of the day, I kinda like him. If you love 24, and Jack Bauer, you'll love 24: DAY SIX!!!"
B000MPGI68 I can't say enough about 24, I LOVE each and every Season and Episode.  If you like action, you will be at the edge of your seat with this Season.  We are VERY hooked and stream from one to the next episode."
B000MPGI68 Keifer Sutherland is outstanding and all characters are appealing.  New characters come into shows and stay for a while, and the stories always have unexpected twists and turns.  The one thing you can expect is great acting, interesting plots, and unexpected turns.  It's great to watch."
B000MPGI68 More of Jack Bauer and his over the top method of saving America from terrorists. Very intense at tomes. Enjoy all of it."
B000MPGI68 I loved 24 when it was on tv and now after years I still love it.  All the seasons are the bomb.  LOL"
B000MPGI68 Not sure which season was my favorite.  I truly liked David Palmer as Pres so maybe Season 1and the final season when Chloe took on a commanding role."
B000MPGI68 Each episode is full of surprises, thus it was very difficult to quit watching. I was never be a fan of &#34;24&#34; before I start watching over Amazon Prime. Now, I love it. After finishing Season 6, I have reverted back to Season 1 and am still enchanted."
B000MPGI68 I *think* this is the episode where someone FINALLY says to Jack what I'd been thinking for about 50 episodes already.\"You're cursed, Jack.\"THANK YOU. This poor guy. It's like he's got a little black cloud of bad luck that follows him around. Sure, he can pull YOUR bacon out of the fire, but HIS house will burn down in the process.That being said, it make me love Jack and root for him all the more. \"PLEASE let this man have SOMETHING good happen. ANYTHING.\""
B000MPGI68 Just finished watching season 6 on DVD. (I live in Europe and it has been out a few weeks already) Dumbest ideas ever in 24. Fox should definetely fire the writers! There got to be more qualified people out there?Don`t buy it. Rather buy season 5 (which was great)"
B000MPGI68 Though widely-regarded as the weakest season (barring early feedback about the just-released Season Seven) of the TV series \"24\", I still found the season to be just as emotionally compelling and intense as any of the previous efforts.I will admit that, for (at least for me) the first time in show history, the late-season plot (regarding a piece of circuit board machinery) became a bit unbelievable.  Of course, all of \"24\" requires the viewer to suspend reality just a bit, but this time it seemed completely implausible that Jack Bauer would be allowed to complete his task.  Aside from that, however, this season created some very thrilling moments and acting, including (my highlights):-The introduction of some other Bauer family members (let's just say they don't share Jack's patriotism).-The \"Islamic prejudice\" storyline that mirrors the feature film \"The Siege\" in its high drama.-The acting of Vice President Noah Daniels (played by Powers Boothe), who mirrors the inspired performance of Gregory Itzin (Charles Logan) from Season Five, who also makes an appearance in this season.-The return of Jack Bauer from his detainment in China and how (or if?) he is able to transition back into normal society.As usual, the intensity of Kiefer Sutherland's Bauer as well as the \"staff\" of CTU Los Angeles turn in great performances, with special props given to James Morrison as Bill Buchanan.Thus, I cannot see where others saw this season falling short of previous efforts, as I found it to continue the \"24\" tradition of exciting plots, great acting, and mind-boggling twists and turns along the way."
B000MVI8HO This is worth getting alone for the second episode \"The Deadly Dolls\" guest-starring the great Vincent Price.  While the plot is similar to so many other Voyage episodes with the crew being taken over by aliens desiring the Seaview's nuclear reactor, the combination of Vincent and the hysterical Nelson and Crane puppets make this one an absolute pleasure.It is interesting to ponder how great Voyage would have been had it continued the combination of sci-fi and James Bond-type episodes seen during its second, and best, season."
B000MVI8HO This was the best season of Voyage To The Bottom Of The Sea starring Richard Basehart a hugely underrated American actor who has performed on stage, screen, and many guest starring dramatic roles on various TV series, movies made for TV, specials, and also has narrated many outstanding documentaries and has a career that spans from the 1940's until his passing September of 1984. The stories in the first two seasons were taught, gritty, with many of the episodes involving cold war espionage and a few aliens and undersea monsters tossed in here and there. Seasons 3 and 4 contained more monsters and aliens and centered more on fantasy. This was a show that was geared for all ages. Voyage To The Bottom Of The Sea has been around since it originally aired on ABC on September 14, 1964 and has been run on many networks in syndication since it went off the air in 1968. All 110 episodes have also been released on DVD which I also own and I recently decided to buy season 1 on instant stream to go along with the other TV series and movies I have in my video library. I like the convenience of instant stream videos because I don't have to get up to change DVD's.  I only have one negative thing to say about this and that is why seasons 2, 3, and 4 are not available on instant stream. I would like to see the rest of the series be made available in this format. It saves the wear and tear on my DVD's. Unfortunately FOX released Voyage on double sided DVD's and those don't seem to hold up well with a lot of use. I really wish FOX had not skimped on the quality of the DVD's for this and other series they have released on double sided DVD's. I believe there will come a time when everything will be on instant stream and there won't be any more DVD's to hassle with."
B000MVI8HO One of the great things about DVD is that classic television shows can be not only recalled but watched again. Some of them upon second viewing make you think \"Did I really think this show was good?\". But then again others make you realize that the shows you enjoyed from your youth were not just memories but were actually good shows. VOYAGE TO THE BOTTOM OF THE SEA is one of those series.As with the previous releases of the series, SEASON 4 VOLUME 1, holds up as well as the rest. The improvement of color over black and white is an obvious one when comparing to season one. But the characters have now had a chance to develop on screen and become familiar to us all. Too bad the series left the air not long after.The sixties gave us some of the greatest science fiction television ever seen. As early as THE TWILIGHT ZONE and moving forward to THE OUTER LIMITS we had anthologies that held our attention. And as for serialized tales, we had the original STAR TREK and more. No person helped this era out more so than Irwin Allen.Allen was the creator of some of the most remembered sci fi series from the time including THE TIME TUNNEL, LOST IN SPACE, LAND OF THE GIANTS and of course VOYAGE. Each of these series has had a release to DVD and have had the opportunity to give those of us children of the sixties the chance to relive those moments that held our attention each week, an hour at a time, as we watched incredible worlds unfold before our eyes.As for VOYAGE, the story mixed a combination of military and peacenik in one. It told the tales of the submarine Seaview, a high tech sub designed and operated by Admiral Nelson (Richard Basehart), a man who sees great things for the future and who uses his sub not as an offensive weapon but as a means to an end to help people around the globe.Along with Nelson are several main characters. The main one of these was Capt. Lee Crane (David Hedison), his second in command. While Nelson offered an elder statesman, Crane was the young eye candy to draw in girls, a man of action who took control when needed. Robert Dowdell as Lt. Comdr. Chip Morton, Del Monroe as Kowalski and Arch Whiting as Sparks helped round out the all male cast as they tackled world crises around the globe, saving the world over and over again.This particular season gave us a number of items to be concerned about opening with an episode that showed the Seaview tossed about was a volcano was about to blow cracking the world in two. Vincent Price paid a visit to the Seaview as a puppeteer who took control of various crewmen. A well loved plot device of the sixties, the ability of a bad guy to transform his appearance to do harm to whoever he chose was used. And time travel was brought into the picture again as well.VOYAGE played out like STAR TREK taken to inner space instead of outer and with an all male crew instead of one more integrated. But then TREK was in the future and VOYAGE in the present. Scenes of both ships being tossed about due to either underwater explosions or photon torpedoes gave us the cast tossing themselves about from side to side of the set. One could expect anyone from either cast feeling comfortable changing sets.For me it was glorious to watch as the flying sub once again lifted off out of the bottom of the Seaview and broke surface to fly across the sky. Like many I was lucky enough to have purchased the Aurora model kit and make my own flying sub to take a place of honor on the top of my desk. To find one today means a prolonged ebay search and paying an arm and a leg. Better it remains a fond memory.Not so this series. It no longer has to be a memory. Instead it is something that can be enjoyed again and again. And it can be shared with my son and later perhaps my grandchildren.One of the best things that we can take with us, those of us who watched these shows when they were fresh and new, is the sense of hope that they offered. Rather than a post apocalyptic world of bombed out buildings and survivors clad in furs and remnants of clothing, we were shown a world where we could use science to help build a better world. We were offered a world where not just races and genders got along but aliens as well. Wouldn't it be great if the world had that same sense of hope once more? Perhaps sharing these old television shows might just be the first step in that direction."
B000MVI8HO Heck, what a change of course!Season Three of Voyage To The Bottom Of The Sea altered dramatically the tone of the show. Gone were the clever plots about spies, Cold War, nuclear danger, secrete agents. Gone is the Nelson Institute location, different things like Veneza, etc.Admiral Nelson is onboard the Seaview in all episodes, and now the focus are aliens, monsters, mermaids, werewolves, mummies, dead Nazi agents, plant men, wax men, you name it. The Seaview \"rock and roll\" like never before, it's a miracle it never gets destroyed.Gone is Riley, in comes Patterson.Season Two is the best for me, it will always be. Bu Season Three has its moments and, in general, maitained the good reputation of the show as a guilty pleasure show. It was in Season Four that thing went downhill drastically."
B000MVI8HO This like season two of lost in space was the time when a serious show went into the land of silliness, although it's alot of fun and fast moving the whole concept of the show was scrapped for this more kid friendly romp that could be said to be the fantasy season part one.  I like this but after the first two seasons I just wanted the noncamp era back.  That being said this camp era is a blast if you just enjoy it like that."
B000MVIAUY Great story....and one of the few genre shows that the ivory tower &#34;brain trusts&#34; have allowed to survive and develop. For what its worth, if you are getting into this show late, these boxed sets have gone on sale for something like $9.00 each right around Christmas the last couple years."
B000MVIAUY I love this tv show!  My daughter introduced it to me and I couldn't stop watching it.  I've also bought and watched the 3rd Season.  Very good!!"
B000MVIAUY This review has one slight spoiler in terms of what the brothers hunt in a single episode... you've been warnedThis season of Supernatural gives us a dose of comedy many probably wouldn't expect from a show that is \"scary\". But the scary ramps up too. Everything escalates. The plot of Season One is extended greatly as Sam tries to track down others 'like him'. We get great guest stars (Katharine Isabelle from the Ginger Snaps films; Linda Blair.... LINDA BLAIR! from the Exorcist)and we witness the come back of one who becomes a fan favourite: Jim Beaver's Bobby Singer. We also see what became fan favourite episodes such as 'Heart' (werewolf alert), 'What is and What Should Never Be' (djinns), and &lt;SPOLIERS>  ----- 'Tall Tales' (a Trickster, a la Coyote, Anansi, Loki, etc)&lt;/SPOILERS)>.Religion comes to a head, and it is easy to see that it is going to intrinsic to future episodes. Hindu and Muslin faith enters center stage, and they do it well, given as much or more reverence than the Catholic and Christian dogma. Perhaps the greatest achievement of  this season is that the writers merge the 'monster of the week' theme by making those monster hunts have some allusion to the metaplot or even fuel the the on-going episodes. So just a head's up: the show is quickly veering into theological discovery. But - they are smart enough not to shove it down anyone's throat.Now, for the fun stuff: the CGI is outright brilliant this season, and it only gets better as the season go on. The audio is set for 5.1 Dolby Digital. As for Special Features, they are the ho-hum variety but made oh some not ho-hum by the crew and cast. It is easy to see these guys love their work. We have a few commentary tracks, deleted scenes on a few of the episodes, a 'making of' in regards to the second jaw-dropping finale.This show is just getting started."
B000MVIAUY A good follow up to the first season. The cliffhanger from season one is answered. You meet a lot of interesting players in this season and the main vilian is no joke. A must buy series if you are into good action and a well told story."
B000MVIAUY This second season becomes tricky since it starts with the father's death and ends with his temporary resurrection in order to be redeemed. At the same time Dean is dying and his father exchanges his own life for Dean's but yet gives Dean the mission to look after Sam and save him, or kill him if he can't protect and save him. It ends with Dean doing the same bargaining as his father for the life of Sam who was killed in the dead western city of Cold Oak. Dean manages to get one year of living before he is reclaimed.This second season tells us too a little more about the demons. Apart from the everyday black-eyed demons who are tortured souls that stopped being human and became demons, there is a particular and more powerful one, the yellow-eyed demon, and though we are not told what or who he really is, he is what we can call a higher class demon. He is the one who accepted to take John's life in the place of Dean's. He is the one who has chosen Sam for a special mission that will be uncovered during this second season. What is that mission?Strangely enough all the hunting is for that yellow-eyed demon nothing but training for Sam and the training is not only directed at Sam. This second season is focusing on the hunting by the two brothers of the yellow-eyed demon. But, this seems to be part of a plan elaborated by him to train Sam and make him understand his importance and his uniqueness. With others like him, that are called \"psychic\" in the series, they have been selected by this special demon to accomplish a task, that is to say lead the demonic army that is to break loose from Hell. Of these \"psychic\", Sam will meet four of them, but there are more, all born on the same year 1983, and whose mothers all died in a nursery fire. We come across them now and then but they do not seem to be very resilient. In a final attempt at selecting the right \"general\" to bring in the armies of Hell out of the deep,he brings together four psychic and a black veteran from Afghanistan (who also has special abilities in a dead western city, Cold Oak in South Dakota, for the sole survivor to accomplish the mission.The Black chap, Jake, will manage, under blackmail from the yellow-eyed monster and menaces against his mother and sister, to kill Sam by cutting his spine through. He is an obviously well trained GI. But Dean will manage to revive Sam by a trip to Crossroads Inn, Mississippi to meet with a crossroad demon, that grants wishes that was tracked down in a previous episode, and to bargain his life against Sam's. He will get a one year survival time for himself. But that enables the two brothers to go to Bobby who had noticed that evil and demonic elements were concentrating around a special zone in Wyoming.Sam will actually find out that in this sector there is a cemetery and a crypt in the center, built by Samuel Colt surrounded by churches connected by railroads building up a pentacle or pentagram, which is called in the series a \"devil's trap\", that can imprison demons if they enter it. The crypt in the cemetery is supposed to be the gate to hell, the gateway through which the armies of Hell will invade the earth. This is an important specification in the series. Several episodes are openly dedicated to Catholic beliefs: angels for one, but also a Catholic priest in a Catholic church who is shot dead on the steps to his church and cannot receive the last rites. He becomes a haunting ghost and is redeemed by the priest of the church.This leads to a discussion that emerges several times on the existence of angels. Dean does not believe. Sam does believe. This definitely gives the series a Christian if not Catholic ring, especially with the number of times the Catholic exorcizing rite or ritual chant is used, though it is never uttered by a priest in the series, which makes it surprisingly iconoclastic. Never people believing in exorcism would consider a lay man could perform the rite. It is the same thing with the use of holy water. For example when Ellen, the inn-keeping lady of the roadside diner that is a meeting place for spirit hunters, comes at the end of the season for help after her diner and everyone in it were burnt to ashes, she is asked to drink a glass of holy water to make sure she is not possessed. This is definitely Catholic, but at the same time always performed by non-believers or even atheists. This is a reference to a religion from the point of view of people who are totally unconcerned by it as if you may not believe in God but God believes in you. Does he?The special gun John Winchester had saved and kept for its final task and that he had traded with the yellow-eyed demon for Dean's life and that still had one special bullet, was in fact the key to the door of the crypt that enables the armies of hell to come into this world. But the weapon only and not the bullet. The gun was recuperated, too late, by the Winchesters and the bullet killed the yellow-eyed demon, or can we be sure it did?That's when the tale turned ironical and sour. The poor Jake who had accepted, willy nilly and more nilly than willy, to be the servant of the demon did manage to open the gate and thus to enable the yellow-eyed demon to enter the final pentacle, but he was shot on the spot by the Winchesters. He probably died smiling since he thus saved his mother and his sister. But he got nothing out of the deal at all. That's the irony of those devilish missions: the possessed do what they are supposed to do, and at times it takes a lot of energy from the demon to convince them. Like in this special case, where Jack has a mission that a demon or a possessed human could not accomplish since they could not enter the pentacle, but otherwise demons only take possession of human bodies and use them as \"meat suits\"But this second season has a touch of itself first of all in the constant debate about the worthiness of the fight, the worthiness of one brother being ready to die for the other and vice versa (if it were true they might even die together one on top of the one on top of himself.) This debate is constant, deep in many ways and perfectly well acted for us to believe that what is mostly a verbal claim no one ever makes true is probably true for these two brothers. That the father accepts to die in the place of his sons is normal since his sons are his heirs, his continuation into eternal human life. But for two brothers it is surprising especially since in our common vision of two brothers, even twins, and these are no twins, there is always some amount of hostility when it is not hatred and jealousy, which is indeed present in these two brothers. That can be explained by the fact they grew up apart from the world, taking care of each other while their father was hunting this yellow-eyed demon that killed his wife/their mother. Also, the animosity would rather be localized between Sam and John, Dean being the lever, the path between these two characters that have antagonistic trajectories.Those two brothers are so much in love with one another that they are ready to sacrifice their whole life for an adventure together. This is not inhuman. This is superhuman. This is an idealistic vision and the actors make us believe it is true, possible. That level of intimacy between two brothers is admirable and beautiful, even if, deep behind my mind's eye I kind of doubt it a little bit.There is a last remark I want to make on this season. The South was finally represented this year with Mississippi, but in a rather unfavorable light as a place of demons, curses and other devilish traffics. Yet Mississippi is the place where the resurrection of Sam is purchased. We are no longer dealing with anything Christian here but with something like voodoo, the originally African religion of the Blacks in the South that has survived in spite of all the Christianizing performed by the whites over the centuries.But this leads to the plain fact that all black characters are evil in a way or another, either because they are easily manipulated by some demon or evil mind, or because they are sort of genetically evil, even Special Agent Victor Henricksen, who is shown as unable to see beyond his book of rules, and who is turned upside down and made a fool of by the two Winchester brothers and their female and not so much experienced lawyer. And fooled is a euphemism: he turns out to be a plain dummie. But the FBI agent will remain on the tracks of course because he is a Fox Beyond and you may choose, Insanity, Intelligence, Intuition or Impotence.We could say that they are doing wrong while hoping to do good : nave would be a better word to describe them. Jack is hoping to save the ones he loves, but doesn't understand that the whole planet will die, while the Winchesters brothers are willing to die for the sake of humanity. The FBI agent is not trying to understand what is going on but wants to catch two fugitives that are threats to his un-supernatural world, where a ghost belongs in a book. He is too rational to understand, maybe to good at what he does to think outside his pragmatic, Cartesian referential mind. And he lacks the creativity or the beliefs that what is really and what he sees are two different things.The season ends well since it has finally redeemed the father and created a tremendous suspense as for the future since in twelve months Dean will die. That's not much time with all the evil spirits that have been released from hell.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU with the help of Ivan EVE"
B000MVIAUY This is another fun filled, action packed, well written season with the Winchester clan.  You just can't go wrong with this set...something for everyone here!!"
B000MVIAUY This show is amazing. I know what you're thinking. Two pretty boy actors on a CW show? Can't be any good. But brace yourselves. They actually keep their shirts on! In fact, they're usually wearing layers. The show takes itself seriously, gives a lot of love to monster mythology and does a tremendous job of going through season story arcs. Season 2 is where they start to have a little more fun in the show and the dark humor shows up. They really begin to find their stride. If you've somehow missed this show, you need to correct that mistake right now."
B000MVIAUY If you are a fan of the show you want to have this dvd set.  I love the outtakes and extras it makes paying for the set worth it."
B000MVIAUY you have gotta check out Supernatural. At first glance I thought that a CW horror show would suck, but this baby doesn't shy away from the gore at all. The classic rock music really sealed the deal for me, not to mention the hot chick of the week vibe it has going for it. The two main dudes, Sam and Dean, who can make or break a show like this, are both very natural and easy to root for. The second and third seasons are much stronger than the first (which is also great, save for the episode \"Bugs\") with almost every episode ranging from very good to great. The \"monsters of the week\" are always interesting and the major storyline for the whole season really makes you feel the show is heading somewhere. So hop in the 1967 Chevy Impala and go for a ride."
B000MVIAUY Sam and Dean are back, with new Hunters to help them out.  With time running out, and the Yellow Eyed Demon out there, it's a race to get find him, and avenge their dad.  And Soon, Dean makes a shocking deal."
B000MVIAUY From the tear-jerking premiere to the virtually perfect season finale, Season Two of \"Supernatural\" once again demonstrates how much better genre shows get in their second seasons.  Take a look at \"Buffy the Vampire Slayer,\" a show which, by the way, has a heavy influence on this wonderful series.  BtVS, like \"Supernatural,\" had humble beginnings, but blew the audience and critics away with a stellar second season.  \"Supernatural\" does the very same.Everything that was good about the show in the first season was strengthened here.  Dean and Sam's relationship has become layered and, as it is really a story about the bond of the two brothers, becomes the dramatic center of the show.  Replacing the \"monster of the week\" format of season one is an over-arching story that develops throughout the season.  Even standalone episodes contribute to the main story of the season.  If the high level of continuity maintained in this series is enough to get the horror/fantasy fan in you to get all sweaty, get this.  The mythology is expanded and strengthened.  The black and white, good and evil of demons/humans gets thrown into that grey area we're all so interested in.  The comedy--again, very Buffy-esque--is amped up, including many laugh-out-loud moments.  The battle between the two brothers and the forces of evil becomes way more epic and also more tragic.All of this comes to a head in the two-part season finale, which is--as I mentioned above--a moment of television perfection.  I haven't been so euphoric about serialized television since the moment Joss Whedon'sAngel - Complete Series Collector's Setcame to an end in 2004.Along withHeroes - Season OneandVeronica Mars - The Complete Third Season, the second chapter in Dean and Sam's journey was among the best of the Fall 06-Spring 07 television season.9/10"
B000MVIAUY Great show.  I got into it late but now I am a super fan.  Too bad they have had some really bad recent seasons (8 & 9)"
B000MVIAUY This season is basiclly the exact same as with the first season. Only differences are different characters, different creatures, a couple more story arches start recurring and a couple big story arches are resolved. This season also has the same flaws as the first, it seemed to posess a crazy amount of hot girls and some of the dialogue between Sam and Dean got repetitive. Still enjoyed the suspense, the laughs, the mythology and the action. A good viewing."
B000MVIAUY I was not a fan of SUPERNATURAL after its first season, and indeed I'm not a huge fan even after Seasons Two and Three.  But there is no question that that show made some major strides forward in its sophomore and junior years, deepening the storylines and finding new and innovative ways to structure episodes.  Because one of the biggest problems with the show in Season One was its episodic \"demon of the week\" narrative structure, the show grew far more interesting and engaging.In these two seasons SUPERNATURAL also became a far more playful show, willing to engage in self-parody and capable of poking fun at itself.  In a way, this mimics the way that one of the shows that has most influenced the series, THE X-FILES, grew.  That show for the first couple of episodes was almost unceasingly serious.  It was a great show despite this, but it really took off once -- especially with several extraordinary scripts by Darin Morgan -- when it began mixing in comic episodes.  Season Two of THE X-FILES saw a mildly comic (though mainly jut flat out weird) scripted by Morgan, late in Season Two about circus freaks entitled \"Humbug.\"  But the first out and out laugh fest was another Morgan script, \"War of the Coprophages,\" in which Mulder and a scientist named Bambi do battle against cockroaches.  (Darin Morgan only wrote a half dozen scripts for THE X-FILES, but four of those would be among the ten best X-FILES episodes ever, one of them the Emmy Award winning episode \"Clyde Bruckman's Final Repose,\" which is one of the finest TV episodes of all time, garnering an Emmy not just for Morgan but for guest actor Peter Boyle.)  Certainly THE X-FILES seemed to be an even greater influence on SUPERNATURAL in these two seasons than in Season One.  One Season Two episode, in which Sam and Dean give offer Bobby differing accounts of events calls to mind THE X-FILES episode \"Bad Blood,\" in which Mulder and Scully give contradictory reports of events surrounding vampires in Texas (along with a sheriff played by Luke Wilson -- both episodes were among the dozens of TV episodes or movies loosely based over the years on the great Kurosawa film RASHOMON, which details four incompatible accounts of events in the woods in medieval Japan).  I don't know how much of this can be credited to Ben Edlund (creator of THE TICK in all his forms, as well as a writer on FIREFLY and ANGEL) joining the writing staff.  But in every way the writing in these two seasons showed a sharp increase in sophistication and flexibility.  The scripts in Season One were stiff, uninteresting, and frequently just flat out boring.  That was rarely the case as the show progressed.  No doubt part of the improvement stemmed from the producers gaining new concessions from the CW, which surely allowed them to stray away from the standalone, episodic format that so thoroughly hampered the show in Season One.I frankly found just about every episode in Season One of the show to be completely forgettable.  But several episodes in Seasons Two and Three stand out.  For instance, one particularly good episode in Season Two does some great twists on the genie legends, with the help of an excellent guest performance by BATTLESTAR GALACTICA's Tricia Helfer.  That episode is emblematic of the new maturity of the show.  I can honestly say that I was not surprised (nor scared) by a single thing that happened in Season One.  It was almost intentionally predictable.  But in Helfer's episode there were some truly interesting twists and surprises.  In just about every way, the show got better in these two seasons.I'm still not what one might term a major fan of the show.  Even after three seasons it is a fairly conservative show.  It certainly has done little to redefine the horror genre and it has not expanded the scope of horror or fantasy in the way that either THE X-FILES or BUFFY did.  Still, there is a great deal to say for a show that is excellent even if it is not innovative.  And I admire any series that gets better as it goes along.  I received the first three seasons of the series as a gift, but I frankly did not think I was going to continue with the show after finishing the three sets.  But now I both plan to buy Season Four come this September and DVR the show upon its return this fall (it will be going against a very similar show with what is surely a pretty substantial audience overlap, FRINGE -- why do networks do this? -- the only then that FOX assures in doing this is that both shows will get lower ratings than they might otherwise -- still, FRINGE is a show I really love, so I'll keep up with SUPERNATURAL via DVR).  Hopefully I'll enjoy Season Four as much as Seasons Two and Three."
B000MVIAUY Yes, the two leads are handsome and they may attract young female viewers.  But this is not some beefcake sitcom. This is Supernatural, a very dark and often gloomy story of two brothers who cannot live a normal life because they must carry on their father's legacy of demon-hunting.  This has dogged them since they were young and watched their own  mother die from a demon attack.What complicates matters is that the younger brother, Sam, has some psychic abilities which sometimes put him at risk.  Their father even told Dean that he might someday have to kill Sam to save him from himself and to protect others.  This leaves Dean with a sense of anxiety that never lets go.What I really like is that many episodes do not have some happy resolution; instead, the two brothers are left brooding on the life they are forced to live and the complications of their relationship and knowledge of each other.  No wife or kids for these guys; they are stuck on an endless road trip, running from harm or trying to destroy demons before they attack someone else.There are occasional lighthearted moments for comic relief--thank goodness.Think of this as a cross between Buffy and the X-Files. In fact, many XF writers and producers now work on this show, and it has the same foreboding atmosphere and music."
B000MVIAUY Special Features: \"The Devil's Roadmap\", \"Webisodes\", three commentary tracks, gag reel, deleted/unaired scenesThere was no witchcraft involved in the success of \"Supernatural\". The show benefited from top notch writing, direction and performances with just the right dash of quirky humor to offset the horror elements of the show. The second season of the show picks up right where the first ended. Dean (Jensen Ackles) and Sam (Jared Padalecki) have located their dad  (Jeffrey Dean Morgan) and have the fabled gun fashioned to kill demons in their possession. The trio confront the Demon that killed Dean and Sam's mom only to find it leaping from person to person finally possessing their father almost forcing the boys to kill him. Driving the Demon out of their father the trio escape with the gun believing that they can still track down the creature, find out why it has harvested children with special psychic abilities and how it plans on using them in its \"war\" against humanity. Then a truck hits Dean's 1967 Impala. Sam is injured but alive and Dean is on the cusp of death with internal injuries. John makes a deal with the Devil or, in this case, the Demon they were pursuing--take his life for Dean's. Before he dies John whispers something to Dean which will resonate throughout the rest of the second season.We get three commentary tracks on \"In My Time of Dying\" (director Kim Manners and actors Ackles & Padalecki), \"What Is And Should Never Be\" (writer Eric Kripe) and the first part of the season two finale \"All Hell Breaks Loose\" (Kripke, Manners and writer Sera Gamble) along with deleted/unaired scenes on three episodes.\"The Devil's Road Map\" is exactly that; a map of the United States showing where each episode takes place in the country You can click on each spot and see material from John's book with writers like Whitley Striber discussing the various monsters. We also see behind-the-scenes footage of the writers/producers discussing the creation of various episodes such as \"All Hell Breaks Loose\". These are essentially featurettes on each episode and they are kind of cool.  We also get Jared Padalecki's original screen test on videotape. The quality of the screen test is typical for home video cameras as it was really never intended to be shown. It's kind of cool to be able to contrast his first take on the character vs. the final performance from the pilot episode and subsequent character development over the course of two seasons.We also get three \"webisode\" featurettes including \"The Inside Scoop with Ivan Hayden/VFX Supervisor\" discussing the visual effects of the show, t
B000MVN8GK Veronica Mars - The Complete Third Season is pretty much a mixed bag. This was the last season of this cult classic and I can understand why this show was cancelled. Kristen Bell who plays Veronica Mars is a good actress but the plotlines and glossy writing is too much. The characters were one-demensional and artifical. Stick with the first two seasons instead, season three was a snoozefest."
B000MVN8GK I just couldn't wait to watch it, I don't know, when I saw couple of episodes on TV I was like \"nothing special\", but when I decided to give it a shot and start from the beggining....LOL I just fell in love with it. So after 2 seasons I was completly addicted to it. Season 3 is as funny as previous ones, lots of my favourite characters (of course Logan and Veronica:)) I also liked the previev episode of season 4..but I don't know if the season 4 was actually made or if the series was already cancelled:(( What a schame it would be, really great thing to watch:))I enjoy getting new dvd's to my collection like Veronica enjoys the thought about getting a PONY:)))I think this caracter is very funny-I WONT MORE VERONICA MARS PLEASE !!!! Whoever is in charge PLS!!!"
B000MVN8GK This was such a wonderful series. The acting was so superb. Why do series get cancelled and the trash stays on? I will never understand, but thanks to Amazon.com, I have streamed and watched every episode and will probably watch again. Yes, I know there will be a movie out next month, but that is just not the same is it? Better than nothing maybe, but this series was cancelled with so many open questions. Like ending in the middle of a sentence. It neve should have been cancelled. Such a waste."
B000MVN8GK After all the fuss with the film, I couldn't wait to check out what the show was all about. I'm addicted! I can't believe they ever canceled this show."
B000MVN8GK Such an awesome series.  Too bad it ended without closure, though.  Makes me leary of watching new series, because that seems to happen a lot.  Loved Veronica throughout the series, however, she was a little over the top in this last season with the&#34;cutie pie&#34; behavior.  Bu
B000MVN8GK This series has for the most part been enjoyable to watch. The process of finding the guilty party holds your interest."
B000MVN8GK Loved this series.  We were so into watching that we had a hard time stopping.  We watched the total season one episode after another until we finished it.  Great season."
B000MVN8GK I just enjoyed it..it was always a well written script a good mystery andthe relationships were real. good job!"
B000MVN8GK We began watching Veronica Mars because it was recommended. Glad we did watch - loved the characters and the fact that they kept showing up. Dick Casablacas was a character who was difficult to like - just shows what a good actor Ryan Hansen is. I hope they keep making more Veronica Mars..."
B000MVN8GK Based on a lot of the reviews that are already posted here, I don't think there are a whole lot of people calling it like it is. So, I will take it upon myself to be the voice of truth about VERONICA MARS season 3. There are 5 star people raving about it because they love the show and are unwilling to accept the truth and there are 1 star people who aren't giving the 3rd season a fair assesment.There is not a single show on TV, not a single one, that my wife and I don't flock to week to week, other than VERONICA MARS and the 3rd season was no exception. As the 3rd season played out, we found ourselves completely involved as we had been the previous 2 season, all the way up to the midseason cliff hanger. A serial rapist. A murder on campus. All the suspense and mystery was in tact and juicy as ever.Then, when the show started back up, all the things that we had gotten involved in were solved in the first handful of episodes. The following episodes were, for lack of better words, UNEVENTFUL. All the way up to the odd and uncomfortable season finale that ended with the yawning cast of a vote.Even my wife was shocked at the abrupt and uneventful ending. What did they do? What happened? Did the writers lose interest? Did the network pull the plug on the show before they wrote the final episodes? This is what I think. Personally, I believe the only thing that explains the weak ending of the 3rd season would be that the writers and producers knew that the CW had given up on them. So, they in turn, gave up on the CW.All speculation aside, VERONICA MARS fell off the table halfway through the 3rd season. The charm and personality of the characters and actors involved was still intact, but the stories being told were in par with a fledgling show instead of a show that has given us some of the best television moments around over it's 2 1/2 prior seasons.The CW just needs to face the facts. The ratings that they're suffering aren't because of quality of show, but because of lack of STATIONS and lack of bribing the NIELSON and ARBITRON companies... like the big boys do... cause we're watching... and unfortunately, we're not watching VERONICA MARS anymore."
B000MVN8GK I love this show, I can't believe it only lasted 3 seasons. The main character is only a teenager but is very savvy!"
B000MVN8GK Sad that it's the last season. It's a great show. I love the characters. The show can get pretty dark, but also very realistic. Looking forward to the movie next year!"
B000MVN8GK Okay, I got &#34;hooked&#34; in amazon.com prime viewing Veronica Mars 10 years after this program first aired, and in the interest of those who were and are like me, late to the program, I won't provide spoilers. That being said, I'm really so into this major plot line that I did jump ahead to the grand finale, and now I am watching all the 2nd and 3rd seasons the way one eats popcorn or salted peanuts--I hate having to stop watching and go on to real life. I find that no matter what episode I watch, there is a great deal of continuity of story line, characters that Veronica's sleuthing bring to life, and there is such genuine warmth between the father-daughter pair that make this series worth the time and trouble to watch. You could label me the &#34;mountain girl who finally had time to see old TV shows worth saving&#34;, oh but perhaps too trite. Anyway, what keeps me into this story is the completeness of every episode, and the way the final episode wraps up the characters very nicely. It keeps you guessing right to the end, no matter how many mysteries you've see on TV or in the movies. Sorry that this is one for the history books. Well written and acted."
B000MVN8GK First, I love Veronica Mars. Cleverly written, generally well acted, good production values. Not to mention that Kristen Bell is a little doll! I would rank the first two seasons among my top 10-15 all time favorite shows. It started out strong in season 3 as well, but then began fading. By this time, several interesting characters were gone- Kendall Casablancas (Charisma Carpenter)and Aaron Echolls (Harry Hamlin)most important among them. Another problem with the third season is that there were too many threads left hanging and unexplained subplots, perhaps to have been picked up in the 4th season, which never materialized. I suspect that late in the 3rd season, cast, crew, and writers knew they were not to be picked up for another season, and everything started going downhill. If you haven't seen this series, you may be able to find some episodes online to see if you like it. I was poking around free TV sites (legal sites, paid for by advertising, of course)when I first found this series. But then if you do like it, I would say the first two seasons are probably a buy, but could only marginally recommend the 3rd season."
B000MVN8GK Well, now I know what all the hype was about and why they are making a movie. Because the series was cancelled suddenly with NO ENDING!!! How dumb are these TV execs to cancel a show without allowing an ending? I must see the movie when it comes out so I know how it ends. Kudos to Kristen Bell and the guy who plays her dad (can't pronounce or spell his name) and all the friends and boyfriends. I hope we get to see all these characters again soon!"
B000MVN8GK My wife & I remember this series when it was on TV, but we did not pay it much attention. The teen-love-triangle-high-school-drama had been playing itself too much. However, recently, while being on bed rest for a few weeks & coincidentally seeing the new movie previews; I was intrigued by the hype. Then I decided to give it a try. (We are Amazon Prime Members & I saw it each time I logged in to watch a streaming show) It was better than we expected! It genuinely delivered - Veronica (Kristen Bell) sublimating her grief & pain into finding her best friends murderer, while helping her dad & fellow high school students with individualized cases - after they had all abandoned her due to the events of her father, then the sherif of Neptune, suffering at the hands of the wealthy, powerful parents. The stories, the filming, the writing was very good! We were completely addicted to the show and watched it until it came to the final episode. Yes, it had it's cheese & some Episodes did not quite hold true; it was still a very good series, launched many young Hollywood actors & actresses as well as showing up some faces of previous young Hollywood actors/actresses now playing adult parents to this generation. We will be seeing the movie this weekend-now that I'm off bed rest! (Can one be a Marshmellow in post-haste?)"
B000MVN8GK While entertaining, this season seems more contrived than others.  The personal ties from earlier seasons added continuity to the episodes. These connections are often missing on the college campus.  Still the series is entertaining."
B000MVN8GK Always loved watching this series.  Also watched latest Veronica Mars movie - it was great."
B000MVN8GK I absolutely loved this show. I see it has been listed as a cult thing and I'm not sure what that means. I'm a very senior Senior so my interest may be surprising but I had a hard time doing anything else until I'd finished watching the last episode. All the good things said about this series are true--I was just very disappointed to learn that it was ending with this season. I have recommended it highly to several friends, but haven't heard their feedback yet. What a gem!"
B000MVN8GK This is entertaining for both young teenagers and up through older adults - probably kids too. I tries it out and was soon sucked in by the excellent character actors, most of all Veronica. each epidode has multiple plots and sometimes there are great 2 episode stories. Everything links back to 
B000MVN8GK Couldn't think of a thing.  It is too bad the show ended after 3 seasons.  Just watched the VM Movie.  It was just enough to tie up some loose ends, but opened up new mysteries that I suspect will remain just that...mysteries.  The very last episode was really depressing.  Keith's roll especially was sad.  Always the bridesmaid; never the bride was wearing a bit thin.That being said; I loved it anyway.  Logan and Veronica - epic saga, spanning vast continents...to paraphrase LoVe.  If you haven't watched this series it is so sweet, sad, cleaver, romantic, mysterious and wonderful.  Yep, I'm hooked and got my hubby to watch all 3 seasons and the movie.  We have grand kids, so it is fun for all ages.  Ah, to be young again.  Not!  Just kidding.  Watching VM made me remember why I was glad to graduate HS and never looked back.  It is painful being a teenager and this series was a reminder (fictional though it is) how vulnerable and at risk they can be.  Food for thought."
B000MVN8GK Wait, Veronica is a freshman at imaginary U!  Not being a fan of the original Veronica Mars series, I found this one hard to swallow and even harder to engage in.  Maybe old fanboys and girls will enjoy seeing their favorite characters &#34;aged&#34; for this new series, but as a newcomer I found little to like or engage me."
B000MVN8GK nothing really too special ...but it is rather etertaining.....wouldnt buy it but its included in prime so i watch from time to time"
B000MVN8GK Although I am not completely through season, I have enjoyed the eleven episodes I ave watch.  I paused to was the movie version that was real eased in early March and to go on my trip to St Louis, Mo.  But I do plan to resume binging on Veronica Mars to complete season three.  I have thoroughly enjoyed this show and thank Amazon for making it possible.  The cast, including guests performed superbly and made the show a legend within its rights."
B000MVN8GK - Veronica (investigating Piz's car, from which his moving-in stuff had been stolen): \"It doesn't look like they jimmied their way in.\"- Piz: \"It wasn't locked.\"- Veronica: \"College campus. All your worldly possessions. Where are you from? Brigadoon?\"Nope, Neptune in Cali isn't exactly as  magical as Brigadoon. Neptune, like most places, hides its share of festering secrets and nefarious intents, which keeps busy the hardworking Mars Investigations agency, staffed by Keith Mars and his ever resourceful 19-year-old daughter Veronica. So for this 3rd and final season, we again say hello - and bid farewell - to these folks up in Neptune. With high school flush in her rearview mirror, part-time shamus, now full-time college student Veronica Mars turns her sardonic attention to life at Hearst College. But some things simply don't change for our feisty heroine. She still helps out her dad in the gumshoe department and still suffers an exhausting relationship with her emotionally fractured bad boy of a boyfriend, Logan Echolls. And she still touts a rep for ferreting out, and digging in, and nosing about. And, since she does get results, she's soon up to her neck putting out fires and solving campus dilemmas.Some plot SPOILERS follow.VERONICA MARS - THE COMPLETE THIRD SEASON is still very good, but it's the weakest of the three seasons. This time the main ongoing story arcs revolve around Veronica hunting down a campus serial rapist and sleuthing another baffling murder. On a smaller scale, her mystery plate is heaped with servings the likes of a stolen team playbook, some missing tapes, an accusation of plagiarism, a vanished heiress, a secret society, a holdup at a costume casino party, etc. So add that to her freshman woes. And, being Veronica Mars, she also doesn't take long to alienate an activist sorority and a raunchy fraternity, as well as the weasely assistant of her criminology professor. But at least her crime solving is made easier by her gigs as Library Helpdesk girl and as the photographer of the college paper. And she's always got her buds to lean on, Wallace, Mac, and Logan, even if their onscreen appearances are sporadic (just one reason this season isn't as good).But the show's not all about Veronica (it's just mostly about Veronica). My second favorite character in the show is Keith Mars, and he has his own messes to muddle thru. Logan continues to have his own issues and comes close to overdoing the tortured soul thing; Wallace juggles basketball with his mechanical engineering aspirations; Weevil is now out on parole (from his misdeeds in Season 2) but must maintain a job; and Mac, well, she's still shy. Meanwhile, Veronica's clique widens in the forms of the happy-go-lucky, kinda dull Piz (Wallace's roomie) and party girl, kinda dull Parker (Mac's roomie). So, hello, new loves and old loves, and there's even a hasty wedding. As usual, it's a blending of heartbreak and mystery and life lessons and surprises. Just life in Neptune.SPOILERS end.So I managed to blast thru all 20 episodes (plus extras) in one sleep-deprived - but worth it - marathon viewing session. Something to be said for watching your favorite shows on dvd instead of television, the dvds lending an instant gratification and an immediacy which suck in the viewer even more. Having said that, not only am I bummed out about the series's abrupt demise but pretty upset that there wasn't even a proper ending to the series. Again, only 20 episodes here, with the last one leaving its audience hanging off a cliff. Not cool, CW.Two paragraphs now about the plentiful bonus stuff, which can be found on the 6th disc (there are 6 discs in all in this set). Most interesting and quite bittersweet are the two segments devoted to what would have been Season 4: one's a 12 minute clip giving us a feel for what the next season would've been like (Veronica in the FBI), the other has the series creators talking about their pitch presentation for season 4 and their planned new direction for the show. Both segments, to me, feel decidedly unsettling because most of the familiar stuff (ie: the town of Neptune, the school backdrop, Veronica's father and circle of friends) had been taken away. A whole new mess of characters are introduced, all of whom I felt a bit hostile to.Under the banner \"Going Undercover with Rob Thomas\" (and with his sycophantic right hand man Dan Etheridge) we get 9 ho-hum featurettes: \"Main Titles: Why the Change?\"; \"Rob's Directing Experience\"; \"Favorite Guest Star Moments\"; \"Veronica Mars: Mean Girl\" - in which series creator Rob Thomas addresses the public outcry that Veronica was too mean in season 3; \"The Politics of Veronica Mars\" - concerning the negative reactions to the show; Thomas goes over his \"Favorite Veronica and Logan Moments\" and his \"Favorite Veronica and Keith Moments\"; \"Do-Overs?\" - scenes of which Thomas wasn't too fond; and \"Highlights\" - more of Thomas's fave moments. Then 24 minutes worth of 16 unaired scenes with Thomas's intros; a 7 minute gag reel (best was Enrico Colantoni's many takes of \"I finally got the police report on the ****'s suicide\"). The Webisode gallery offers 5 clips, the most fun of which is Kristen Bell and Chris Lowell Q & A-ing each other. There's also a guidebook which breaks down the episodes. A ton of extras here, so I shouldn't gripe; yet I wish Kristen Bell and cast had done an interview or even an episode commentary.For three years VERONICA MARS has delivered the goods, consistently bringing it with the clever and the funny, with the heartwrenching angst and the occasional melodramatic twist. Once in a while, my thoughts were even provoked. Along with the crisp plotting and snappy banter, the show presented relationships that were complicated and fluid and real and multi-faceted mysteries which perplexed. But by this season's end the show had kind of broken away from its normal pattern, that of each episode being pivotal and acting as chapters to one cohesive storyline. The last five episodes instead tended to be self-contained ones, and that's when the show really began to feel fractured. There are less gems here than in the first 2 seasons, although most of the episodes are still darn watchable. If I had to pick favorites, three episodes instantly spring to mind: \"Debasement Tapes,\" in which Paul Rudd guest stars as a rumpled, near alcoholic rock star living off his old glory; \"Postgame Mortem,\" in which a moping Logan ends up babysitting a cheerful 11-year-old girl; and episode 20, which ends the series just as things begin to get darn good.In the acting department, Jason Dohring (the ever moody Logan) again stands out. Enrico Colantoni continues to make a case for his character Keith Mars as being the best dad in the universe. My most cherished moments in the series have to do with Veronica and Keith doing their daughter-dad thing. There's just this amazing level of understanding, caring, and humor between them, and conveyed wonderfully by Bell and Colantoni. Whenever they're in a scene together, the world is good. And, as always, Kristen Bell, playing that spunky, tenacious girl detective, effortlessly carries the show.But, well, the show's done now, and the superb cast scattered, with Bell having moved on to HEROES and Jason Dohring, to MOONLIGHT. But it's still gonna take a while before the bittersweet lyrics to the theme song stop sticking in my brain: \"A long time ago, we used to be friends.\" VERONICA MARS, you see, it was a very good show. And, to echo Keith Mars on his daughter Veronica, \"I find her nosiness charming.\""
B000MVN8GK Good third season. The only thing that happened at the end is Logan and Veronica didn't end up together, which I was waiting for. A little disappointed. But then I decided to watch the movie."
B000MVN8GK I think it follows the quality of the other 2 seasons without falling in to the &#34;same old&#34; trap.  It stays exciting but ends expecting another season, which as far as I know does not happen.  There is a movie I have not watched yet,  hoping that is as good as the series.  I have enjoyed the series enough to go explore what other movies/shows they have done."
B000MVN8GK This show is fresh and smart and always had clever idea for new cases and stories yet it was canceled ?? When Smallville which is sorta just dragging on these days is going on to it's 7th season. But hey at least that's way better than 7th Heaven which at least isn't coming back. Why can't the CW bring back Veronica if they could bring back the lame 7th Heaven after canceling it. I got into Veronica Mars the most this season, so it really bugs me that it got canceled. Hell I think everything was canceled but Smallville and Supernatural, so why would they have to cut this show too ? It was actually good even if Veronica could act just a little too much like an overly goofy version of Buffy. It was still a really good unpredictable teen detective show and beats a lot of the crap shows that actually weren't canceled this year!"
B000MVN8GK We came into the seasons after they were over on the TV, but thought all three seasons were well written, entertaining, and fun.  It was easy to get attached to the characters and were glad we could watch two at a time because you are often left with cliff hangers.  Sadly, the end of this season left us with a major cliff hanger that will not be resolved until hopefully the movie coming out does.  That was my only complaint.  There should have been more seasons following this one."
B000MVN8GK For fans of the old Veronica Mars TV series, everything will fit like an old glove.  I had never seen the series, but I still enjoyed the movie a whole bunch.  Good for a rainy weekend afternoon.  Doesn't require a lot of deep thinking and no messages to ponder at the end.  Just a good old fashioned murder mystery."
B000MVN8GK The third season was as good as the previous two.  All and all it was a good series from beginning to end."
B000MVN8GK I had never watched this show before and came across it. I was so sad to find out that after season three, the show got canceled. To make matters worse, season 3 ended with a huge cliffhanger. It was a great show and worth keeping."
B000MVN8GK Yet the writing is superb. Characters are interesting. Story arcs are involved and the cast was spot on for the most part. I fired through three seasons in a month. Very unfortunate about the abrupt ending while we are on our 20th season and spinoff of the Jersey Shore."
B000MVN8GK Love Love LoVe Veronica Mars! I won't spoil it for you--but there are a lot of new adventures in store for the VMars crew. And the intrigue, wit, and repartee are still cery much intact. The only thing I was bummed about was the remixed tgeme song."
B000MVN8GK This show was fabulous and I highly recommend it for those who love mystery and action and strong, smart leading female characters!"
B000MVN8GK So glad the fans stayed on them to make a movie, which I did watch as well. The actors are great, the stories as well. I hope they make another movie in a couple years to catch us up with them again."
B000MVN8GK i enjoyed her in high school a bit better.  Though the show still is enjoyable and i would recommend nice fun show that is not completely dumb as many are today."
B000MVN8GK I am disappointed that this show ended after only three seasons.  I love all the characters, especially Veronica's father, played by Enrico Colantoni.  I'll definitely see the movie and hope it resolves all the issues left hanging by the early demise of the show."
B000MVN8GK This season continues to please with it's twists & turns. When characters behaving predictably, it is believably so. The last episode clearly shows that the season ended and the producers pulled the plug without completing the story line, leaving the audience wondering what happens next?  Or what happens to conclude the story line?  Maybe the moving coming out in March will pick up the thread. However I hope to see some of the same characters. We have a girls night out planned for it."
B000MVN8GK With high school now completely behind her, Veronica Mars (Kristen Bell) heads off to college.  In spite of her best efforts, she's stuck in Neptune, attending Hearst College and living at home with her dad, Keith (Enrico Colantoni).  As a result, it's really no surprise when mystery and danger find her again.Veronica's well earn reputation and the person who can solve the unsolvable gets her involved in one case after another.  Who is behind the \"Welcome Wagon\" and steals new student's stuff?  Who would kidnap a monkey?  And where is the missing member of the board of trustees?Unlike previous seasons, there are two bigger mysteries.  The first involves the serial rapist on the Hearst campus.  And the second one begins when college dean Cyrus O'Dell (Ed Begley, Jr.) is found dead in his office.And we can't leave out her personal life.  Her on again off again relationship with Logan (Jason Dohring) creates problems, especially since friend Wallace's (Percy Daggs III) new roommate Piz (Chris Lowell) is also interested in her.  With all this going on, will she ever have time to study?Unfortunately, this is the final season of a show I fell in love with right away.  The mysteries were sharp, requiring concentration to follow every week.  Yet the clues were there.  Veronica has a sharp sense of humor that is wonderful for lightening the mood of the usually dark show.  The relationship soap opera, while at times annoying, never got too bad.  And all the acting was top notch.Having praised it, this is my least favorite season of the show.  And it's not because there were two shorter mysteries and a couple stand alone episodes.  It was because the adult tone, definitely always present, became even more pronounced.  Of course, that's what you'd expect with rape being a subject for half the season.  Even the details of Veronica's personal life made me uncomfortable at times.As a result, I don't recommend this show for young kids.  Older teens and adults will absolutely love this sly combination of wit and noir."
B000MVN8GK Love the characters; the way it ends was traumatizing."
B000MVN8GK I love the Nancy Drew style of this show. A twist to most Private Eyes by having a teenager solving what seems to be real crime on a teenager level. Learning from her private eye dad.. and seemingly real life situations on a college campus."
B000MVN8GK I just wrapped up viewing the last of the Veronica Mars TV shows.  Had to get through all three seasons before watching the new VM movie.  Next to Firefly (another too soon canceled TV show), Veronica Mars is the best thing I've watched in a long time.  Highly recommended.  Great acting, superb writing, excellent &#34;snarkiness&#34; to keep things entertaining and moving along.  I have to say that they actually did a pretty good job of wrapping up entire season with the last episode."
B000MVN8GK this season of veronica mars was thriling it always keept me on edge and always wonting to watch the next episode there is only one thing that i did not like and that was the the season ended and there is no season 4 to go on that is the only thing that i did not like."
B000MVN8GK I have been a big fan of veronica mars for a very long time! I'm not that old, but I have been watching since season 1, and I think that after I'm finished watching season 3, I'm going to watch it all over from the beginning! I've always been a big fan of detective shows. I also watch bones and CSI and so on. I would recommend this show to anyone who likes detective shows."
B000MVN8GK My husband and I love this show. Too bad it was only 3 seasons.  But I hear there is a movie coming out."
B000MVN8GK This was interesting for the series to go from High School to college.  Most of the cast remains and Veronica is on the case again.  The sizzling romance with Logan is rekindled .  The college scene is somewhat believable, but I thought needed a little bit more work.  The last scene was a heartbreaker."
B000MVN8GK The shows writers are excellent.  I like the whole cast of characters.  It's funand it has good contemporary stories."
B000MVN8GK I have Enjoyed all of her series very much good cast of characters and good show themes. writing is great"
B000MVN8GK love the series.  well written, well acted, and excellant all around.  would like to see the series continued.  thumbs up"
B000MVN8GK This was a cool series 3 - Veronica Mars.  I learned to like the characters after season 1 had ended and that's when this series got good. I gave it 5 stars because the show came together so well.  KRISTEN BELL is charming as a modern day Nancy Drew mistery solver."
B000MVN8GK I love this show.  Wish there were more seasons.  They left it open ended!  Very excited about the upcoming movie!"
B000MVN8GK Loved it. loved it. loved it.  Can't think of anything negative to say about this episode I purchased from Amazon."
B000MVN8GK I chose 4 stars because this is a really good television show but I am saving the 5 star rating for a knock your socks off show. I really enjoyed it and if I had the option I would give it 4 1/2 start."
B000MVN8GK Loved it from beginning to end.  And the movie was the ending I was looking for.  tough stories lines but told in a light mood."
B000MVN8GK You must watch all three seasons.A television show that actually deals with classism, racism and sexism.Smart, sarcastic and entertaining."
B000MVN8GK Season Three of \"Veronica Mars\" is often panned by critics and fans alike.  I start my review on that note not because I plan to dispel claims of a decrease in quality (creator Rob Thomas addresses these issues on the special features without dismissing them) but to let the fans of \"Veronica Mars\" know that they have absolutely nothing to worry about.  This is classic V. Mars.Veronica Mars, a show very centered on the high school setting, easily survives something that has killed countless shows:  The shift to college.  Hearst College is a great new location for the majority of the action of the series, giving us many new and interesting sets and a variety of new characters.  Though the show may suffer from too much focus on said new characters (namely Piz, a true tool) instead of established favorites (Wallace catches it the worst here), the lost points are gained back by the strength of the series.  Kristen Bell consistently giving a stellar performance as the titular Veronica.  Usually--I know this is true for a lot of people--the most captivating characters are the supporting ones.  However, Veronica is simply the best character the series has to offer and that's saying a lot, as the characterization in this series is almost always flawless.  With characters like Logan, Keith Mars, Dick Casablancas, Wallace, and Weevil, one can't go wrong.Changes were made (due to pressure from the Network), most notably the shift of the usual format of a season-long arc carried out through mostly standalone episodes to a very different kind of set up.  The season is instead divided into three different mystery arcs.  The first few episodes focus on a rapist on the Hearst campus, the next revolving around a classic whodunnit murder mystery, and the final five episodes (the weakest of the series) are essentially standalones.  They function well enough as standalones, but the strength of the series has always been in it's story arcs.Another plus about this season is the fact that Disc Six is packed with previews.  We get the never-before-seen pitch for what Season Four of Veronica Mars would have been (which never came to fruition, thanks to the idiocy of television executive Les Moonves) and more extras than you will know what to do with.  It is truly a shame that this intelligent series was cancelled, as it was easily one of the best shows I have ever seen.9/10"
B000MVN8GK Veronica Mars is the new Nancy Drew 21st century style. Action packed and lots of fun too.Will wait for more."
B000MVN8GK This was one of the best series I've ever watched. Loved Veronica with her kickass attitude. Wish the series had continued with her going into the FBI."
B000MVN8GK First off, start with season1.  It'll mean more if you watch them in order.  Season 2 was a little random for me, but I really liked the way they pushed it forward with Season 3 (in college).  We are all looking forward to the Veronica Mars Movie next year! (thanks to a GREAT Kickstarter campaign--the fans have spoken and we want more!!)"
B000MVN8GK This review comes from a 75 year old female. I HATED to see the shows end. All the actors were excellent. It was so different and couldn't wait to see the next serial. They don't make good shows any more, just murder and horror ones. What has happen to all the good writers?"
B000MVN8GK Good show.  Wish there had been more seasons.  It is definitely worth watching if you like detective shows.  Also watch the other two seasons."
B000MVN8GK I enjoyed all three seasons of V. Mars.Sad to say: season three was the lastseason but the movie:Veronica Mars opens March 2014."
B000MVN8GK Warning!  Spoilers littered throughout this review!Note:  I'll rewrite the following paragraph soon (pressing matters keeps me from doing more right now) but we now know from reliable sources that Veronica is not going to be back in any way.  She will not be back as a college student and she will not be back as an FBI agent in a reworked format.  The only reason the CW hasn't already made the announcement, according to Kristin of Eonline.com, is that they are afraid of the anger fans will heap on them.  They will deserve that anger!  For me the CW will always be the network that made room for a mother-daughter beauty pageant, a second season of the Pussycat Doll show, and THE FARMER TAKES A WIFE.  It had room for absolutely miserable excuses for shows like these, but couldn't find room on its schedule for VERONICA MARS.  That pretty much tells you all you need to know about the CW.I will revise this first paragraph as soon as we know for certain, but it is not true, as has been almost universally reported, that VERONICA MARS has been cancelled.  As of today this is what we know for certain:  it has not yet been placed on the fall schedule.  The head of the CW, Dawn Ostroff, says that while the VERONICA MARS of the past three seasons is gone, she is working with Rob Thomas and Kristen Bell on a possible future project, which most believe means the widely reported successor series to VERONICA MARS, in which the plot would shoot to the future, to deal with Veronica Mars as a FBI agent.  This would be accompanied with a completely new supporting cast and perhaps even a title change in the show.  Numerous sources have reported and Dawn Ostroff herself has stated that she has until June 15, 2007 to make a decision on whether to pick this new series up.  To be honest, not many insiders are offering fans much hope that this series will be picked up.  But as the old expression goes, \"The opera ain't over until the fat lady sings.\"  Well, she isn't singing yet, but she might be warming up.  We'll have to keep our fingers crossed that the next three weeks will bring some good news.Certainly we need not fear for the long term future of Kristen Bell.  One of the most talented actresses on TV, she is not only lovely but a gifted actress, singer, and dancer all in one diminutive package.  The question is not whether she will be involved in some project in the future, but which one.  Most immediately it appears that she will be the narrator for GOSSIP GIRL (this might not happen if she plays VERONICA MARS in some way, but even if she does, it might be possible for her to serve as narrator--she did do the narration for the pilot that critics saw at the Upfront in New York).If VERONICA MARS is cancelled and we see no more of our pint-sized but large-spirited teen detective, we can, in a way, be grateful that we got three full seasons.  I fell in love with this show immediately and watched it religiously through its entire run.  When UPN inexplicably scheduled it opposite one of my other favorite shows, LOST, I recorded LOST and watched VERONICA MARS live.  Veronica was when she debuted the latest in a string of strong female characters to have arisen in the wake of BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER making TV safe for such creatures.  She was, in fact, the heroine who most resembled Buffy.  The first two seasons were simply glorious, two utterly perfect seasons that topped almost everything else on television.  Season Three, unfortunately, represented something of a slip for the show.  (I refuse it give it less than five stars, however, simply because it was still better than most else on television.)  Many people have felt this and have speculated on why.  My own belief is that VERONICA MARS suffered from network interference.  Both Season One and Season Two were driven by deep emotional needs in Veronica to solve major mysteries.  Season Three had no such deep mystery (though there were two lesser ones) and as a result lacked the emotional intensity of the previous seasons.  No doubt a lot of this was the result of the network putting pressure on the show to make it accessible to new viewers.  We've seen this take place again and again over the years with various shows and the brute fact is:  it doesn't work.  Mainly such an approach wins no new viewers and alienates many of the viewers the show already has.  I spent all of Season Three with a mild feeling of disappointment, yearning for the intensity to return.  Yet, sometimes it did.  \"Spit and Eggs,\" which resolved the campus rape mystery, was as stressful and as wonderful as the best Season One and Two episodes, but it turned out to be the exception and the rules.My own thinking on the \"how to win new fans\" issue with series is that watering down the show never works.  Instead, I think the way to go is to rely on online streaming and DVD to get potential fans caught up.  I didn't, for instance, start watching FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS last fall when it debuted.  But I was able to catch up by watching it on NBC.com.  The CW put up a few episodes for streaming, but only a few.  What they needed to do was place the entire season online for its shows, much like NBC does.  Serial dramas like VERONICA MARS can attract and build up a fanatically devoted fanbase, but you keep that fanbase by continuing to produce a high quality serial drama, not by forcing it to become more and more episodic.  The truth is that networks almost always complicate rather than improve a series through their meddling.Another perplexing problem with Season Three was the near disappearance of several supporting characters.  At times I wondered if Wallace was still part of the show.  And Weevil played less and less of a role as the season went along.  My understanding is that Francis Capra, who plays Weevil, had some health problems during the season (and that medication he was taking led to a rather startling weight gain early in the year with accompanying skin problems--these seem to be on the way to clearing up by season end).  Mac became an opening credits character, but she didn't seem to play any more important role than she had in the past.Still, some things remained really great about the show.  Veronica and her father continued to have one of the most satisfying, if not the most satisfying, father-daughter relationship on TV.  Veronica continued to impress and overwhelm all those disposed to doubt her.  And as a huge BATTLESTAR GALACTICA fan she made the best frakkin' BSG references on all TV (though Dwight Schruette of THE OFFICE and Seth Cohen of THE O.C. gave her a run for her money), even helping one client find a woman she met at the BSG session at Comicon.  But a lot of the passion of the previous years was gone.  TV critics noticed.  For its first two seasons, VERONICA MARS was probably one of the five most critically praised shows on TV.  In Season Three it probably dropped out of the top ten to somewhere in the 10-15 spot.  I blame this entirely on network interference.The most heartbreaking part of the season came with the finale, which left several plot lines unresolved.  This was not entirely the network's fault.  Rob Thomas obstinately refused to do a \"just in case\" ending for the season.  He apparently wanted to increase the pressure on the network to renew the show.  That is one philosophy, but I prefer Joss Whedon's when he was on BUFFY.  His idea was that you never knew whether you would get cancelled (fortunately BUFFY never did, though both ANGEL and FIREFLY would be), so you leave the end of each season in a place where it could both lead into something if you get renewed, but it would be satisfying to the fans if you don't.  EVERWOOD filmed two versions of its Season Three finale in case it didn't get renewed.  It didn't, but thankfully a finale existed that wrapped up the show  Now, unless the FBI Agent Veronica Mars series materializes, we are left with a dangling show.  Moreover, it will dangle most likely regardless, since a time shift to several years in the future will take the show well past the subsequent events on the show.  Networks should do a better job of ending serial drams with dedicated fanbases, but the executive producers need to take some responsibility as well.  I can understand Rob Thomas's reluctance to not go gentle into that good night, but I wish he had filmed an episode that did a better job of wrapping up the series.  As it is, we are left wondering whether the homicidal nutjob Logan beat up got his revenge, whether Jake Kane was once again a part of the show's story, and whether Vinnie Van Low was the new sheriff of Neptune.Television is going to miss this show.  Although NBC debuts THE BIONIC WOMAN in the fall of 2007 (with a crackerjack production staff, a strong cast, and some very good writers, making this look like a more like one of the more promising series of 2007-2008), television is lacking somewhat right now in strong female characters.  In fact, only BATTLESTAR GALACTICA with characters like Laura Roslin, Sharon Agathon, and Starbuck has much in the way of strong women.  I'm delighted that we got to see Kristen Bell portray Veronica for three wonderful years, but I'm still going to miss her mightily."
B000MVN8GK I wish there was more.  Loved the series.On a side note Amazon's video quality seems to have improved from just a few months ago.  They need to work on their app for the Roku 3."
B000MVN8GK My household discovered this series about a month ago.  We'd never seen it when it was broadcast.  We found the cast, actors, and story lines interesting and, considering the relative age of the series, not dated.  Season 3 retained most of the original cast but added a few new ones.  Veronica is now in college but attends few classes.  She spends most of her time solving big and little problems for her friends.  If you like this type of TV you'll like Veronica Mars.  A side note:  Season 4 was planned, trailers produced, but never happened.  Season 4 trailers can be found online."
B000MVN8GK Loved it! Sad to see it go! Love all the spins, performance by actors, and the storyline. Can't wait for the movie to be released!"
B000MVN8GK Another great season of a great show. Too bad it didn't last longer. I can't wait for the movie. Free to watch for Prime members."
B000MVN8GK Crime and mystery in sunny California.  Overall, the series is a great production; characters are well realized and believable story line.  I've watched the episodes a couple of times and it holds up fairly well though Season 1 dates to Sep 2004."
B000MVN8GK This series is a classic. It can't be duplicated. No matter what Kristen Bell does, she will never surpassthis series."
B000MVN8GK I loved all 3 seasons of Veronica. This one leaves you a bit hanging. Excited for the movie. Hoping it will wrap everything all up"
B000MVN8GK The third season ended after 20 episodes. In Previous years there were 22 episodes.In the last episode (20) of season three there were to many story lines that needed to come  to a conclusion.Does anyone know how the story lines ended up - Election of Sheriff Etc.Looking forward to the movie coming out in 2014."
B000MVN8GK This is a good movie to rent if you were into the series like I was. I'm not sure how the producers thought this was a good idea for the big screen. For people who had no clue about the series did not get any back story on the characters who participated in the movie verses the series and why.....It is like picking back up although 10 years later straight from the series....leaving out the cliff hanger from the last season though. For those who did not see the series, I'm not sure will get much from the movie other than, &#34;hey, this would be a good tv series&#34; which it would!"
B000MVN8GK I never watched this show when it was broadcast and I'm glad I didn't because I wouldn't have been able to handle the wait between weeks and seasons. Binge watching this show made it much more enjoyable and I can't wait for the movie because the way the show was cancelled in the middle of a season was a travesty. WATCH IT!"
B000MVN8GK Is it possible?  I love this character!  Maybe because of my childhood fascination with Nancy Drew and this is her come to life in the modern age, maybe because this is the chic I wish I were with the feisty and the smarts and the always getting her man (or lady criminal).  I don't know, all I can say is yes, thank you, more please!  Thrilled for the movie and I really hope we can get a new movie every couple of years, even made for TV.  Keep Veronica Mars alive!"
B000MVN8GK Turned in to marshmellow! Love this show. Wish it had lasted more seasons. Hope that with the movies's success they will restart the seasons"
B000MVN8GK Veronica Mars was not my first option if something better is on, but nonetheless it was a good production and I enjoyed it when I wanted some escape - and my favorites were not on.The abrupt ending of the series was an \"oh no!\". I knew it was coming, but I still cannot believe that the plug was pulled on this show. It had its charm and the plot was getting thick and then....and then....kapowie!!"
B000MVN8GK I've watched all 3 seasons, this is one of the best series I've seen lately. It's to bad that it ended in 2007. I'm curious as to why it ended, somehow the networks always end a good series and replace it with something that flops in a few weeks.Enjoyed it and highly recommend it."
B000MVN8HE Lots to chew on and enjoy whether you were already familiar with these characters or not.  Nice flow to the plotline.  I enjoyed it very much. The writer made her mother's addictive personality an unavoidable inheritance of Veronica's.  Will our heroine embrace this trait as a weakness that she will always fall prey to or will she find a way to make it a strength? This was the consistent psychological thread that deepened the murder mystery and gave the audience a super meaningful connection to Veronica Mars.  All of the characters from her childhood were grappling with a question: to what extent are we unable to throw off genetic proclivities and childhood traumas and other cultural influences in order to walk our own path in life?"
B000MVN8HE I am a grandmother. I really loved the TV series and watched it for the third time on Amazon to prepare for the movie. I was very pleased so many cast members returned to do the movie. I think they all liked the series also. Why did such a fine series disappear from view? I don't get it. What they have on now is a big marathon trying to say that all girls have sex by 14! Well bull to that. Watching Veronica Mars, it made virginity serious and precious. When she was raped at a party, what woman would not feel her loss. The relationship with her father is a rarity in American viewing. She was raised by a single Dad who loved the heck out of her and expected her to love herself. He supported her, but also guided her. Bring her back. We need this series. Thanks for the movie, but it only made me want more of the story."
B000MVN8HE I have to confess after the series opening presentation I never really watched the rest of the series.This was probably made to placate the devoted series watchers that found their programs cut off. Many different series ether just stop or have a pansy wrap up for the last episode. If we are lucky as with \"Veronica Mars\" we are treated to a full length movie that tries to incorporate the essence of the series. With Star Trek there was a series of movies. We can only hope so here.Veronica was a teenage private eye. Now older and supposedly wiser on the verge of getting a cushy law firm job, she is called back home to help pick a lawyer to defend an old boyfriend. He was accused of murdering one of her old classmates. Naturally as we would've suspected she gets sucked into trying to track down the culprit(s) herself. Will she give up the cushy job and her new boyfriend and a new life just to save her old boyfriend and possibly cleanup the local law enforcement at the same time?If you seen one of these \"let's find culprit as the only way to vindicate the suspect\" stories that you see most of them. The worth in this particular movie is that it has the formula and the characters that we've all come to identify with in the series. This film also gives hope that there might be a series of films."
B000MVN8HE My wife is a huge fan of this show and she really loved the movie.  I was a casual fan and was able to enjoy the movie with her. Her biggest complaint was that Logan was so skinny and sickly looking. The team Logan roots run deep for her, haha."
B000MVN8HE I was looking through my Amazon Video selection and I came across this movie.  5 stars!!  I had never seen a movie rated 5 stars. I immediately purchased it b
B000MVN8HE This was a good story as follow up to the seasons of VM. I liked the story and was glad that many loose ends were tied up. I always follow a series and when it stops it is irritating that all the unanswered questions remain. Not so here. Love the character of Veronica Mars, just the right balance."
B000MVN8HE I have missed Veronica Mars so much. It was so sad to see it leave the airwaves after 3 seasons. Seeing this movie was as if it never left."
B000MVN8HE Good quality picture, no problems...makes me wonder why I did not watch the series when it was on network tv"
B000MVN8HE I am fairly certain that when Rob Thomas was developing Veronica Mars over 10 years ago that I was not the demographic he was shooting for.  Well, call me Mr. Staypuff because I'm a genuine \"marshmallow\" fan of this show.  Growing up I was a big reader and quickly ran through all the Tom Swift and Hardy Boys books published.  My next door neighbors were three sisters who had the entire Nancy Drew library which I also read and enjoyed.  Maybe this is why I love this series-  and now this movie.  The characters reunited in another mystery was a lot of fun.  I think the success of the Kickstarter campaign to fund this film starts with Kristin Bell, she totally sells this character and owns it.  Pretty, smart, and sassy she's very entertaining and compelling to watch. A contemporary, darker Nancy Drew strikes just the right note and is credible.  The support cast of largely unknown actors work well together and the sprinkling of known actor guest stars are blended well into the stories.  Of special mention is Enrico Colantoni as Veronica's dad, P.I. and former sherriff Keith Mars.  I only know him from his work on \"Just Shoot Me\" which was a comedic role but he's perfect as Veronica's father.  My only frustration with the series was the seemingly endless poor relationship choices Veronica makes for such an intelligent young woman. That said I was never a team Piz fan and guess her serial boyfriend Logan works the best.  I think this movie gives fans some closure since at the conclusion of season 3 Rob Thomas and company did not know if they'd been renewed or not.  For some critics of the updated presentation, and one who picks on Kristin Bell for essentially not being as \"hot\" as she was 10 years ago and looking like she just had a baby (which she did) all I have to say is don't attend your high school reunion dude, you're going to be disappointed!  Do I here sequel?"
B000MVN8HE I did not get in to the TV series until just recently and then only because it was a free show to watch due to me being part of PRIME.  Well I got hooked.  LOL the movie just increases the hooked that caught me.  I am not sure how it is doing in the theaters and was not able to watch it at a theater....FOR SHAME.....but I did purchase the movie with Amazon before it was released.....see told ya I was hooked.....I will not spoil the fun for anyone who has et to view this movie; but will say that if you miss it....whether or not you are a fan of Veronica Mar TV series, then you are missing a really great movie......and no you do not have to watch the series in order to understand the movie and the past lives of the characters; but hey after watching the movie you may want to delve in to the old series.  Now then one item......told ya I was hooked after watching a bit of the series......another word for hooked is ADDICT.......there is more than addiction to drugs....or to alcohol.....there can be various addictions and being addicted to fantastic story lines in TV series and movies is not truly a bad addiction.....LOL that is unless you are not able to receive regular feedings for that addiction and I am hoping that this will not be the first and only return of Veronica Mars, for that would mean that the producers and writers and directors and actors are NOT feeding us poor addicts to the ongoing adventures that the marshmallow Veronica Mars can delight in."
B000MVN8HE They did a good job recreating the show.  I am glad to have just got in through Amazon since not sure what a movie screen would have done..  Obviously sets up a possible 2nd movie depending on how much it makes."
B000MVN8HE Loved the show. I missed a few episodes so I binge-watched the entire series before watching the movie.It was what I hoped-it did not disappoint. I am not as hypercritical about every detail. I just like the characters, miss them and was glad to see all (missed one) in the movie.If you even remotely enjoyed VM before, rewatch it all and rent this-it wil not disappoint!!!!"
B000MVN8HE Always love the series and this movie was great.  Hope there is more coming.  Kristen Bell is wonderful in this series."
B000MVN8HE From the trailers, I had very low expectations. This film far exceeded those. I had to get used to the style of this movie in that Veronica narrated it, her texts would appear almost as 'bubbles' on the screen from time to time and there were a lot of characters I did not know from the tv series, which I have seen but a long time ago and didn't remember all of them. No matter. I quickly adapted to these and instead enjoyed the mystery.The film corrected one thing and this is a SPOILER. At the beginning of the film she is with a guy and they were an item but it was very clear to me they had no real chemistry. It was with Logan you instantly saw the chemistry. Well, enough said on that.Kristen Bell is outstanding in the lead and I liked everyone in this film.It is beautifully shot, too. I was very impressed with t
B000MVN8HE The cast is largely the same, that's good. But the whole movie just doesn't &#34;gel&#34; with the excitement and sparkle of the original TV series, the first two, anyway. There are flashes of the old character's great acting and it gets better as the movie progresses. But I was left disappointed, I'd expected more."
B000MVN8HE This is a first: An unusual number of five star ratings at a rate that surpasses all of this past years Academy Award (Oscars) nominated movies put together (TOTAL). Also, interesting is that the same fanatic slasher types are hacking the heads off of any one who dares give it one star (or less). Depending on date the same reviewers gave the one star reviews a: 0 out of 25; 0 out of 14; 0 out of 13; 0 out of  12, 0 out of 11. I'm just happy they're not all from Salem.The reason: A large number of people are making sure their Kickstarter funding for this movie proves rewarding.The movie: Simplistic dialogue that could only come from a cliche saturated Hollywood high school apprentice writer. Acting so bad the actors could manage only one short emotionless line then pause for the next actor to robotically respond in kind; back and tediously back and forth. Scenes composed of  95% dumbed down dialogue. Other 5% of scenes composed of a superficial attempt to  appear current e.g. tablets, internet video, Samsung product placement phones. Lot of formula characters e.g. dumb act cool cops; surfer dude; party people; lawyer cutouts; etc.Baddd: How bad? I was ff after 10 minutes and checking it every 10 to see if anything changed. Answer - as blandly homogenized as milk.People! For the honest reviewers not financially invested in this movie; if you want to see quality acting, storyline, sets, props and actually have to think, then watch \"The Best Offer\". It may cleanse you of the effects of this film's shallow banality. As far as the \"fanatic-obsessives\" I hope that VM series wasn't a representation of lives (un)productively lived. Let me know."
B000MVN8HE I am 50 and not in the majority demographic, but I have a teenager and I love watching Veronica mars. I envy her and her fathers relationship. I envy her father for having a teenager that is so together.Anyway, I loved the show, did not watch it while it was on. Binge watched on amazon, then watched this movie on amazon too. Great concept for delivering the film to fans.I think any casual or serious fan of the show would get their money's worth with this. It gave me a warm fuzzy feeling. It was very loyal to the series."
B000MVN8HE Loved the movie! I was willing to pay the higher rental fee simply because fan funding brought the movie to us. The script was well written, the acting was well executed, and I enjoyed seeing everyone back playing these roles."
B000MVN8HE This, to be frank, will not be a very critical post. To my shame, for I am a manly man, I am one of them, whatchamacallit, \"marshmallows,\" a devotee of the late, lamented series, Veronica Mars. This silver screen resurrection was such a damn longshot... How the movie came about says something about the emergence of social media as a determining factor in the film industry. Freakin' yay for the Kickstarter campaign and its 91,585 backers and the shattered records, including that it met its $2 million goal in the first day of the campaign and went on to triple the thing at $5.7 million. The behind-the-scenes story is so feel good. Veronica Mars, the movie, is essentially a love letter from the cast & crew to the fans.A long time ago, we used to be friendsBut I haven't thought of you lately at all...It's been roughly ten years since we last saw Veronica, back when she was a teenaged private eye poking her nose in everyone's biz in Neptune, Cali. The movie's opening sequence fills us in on what she's been up to. Veronica is interviewing for a place in a prestigious New York law firm that especializes in dumping frivolous cases before they get to court. (So much for what would've been the 4th Season premise of her landing in the FBI.) Veronica confides that she got out of Neptune when she was 19, got herself a B.A. in psychology at Stanford, was near the top of her class in Columbia law. Interview over, Veronica hopes for the best.She claims that her amateur sleuthing days are in the rear view and her nosy disposition tamped down. And when her bad boy ex Logan Echolls (Jason Dohring) is implicated in murder and he calls her, pleading for her help, she assures her current beau that she's only going to provide Logan with lawyery advise. So it's back home for Veronica, a reunion with her ex with the baggage and a dive back into a posh but then scuzzy space redolent of leftover angst and reputations ruined and inner demons outed but never exorcised. That unknown murderer lurking in the midst - because it can't possibly be Logan, right? - almost seems a footnote. Just another day in Neptune.The best bits about the television show get reincarnated. It's still ultimately about the underdog, the perceived loser, putting one over the bullies. Very much intact is that marvelous father-daughter synergy between Kristen Bell and the fantastic Enrico Colantoni. Veronica and Logan's relationship is still... complicated. Veronica still cracks wise. She's still incredibly dogged. There's huge gratification in catching up with a host of familiar faces. Everyone came back! Plus, there's a surprise cameo or three. Okay, if you don't know Veronica Mars from Bruno Mars, you won't get it. But this isn't about luring in the uninitiated. See, you've caught me in mid-celebration. I'm still gobsmacked that there's a Veronica Mars movie, and I think we marshmallows suspected it wasn't gonna make tons of money, but so what? Maybe tomorrow I'll watch this again and then I'll notice flaws. But that's tomorrow. This movie is a collaborative labor of love among the filmmakers, the cast, and the ardent, mobilized fans. For now, I'm keeping it on the pedestal.The DVD's bonus stuff:- \"By the Fans: The Making of the Veronica Mars Movie\" - a very cool documentary in which Rob thomas, Kristen Bell and the entire Veronica Mars cast take you from its record-breaking Kickstarter launch to pre-production to the first day on set and beyond! Includes a segment from the backers' perspectives as they show up as extras on the set (00:55:36 minutes long)"
B000MVN8HE It's been some time since the show ended, but the movie does a fine job of pretty much picking up right where the show left off. Many of the recurring characters from the television show have small appearances, but the focus of the movie rests squarely on Veronica and Logan. Like many of the episodes, the &#34;mystery&#34; is revealed in the closing moments in fairly quick order. The mystery, while important, is not the point of the story, the characters are. The mystery is simply the delivery vehicle.The pacing of the movie feels somewhat rushed, but that may simply be due to the number of acknowledgements of the original series that it tries to fit into a mere 100 minutes of movie time. These little glimpses of what has become of Veronica's past life are not entirely necessary. They are there for the fans. But since this was a fan-funded project, it's entirely understandable.One need not have any clue about Veronica Mars before seeing this film. It is capable of standing on its own. However, for those watching the film without first having watched the series, it may come across as a bit shallow as there simply isn't enough time to get invested into what happens with each character, leaving the mystery the sole reason for watching the film."
B000MVN8HE It was good to see all the characters grown up. Good story line and the movie sealed the TV series. Veronica and Logan end up together. I like happy endings and this did it for me."
B000MVN8HE I was soooooo very excited once I found out about this movie, because I was completely bummed when the series ended.  The movie is awesome!  Again...  I found myself sad as the ending approached because I knew it would finally be over.  Farewell Veronica Mars...  you will be missed."
B000MVN8HE I've said it before and I'll say it again; Why did this show get canceled? I was THRILLED when I found out there was going to be a movie, but now that I've just watched it, I NEED MORE! I am excited about the books coming out, but that's just not going to cut it. This show needs to return. I loved seeing all the old characters and Veronica's sass. Cannot say enough good things about this show."
B000MVN8HE As good if not better than Covert Affairs or Person of Interest  and Rizzoli & Iyles but with far more interesting characters and storylines. Strikes a nice balance between mystery and humor and the frustrations of love. The Networks are too busy with reality tv CW, Netflix, Amazon HULU make this happen. One refreshing note among many, how realistic to see Logan put his hand on the wall when they we r e going to kiss after he embraced her. Instead of the usual &#34;slam her head against the wall&#34; (Arrow). Not being familiar with the show, I robowatched the 3 seasons on Amazon Prime and then opted to purchase the movie on Instant Video to watch at my leisure. It's great to be able to buy a movie while it's in the theater."
B000MVN8HE I was late to the Veronica Mars party, but was absolutely thrilled with the movie. I only wish there was more."
B000MVN8HE Glad I watched the movie, though I was never a fan of Veronica Mars TV series. I'm a fan now, eager to see a second one.The acting is low-key but believable. I quickly forgot I was watching Kristen Bell. The detective action is believable, and has a high-octane finish."
B000MVN8HE I own the whole TV series from 10 years ago. I loved her character, a great female role model for the teenage/young adult set. She's smart, resourceful and I love a good detective story because I'm a super sleuth myself so I felt a kinship with her character. I could totally be a detective. While chicks were watching vacuous reality OC shows back in the day, I was more into watching the smart girl kick butt and solve mysteries. The movie was fun to watch for someone who obsessed over the TV series, but probably not for someone who didn't watch it 10 years or or who vaguely remembers the story lines. It was fun to see all the regulars again. The movie was a bit contrived and dorky but I loved it anyway. I would watch the next one if they made one so we can see Veronica and Logan be in love and live their lives together. Also, did Gia die? That wasn't clear."
B000MVN8HE If you were and still are a fan of this awesome series then the wait is over.  Your fix for more Veronica Mars will be satisfied and having all of the actors reprise their roles give me chills and made be giddy.  The fans spoke and acted by donating to Kickstarter to make this film a reality and to all of them I simply say...THANK YOU!!!I definitely want another movie!!!!"
B000MVN8HE Not bad.  Slightly campy and geared toward teenagers.  A few good jokes between father and daughter.  I would probably watch another Veronica Mars movie at home but (I wouldn't rush to the theater).  High school reunion scene reminds me of why I do not attend my own.......funny."
B000MVN8HE I hope they continue to make more. The pace and acting is great, I also love the plot lines. They aren't the usual cookie cutter stories hollywood turns out, these actually have depth, the characters also have depth. Clearly the fans love it to put up the money to make it. Maybe now some smart producer/director/studio will see the wisdom of developing stories for Amazon. This is the first time I've heard of a film being made to order for fans, and I hope it's not the last."
B000MVN8HE This would have been a great TV Movie.  My wife loved it.  My Kids and grandkids all want to see it.  The problem with that is there are 5 offensive words, some hand gestures and genital cartoons in the movie.  Of course I believe all the kids see worse than this at school.  I just don't want to be the one to give it to them to watch.  Leaves me in a bad position for a PG13 movie.  Why did Veronica have to grow up and have such a mouth.  I am in a bad spot because the movie was surprisingly good and had a fulfilling end to it.  I really didn't see it all coming down like it did.  Apologies to the director but I may edit it so I can show it to the kids."
B000MVN8HE As a die hard V. Mars fan, the movie was everything I had waited years for.  The package arrived in a tmely manner, was in excellent shape and easy to open."
B000MVN8HE I am a big Veronica Mars fan and this movie with the extended characters from the TV show did not disappoint."
B000MVN8HE Matein-MovieAn adult Nancy Drew with an attitude and a chip on the shoulder. A Saturday Matinee Movie following or before a Western."
B000MVN8HE I loved the movie I think they did a really good job of tying up loose ends for those of us who were extremely sad the series ended."
B000MVN8HE I saw most, if not all, of the TV series when it was on.  I loved the show, Veronica's sass and the father-daughter relationship.  Having said that, I wasn't obsessed.  A little sad when it departed but I can say that about a lot of shows that leave too early for my liking.  Admittedly I was glad to get back together with the old crowd and I remembered most of the characters.Veronica (Kristen Bell), now involved with good-guy Piz (Chris Lowell) has recently graduated from law school and is on the verge of accepting a job with a prestigious NYC law firm.  But she's drawn back to richy-bitchy Neptune, CA when one-time bad-boy paramour Logan Echolls (Jason Dohring) is arrested for murdering his pop singer girlfriend.  Oh, and it's her 10th year high school reunion.  Against her better judgment, Veronica can't turn Logan down, presumably to help screen defense attorneys.  But it goes further as she digs deeper and deeper into the crime.Thanks to some fine dialog written by Rob Thomas (also directed) and Diane Ruggiero, Veronica is as snappy as ever when it comes to retorts and one-liners.  Logan, outside the murder charge, has redeemed himself and is now a Navy Lieutenant.  His best friend Dick (Ryan Hansen) is still a goofball and a key to solving the murder.  And I'm always glad to see Enrico Colantoni as Keith Mars, Veronica's moral compass.  Those familiar with the characters will likely swoon over the movie.  But even newcomers (like my son) should have a good time."
B000MVN8HE We watched the series and was bummed that it didn't continue. We heard they were making a movie and glad that it released on dvd at the same time as the theaters.  The did a great job continuing the story and with a good ending."
B000MVN8HE I would watch it again. Funny moments that crack you up."
B000MVN8HE wish they would bring back the series.  understand regretably all actors have gone onto better things.  bjut, i'm sure they could  find someone to fill the spots. i liked them 5 stars"
B000MVN8HE This movie is awesome!!  Veronica and Logan and their &#34;epic&#34; love story continues!  I wish the show would come back on the air!!  This great movie makes me hopeful for more :)"
B000MVN8HE Love Kristen Bell...movie/plot is a little sophomoric.  Kristen is such a strong leading character, she needs to star in a movie that has more depth"
B000MVN8HE Finished watching the series just a few weeks ago.  They left us hanging, so we were so happy to see the follow-up.  If this was a TV series, it would still do well today.  (Hint, make more.  Bring her back.)This movie however, felt just like the weekly show.  And as mush as we love the weekly show, we expected more from the movie. There was one obvious continuity mistake.  I'll let you find it.  The mistake makes you feel they were not too serious about doing the film right.Message to the producers... step it up.  Try again.  We want more, but don't take us for granted."
B000MVN8HE Great to see the gang again, sad to see them together in this.  I'm not sure which makes me feel worse, that I watched this or that I paid for it (okay rented).  It started well I'll give it that, but that lasted maybe 5 minutes and then let the shlock begin!  The only thing that could have made it worse would have been having Harry Hamlin show up for a cameo."
B000MVN8HE This is a great movie. I really wish the series would start up again. I LOVE all of these characters. The movie was interesting and kept me interested."
B000MVN8HE It's not that we're soft, like &#34;marshmallows.&#34; It's more like we're addicts for the soft, sweet, heated up, treats that The Veronica Mars show dished out. We're more like raccoons. We can't get enough of that browned, white, semi burned, funky stuff. The movie delivered it. Dished it right up on a reminiscent platter on a brand new table. Yum! Feels as good as ever. And if we gotta dish out more Kick Starter Cash to get Movie Two&#8230; DON'T BE SURPRISED. We raccoons have a tendency to get what we crave, one way or the other. You Dig?"
B000MVN8HE I couldn't believe when they said they were going to crowd source the funding for this movie. But they actually did it and then some. my wife and I have always loved the series, and couldn't believe that they stopped it like they did., a la deadwood, pushing daisies, Fire Fly etc. anyway we loved the movie, we didn't see it in the movie theater, but we have Amazon prime and were able to rent it for 4 bucks....What a great deal. They left the ending so it almost looks like they could do another movie, which would be great!"
B000MVN8HE It was what it was.  With approximately a billion jokes tailored &#34;for the fans,&#34; it's an easy pass if you aren't already a fan of the series.  There isn't much of a story here, and it about equals the quality of the show it's based on.  That said, if you're a fan, you'll probably enjoy it and laugh harder than everyone else in the room.  It'll make you intolerable to everyone else, but you'll feel special."
B000MVN8HE After this movie was over, I immediately pre ordered the novel that comes out next week on Amazon. I can't wait to dive back into the world of Veronica Mars. I wish Kristen Bell wasn't on House of Lies because this would be a perfect show for Amazon or Netflix to pick up."
B000MVN8HE But, t
B000MVN8HE If you were a fan of the Veronica Mars series, you will love the movie. I love the way it was funded by fans too! I think the movie is even better than the series. It picks up Veronica's life several years after the series ended. The mystery is complicated and hard to solve. The decisions Veronica has to make are difficult life changing decisions. The acting was solid, the characters complex, and it looks like a much more expensive movie than it is. I hope they do a sequel."
B000MVN8HE I loved the show and was continually surprised at the excellent writing. I thought this movie would be predictable, but even though there were some predictable parts, it still holds plenty of surprises.  I was blown away, and I hope there will be more movies in the future.  BIG kudos to the writers!!!!  I wish the show hadn't ended so soon."
B000MVN8HE You know the plot. Trashy kids being trashy. The &#34;good&#34; ones are the &#34;poor&#34; ones. The rich trashy kids are just &#34;bad&#34;. Another movie to help the retarded careers of this TV show's actors. They are all old and washed out. But they still try to be hip and cool with their texting and foul mouths, sex videos. Sorry if you can't route for the heroine of the movie it clearly isn't worth watching."
B000MVN8HE I love this movie. We waited a long time for this to come out. My daughter and I watched it twice. It stayed true to the series and did not disappoint."
B000MVN8HE I loved the series when it was on and have rewatched it many times.  I saw it at the theaters and couldn't wait to own my own copy.  I have already watched it many times and love it."
B000MVN8HE Veronica Mars has it all:  suspense, drama, romance, comedy, and action.  For us Marshmallows, it, seamlessly, took us to today's VM; and left us happy and anticipating a maybe-sequel - anything is possible, right?  Thoroughly enjoyed the movie and seeing my favorite characters again.  Outstanding!"
B000MVN8HE It's been years since Veronica was in Neptune but her departure from New York as a recent law school graduate and promising law firm prospect was masterfully done.  Veronica finds her way back to Neptune to help Logan and ends up not only finding herself in the midst of a case that could potentially clear Logan's name for the murder of his high profile girlfriend but a mystery of the murder from the past.  The movie lives up to the three seasons of the show that saw the series end to soon.  One of the many casualties that resulted from the network changing from UPN to the WB to The CW network (i,e. Star Trek: Enterprise).  Both Veronica Mars and Enterprise series didn't die out because of a lack of viewership but the confusion of the changes of the networks.  If you were a fan of the show then you will love the Veronica Mars movie and will make you want to go back and revisit the series' three seasons.  I"
B000MVN8HE Veronica MARS looks like VENUS, but is a down to EARTH girl who is from cliche filled NEPTUNE where no one drives a MERCURY. Veronica narrates the last dozen years of her life so we can catch up, but continues her \"Sex in the City\" style of narration well into the film. She is set to work for a law firm in NYC and has a great boyfriend. When someone from her \"nearly everyone is rich and famous\" class is killed, and the main suspect is her ex-boyfriend. Veronica returns to resume her role as an investigator in the case.This was a made for TV formulaic script, and wasn't done well. If you have evidence to clear your client, you present it to the DA and not the local sheriff who doesn't like you.  I also don't understand why she never returned the calls or answered the phone from her new employer. She could explain what she was doing, if they were willing to wait, fine, if not, also fine. But to simply ignore the calls without giving them the respect and decency to provide them with information to make a decision is immature and irresponsible.What channel has the \"Columbo\" reruns?Parental Guide: F-bomb, sex. no nudity."
B000MVN8HE There's a scene in Misery where the author writes what he thinks his nurse/tormentor wants to read and suffers for his presumption. Her main problem is the fact that he cheated when he explained that his heroine was alive, but there was also the fact that he was second guessing his audience. Instead of writing something that he could be proud of, he wrote something that he thought that the audience wanted. In many ways, the decline in quality of Veronica Mars reflected this issue. In the third season of Veronica Mars, Rob Thomas veered away from the season long arc and the feminist context and chose instead to focus on shorter story arcs and one-off episodes that didn't tie into the arcs. Instead of making the show easy for potential new fans, Thomas disappointed the existing fans.There was also the issue of the heroine graduating from high school. The teenage detective angle worked better when the setting was high school and there was a great metaphor about tying in hard boiled mysteries with high school where no one really is what they appear to be. Buffy recovered from the same setback, but just barely.This movie tries to go in the opposite direction of the third season by making a movie that is solely for the fans but retains that same desperate &#34;LOVE ME&#34; vibe that wrecked the last season. A little fan service is nice. It's cool to see Mac and Wallace again. Veronica working to solve the case and manipulating the police force to do it is fine. It's even nice to see Veronica and Logan fall into their old patterns.Ken Marino has established himself in comedic roles in shows like Party Down and Children's Hospital so why not bring back Vinnie Van Lowe.Yet, a little goes a long way and too much just becomes aggravating. Do we really need to get Piz again? Especially when he is still the nice guy that Veronica basically ignores. Does Madison have to be a one-dimensional villain ten years later? Weevil shows up to AGAIN end up on the wrong side of the law. Krysten Ritter appears and then reminds everyone who she was in season 2. The only strange moment of restraint in the movie was not bringing back Adam Scott as the teacher who had sex with a student even though the movie revolves around Carrie Bishop who accused him of rape in the Mars vs. Mars episode from season 1. When the ten year reunion has a tribute to the dead classmates, you almost expect it to take over the movie since there were a lot of dead high school students on the show.With all the fan service, the director and writer forget to tell a compelling story. It's a two hour episode with references that require the Veronica Mars wiki to fully get. Unfortunately, as you are referring to the Wiki, you are getting spoiled for the rather pedestrian mystery - which should already be obvious since it follows the &#34;really popular cult actor shows up in a minor role&#34; pattern.This isn't a bad movie. It just isn't a very good movie."
B000MVN8HE If you love the tv series, you'll love this movie. The movie sticks to the light-hearted yet dark tone of the series and features the great character relationships and mysteries that made it so strong. Lots of bantering between Veronica and her dad especially. Don't spoil yourself by reading about it - just get it. love love love. Now I want another few years of a tv series."
B000MVN8HE &#34;It's a one time deal, a farewell tour if you will.&#34; After giving up her private eye life, Veronica (Bell) is on her way to becoming a lawyer. When she starts to celebrate after a great interview she notices that someone she went to high school with has been found dead and her ex- boyfriend Logan (Dohring) is accused. She decides to go to her high school reunion and help Logan clear his name, but her old life begins to take over and she forgot how exciting the life of an investigator can be. I will start this by saying that I have never seen the TV show so I wasn't sure what to expect. After watching this I wish I had seen the show, for two reasons. One, so I had a little more back story for each character and two because I really enjoyed this and would really enjoy seeing more of it. Someone that has been a fan the entire time will probably really love this. People like me who have never seen one episode will also really enjoy this. Overall, funny, exciting and very fun to watch. I recommend it. I give this a B+."
B000MVN8HE I had recently watched the series on Amazon and sound this movie did a wonderful job catching up on a series that was cancelled without time for an ending-with a few exceptions-you can only do so much in an hour and a half. It was like going to a reunion. Veronica's dialogue was witty as usual. I had read a review that stated this movie ending could lead to another sequel or perhaps to brining the series back. I vote for brining the series back with a grown-up VM and friends.Rob Thomas proved that a movie can be made well with a smaller budget.James Franco, Justin Long and Dax Shepard all have cameos-James' does a great job making fun of himself."
B000MVN8HE I know this was a true labor of love for everyone involved!! What an effort it must have taken to get so many of the original cast members back for a movie after all of this time. Great show and a GREAT MOVIE!!!"
B000MVN8HE I love me some Veronica Mars!  No, the movie does not give you all the same joy, anticipation and frenzied excitement as the TV show but it was a well done story of people who have moved into the next stages of life with all the decisions, dramas and regrets that can come along for the ride.  Throw in murder, intrigue, and a love affair for the ages...and you have one heck of a movie.  if you like film noir, suspense, and detective movies, check it out.Also, when you do, you support a movement. I believe that if we get a Veronica Mars movie every few years, they will just get better and better because the creator is committed to such excellence and has the vision.  Let's support it and keep the dream alive.  This has been a PSA brought to you by this one fan of Veronica Mars."
B000MVN8HE I had mediocre expectations when I went to see this move, I just didn't want to get my hopes up for a fantastic movie and then have it be a let down. But I was extremely pleasantly surprised with the movie. It was well made, well filmed, gave us marshmallows the answers we've been dying for, and had some great suspense scenes. I was so happy that I made the commitment to this movie that I did, and can't wait to own it so I can watch it again and again!"
B000MVN8HE This movie is really only for fans of the series who need a fix. It isn't the best Veronica Mars storyline ever but if you're a fan you'll eat it up. Admit it, you know you want to watch it."
B000MVN8HE OK, sort of a spoiler. I had heard of Veronica Mars for years, but because I had a night job I was never able to see it. Then came Miss Mars to Amazon Prime. I binge watched, got caught up in the story and hated the fact there was no resolution, no ending to speak of. Did her promising career with the FBI pan out? What about everyone else she was close to in Neptune? Questions, speculations, then rumors of a movie to clear up those loose ends. Now here it is in all its glory. Some of it will make you angry, some parts will bring smiles and maybe some laughs. But it is raw Veronica, a little older, somewhat wiser, but still our girl/woman. I could see possibly a sequel, the door is open, new questions asked some resolutions maybe not as resolved as they could have been, but that is/was her life. Thoroughly enjoyed the movie. If you enjoyed the TV show, you'll enjoy the movie as well. One thing, if you don't already know Miss Mars, go watch the TV show first it helps."
B000N8M43U Point one: this is a very good psychological thriller, full of clever plotting and well played intrigue.Point two: This is part of a huge lifetime opus of Sidney Lumet's work that I am only beginning to savor and enjoy. Am I lucky or what?And the main point: Why isn't Beau Bridges in every movie all the time.Yes you love his brother Jeff. We all love Jeff. But the secret is if the two decided to have a charisma-off, Beau would just stand there and smile and he would win, hands down.I could watch three hours of Brau Bridges chuckling and grinning and lounging around with Robert Preston as the affable Dobbs and feel like it was time well spent. I'm transported back to a more civilized era.And the add James Mason casting shadows and angst everywhere and you've got yourself a show.And if you ever want to see that magic in action, this movie should be the first place you go. Tha man does gymnastics for crying out loud, in slacks and a tie and without missing a beat!Please enjoy!"
B000N8M43U A former student (Beau Bridges) returns to his old Catholic prep school after ten years, this time as the new Gym teacher, Mr. Reese. His free-spirited approach is in sharp contrast to the dire mood he finds, especially from the sour Latin teacher, Mr. Jerome (James Mason- LOLITA, JOURNEY TO THE CENTER OF THE EARTH). Reese quickly discovers a dark secret among the students. For some reason, simple pranks have escalated into dangerous acts of brutality. Just what has Reese stumbled into? After allying himself w/ the kindly Mr. Dobbs (Robert Preston), Reese tries to solve the mystery behind the almost ritualistic violence. Can they get to the truth before someone is killed? Meanwhile, Jerome seems to mentally disintegrate before their eyes. CHILD'S PLAY is a deceptively calm film full of macabre atmosphere and sacrilegious imagery. The fiendish finale is perfectly bleak and disturbing..."
B000N8M43U This is one of those plays that may work brilliantly on stage, but is hard to translate to the screen. The cast is great, the director talented but the movie never quite gels into anything substantial."
B000N8M43U Child's Play (Sidney Lumet, 1972)It is exactly thirty-eight minutes into Child's Play where the movie stops being a fuzzy, slow-moving mess and becomes something that actually seems like a Sidney Lumet film. The scene takes place in the chapel of the boys' school where the entire film is set. Robert Preston (The Music Man), who plays Joe Dobbs, the headmaster of the eleventh-grade class, an English teacher much-beloved of the school's pupils, is standing at the front of the chapel, facing the altar. In a pew a few rows behind him is Jerome Malley (A Touch of Larceny's James Mason), the headmaster of the senior class, who teaches Greek and Latin and, as a holdover from the days when corporal punishment was accepted in schools, still has the nickname \"Lash\". Dobbs delivers a monologue that sets up the entire rest of the film, at least the bits that haven't already been set up. And I can almost imagine Lumet, at the end of that scene, smacking his fist into his other palm, pointing at Mason and Beau Bridges, the other main actor in this movie, then pointing to Preston and yelling, \"THAT is the quality of acting I want to see from you idiots!\"He gets it for the rest of the film.Plot: We open with Paul Reis (Bridges) as a senior at the school, on his way to see the headmaster, Father Mozian (They Might Be Giants' Ron Weyand), for the very, very serious infraction of drawing some obscene pictures on Malley's chalkboard. He's being escorted by freshman teacher Dobbs, who cautions young Reis that, while such actions may be amusing, they're not likely to get him anywhere in life. The camaraderie of the moment is shattered by one of the school's jocks lobbing a basketball at Reis' head--it would seem that Reis is what Jean Shepherd calls \"one of the nameless rabble of victims\" in A Christmas Story. Dobbs defuses the situation and everyone gets on with their lives. Fast-forward nine years. Reis is now a phys.ed. teacher who's sick of the public school system and has returned to his alma mater to take up a vacant position there. He and Dobbs pick up just where they left off, as great friends. Reis seems willing to bury the hatchet with Malley, but Malley is driven to distraction by his mother's imminent death, which he believes is being hastened by a series of anonymous, harrassing phone calls, and assaults on his own character (which include, but are not limited to, pornographic magazines being ordered in his name and sent to his home, as well as notes being passed by the students--it is never explicitly stated, but made obvious nonetheless, that all of this is homosexual in nature). We find out soon enough that Malley was supposed to retire at the beginning of the year, but refuses to do so because he is adamant that Dobbs not take over his job as senior headmaster; he considers the affable Dobbs not only unfit for the job, but in fact an agent of Satan himself (he believes Dobbs to be behind all the magazines, notes, calls, etc.). Reis walks into the middle of this, and while he's not explicitly tasked with choosing a side, his unexpected, and unlikely, ally Father Penny (King of the Gypsies' David Rounds in his first feature appearance), the oft-tipsy religion teacher, warns Reis that it's going to happen eventually, no matter how neutral he tries to stay. While this is the main conflict, there's also the ever-present bullying that, as we know, Reis is all too familiar with...but this class aren't just bullies, they're sadists; in the first act of bullying to which Reis is witness, by the time he manages to pull the children off, their target has damage severe enough that the hospital believes he may lose an eye. A second victim is mock-crucified, at which point Father Mozian is forced into considering whether to expel the culprits--which would, almost immediately, cause the school to shut down, as they comprise half the senior class (and thus, half the senior class' tuition). Assuming, of course, the authorities don't shutter it first.There is a great deal going on here, and the late Lumet manages to herd these cats very nicely once the movie finds its rhythm (which, admittedly, takes thirty-eight minutes). Mason, Preston, and Bridges, of course, were all known commodities by this time, and was there ever any question they were up to the material? As a simple portrait of the nasty goings-on at a boys' school, a generic slice-of-life drama, this would have been a damned good movie. But the final twenty minutes, which turn it into something very different indeed, take it from \"good\" to \"blow the lid off.\" In the hands of a lesser director, or performed by lesser actors (and to be fair, there's a time or two where it seems like Bridges is about to slip over the line), this could have come off cheesy, if not unintentionally hilarious. But it is meant to be horrific, and it succeeds. This is tragedy of Greek proportions, with the school's gang of bullies functioning as the chorus of harridans, and had the first thirty-eight minutes been as taut and compelling as the final hour, this would be Lumet's second five-star film in my library (Dog Day Afternoon is the other). Even with that considered, this is another guaranteed slot in the top thousand for Mr. Lumet; the brilliance of the last sixty-two minutes downright overwhelms the unfocused, muzzy quality of the first thirty-eight. **** "
B000N8M43U Many spooky moments ! Good storyline good acting ! James mason is excellent ! I would have bought it had it been available to do so ! Please put it up for sale soon amazon ! If you enjoy old horror you should watch this one !"
B000N8M43U This is an excellent movie.  It is not the \"chucky\" horror flick, it is heavy duty drama which in its own way is a \"horror flick\".  The actors were excellent and the story good.  It's story that fringes on true horror. The evil intentions of one in authority manipulating the innocent towards the destruction of their own soul; by committing atrocious vile acts against others.  I gave this movie five stars for the extremely talented Actors, Director and Writer of this film. I had almost forgotten what a really good movie was..."

B000NHRTAO Sorry, but the other reviewers are leading you astray. As usual, (re)viewers fall in love with a show and think it can do no wrong. Well, plenty goes wrong in Earl's second season---mainly the scripts.The writers are milking the same old laughs, and even a bunch of decent guest stars can't make this nearly as funny as season one. They try to get outside the box at times, but when all of your characters are basically morons, things get a little stale after a while. The trailer park humor worked for a season, but now it's just old.The only really funny thing on this show now is Joy; Pressly does a great job of making her lines come alive, show after show. Everyone else seems caught up by the slowly increasing weakness of the scripts. There's also the feeling that now that the formula is set, let's milk this puppy while we can. Randy and the cleaning lady are especially flat by the middle of this season.This season has its moments, but it also has loooong minutes of pedestrian writing and nothing interesting going on, and cheap attempts at weak laughs.Didn't think this would jump the shark so soon.Earl's list should now include, \"Had a good, really funny show and then made it boring.\""
B000NHRTAO Season 1 was simply fantastic. This is slightly a let-down. Probably because the novelty has worn off slightly. As we know Earl is a no-good guy who discovers Karma and decides to undo some wrong things he has done in the past. The persona of Earl is still very sweet and maybe one positive thing is that the episodes are somewhat less aggressive in tone than sometimes in the first season but it is nevertheless not as great."
B000NHRTAO I love My Name is Earl and all the kooky characters on this show. I thought I paid a great price for this season 2 of this funny show. I would recommend anyone in the world to get any season of this hilarious comedy show. I love this show! :)"
B000NHRTAO Earl and his crew are great. Love the Karma thing. Each season gets better. Great gift idea. Each show the characters develop farther. Guest stars are great."
B000OC2T4Y I've never been the type of person to get excited over television.  I like my sitcoms because they're easy to follow, even if you miss a week, and reruns barely ever get old (I think I've seen every episode of `Friends' twelve times over), but aside from that I really can't say that the idea of following a shows premise all season long interests me.  It's easy for me to miss a week and then find myself lost and wondering what is going on.  There are really just a few shows I've watched religiously; `The Sopranos' being one, another being the early seasons of `Nip/Tuck' (I lost faith after the disastrous third season).Well, you can add `The Riches' (as well as `Damages') to that short list.  As we head further into season two I feel compelled to write my review of the first season before too much blurs together.Like I said, following a show all season long seems like a daunting task for me.  When that show sinks its claws into you and refuses to let go though, you find it much easier to plop down in front of the TV every Tuesday night.  That's how things went for me with `The Riches'.  After deciding the `Nip/Tuck' was so behind me I needed to find something to fill that void.  I happened to stumble onto a encore showing of the pilot for this new `provocative' show called `The Riches' and within the first few minutes I was hooked.  Watching this cute little girl con someone then turn around and reveal that he was a cute little boy was enough for me; I was in.The shows premise is that of a traveling family (modern day gypsies), the Malloy's.  Dahlia has just been released from prison and her husband Wayne and three kids (Di Di, Cael and Sam) have come to bring her home.  Dahlia has her own set of problems, most instigated from the time she's just finished serving, but when Wayne decides that the life of a traveler is just not for them anymore the Malloy's find themselves in a hole heap of trouble.  Segregated from the rest of their traveling family, which includes Dahlia's crazy cousin Dale, the Malloy's find themselves on the run for their lives.  When an unfortunate accident costs a young wealthy couple their lives Wayne and Dahlia see this as an opportunity to change the course of their lives.  Taking on the identity of Doug and Charlene Rich, the Malloy's are now living the `American Dream', but is it really all they could have hoped for.The show at times may stretch the boundaries of reality, but that is what makes it so much fun.  The writers are smart enough to make what on the outset may appear implausible seem completely doable.  Looking at the situations Wayne and Dahlia find themselves and the ways they purpose to survive them is enthralling and exciting beyond belief.  What's so great about `The Riches' is that it asks the viewer to really examine what makes them happy.  As Wayne tries to turn his families life around and create a more stable and `normal' environment for his children he ultimately finds himself sacrificing the morals he has already set for them, and while Dahlia tries to support her husband she finds that her life is becoming more and more miserable by being someone that she doesn't want to be.  The children also have to adjust and decide if they even want to pursue a `normal' life if it forces them to change who they are inside.The acting is superb here.  Eddie Izzard and Minnie Driver are phenomenal as Wayne and Dahlia Malloy.  Izzard has impeccable control and becomes the stability in the show, while Minnie steals every scene with her acting range and emotional temperance.  She conveys so much realism with her performance, it's captivating and touching.  All three actors who play the Malloy children are flawless.  Noel Fisher captures Cael's rebelliousness which is really nothing short of his outward display of disapproval with his parent's new lifestyle.  Aidan Mitchell is adorable as young Sam, the gender-bending son who can't seem to decide just who he really is.  But it is Shannon Woodard who really shines brightest here as Di Di, the smart and yet torn daughter who battles herself with their new life, wondering if it's perks outweigh it's disadvantages.Each episode is littered with superb supporting performances by Gregg Henry who plays Wayne's outlandish new boss as well as Margo Martindale who plays their nosey yet caring neighbor Nina.I can't think of a flaw here, at least not one large enough to deter anyone from enjoying the entire season.  Season two has now officially begun and is building strong on its first season so I truly only see good things to come at this point.  `The Riches' help make my Tuesday nights all that much more interesting and hopefully they can do the same for you.  Leave it to FX to create something new and exciting and completely worthwhile.  I may have just been conned out of my Tuesday evenings, but it was well, well worth it."
B000OC2T4Y It was this show that made me realize that the best programs were rarely on broadcast TV anymore.  FX has taken unique risks with their programming.  (Thanks forever, for giving Louie CK the room to do what he does best.  Rescue Me had scenes so heartbreaking, I could barely stand it.)The Riches is a great metaphor for looking at the American Dream through a cynical lens, unique in its kind of subtlety and suspense.  Eddie Izzard did great work, as did Minnie Driver.  What a culture clash--Travelers vs. Settlers.  Why did it end?  I'm so happy for the chance to go have another look at programming I miss.  With streaming video I can really say, there is no such thing as moaning, \"There is nothing on.\"  Now, there really is, always something worth watching."
B000OC2T4Y A bit funny, if you like silly funny.  First couple of episodes seem to introduce a great plot.  Then everything becomes predictable; you almost know everything next on the agenda."
B000OC2T4Y I'm reviewing the season which I loved, Season One.  This season was so fresh and new in premise that I hung onto each episode.  It is great fun from first episode to last.  The premise is that Travelers (American gypsies or Roms) substitute themselves for people who were killed in a car crash.  They hid the bodies and then rolled into a moderate sized southern town as those people.  Since no one in the town knew them, they were able to pull this off.  The husband and father was a corporate lawyer and his wife was the perfectly tended 2nd wife.  The dead people had no children but they add on their 3 children to the mix.  These people have never lived in anything but an RV encampment and have lived on solely their wits for years.  They are expert con men, even the children.  Now they live in a gated community and must convince everyone in town that they belong.  It is always a near thing because, of course, they don't belong but they are excellent cons, both on a computer and off one. Wayne and Dahlia Malloy (Eddie Izzard and Minnie Driver) are the husband and wife and parents of this bunch.  Eddie Izzard is a very well known British comedian and thus he is perfect for playing a man who has to live by his wits and become someone he's not on a moment's notice.  Although everyone else is very good, Izzard is outstanding and it is impossible to picture the show without him.  Season Two just did not come together for me like Season One did but I kept watching because Izzard was still so good."
B000OC2T4Y Ok, here's the thing with this show..everyone in it is excellent..I meaneveryone..the story line is fine and the writing good for the set up.I love the parents and always have but the show falls short of evergetting in the least little bit close to what it could be..I don't know whyit's a disappointment but it is..it's got all this gold and for some reasonit's been cast in lead.  Bummer man, because I would really like to watchthese people..and believe me I have tried more than once."
B000OC2T4Y What a great concept for a series.  Eddie and Minnie are marvelous together with true chemistry.The plot is well written and the story archs are delightful to watch unfold.Like the character traits themselves, you won't be able to watch just one at a time."
B000OC2T4Y Not really a comedy, sometimes stressful, sometimes insightful.  Ends with a question mark, probably due to the writers' strike."
B000OC2T4Y Of all the show that I've watches lately, I must say that this is the best show today. I'm glad that I've own my own copy, so that I can always watch it over and over again."
B000OC2T4Y When I was a young man running my first rig in the Oil Fields in Kern county California, was having trouble with doing jobs faster than the other crews I worked with. One day the man who trained me pulled me aside and said \"You don't get it... They don't want good operators, they want good liars\".In this wonderfully written and acted series, Minnie Driver and Eddie Izzard test that theory, in the world of the upper class, by \"stealing the American dream\".  This series brings the public to a mostly unknown hidden culture in America of the Travelers (Irish Gypsies) which is something cool in a TV show, going so far out of the box of regular TV writing it's in another warehouse.If you want something very different, \"The Riches\" is a show for you."
B000OC2T4Y This show is nonsense.  The people being conned are too stupid to be believed and the main characters aren't much better - really, it's almost painful to watch.  The show gives no credit to its audience.  I only made it through the first long long episode.  Insipid best describes."
B000OC2T4Y I thought this show was great.  The story was very original and entertaining.  I was sad to find that there are only 2 seasons because I could watch much more of this show!  It's got a little bit of everything - suspense, comedy, action and drama."
B000OC2T4Y I found these people to be liars, crooks, backstabbers and cons,yet they are portrayed as heroes, that just does not compute getreal they are crooks plain and simple."
B000OC2T4Y Wow, I love this show.  There is suddenly a big influx of fun, original shows and this is one of them.  It's so cool and addictive and I'm hooked now.Minnie Driver is fantastic as Dahlia Malloy who is part of a family of con artists.  She is on parole from having served time in prison for petty robbery and larceny.  Her and her husband Wayne are now on the move with their three kids.  They're travelling in an RV when they are witness to a car crash, and making a long story short, they end up assuming the identities of a wealthy family, the Riches, and move to an upscale neighborhood in Palm Beach Florida.  Wayne needs to find work to support the family's new lifestyle so his first scam begins when he tries for a job with his neighbor at his law firm.I can't tell you in words just how good this is.  It's such a cool show that you have to check out for yourself.  It's fun and enjoyable and Minnie Driver is brilliant in here.  I love watching how these guys get away with all the things they do and it's certainly addictive.  Get yourself a copy and you'll have a new favourite show for sure."
B000OC2T4Y I loved the characters and concept. Always there was an intriguing cliff hanger that forced me to watch the next and then again, I was never bored. I just wish this never ended. Beware though - it's addictive."
B000OC2T4Y Love Eddie Izzard, good to see him straight acting, proves he can do it. Minnie Driver is great also.& supporting cast."
B000OC2T4Y It wasn't what I at first expected, and actually was better than I hoped for.  It is entertaining to explore the concept of Travelers interacting with whatever they call everyone else...Take it for entertainment value, not a lesson about society and you will enjoy this series."
B000OC2T4Y This is not run of the mill comedy. It has sacrasim and wit. I can watch several in a row. That is a major test for any comedy. Half hour increments can seem entertaining. Watching several of the same show in a row is the major test. This one stands up.The actors are superb."
B000OC2T4Y This show has a wonderful story line that gets your hooked. I recommend giving the show a try, I think that you will enjoy it."
B000OC2T4Y The Riches is one of the most original series ever with characters who are complex and intriguing. Each episode holds you captive as Wayne (Eddie Izzard) and Dahlia Malloy (Minnie Driver) strive to impersonate the Rich family, an immense challenge with their lack of education and experience.This is a series where you never know what is going to happen next or how Wayne is going keep it all together but the love that Wayne and Dahlia have for each other and their children always help them to find a way.Izzard and Driver are simply eloquent. Noel Fisher (Cael), Shannon Marie Woodwood (DiDi) and Aidan Mitchel (Sam) are genuine in their roles as the three Malloy children.I can't wait for this to come out on dvd!"
B000OC2T4Y As my review title goes, this was a great show.  Originally I thought it would be a comedy, but it's more of a drama with a lot of irony.  Not your typical formula show, which is why it was so cool but also probably why it got cancelled (can anyone say &#34;Firefly&#34;?)."
B000OC2T4Y The Riches is the most recent TV show I've been watching, and I have one question. How in the world could they cancel it!? More people watched the premier of The Riches than ever watched an episode of the Shield or Rescue Me. It's also got to be one of the most creative shows I've ever seen! The show centers around the Molloy family, a family of modern day gypsies. Today is a big day for them as the matriarch of their family is being released from jail, after serving a two year sentence. A big party is thrown for her and all seems well in the Molloy family, but things aren't what they seem. The Molloy family is forced to leave their camp. Wayne (Eddie Izzard) is not going empty handed though. Before leaving he cracks the camp leaders safe and takes a substantial amount of money. Once on the road, they run into another family from camp, that had been oblivious to what was going on. It doesn't take them long to realize something isn't right, but before they can confront them, the Molloy's take off and a big highway RV chase begins. During the chase a passing motorist and his wife are killed. The man and woman are Doug and Shrine Rich, and they are on their way to a new home in Eden Falls. Doug was a savvy lawyer, who made a fortune at the expense of others. On this day he and his new wife were on the run also, moving away from everyone and everything they've ever known to move to a new state and into a new house they bought on the internet. Thanks to paper work in the car, Wayne Molloy quickly realizes who these people were and where they were going. It is then that he decides it's time to stop traveling the country and settle into a nice, normal, \"buffer\", lifestyle. Living in Eden Falls as Doug and Shrine. Along with their 3 kids, the Molloy's try to adapt from being a family of travelers to a family of wealth and stability. The show is amazing! There are so many twist and turns, cons and jokes, ups and downs, It's so well written, with an outrageous cast of characters, and most important of all, a storyline I promise you have never seen before!  The show was cancelled by FX in late 2008, but both seasons are available, and according to Wikipedia, Eddie Izzard and the show's creator are currently working on a full length feature film. If you want something different crossing comedy, drama, and action, then I'd say The Riches are for you!"
B000OC2T4Y The group in question is the Travelers--a band of con artists who have apparently been in the U.S. since the 19th century.  This show offers a glimpse into their world, and how odd and sometimes difficult it is for them to try to live among the rest of us.  Eddie Izzard and Minnie Driver do some pretty decent American accents as the husband and wife posing as the Riches.Complications ensue as they attempt to fill the deceased Riches' shoes, working, living, and going to school among the so-called Buffers (non Travelers).  Never a dull moment, as they say."
B000OC2T4Y I tried three times to watch this series, but I cannot get past the first episode, where the main characters (who remember, we are all supposed to be able to relate to)lie, cheat, steal, assault, bilk, pilfer, pickpocket, participate in vehicular homicide and then escape to a life of the super-rich. No, they all should have just been caught, arrested, tried and thrown in prison, end of series.I love Eddie Izzard as a comedian and as an actor, but this series simply crosses my ethical lines; you do not make heroes out of villains, you just don't send that message to the world, unless you make it clear that what you are promoting and supporting and suggesting EVIL as a justified way of life. Just because they are part of an even worse criminal element, that does not forgive them for their actions, which they never have to face, that does not give the producers the right to present an upside-down morality play as if it were OK to just kill someone, take over their life, impersonate them, and go about your business as if nothing evil happened, or that it wasn't your fault.So I'll just prop the soapbox up over here and quietly walk away, while you figure out why you want to watch bad people get away with bad things."
B000OC2T4Y This seemed so ridiculous at first, but halfway through my husband and I were hooked even though we both agreed that intelligent people could not be fooled this long.  Also, we would never have friends like these folks in our lives.  They are too immoral."
B000OC3FZQ South Park is a great TV series, one of the alltime best.  The DVD's of the series are somewhat less.  Many of them have the irritating founders of the series with mindless spoofs that you can't skip over.  Worse, this set, among others, has some DVD diskette problems that make the playback freeze-up just when you are enjoying a scene.  Disappionting"
B000OC3FZQ With almost every season of South Park you always have the odd one or two episodes that weren't really that good. Season 1 it was Weight Gain 4000, Season 2 it was Terrence & Phillip in not without my Anus and so on, as with all seasons although you have the bad episodes, you always have your personal favourites but Season 11 is in my personal view the strongest and most unique season to date. With episodes ranging from racial controversy to a trilogy of episodes setting the boys in Imaginationland and ended up with its own DVD releases.Episode 1: With Apologies To Jesse Jackson: This is a Randy Marsh episode and shows the true no holds barred attitude that Matt Stone & Trey Parker have towards writing an episode. Randy is on an episode of Wheel of Fortune and accidentally uses the N word, which causes an uproar and singles Randy out as \"That N***er Guy.\" This episode is obviously a reflection on the American society in relation to the N word and satires the whole subject, extremely funny episode with some great one liners.Episode 2: Cartman Sucks: Again this is another controversial episode but this one is entirely around Cartman, of a night Cartman has Butters stay over at his house and while Butters is asleep, Cartman plays pranks on Butters then takes pictures of it. One prank backfires on Cartman which he's afraid will make people think he's gay, he thinks Kyle has the picture and is ready to show it to the class so Cartman enters on a panicky mission to try and save his skin. Amazingly funny as we see Cartman show some vulnerability.Episode 3: Lice Capades: One of the boys has head lice and Cartman leads a mission to try and find out who it is. Meanwhile in one of the boys heads one of the lice suspects that their environment will be aware of the affect the lice are having and may try to get rid of them. Now it's a race against time to try and convince the Lice that the environment wants to get rid of them. A great parody episode that shows the evil side of Cartman as he goes on this manhunt simply to make fun of the person with lice.Episode 4: The Snuke: One day while in class a young Muslim boy is introduced as the new student, Cartman becomes suspicious that he may be a terrorist and enlists Kyle to help him look into the background of this kid. In a 24 style episode Cartman unwittingly discovers a conspiracy to take down America and its government. This is possibly THE most controversial episode of them all as it made the news in England for the ending, the clear parody of Hilary Clinton is hysterical and makes this an enjoyable episode.Episode 5: Fantastic Easter Special: Stan starts to question the point of Easter which brings him into a conspiracy that has been kept a secret for 2000 years. A great parody of the Da Vinci Code that sees the return of Jesus in one hell of a cool setting and Kyle being Jewish has the opportunity to kill Jesus, will he do it? Enjoy this episode to find out.Episode 6: D-Yikes: Mrs. Garrison is dumped again and she takes it out on the class, the boys get sick of the constant screaming and ranting by Mrs. Garrison and they employ someone to help them out. A classic Mr./Mrs. Garrison episode with one hysterical ending.Episode 7: Night of the Living Homeless: Kyle is approached by a single Homeless man who's looking for some change, after giving the homeless man change more homeless people show up in South Park until it becomes an infestation. Cartman creates a goal for himself to jump as many homeless people as he can on his skateboard, while Kyle and the rest of the gang are on a mission to solve the Homeless problem. This is a great parody episode of Night of the Living Dead which gives yet another great part to Randy and shows how stupid he can be.Episode 8: Le Petit Tourette: One day whilst in a toy store, Cartman discovers something wonderful, something that he never believed that could be possible, he discovered Tourettes Syndrome. He sees a kid swearing and getting away with it and he decides that this would be a great excuse to insult those he hates to their faces and get away with it, little does he know however that him being Tourettes deliberately developes into something much worse which he didn't expect.Episode 9: More Crap: Another great Randy Marsh episode, in which Randy endeavours on having the worlds biggest poo, He's faced by some competition however, by the legendary number one at everything, Bono. I have to admit this is the weakest of all the episodes but it still has its classic moments, especially when Bono is in the picture.Episode 10,11,12: Imaginationland: One day Cartman is out to prove to Kyle that Leprechauns exist, the boys made a deal that if Cartman can prove they exist then Kyle must suck his balls. Cartman does manage to capture a Leprechaun but it was on a mission to deliver a warning to Imaginationland of a pending terrorist attack on our imagination. The boys are picked up by an eccentric man who takes the boys to Imaginationland which while they're there the terrorist attack takes place. Kyle, Stan & Butters enter on a mission to help fight the bad side of our Imagination and the terrorists, whilst Cartman sets out to prove that the Leprechaun was real so he can get Kyle to suck his Balls. An absolutely hysterical trilogy of episodes that show the genuine imagination of the South Park creators.Episode 13:  Guitar Queer-o: Stan and Kyle are the best players on the computer game Guitar Hero and they are signed by a record company who wants to display their skills by then gaining 100,000 points at a show in the arcade. Kyle gets manipulated by the record company and is convinced to get a new and better partner, Stan takes it badly and buys a new game called heroin hero in which he must chase the dragon. Again this is an incredibly funny episode that makes fun of those who take these games seriously and spend way too much time on them.Episode 14: The List: The girls of South Park elementary create a list of who they think the cutest boy in the school is. Kyle is placed last on the list but can't believe that he was placed lower on the list than Cartman, this uncovers a conspiracy that the boys would have never expected. It's a great episode that gives us a nostalgic look at some classic moments from previous episodes.As you can see from the descriptions this is a great set of episodes that everybody should own."
B000OC3FZQ This was at one time a free download. I downloaded it, but never had the chance to watch it. On the 31st, some weird power failure completely disrupted my computer. The unbox player had to be re-downloaded. None of my films or downloads was marked as downloaded, but they began to come back - over 90% of them. The rest I simply re-purchased on unbox - though I had to buy Borat on DVD. When I tried to either re-buy or re-download this episode, I discovered it listed but not for sale. Why? Can anyone at Amazon answer that question - several other episodes are also unavailable. ???? I cannot even seem to delete the useless episode. Que pasa? I give it 1 star because you can't give something no stars - a rating deserved by lots of stuff."
B000OC3FZQ South Park is my favorite show and I watch the season DVDs over and over.  Just when it seems SP has reached its peak, it keeps coming up with creative shows that cover the latest fads in our popular culture and sociopolitical consciousness.  Although \"Make Love Not Warfare\" from season 10 is still my favorite episode, season 11 provides another solid crop of classics, from the openings of \"With Apologies to Jesse Jackson\" and \"D-Yikes\" to the conclusions of \"Imaginationland, Episode III\" and \"The Night of the Living Homeless.\"Disc 1:\"With Apologies to Jesse Jackson\"--Who can ever forget Randy Marsh's faux pas on \"Wheel of Fortune,\" the way he apologized to Jesse \"the emperor of black people\" Jackson, and his fight to ban a hateful slur from society with the help of Michael Richards and Mark Fuhrman?  Meanwhile, a midget author who speaks at the school provides amusement for Cartman and an epiphany for Stan.  Instant classic.\"Cartman Sucks\"--There are several peculiar incidences in this season that put into question Cartman's sexuality.  This episode is one of them.  Cartman takes a picture with a certain body part of a sleeping Butters in his mouth.  When Cartman learns what such a photo means, he tries to take another photo with Butters to reverse it, but Butters's dad walks in on them and sends his son to bi-curious camp.  Of course, SP fans know Butters's dad has some bi-curious issues of his own.  Meanwhile, Cartman must make sure the offensive photos does not get out.\"Lice Capades\"--It is revealed that someone in Mrs. Garrison's class has head lice and the students turn vicious with suspicion.  Of course, SP can't just scratch the surface; if you will, it needs to dig deeper by covering a louse community destroyed by the shampoo treatment.  A lot of movie references in this one.\"The Snuke\"--A new student arrives in class who is a Muslim and immediately sparks Cartman's suspicions.  Turns out there is a terrorist attack planned, but not by Muslims--and it involves Hillary Clinton's unmentionable.  Clinton's voice makes her sound like a down home southern gal, not a Senator from New York.  I like how so much information can be found on the Internet and the blinking 12:00 on the \"24\" clock after the power goes out.\"Fantastic Easter Special\"--Stan questions what easter eggs and bunnies have to do with Christ's resurrection and learns about the secret \"Hare Club For Men\" (where do they come up with this stuff?) A Da Vinci Code style mystery is unveiled and Matt and Trey get back at the head of the American Catholic League who had been critical of SP and said some anti-Semitic things in the past.  Hmmmm, the papal mitre does look like it belongs on a rabbit.  \"Hippitus, hoppitus,\" indeed.Disc 2:\"D-Yikes\"--I love the opening to this one!  I remember when it was first aired I struggled to stop laughing after Mrs. Garrison storms into the classroom complaining about men.  This episode is one of the funniest SPs ever.  I like when Garrison announces she's gay and Stan replies, \"Again?\"  And the name of the lesbian bar is great!  I've never seen the movie \"300,\" but it's a takeoff on that.\"The Night Of The Living Homeless\"--SP is suddenly overrun with homeless people begging for change.  When the boys learn to mystery behind the onslaught of beggars, can they, with the help of some old school NWA & The Posse 8-Ball \"City of Compton\" style rap, save the day?Le Petit Tourette\"--Cartman sees a kid cussing uncontrollably in a toy store and learns that the kid has Tourette's Syndrome (is this a subject right up SP's alley, or what?!).  Cartman is given an idea that makes him so happy he breaks out in song.  Of course, his plan backfires when he starts blurting out things that, to him, are more damaging and offensive than \"%#@& #$!!*() #%!($#@@&/.\"\"More Crap\"--Randy Marsh passes a world record size BM.  when his record is broken, his life's quest is to get it back--but Bono is bound (if you will) to stop him.  I actually agree with the point they make about Bono, but this episode has a very nasty part--and I'm not talking about the BMs.Disc 3:\"Imaginationland\"--OK, the bet Cartman made with Kyle is hilarious.  I laughed to tears when I first saw it on TV, but what does it say about Cartman's sexuality?  Is that a prize a straight guy would want?  I mean, another guy performing the task?  What's up with that?  Anyway, the boys go on a trip to a land of imaginary characters--including my favorite, Pac-Man, though I don't like that he's sometimes given teeth--and it's hit with a terrorist attack.  Yes, terrorists have now attacked our imaginations.  Meanwhile, Cartman takes Kyle to court and Stan and Kyle are taken to the Pentagon for questioning.\"Imaginationland, Episode II\"--That opening dream sequence is from Monty Python.  The terrorists break down a wall and unleash the evil characters of our imagination and now imaginations are really running wild, especially when Cartman's demented Christmas woodland critters show up.  Stan and Kyle help the feds break through the portal to Imaginationland but, just before the troops charge in, Kyle may finally have to pay his debt to Cartman.\"Imaginationland, Episode III\"--With the help of Butters, the good imaginary characters set out to battle the evil ones.  Kyle has to stop the Pentagon from destroying Imaginationland before the good characters have a chance to win.  Al Gore, however, might doom everyone when he sees the evil character from his imagination.  Oh, and the Cartman/Kyle bet finally gets settled...sort of.\"Guitar Queer-o\"--Great!  In typical SP fashion, the importance of Guitar Hero is built up all out of proportion.  This episode shows how Matt and Trey keep up with the fads of pop culture.  I also like this episode because I'm a Kansas fan.\"The List\"--There's a list the girls created ranking the boys in their class from cutest to ugliest and Kyle is ranked last.  That can't be right!  Kyle is adorable!  Something must be wrong!"
B000OC3FZQ Even in it's eleventh season, South Park manages to still be the funniest animated show on TV today.  Proof of that statement can be seen in the opening episode, appropriately titled \"With Apologies to Jesse Jackson\", in which Stan's dad Randy goes on Wheel of Fortune, and gets the wrong idea.  If you've never seen this episode before and are easily offended, well, I suggest you don't watch it.  For the rest of us though, this episode is worth the price of admission alone.  Not to mention the simply brilliant \"Imaginationland\" trilogy of episodes, as well as the very funny \"Cartman Sucks\" and \"Lice Capades\"; which once again find creators Matt Stone and Trey Parker not only pushing limits, but obliterating them.  Matt and Trey also have a fine time spoofing things as well, including 24 with \"The Snuke\", zombies with \"Night of the Living Homeless\", Bono's work (and their Emmy win) with \"More Crap\", 300 with \"D-Yikes!\", and the mega-popular Guitar Hero with \"Guitar Queer-o\".  The season really reaches one of it's best moments with \"Le Petit Tourette\", which finds Cartman faking having Tourette's syndrome.  While season closing episodes \"Guitar Queer-o\" and \"The List\" aren't anything too special, the season as a whole is still another winning and ungodly funny season of the long running show.  All in all, South Park continues to raise the bar for hysterical offensiveness, and we should all definitely be glad that it does, and hasn't become a stagnant shell of it's former self like another long running prime time animated series that will remain nameless."
B000OC3FZQ South Park season eleven is a great season of the show. It contains great episodes and the only time they weren't of classic status was in Lice Capades. The episodes included in this set are:With Apologies To Jesse Jackson- Randy solves the wheel of fortune puzzle with the N word as he comes to understand why being classified by a word is annoying when it reminds you of a past you want to forget. (People who annoy you.)Cartman Sucks- Cartman gets Butter's sent to gay counselling camp as he tries to stop Kyle from showing the class provocative pictures of him. (Eric Cartman's mother called, she found the photo's)Lice Capades- A slower episode where the boys lice symbolize the annoyance we are as inhabitants to the planet. (Smart idea, poor execution)The Snuke- Hilary Clinton is under attack as Cartman plays the part of Jack Bauer in a 24 spoof. (The Snuke is in her Sn*tch)Fantastic Easter Special- Stan learns why we paint easter eggs in a Da Vinci Code Spoof. (Peeps!)D-Yikes- Mrs. Garrison finds a club for others like her but when Persians want to take over it turns into a '300' standoff. (Scissor me timbers).Night Of The Living Homeless- Great episode where homeless people play the part of zombies. (Does anyone have any change?)Le Petite Tourette- Cartman pretends to have Tourette's syndrome in an attempt to say whatever he wants. (P*ss! In your mouth!)More Crap- Randy breaks the world record for biggest crap until Bono steps in as the world's biggest piece of crap.(This show is emmy winning).Imaginationland I,II,III- The boys finally hit on the Iraq war in the most intelligent and entertaining thing they have done so far. Man Bear Pig, Al Gore and the Critterland Christmas Critter's all make appearances as well as Alien, Santa, Luke Skywalker and Jason Voorhies. (The terrorists are attacking our imaginations!)Guitar Queer-o- Stan and Kyle want to be rock stars but the life may be too difficult. (The best use of in show product advertisment since Make Love, Not Warcraft)The List- The girl's ranking of the boys looks finds them all reacting different ways in a more low profile still entertaining episode. (Burn it down, burn it down to the gwound.)The set is the same as all the previous ones with well chosen art work and safe DVD storage with easy access and convenient episode listings/descriptions on the box foldouts. Other than previews the only special features that have been on South Park sets recently are Matt and Trey giving mini-commentaries which are the most honest and entertaining commentaries around despite being under five minutes each.I loved this season, I feel it is has reached a new plateau for the series and hit a new stride creatively. South Park as a concept is a series that is constantly not only changing itself but evolving to keep current. The first two seasons were one thing then season three started it in a new direction through the fourth and fifth seasons. Then season six was similar to season eleven in that for me it hit a new stride and was near perfect beginning to end. The trend of the sixth season grew through the seventh and season eight was another new height for the series. The ninth season started it on a new track through the award winning tenth season to season eleven which for me is another solid season beginning to end (despite Lice Capades which had funny moments but didn't hold my attention, a few more moments of the boys might have fixed this).The recent South Park seasons have been better in the tail end or second run of episodes. I think since episodes are split up in runs from March to May and then September/October to December this is probably because they have more time over the summer to workout idea's ahead of time and improve what they didn't like looking back on the first half.The twelth season is coming out on DVD/Blu-Ray soon and it's not as great as season elev
B000OFME82 Funnier than I thought.  My husband wanted to watch this so bad, and I was hesitant.  The newer seasons are better!"
B000OFME82 And I mean that in every way ;). She looks so pure and innocent. As I said about &#34;Strangers With Candy&#34; I am not sure this series could be shown on TV these days because it isn't politically correct enough. Too many people have forgotten how to laugh at themselves any more.I have also heard that Sarah is kind of like she is in this series in real life in the sense that she is outspoken and sometimes people are offended by her honesty and political incorrectness. Lighten up America (and others), humor and laughing at oneself is better medicine than anything a doctor could give you."
B000OFME82 not funny - not silly - just stupid - really a waste of time if you watch this show ."
B000OFME82 Don't waste your time with season two.  She could be fun if she wasn't so hateful inside.  Not good.  Yuck."
B000OFME82 Moments of real comedy on this show, and sometimes really brave comedy, are almost always followed by moments of truly moronic humor. \"Poop\" jokes are a favorite, for example. Sarah gets points for the occasionally brilliant surrealistic humor, then loses them for her sheer idiocy. It's hard to like this person/character, despite her occasional genius.She is also very anti-semitic at times. But, she is also Jewish. Are Jews allowed to make nasty fun of Jews and also of manufactured anti-semitic hysteria? Anyone else would be declared a war criminal for making a joke about big noses...but apparently if you're Jewish you can go much, much much farther than that. At one point she even suggests the Holocaust was faked. How dare she? To the electric chair! But wait...she's Jewish...I would love to see more Christian and Buddhist and Hindu and Muslim and Jainist etc comedians who have this sort of egotistical self-loathing cushioned by loathing of everything and everyone else as well. But somehow we don't get much of that.Silverman says that's because the media is largely owned and run by and for the Zionists who make the US fight their wars while they run their banks and Federal Reserve, but she is Jewish, so she can say that. It's darn offensive, however true it may or may not be, and I think she should apologize. It does explain her getting to do a show this offensive, though, so maybe it all makes sense. Her boyfriend is Jimmy Kimmel, perhaps the least talented person on TV (quite a feat), so it all fits together in some arcane fashion.In any case, while there's some uniquely weird and funny stuff here, the poop that surrounds it makes it somewhat of a moot point.It ain't normal, so that's a plus.But it's also often so mean-spirited that it just ain't funny."
B000OFME82 This programme surprised me as not veryy funny in lots of ways. By trying to be as offending and gross as possible, Sarah Silverman actually achieves the opposite: she bores us to death at times. There is a great lack in consistency in the writing which makes it very difficult to watch any episode in its entirety."
B000OFME82 I didn't know anything about Sarah other then her famous Jimmy Kimmel song about \"Matt Damon\" & \"Ben Afflect\", and a small interview in \"The Artistocrats\" which made me think she may actually be a hilarious female comic that doesn't just do jokes about how much better a woman is over a man... so seeing this show on DVD for a low price, I figured i would have a look and see if she could make me laugh... and yes she did!The show is like Seinfeld in the way it's about nothing, but I never did like Seinfeld and never will, but the Sarah Silverman Program I will be watching for many years to come. It stars Sarah and her sister, they live in place, they have 2 gay neighbors, a dog, and coffee shop, people call her on the phone, she likes cookies and her parents are dead. That's about all there is to it, the rest of it is just some funny little story of the week to go around it.I think Sarah's gotta be the top female comic in the world today, and very underated, so check out her show if ya want, other wise, why are you reading this? Go away then."
B000OFME82 Liking this show depends on how much you like Sarah. I think she is a funny gal, so I like the show. The show is full of potty humor and she does have a very good \"off the wall\" supporting cast. Since there are only 6 episodes included in season 1, I won't be buying this set unless it drops down in price a little. I can't wait to see season two!"
B000OFME82 I didn't know what to expect when I ordered this. Sarah Silverman is soo darn crazy funny. Season 1 is a must have!"
B000OFME82 It is impossible to watch this show without some kind of strong reaction.  There were times watching this show that I laughed as hard as I have laughed at anything I've seen in recent years.  But there were also times when I was simply appalled at how unfunny and in bad taste some parts were, as if the point had ceased being to make us laugh and had become to shock and dismay us.  There are many moments when I am simply blown away by the brilliance and originality of Silverman's comic vision and times when I wonder if she has any conception of what is funny and what is not.This is definitely not a show for everyone and it has nothing to do with how well one's sense of humor is developed.  There are simply a lot of absolutely terrible moments in these episodes to go along with some hysterically funny ones.  If you can filter out or ignore the bad and merely focus on the good, this is a show you will either partially enjoy or consider a masterpiece.  But if you can't filter out the bad or if you obsess over the bad to a degree where you can't appreciate the genuinely funny bits, then you could well consider this to be one of worst shows ever concocted.I especially loved the initial episode, where Sarah buys some cough syrup that has a decided effect on her perception of reality.  That episode -- and especially Sarah's self-absorption that is so extreme that she almost obtains a childlike innocence -- reminds me very much of the balance that Paul Reubens was able to strike in PEE WEE'S PLAYHOUSE.  Unfortunately, she is not able to maintain that balance through the rest of the series.  I did not enjoy any subsequent episode as much as that one, though the one in which she thought she was dying of AIDS came close.  Here is a bit that presents the show at its best.  Sarah is feeling a bit down so she decides to go get an AIDS test so that she'll feel better when it comes up negative.  As part of the exam she is asked to respond to a questionnaire that tracks her lifestyle choices.  Here is a bit of that dialogue:Nurs:  Did you ever have a blood transfusion in the 80s?Sarah: Yeah.Nurse: (alarmed) You did? You had a transfusion in the 80s?Sarah: (bemused) Oh! Ha!  No--I thought you said in Haiti.Nurse: (even more alarmed) How long were you in Haiti?Sarah: Oh that's hard to say; I was doing a lot of heroin at the time.On the other hand, there are the truly awful moments, most of which cannot be repeated on a board like this.  It wasn't merely that they were off color or excessive or extreme.  They were simply not funny.  And being extreme simply for the sake of being extreme is not funny.  Andy Kaufman could pull that off, but few others.So, this is a show that can only receive a limited recommendation.  More perhaps than any other comedian today, Sarah Silverman invites extreme reactions.  There have been many moments where I have found her to be as funny as anyone alive and times when I can't tolerate her.  I suspect that this is pretty much what you will always get with her.  But I will say this:  there isn't anyone else out there quite like her."
B000OGTRC2 Loved it on TV and I love having it here. I just wish the series has continued because there was much more to tell."
B000OGTRC2 There is usually a &#34;whats going to happen next&#34;  character to these episodes. Well acted, powerful relationships. A nice package."
B000OGTRC2 Jericho is FAAAAAAAAAANTASTIC!!!!!  Ignore the naysayers, watch this series for some enjoyable television.Some GREAT young (and even older) actors and actresses in this series; they do a great job balancing the serious and the comedic elements.Watch this show with an open mind.  There's a big element of &#34;WHAT IF&#34; in this series, and you have to roll with that for it to hold your interest.  Accept that &#34;what if&#34; premise for what it is--the opportunity to observe human reactions to extraordinarily stressing situations in a world gone seemingly mad--and you'll really enjoy this show.Obviously, any television show (or even movie) has practical limitations in how accurately it can depict &#34;the end of the world as we know it.&#34;  Accept those limitations, don't stress out on the over-simplifications.I kind of envy those who discover this series for the first time...getting to meet and know the people of Jericho is a real treat.Enjoy!"
B000OGTRC2 The series is action packed and keeps you guessing who is the good and who is the bad guy. I have enjoyed the series a great deal compared to no acting on reality TV and various contests that make up network TV today."
B000OGTRC2 Really makes you stop and think what if this really did happen in our world what would you do.  Very interesting, has the since of community in it."
B000OGTRC2 A soap opera. Stupid script, bad acting, glaring tech flaws. It promises a lot and delivers a lot of boring stupidity."
B000OGTRC2 I could do without the romance stuff, but otherwise this series grew on me.  wish they kept it going a wile"
B000OGTRC2 I like watching Jericho very much and look forward to viewing each new episode. It's all about small town America pulling together in time of disaster with lots of twists and turns. Very entertaining.  The editing of this TV series could be better. Lots of blank time in between where commercials were but not sure how that could be remedied."
B000OGTRC2 I love this genre but just could not get into this series.Girl leaves town with no gas in the tank, bar full of people ignoring the firetruck as it blasts out a warning that the radioactive mushroom cloud is coming in 45 minutes, the only two cars on the road within 10 miles and they run head on into each other? Who writes this stuff?"
B000OGTRC2 My husband and I enjoy watching in the evening on Prime via the Roku. No commercials, only watch what we want to watch. This series is pretty entertaining. Nice to compare what we would do versus what the town has done."
B000OGTRC2 I think Jericho has some great actors.  Unfortunately the story really isn't as great or as accurate as the writers want you to believe.All these cities have just been destroyed, and yet, more often than not, the people are remaining extremely calm in the small town, and actually having unrealistic conversations about what their future would be like involved in relationships and whatnot.If over 20 cities had been destroyed, setting my sights on my future would be the *last* thing I would be thinking about- just trying to survive should be important enough.  There should be more confusion and uncertainty going on in that small town more than anything else.  Not these emotional scenes that in real life would never happen.There's some nice twists from some of the main characters, but it is pretty hard keeping up with everything, and understanding what's going on can be a difficult enough task.  Still, it's not a bad show, but it's not the best, and it's kind of overrated."
B000OGTRC2 About life after nuclear war. I recommend. It to all adults only.  Amazon you need to buy the rest of the seasons."
B000OGTRC2 Fun to watch folks being completely unprepared for disaster.  Hollywood shows they dont understand farmers and country folk very well but the show and premise are still good entertainment."
B000OGTRC2 It's hard to watch how childish people are.  How we humans get through a disaster, baffles me.  99% of the sheeple just complain and steal and complain, no one rising to the occasion, everyone yelling my brother my father my sister my children, parochial.So I don't wonder this series only lasted two seasons.  The mirror, hurts.Most poignant in the first episode is the narrow-minded mother who accuses the mayor of not knowing what it's like to have your kid 'out there', when in fact Jake is 'out there', and his dad the mayor, doesn't know if he's still alive.  But he has no luxury to think about that, to cry, to worry.But oh, that mother thinks she's supposed to yell at the mayor, to be a good mother.  Instead, she's not only a bad mother, but a bad human being, heedless of anyone but her own ego.  She obviously doesn't even care about her kids;  because if she did, she'd be trying to help, not yelling.Hope someone will redo the series, for we need to see how hypocritical, parochial and ill-prepared we are, to assemble and think through a crisis, always expecting someone else to handle it;  always uninterested in the big picture, uninterested in doing something ourselves, always ready to blame someone else, never paying attention.It was always 'cool' to pay little attention in school.  Only the bad guys run things.  To be disinterested in anything but one's narrow circle, is supposed to be a virtue.  Yeah, and this is what we get for such bad attitudes.So this series really focuses on WHY war occurs.  Dark lesson never learned.  Which you know, because the music is totally at odds with the theme of the series.  Hence only four stars."
B000OGTRC2 This show had me at the edge of my seat. It is realistic as to troubles faced during war or disaster. I wasn't sure who was bad and who was good and I enjoyed it from episode one."
B000OGTRC2 i enjoy the blend of tension with everyday life. this is a solid plot background for that kind of mix.just one question: wth happened with Heather?!Emily and Jake just seems so...trope."
B000OGTRC2 The first season was, in this reviewers opinion, the best television ever made.  The second was virtually unwatchable.Pros:The show is like \"Picket Fences\"PilotmeetsThe Road Warrior. You get the small town dynamics of folks who have generations of family and a lifetime of history then just to keep the storylines from getting too girly you have the whole post apocalypse thing going on.Likewise, there are the moral decisions that people must make. What is the correct action to take? What are the rewards and punishments for that action? In the end, the answers are ambiguous, just like life, but the struggle for moral truth - with all the history and entanglements that folks in a small town have - is almost as compelling as the struggle for survival.While I'm sure it wasn't intended, the series is a powerful endorsement of Federalism. A strong city government maintains order while the federal and state governments collapse. The fact that the city government succeeds is in large part to the small town history of relationships.Cons:If history teaches us anything, human society is surprisingly resilient. While things like Katrina, the Great Chicago Fire, and/or the Great San Francisco earthquake have caused localized destruction of society for short periods, within a few weeks or month's life reverts to normal. Social norms are resumed and law and order return. In WWII Germany and Japan, despite the general destruction of the nation and mass hunger, society more or less functioned.The U.S. is a country of 300,000,000 plus. It is geographically huge. I don't think 10 or 20 atomic weapons would result in a complete destruction of society. The plot addresses this by saying that Jericho was in the middle of nuclear fall out zones but spared due to unique weather patterns. Still, I would suspect that what is left of the United States would mount a heroic rescue effort of these isolated pockets. It just might take a couple of months.The whole CIA/terrorist storyline really doesn't add anything to the best parts of the show and actually distracts from it.Most of the corn in the U.S. is not edible by humans. It is grown to feed to livestock or to turn into corn syrup. I suspect that there would be a lot more hunger in Jericho.Realize that Kansas is tornado country, but found the number of people who had their own backup generators and stockpile of gas a bit unbelievable.Overall, if you can get past the parts that seem unrealistic, Jericho - especially the first season - is as good as network television gets."
B000OGTRC2 I have now come to that stage of life where I have seen every standard TV plot so many times that I am now able to predict the denouement almost as soon as I see the setup and have declared a personal embargo on watching any more shows about doctors, lawyers or cops. While some of the current offerings (House, Scrubs, etc) are quite passable - there are other occupations, and other situations which in the hands of the creative, will offer sufficient interest to keep viewers returning on a regular basis. Shows like \"Lost\" and \"Ugly Betty\" are splendid examples of what can be done by stepping outside of the cop-lawyer-doc box, and \"Jericho - Season One\" is another. Take an intriguing and (for television) a semi-original situation, involve a large cast of interesting people reacting to it and voila - something that will bring back the audience, over and over. Especially when it is a situation that we might imagine happening to ourselves. After 9/11, and Katrina (which provided the genesis of \"Jericho\" to its creators) it is all to easy to imagine what happens when the world we know suddenly ends, right in the middle of all our mundane plans for a perfectly ordinary day.Which is exactly what happens to the citizens of the small town of Jericho, Kansas, to the family of Johnston Green (Gerald McRaney) and their neighbors and friends. Jericho is a small, pleasant place, full of people going about their own business - farming, stocking the grocery store shelves, going through a mayoral election, planning a wedding and enduring an audit by a visiting IRS agent. The school children are off on a field trip and the Green's black-sheep son Jake suddenly appears needing a great deal of money - the only ripple in the pleasant still pool of a modern American life. In one of the most quietly effective sequences, the camera follows two children, playing hide and seek in a back yard, while one climbs on the roof of a shed, and then onto the house roof. The boy suddenly freezes there, silhouetted against the clouds and the sky - and then we see what he has seen; a mushroom cloud, coming up from a line of mountains on the distant horizon.And that is the exact point where the people of Jericho, and a handful of visitors who just happen to be there begin a long slow devolution from the twenty-first century into something that more resembles the frontier West... and then to a condition that looks more like the warring city-states of Renaissance Italy, or classical Greece. First they struggle to figure out just has happened to the rest of the country - and then begins the fight to survive, ending in a cliff-hanger which promises a large audience for the second-season premiere. It makes for a more interesting television show than I had thought, when I first heard about it. The first season set of 22 episodes is neatly packaged on 6 discs. Commentary and deleted scenes are included for selected episodes on the same disc. I would have much rather that deleted scenes be edited into the episode where they belonged, to make a sort of \"director's cut\", rather than having them tacked on as an appendage. The omitted scenes would have done a lot for t
B000OGTRC2 Great writing, believable story line. Great characters, each developed and evolved. Great acting, each done well. An interesting look into a possible future."
B000OGTRC2 This is a pretty realistic view of what would happen during a nuclear war.  I do believe people would come together and help each other.  That being said, communities would come together like they did in Jericho and would help each other, until the food ran out.  After that it would be every person for themselves.  Luckily we don't have to see that.  What we do see is what would happen after a  nuclear exchange.  Modern things stop working, food stops arriving and people that get common injuries and colds all of a sudden become life threatening events.  I like the stories, I like the characters.  Great show all around."
B000OGTRC2 if this show had come on in the last year or so, i feel confident it would have lasted more than one-and-a-half seasons. it was an excellent show."
B000OGTRC2 Yet another &#34;apocolypse&#34; show written by &#34;big city dwellers&#34; who have a total &#34;city centered&#34; view of EVERYTHING.Let me start by sayiing that the premise of the shows &#34;disaster&#34; is not too bad.  We are drawn in by being left guessing as to the nature of what has happened.This is where it wanders off the path.  The small town of Jericho is nothing more than a minature version of New York or LA from other movies.  with the exception of one or two &#34;farms,&#34; EVERYTHING ceases to exist at the town limits.  A character is either &#34;of the town&#34; or an &#34;outsider&#34; and that is it.It is plainly obvious that the writers have never spent any time in the real world, outside of a big city.  Rural America does not work like this.  Small towns blur.  The town limits rarely really limit the towns themselves and they often sort of blend into nearby communities and they really do encompass surrounding rural areas.  This is not europe and the local twons here are not, and never were, the local strongholds, complete with castle.No, while the initial premise of this series is well thought out, the mechanics of it are way out of touch with the reality of life in rural America.  It lost my interest in the middle of the first season and I can readily see why it died so quickly.  Big city dwellers would have no interest, whatsoever, and real rural citizens are just going to take one look and turn it off.  It could have been done much better."
B000OGTRC2 This was a very good series and the characters was great.  The story line is great and their is plenty of action and suspend.  You do not know who to trust and trying to keep order is a must.  It is a sci fi and a thriller with plenty of action.  You can see in this series who people may react to a nuclear attack.  This is a present day civil war within the United States,"
B000OGTRC2 Saw some episodes when it was on TV but missed the rest. Good build of characters. Great story line. Worth the watch."
B000OGTRC2 Pretty good series.  There's not that many episodes so don't get too attached.We liked it.  Typical disaster plot.  Enjoy."
B000OGTRC2 I found this entire series worthy of a 5. Entertaining, and with imagination, and I did not want it to end."
B000OGTRC2 It started out a little slow but the actors and the camera work really pulled this together. After about the fifth episode I was hooked and looked forward to watching the next episode. It was well done except some of the flash backs weren't necessary but all in all I recommend it."
B000OGTRC2 The Jericho premise is fresh and interesting. But I just finished watching the pilot and I find that the story line is weighed down by the poorly developed characters and a lot of cliches about small town America. It is entirely peopled by \"aw shucks\" \"salt-of-the-earth\" folks. The kind of people you will never meet in the real world, not even in Kansas. Maybe the writers should visit fly over country to get a better sense of what they're writing about."
B000OGTRC2 i've had this one for a little while.  I figured it was finally time to check out Jericho and see what the buzz was really all about.  Even i've seen a preview or two of the show.  It didnt really do it justice at all.  I watched the whole series in 3 days time and it left me wanting more 22 episodes packed with all kinds of intrigue, sub plots with the different characters throughtout the show.  It goes without saying that this is one of the shows to look out for in 2008.  With tensions high between Jericho and the neighboring town of New Bern.Along with other things forming in this series it is evident that the show hasnt even begun to hit its stride.  Great characters, well done stories and design make this something all should check sooner rather than later."
B000OGTRC2 This is one of the best series I have seen in a long time. The story is compelling, makes you think about what could really be, and shows how easily we can turn on each other when the chips are down. Each episode left me looking forward to the next....... and then I found out that there is no ending to the series. I couldn't believe it. I searched the Internet from every angle; only to confirm that the series ended with season 2. I did discover that the story continues in what I thought was &#34;book format&#34;, so I eagerly ordered the 'book' for my Kindle; only to find out that it is a comic book, not a real book.So, if you can live with not seeing the series completed, I would highly recommend watching it."
B000OGTRC2 I just do not like the main character.The only person who seems to like him, is his Mother.His ex-girlfriend hates him, his brother is furious with him, his father is dissapointed with him.Nobody (actors, seem to have a clear line on who they're supposed to be).So far, after 7 episodes,for the first Season, I don't know who, or what anyone is either.Is the owner of the general store, just a stone beetch? Is the IRS auditor just a stone beetch?There is so much good TV. I do not have time to try to figure out what the writers of this show were trying to get across. In my opinion, they had a dart board in their office, and threw darts at it, to see which ones stayed.I'm definately, not willing to watch 18 or so hours of this floundering program."
B000OGTRC2 This is a well-scripted, well-acted series.  Every episode is suspenseful and believable.  It's a shame the series was never completed."
B000OGTRC2 This show depicts events that could possibly happen although I pray it never, ever does. It is well acted and am wondering why it only lasted two seasons."
B000OGTRC2 In a word,Trite.  Nothing new or challenging here.  It's the Oxbo Incident rehashed to the nth power. Very predictabledialogue and ideas. Circle the wagons. Pull together. Beware those who don't agree to authority figures in the face ofdisaster. The walls and my patience came tumbling down! FCH"
B000OGTRC2 There were several places that couldn't have possibly been true to what would really happen after a nuclear strike; however, it did represent a small portion of what humanity would turn into in this country. I personally would have liked to have seen the storyline go a little more toward reality, but, I understand that our six-pack society, those who care more about the unreality of hollywood than current affairs, could not handle it. I really liked this show in spite and watched it on a marathon status."
B000OGTRC2 Give current events this is an interesting story line....Gives you something serious to think about...Survival in an unthinkable situation...However...I think the town is taking the situation way too calmly..but they don't have anyother  choice but to do so.Suitable for teenagers and up I THINK .."
B000OGTRC2 Good series.  Has everything.  Some adventure, some sap, some mystery.  Really pulled me in when learn past lives of characters before the bombs."
B000OGTRC2 A well-developed series that will likely appeal to viewers who like books such as Stephen King's &#34;The Stand&#34; and current television series like &#34;Revolution.&#34;"
B000OGTRC2 I know it, this is a friggin' looong read. The short version: I like JERICHO, and I recommend it. Now, here's the long version.SPOILERS, here and there, everywhere.Great, something nutty survivalists and I can agree on. So I really like JERICHO. It's a strong show and addictive, with a tantalizing premise that should geek out almost any casual fan. Today, end-of-the-world stories have become even more fascinating and timely. JERICHO nicely slides into that space, dropping a tale of fear and struggle and of survival and hope. JERICHO tells of frightened townspeople pulling together under duress and facing down each daunting obstacle. As it turns out, JERICHO is also about nuts. There's a memorable scene late in Season One regarding nuts, and even a real life, save-the-show campaign involving nuts.The story begins with residents of small town Jericho, Kansas glimpsing a shocking mushroom cloud blooming, off in the distance. Word rapidly gets out that Denver and Atlanta have become the targets of nuclear attacks, and who knows how many other cities were bombed? Very shortly after, Jericho, population five thousand, finds itself alarmingly cut off, with minimal and dubious contact with the outside world. In the following days and weeks, the town finds itself contending with a plague of challenges, from radioactive fallout to widespread paranoia to roving marauders to the inevitable arrival of shellshocked refugees from affected neighboring towns and cities. All too soon, the town's resources begin to peter out. Just how long can Jericho and its people hang on, before it all falls apart?The collapse of civilization has a way of leaving deep psychological scars. When stripped of the underpinnings of society and government, it's awfully hard not to become reduced to a caveman denominator. Jericho, influenced by its mayor and his sons, tries to cling to its pre-apocalyptic ideals. It makes for riveting viewing as Jericho's tiny geopolitical dynamics are shaken up and a new, more aggressive social culture emerges. It's a whole new world, a crappy, blighted one. The standard of living has devolved. Horses become a popular, fuel-saving alternative to automobiles. Windmills prove to be a seriously viable source of energy. Food is rationed, ammo is doled out, medicine is hoarded. Money loses value. Bartering is the new money. For Jericho, its salt mines provide an invaluable trading commodity. Meanwhile, the residents are still in the dark as to how widespread the destruction is, or if America still even exists as they know it.Despite the post-apocalyptic, sci-fi setting, JERICHO is fueled by human drama. The show doesn't make the mistake of forsaking storytelling for flash. Oh, there are taut action sequences here and there (\"Rogue River,\" \"Crossroads,\" & the final 4 episodes). And the ongoing suspense is there, even though the series commits itself to a slow burn, taking its sweet time in divulging answers (which probably threw off some viewers). But, mostly, the focus is on the characters' development and their personal story arcs, set in a world-gone-mad backdrop. Jericho is a tiny town, with its share of secrets and notoriety. Extramarital stuff goes on, and family conflict. Political wrangling goes on. A local crime lord lurks on the fringes. A secretive neighbor moves in. But Jericho is also a place where redemption can be earned, estranged families reunited, a sense of community galvanized, and a sweet but unlikely romance blossom between, say, a down-to-earth farmer and a prickly IRS auditor.The acting is very good, the performances, for the greater part, grow on one and impact in the emotional gut. It's a pretty hefty ensemble cast, but JERICHO gravitates towards the Greens, Jericho's first family and led by patriarch and town mayor Johnston Green (a wonderfully understated Gerald McRaney), who also happens to be an ex-Army Ranger. It's so nice to check in with McRaney again, as I haven't seen him since hisSimon & Simon - Season Onedays (I dug it whenever Johnston put on his cowboy hat). I like that he and Pamela Reed achieve a certain believability as a longtime married couple. Props also to the hissable Michael Gaston, who plays Johnston's scheming political rival Gray Anderson, a fella you can't help but throw middle fingers at. I'm not sure how much acting chops it takes to make your character so detested, but Gaston pulls it off. It helps that Anderson isn't nasty all the time, and, in fact, fervently believes that he's a guy doing the right thing, and, sometimes, he even does. Meanwhile, while Ashley Scott is a striking actress, I wish more screen time had also been given to the quietly vibrant Sprague Grayden, who plays schoolteacher/car mechanic/engineer/all-around cutie Heather Lisinski. I like her as much as Scott, with both gorgeous actresses flaunting a nice chemistry with lead actor Skeet Ulrich. On a minus, I wasn't digging Dale, that taciturn kid who works at the grocery store. The earlier shows made him a sympathetic character, but, later on, he transforms into an unlikable opportunist.But the two most interesting - and enigmatic - characters happen to be Jake Green and Robert Hawkins. Jake, effectively played by Skeet Ulrich, is JERICHO's stoic central hero and is the Green family's troubled black sheep who returns to town after five mysterious years of absence. No one's privy to what Jake's been thru since he went away, but, there's no doubt at all that his many newfound skills go quite a ways in keeping Jericho afloat in the trying times ahead. It doesn't take long before the townspeople start looking to Jake as their go-to guy. Another intriguing character is the immensely capable, new-to-town Robert Hawkins (British actor Lennis James, here sporting a Yankee accent), who passes himself off as a St. Louis cop (he's not). Lennis James does a great job of ambiguously toeing that line between good guy and bad guy, all the while exuding that dangerous vibe; you're just never quite sure which side he's on (I mean, even his family is wary of him). Regarding Jake and Hawkins, we don't really get the backstory until the episodes \"The Day Before\" and \"A.K.A.\"There aren't a lot of weak episodes here, with each one integral to the ongoing story arc and several being of the heartwrenching sort (\"Winter's End,\" \"Why We Fight\"). Episode 17 (\"One Man's Terrorist\") I wasn't too fond of, that one focusing on Emily's amazingly bland fiance Roger. But then the ensuing five episodes frenetically bring it home. In the months ahead, it'll turn out that Jericho, even with its assorted problems, had fared better than most other places. This makes the town a desirable target. This plays out in the last four episodes, culminating in the slam bang finale as Jericho is forced to go to war against an invading neighboring town. Season One's final episode \"Why We Fight\" ends on a cliffhanger, at which point, CBS pulled the plug on the series. And, boy, did that tick people off. But, thanks to the concerted efforts of its fans, who delivered thousands of pounds of nuts to CBS, the network greenlit a second season in the form of seven new episodes. And thank goodness! Seriously, a cliffhanger is NOT the way to go out!Sidenote: Here's a cool gimmick: Each episode features a different Morse code played over the title shot, which offers a hint of what's going on in that particular episode. I've got to learn Morse code.JERICHO - THE FIRST SEASON comes in a 6 disc package, and CBS doesn't stint on the bonus features. \"Building Jericho\" is the interesting 24-minute-long Making Of documentary, which includes snippets of cast audition clips (of Lennis James, Kenneth Mitchell, Pamela Reed, and Sprague Grayden). \"What If?\" is a sobering 9-minute segment delving into the history of the atomic bomb and the terrifying possibility of a nuclear attack today. You want episode commentaries? Or deleted scenes? You got 'em! Fifteen of the 22 episodes come with either an episode commentary or deleted scenes (or, sometimes, both). The commentaries are mostly by the executive producers (exec. producer/director Jon Turteltaub is actually kinda funny), although Skeet and Lennie James do pop in to drop their own words (Skeet in \"Rogue River\"; Lennie in \"Red Flag\"; Skeet & Lennie in \"Vox Populi\"). Would've been nice, though, to have commentary on the last episode \"Why We Fight.\" Bu
B000OGTRC2 This series is so intense and makes you think! Never expected to have all seasons, but thanks to Amazon I now do!Check it out."
B000OGTRC2 You need to give it a chance, like about 5 episodes. The acting is good but the theme music grates on my nerves. It is harsh and has way too many horns between episodes, but the music in the episodes is right on and the characters are well cast and act their roles well. I don't know how many seasons this show was on, but I'm enjoying it."
B000OGTRC2 Got my attention from the first episode to the last one in season two.  Very time appropriate for our current time in history.  Just the right amount of drama and action for my taste.  Wish it could go on and on but know all good things must come to an end."
B000OGTRC2 This could have been an interesting series if not for the turgid script and the banal soap operish love triangles."
B000OGTRC2 Really captivating series, and the characters well acted.  I liked the ending, just as it should be if ever we face such events."
B000OGTRC2 What would you do during a disaster scenario where information is scarce and everything is headed into a downward spiral? Most likely, try to keep your head above water. That is the premise of Jericho, a smaller city outside of a location that experienced a major nuclear attack. It follows a town as they deal with the likely problems we as a society would face when things turn extremely rough. Sadly, it only lasted for two seasons, meaning at some point the story line will simply drop off, never to be continued. :("
B000OGTRC2 I'm really enjoying this series.  I wish I found it sooner than now.  It's an interesting perspective on what would happen if life changed as we know it.  Will we remain civil or go into anarchy?"
B000OGTRC2 I thought Jericho was a great series. To bad that they seemed to have canceled it in the second season with only 7 episodes."
B000OGTRC2 I enjoyed this series , a show about what happens after nuclear bombs go off in theUNITED states. Some unlikely heroes emerge and a town grapples with their new reality.The writing is good the character development is interesting. Characters with human flaws but stillAble to hold on to that which is good.I enjoyed the first season and now watching the second season."
B000OGTRC2 first few episodes pretty interesting. but as the season moves forwardthe plots are not as interesting and dont develop as much as they could."
B000OGTRC2 I'm not big on spending a lot of time on fiction.  BUT...The wife LOVES drama.  Add a dystopian view to it and she adores it.  This was right up her alley and she would watch another three seasons had they made them."
B000OGTRC2 This caught my attention from the first minutes I started watching. I could not wait to see what happens next. I recommend this series. I have watches both seasons and am hoping for a third."
B000OGTRC2 I really really like this series. At least they got a chance to give closure to the story line, but I can't help imagining what they COULD have done with several seasons. Fantastic story, great character interaction, intense political intrigue. You will enjoy it and then probably wish it could have gone on for more than 2 seasons."
B000OGTRC2 When I first watched the pilot, I saw too many pretty people with nice hair and though they suffered from a nuclear attack far away, no one suffered from soap and water much less styling goods.  As time went on, people complained about lack of goods but it never really makes much of a dent.  The lack of gasoline, etc. is discussed but in the end it really doesn't affect the residents much.  Besides these concerns, I became more involved in the show and the realism of the setting didn't bother me as much.  Actors meld with their characters and they become more interesting and human.  Jericho in Kansas is a place where the bombs were not supposed to go off and be a safety zone for the terrorists who have detonated the bombs.  The residents don't know what went on and only gets bits and pieces as the series moves on.  The main characters are Jake Green, the son of the mayor who has been mysteriously absent for several years.  He seems to have been in Iraq as a soldier.  The other main character is Hawkins,  an African-American man who mysteriously appears with his family for unknown reasons just before the bombing.  As time goes on, Jake and Hawkins appear to be the heros who will save the day.  The series becomes more and more detailed and exciting.  I was impressed with the choice of great actors in the series including Gerald McRainey who plays the mayor, Pamela Reed as his wife and Lennie James as Robert Hawkins.  One of the most impressive things in the series is allowing Lennie James, a British-African actor. to rise up to be a star.  There aren't many black actors being allowed to act and participate in a show except as the buddy and Hawkins is a character who surpasses everyone else without argument.  The series only lasted a year and a half but if very impressive.  It began when the networks were attempting to challenge cable channels with higher quality series just as they did with Lost and Desperate Housewives.  Those shows lasted longer and lost their impact so maybe it was luck that this show was short and still impressive."
B000OGTRC2 Loved this show when it was on. Missed a lot of it at the end of reg. season when we went away on a long vacation so I was thrilled to be able to watch it. Loved the interaction of the characters, the threads of all the little side stories and especially loved the character Jake. A good mystery as well as you try to figure everything out, who is Hawkins & exactly what is he up to? Who are the good guys & bad guys?"
B000OGTRC2 As usual, there are some characters you will like and others who you will love to hate.  So far, so good."
B000OGTRC2 I loved Jericho! Suspenseful and held my interest the whole time. The acting was well done and the actors were excellent in their roles. I appreciated that there was no filthy language and sex scenes!!! It held to family values and a theme that is very possibly on the horizon for our country! Good for is to be prepared!!!"
B000OGTRC2 The characters were awesome, riveting and exciting, just like our neighbors. So realistic. It makes it so real. Thanks to Amazon I was lucky enough to get a chance to watch the series. Six years after it was filmed I had an opportunity to watch it. I just wish it was still on. Thank God for Amazon!"
B000OGTRC2 Love this show. I found I had to keep watching and watching to see what would happen.Looking for the next season soon."
B000OGTRC2 The tv series is enjoyable but not very believable.  Disasters certainly bring out the stupid in people.It was nice to see a show that didn't have zombies."
B000OGTRC2 Kind of low budget but an interesting premise. It was too bad it was canceled. That said this show suffers from what a lot of post-apocalyptic shows suffer from, there is no set end date for the show. It's a great story but with no hard end date they just keep adding plot twists with no conclusion."
B000OGTRC2 I was so sorry to find out that this show was not continued.  It is wrapped up a bit. but it was really good with great character development and storyline.  I enjoyed all of it.At first I thought it was going to be cheesy... but it wasn't.  Yeah, there was some stuff that didn't make sense... like that despite no electricity, the women all had perfect hair.  Really silly... oh and they all dressed great despite the fact that they had no access to the outside world and no way to wash or iron clothing.  That was also silly.  But I overlooked that because it was really a good show and fun and exciting."
B000OGTRC2 I like futuristic films and was never able to watch this onT.V. as my husband does not and wouldn't watch it. Now I get to watch it on my Kindle."
B000OGTRC2 I started off liking the show, but it soon lost my interest.  I found much of it to be rather maudlin.  The series is just not very well written."
B000OGTRC2 Very realistic.  Really makes you think about what would happen if someone did this kind of thing.  How would America react?"
B000OGTRC2 Very well put together drama.  The characters were perfect for the stories being told.  Some of them were new faces who I will look for on other movies and TV shows.  Sometimes the music was too loud and took away from what was happening.  I liked this series.  The end left you to wonder how it all would turn out but it seemed pretty apparent the good ole USA would prevale."
B000OGTRC2 As someone that grew up in small town America this well written story was fascinating.  Nuclear war is an insane idea, but we live with the possibility every day.  The possible tragedy is explored with what I felt were real people, good acting and reasonable human interaction.  The story line is like one very long novel and being able to watch episode after episode at your leisure with Prime is the perfect way to get the most from this story.  The novel celebrates those that strive to cling to positive moral values in the face of unimaginable hardships."
B000OGTRC2 This a great show, fast moving, and exciting, had many surprise endings, which made jump right to the next eps."
B000OGTRC2 Was skeptical at first, but this show just grew on me.  Great ensemble of actors, good stories, action scenes are well done.  Check it out.....you'll like it."
B000OGTRC2 This show has some really corny acting. I only watched a few episodes. I gave it a chance.  But.......gave up."
B000OGTRC2 I see now why TV is considered a wasteland. This TV show is stupid. These TV producers have a formula, then the produce a TV show, like Jericho. And where do these immature male leading characters come from? The guy is 32. He acts like he is 12. Sad."
B000OGTRC2 This is a great show.  I wished they would have continued on with it.  Watching the whole season on Prime is great.  No commercials and not having to wait until the next week or two to watch the next episode.  Unfortunately, the plot line seems plausible; But makes for a great TV show."
B000OGTRC2 This is a wonderful show. I don't understand why it was cancelled. Anyone that likes survival stories will love this program."
B000OGTRC2 A good story line. The characters are believeable. Sad that there were only two seasons on Tv. However seasons three and four are available in comic novel form."
B000OGTRC2 The first season of Jericho was as  good as any sci fi show.  Suspenseful great cast good story lines.  Shoulda been a classic ."
B000OGTRC2 AWESOME SHOW........I DIDN'T GET TO SEE THE PILOT ....NOW I HAVE & GET THE BACKGROUND OF THE SHOW LOT MORE"
B000OGTRC2 Generally a good production. Realistic depictions of nuclear weapons and radiation effects. Also pretty realistic depiction of EMP effects (older vehicles without computerized electronic ignitions able to run etc).And then I just like some of the players in whatever role they play."
B000OGTRC2 Very realistic situations...no aliens or vampires. Makes you want to store up and makes you realize how quickly you can go from much to none."
B000OGTRC2 Jericho will always be my favorite show, hands down. I'm watching it for the 3rd time and have convinced most of my family to watch it as well."
B000OGTRC2 The show was an interesting concept and took a while to figure out who did the dirty work. The acting was a bit over the top..."
B000OGTRC2 Quick Overview: Jake returns to the town of Jericho to work out some money matters with his father. He makes a speedy exit that is halted abruptly when a ginormous explosion rocks Jericho. Now the whole population is cut off from everything.  Secrets and such come out as these citizens ban together to survive.Great plot. Viewers learn a lot about all of the characters and their histories as they maneuver this big scale event. It didn't take me long to get into the swing on things. The cast does a remarkable job working together and delivering believable dialogue."
B000OGTRC2 I did not watch it when it was on TV, so I wanted to see what is was like. I love it I am looking forward to finding out what happen to everyone."
B000OGTRC2 I just started this series but so far, the acting is good, the story believable and the setting interesting so will be watching to see if it follows true to form. Thank you."
B000OGTRC2 I actually really like this show and I remember thinking when it was being advertised that I should watch it, but never did. Now that it is no longer available, I am sad to know that I never helped with the ratings by watching it."
B000OGTRC2 I definitely thought this show had potential, good actors with good perfomances, and a pretty good plot all told. word."
B000OGTRC2 Jericho was an attempt at embarrassing GW Bush ; that alone made it nearly FLOP . the apocalyptic theme is ok for the regular viewer . for science , hunters , mechanics radio types , it will leave you COLD ! .. forgot FARMERS !! i think they git the worstest  treatment as far as \"REALITY\" is concerned . players as all pretty good . McRaney always does well .story line is consistent , but the props are sometimes BIZARRE . 3 get into an argument because a young woman says \"gas cant be transported in metal tanks !!\" well , just plain STUPID .the second season does wrap it all up in similar vane , but some twists only the emotionally handicapped mite , i say MITE believe .well its up to you . i call it a \"draw\" . you're not losing your money , but if looking for \"reality\" in your viewing , this isnt where to go .G'nite y'all"
B000OGTRC2 Kinda hokey at first, but better as it grew.  Got to be pretty &#34;real&#34; I thought.  Watch season two, don't know why this ended so quickly.Good for a binge on rainy dull days!"
B000OGTRC2 This is a good show. I really enjoy it. It keeps you in suspense. I would recommend it to watch."
B000OGTRC2 Started out as a skeptical viewer and can now say I'm an addicted fan. While this show is fantasy, it has definitely caused me to ponder our vulnerability and the possibility of life without the power grid. Scary thought, but I enjoy seeing how the writers carried it out in each episode. Hope I never have to find out what it's really like!"
B000OGTRC2 It's an okay show. Acting is about par with being a CBS drama. Story line is great but the story has more potential than the show delivers."
B000OGTRC2 I like post- apocalyptic genre, and this show has a good spin on the concept. Nothing so overwhelming that the characters cannot do some problem solving and still have something positive to look forward to."
B000OGTRC2 Every episode had excitement and suspense and character development.  It has a fascinating storyline that makes you think &#34;what if&#34; and then you see how this town handles not knowing the why and what of the attack on America that they survived."
B000OGTRC2 Cancelling Jericho was a serious error on the part of the network. Wonderful, believable characters, excellent acting and an intriguing story line. What more could you ask for in escapist television. The story kept me constantly asking how I would handle a given situation, what would my roll be?  This show is on the same entertainment level as Walking Dead, too bad there won't be anymore."
B000OGTRC2 Wish they would have continued this series, but at least they brought it to a conclusion somewhat instead of just leaving you hanging."
B000OGTRC2 Great writing, and compelling characters in a dramatic situation, are some of the reasons why Jericho is very compelling serial television.  The story centers on the events in the fictitious town of Jericho, Kansas, after a nuclear attack.  The immediate concern is survival, and then maintaining basic government structure, medical facilities, and utilities.  As characters are defined, past lives and secrets are disclosed, and roles, old and new, are formed.Exactly what happened is a mystery, and while some things are revealed, it is evident to viewers that there are several hidden conspiracies.  The situation gets more complex, as new characters appear, and a hazy picture of the new America slowly takes shape.The key figures in Jericho, are from the Green, Richmond, and Hawkins families.  The ensemble cast is gre
B000OGTRC2 I missed this series when it was on network tv.  It is nice to be able to watch it without commercials.  Thank you for making it available."
B000OGTRC2 With the world, and this country, in such upheaval, this series really hit home. Woudl I  react  as they did? who knows. And I hope I never have to find out. Me or my children or grandchildren. As I watched the episodes one right after the other I thought that this series could/should be used as a teaching tool in high schools and colleges. What would you do, how would you do it, Is any of it possible? Entertaining and frightening."
B000OGTRC2 I have always enjoyed &#34;end of the world as we know it&#34; movies.I like the actors, they come across as real people, but the script writing can be a stretch.Sometimes the acting is not believable.That said, the show has my attention and I will likely watch it through to the end.If this review is not clear, try comparing the acting and script of Walking Dead to that of Jericho, day & night."
B000OGTRC2 Great interplay between characters, Gerald McRainey is great as the leader of his people, Would like to see something new with Skeet Ulrich."
B000OJFV3S Well cast drama quite accurately depicted. Don't believe,however, Jonathan Rhys Meyers would ever be mistaken as a double for the original Henry VIII! Nor would any of the real wives and children be as glamorous as the ones Hollywood chose. But the action, the sets, the activities, the costumes, the political-religious arenas of the day were all so true to life that we must grant Hollywood some leeway. All in all, it was a marvelous portrayal of 15th-16th century England. More such dramas should be presented on TV."
B000OJFV3S England, 1519. King Henry VIII rules England and is beloved by his people. His wife, Queen Catherine of Aragon, is popular and the king's chancellor, Cardinal Wolsey, is able and formidable in administering the country and defeating plots against the throne. Another of Henry's advisors is Sir Thomas More, a man of great conscience and integrity whose respect and friendship the king values.However, it is a difficult time in Europe. The Lutheran heresy is raging unchecked in Germany and the Pope is unable to defeat it. King Francis I of France and the Holy Roman Emperor Charles V are engaged in a deadly rivalry, both hoping to enlist England as an ally. With his queen - the Emperor's aunt - apparently unable to bear him a son, Henry also begins movements towards a divorce. When he falls in love with the beautiful Anne Boleyn, this matter becomes pressing and threatens a breakdown of relations with Rome.The Tudors is a television drama produced by the Showtime network and based on the life on Henry VIII, focusing on his relationships with his six wives and the political and religious turmoil that resulted. The first season covers a period of roughly eleven years, running from the accession of Charles V as Holy Roman Emperor (in 1519) to the death of Cardinal Wolsey (in 1530). However, real historical events are compressed, combined or moved around in the timeline to read better as part of the drama. The contentious marriage of Charles Brandon to Henry's sister Mary Tudor (slightly confusingly changed to Margaret in the TV series) happened in 1515, but is moved to later on to create an interesting mid-season subplot, for example.The Tudors plays fast-and-loose with the details of real history, but like HBO's Rome before it, the show does succeed in getting across the events and complications of the period. The complexities of Henry's relationships with fellow European rulers and the Pope are recounted well, as is the seething tension within the English court. As a very rough introduction to the history of the period, The Tudors works, though those interested in the real events are referred to the many history books about the time.As drama and narrative, The Tudors is something of a mixed bag. The script is inclined towards the expositionary, with surprisingly little incidental flavour, and what there is is often questionable: a scene showing Henry VIII composing 'Greensleeves' is amusing but also cheesy and highly inaccurate (Henry VIII definitely did not write the music to the song and his authorship of the lyrics is questionable, at best). One of the strongest episodes in the season is the one where England is ravaged by disease, as it shows how Tudor England coped with such disasters and features more incidental scenes of life amongst the common folk than other episodes.The acting is mostly good, with the likes of Nick Dunning (Sir Thomas Boleyn) and Henzy Czerny (the Duke of Norfolk) providing able support. Henry Cavill (Charles Brandon and, more recently, the latest actor to play Superman) is good as one of Henry's few true friends, though he arguably may have made a better Henry VIII himself. Maria Doyle Kennedy gives an excellent performance as Catherine of Aragorn, mixing palpable fear and worry over not being able to give the king an heir with pride and anger at the thought of being set aside. Natalie Dormer is given the hard job of portraying Anne Boleyn, the woman a king plunged a nation into anarchy for, and almost pulls it off. She is hamstrung by the indifferent script, especially as the story skips large chunks of their courtship and the precise reasons for the king's fascination with her are left somewhat ambiguous: in the TV show she simply appears to play hard to get, fascinating the king who normally just has to nod his head to get a woman into bed with him. Given their seven-year courtship and the intensity of Henry's feelings towards her, this feels rather inadequate as an explanation.Central to this first season is Sam Neill, who plays Cardinal Wolsey with just the right mix of intelligence, political scheming and ruthless anger. Wolsey is presented as something of an antagonistic figure, but he is also shown to be a caring family man (Wolsey had a wife and two children) and to be utterly devoted to the king. As Wolsey repeatedly fails to get the annulment Henry wants, he becomes more desperate and Neill portrays Wolsey's descent with passion and intensity. Neill is possibly the highlight of the first season. Jeremy Northam also gives an excellent performance as Sir Thomas More, highlighting both More's well-known piety, intelligence and integrity but also his darker side, such as his commitment to burning heretics and Protestants at the stake.Where the series falters - and it's quite a big misstep - is the casting of Jonathan Rhys-Meyers in the central role of Henry VIII. Eight years prior to The Tudors, Rhys-Meyers had played the coldly cunning role of Steerpike in the BBC's adaptation of Gormenghast, and bizarrely he seems to be playing Henry VIII in much the same manner. The real Henry VIII is noted for his charisma and vivaciousness, his force of personality sweeping up those around him. Whilst Rhys-Meyers certainly nails the king's intelligence, confidence and raging temper when thwarted, his performance is also often cold, desperate and occasionally whiny. I can understand the idea of subverting the traditional image of the fat, middle-aged Henry VIII by showing him as a young man in the prime of life, but Rhys-Meyers simply fails to get across the complexities of the real historical figure.Fortunately, this is not quite as disastrous as it might be supposed: The Tudors may be about Henry VIII, but the series follows those around him more than the monarch himself, and the emphasis is on the court and period as a whole rather than on the one man by himself.From a technical viewpoint, the series is well-directed. The use of CGI to flesh out the castles and stately homes of England is interesting and rather ahead of its time (and makes up for the fact that the show was filmed in Ireland, with limited or no access to some of the real locations portrayed in the series), though also sometimes distracting. Early in the season we have relatively brief camera shots of locations that try not to dwell on their computer-generated nature. Later in the season we have rather distracting rapid camera movements and broad shots of locations which are clearly CGI and artificial (and whilst the CGI is good for 2007 and the show's limited budget, it's still not great), creating a bit of a dissonance once we switch to the live-action scenes.The first season of The Tudors (***) is flashy, fun and enjoyable but also lightweight. The lack of historical accuracy is not a major problem - the show at least portrays the real events, if not always in the right order or with the correct details - though the uncharismatic performance of the lead actor and a sometimes indifferent and flavourless script certainly are. Luckily, most of the other actors are excellent and as a rough introduction to the time period and events, the show does work."
B000OJFV3S Though artist liberties were taken with the series, I love it none the less,  i have found the show to be very entertaining, and intriguing!"
B000OJFV3S Great subject matter.  Outstanding locations and filming.Good historic reference, and very graphic.Mature subject matter.One of the best series I have seen on TV."
B000OJFV3S Main actor, however is too predictable.  He is too easily emotional and reacts that way.  I know, it's the script for effect."
B000OJFV3S If you are entertained by a scheming, self-centered, sex maniac, this is your series.  Not sure if this was over-done to sell the series or some sort of dramatically correct portal of the reality of the times."
B000OJFV3S I was fairly familiar with the history behind King Henry VIII; this dramatization is really entertaining.  I am in the middle of season 3, and still enjoying it!"
B000OJFV3S Out of all the reigning monarchs of England and elsewhere whose lives would have made a smashingly entertaining soap opera, that of Henry VIII is generally acknowledged to be at the top of anyone's short list. The man certainly had a way with serial monogamy, and as such has kept writers like Philippa Gregory, movie-makers, playwrights and the BBC busy for decades. Make that centuries, for even Shakespeare had a go. One would think there isn't another blessed thing that could be said about the much-married monarch, and yet Showtime has managed it. And they haven't even gotten up to the point where he had finally and irrevocable divested himself of his first wife and married the second - in the process almost casually wrenching England out of the orbit of the Catholic Church. This season just sets the stage and establishes the personalities.In one way, this reminded me rather vividly of the movie \"Elizabeth\", in that it combined psychological acuity with considerable historical inaccuracy. Yes, there are all sorts of inaccuracies, merged events, death of historical personages that did not occur for years after the events depicted here, deaths that did not in the least happen as represented here, and strikingly divergent  visualizations of personalities - not least of which is Henry himself.This is not the usual Henry VIII, a heavy-set and peevish middle-aged man; here he is vital, young and passionate; a sort of rock-star king, as charming as he is - perhaps - a sociopath. He is the sun around which the whole of his court and government revolve. Jonathan Rhys Meyers looks nothing like the historical Henry. However, he conveys the arrogant attraction of the man and his single-minded pursuit of his desires, whether it was victory on the tilt-yard or in a diplomatic convocation... or to be rid of a wife who could not bear him a son. One has the sense that yes, Henry VIII was probably very much like this; charming, mercurial and dangerous to cross - and that his court was a snake pit of seething ambitions and relentless plotting to gain his ear and his favor.Eventually Henry would be also be rid of anyone around him who dared to tell him \"no\", and that is what is the larger drama in this first season: the downfall and disgrace of his most trusted adviser and chancellor, Cardinal Wolsey (Sam Neill) and the setting aside of his proud and able wife, the Catholic Catherine of Aragon (Maria Doyle Kennedy) in favor of the younger and presumably fruitful (and Protestant) Anne Boleyn. This is the point which has been reached in the series finale, although for my money, the most noteworthy climax was that moment of quiet horror when Thomas More (Jeremy Northam) and another councilor seemed to realize that there was absolutely no one left at court who would be able to reason or coax Henry out of the disastrous course that he had set.Of the extra features included in this set, the most interesting is a look at series production and sets, and a tour of modern-day sites in London associated with Henry VIII's court."
B000OJFV3S While not 100 percent  historically accurate The Tudors does a good job at telling what life was like in the court of Henry VIII played brilliantly by Jonathan Rhys-Meyers.The story starts several years after Henry becomes King and goes through everything from the Field of Cloth and Gold, the various plots against the French and Spanish, the birth of Henry Fitzroy (the Kings illegitimate son) and much more.Most of the story centers on Henry's marriage to Catherine of Aragon and his increasing love affair with Anne Boleyn and which led him to cast Catherine off and break with the Church of Rome to marry Anne.The cast is very good. And while it is not 100 percent accurate the acting, scenery, and costumes make up for it."
B000OJFV3S This wonderful production highlights the monster that Henry VIII was and the role of all parties from the gentry to the church in their respective grabs for power. This is a very entertaining show to watch and adds a dramatized human element to the horrible man, Henry VIII."
B000OJFV3S Love,  the show, even watching it for the 2nd time again. Jon Rhees is a smoking hot HenryVlll, and the era costumes are awesome."
B000OJFV3S While its not very accurate as has been stated.  It is good however to see the King be himself and the energy that he brings to the character.  The customes and sites seem to have been well done also.  I'm however not a big fan of explicit disregard for his wife and daughter despite Henry's \"caring\" about her.  It might have be the thing to do at that time but it irritated me everytime.  He was in a room with his wife, the Queen and the mistress Anne is there as well.  He's suddenly so in love and can't live without her.  He wants to divorce his wife because the marriage was supposedly not legal.All of sudden after all the one nighters with women he probably can't even remember or name if put to the test.  His focus should be more on running the country and all the other issues that the people are having around him, not chasing after a woman (that has more skeletons in her closet than a cemetary).  While i enjoyed Johnathan Rhys Meyers acting in in this for the most part and he's very likeable guy.  I can't help but hope that the story picks up for this series.It has some promise and i hope that the Tudors can deliver on that in the 2nd season.  I'd like to see more about the Queen, her background and other relevant issues that Henry went through during his time."
B000OJFV3S I had forgotten how well acted this entire series was. Watch the entire series from the beginning it will renew your faith in the acting community. This series is far better then most of the movies that are put out today."
B000OJFV3S This production has spared no expense on settings and costumes.  It is a visual feast.  However, beware that this show shows alot of skin/sex and is definitely not for children.  I have seen 3 seasons and felt they were all good.  While i don't like all the violence,  it does give me a feel for how brutal the times were and how easy it was to get your head chopped off."
B000OJFV3S I only watched one episode. It had too much nudity and sex in it. The story line was good but didn't enjoy the rest."
B000OJFV3S Love this romantic show. Would recommend this to any women. The men in this show is sexy and you never know what is going to happen in each episode."
B000OJFV3S Amazing performances and beautiful settings!  Do not start watching this if you are not prepared to follow to the end.  Highly Addictive!  A little thin on historical accuracy in places but the performances seem to make you forget that.  Watching the performances of the actors in this series will make you want to watch other things they have done.  Highly recommend."
B000OJFV3S I just finished viewing the first season and i have to admit its a great costume period drama.  It does drag in some places and the acting can be a bit over the top. That being said its a solid B+ mini series."
B000OJFV3S It's a good show that has a LOT of sexual content. I'm just wondering if it's all needed? Other than that it would get another star. And for the record....I'm not a prude. Far from it. I just think the show doesn't need all of the sex scenes."
B000OJFV3S Considering this particular period was so filled with change, twists of fate, rises, falls, and nearly every other device found in great dramas, I expected better than a seeming focus on the sexual antics of the characters. Otherwise, very well done and for those who don't have good background in the period when Henry VIII was King of England, it should hold your attention."
B000OJFV3S This is a docudrama about Henry the Eighth. There is a lot of action and beautiful people to keep you watching.I would not recommend this for children.Dr George Tomes"
B000OJFV3S This show takes an exciting look at a crucial time in history.  If you can get past the sex scenes, the show does a great job showing this complex time in England."
B000OJFV3S It took a little while for me to warm up to the show - i liked it but didn't spend a whole night sleepless watching it until around episode 7, at which point there was no turning back.  As others mention already, the set designs, actors and screenplay are very well done.. but what intrigued me most was that the historical period of the story basically coincides with the division of the church, from the rule of Catholicism to the outbranches of \"protest\"-antism.  And the show goes on to become a study almost (and a very entertaining one at that) of the way this came to be (in England).  The story does a pretty fair job of presenting both the integrity and corruption of the Catholicism of Europe at the time and it likewise shows how and what drove the king to accept \"reformist\" versions of Christianity.  It's a fascinating study of a subject I really knew very little about and I come away feeling more informed somehow, and entertained into the bargain.  Even if religion isn't your thing, religion and politics were once quite married and intermixed with the state and it's fascinating to see these things portrayed - and to compare them with where we are now.  A fascinating historical story.  It's no wonder Shakespeare put it on the stage in his day.  Showtime has just sexed it up a bit.  And speaking of sex, if this show doesn't convince you of the power that libido plays behind the scenes, nothing will!"
B000OJFV3S Engrossing and spectacularly produced, to be enjoyed as entertainment, not history, as it contains many errors of fact. For instance, the writers throw in a couple of completely fabricated homosexual affairs, seemingly just for the hell of it. And a fabricated murder of a royal, married to the (historically) wrong princess. And some of the timelines are messed up. And the series starts with the murder of someone who wasn't murdered. And completely wrong on a suicide and someone going crazy.But, due to its contemporary feel, it succeeds in getting the viewer interested in this period of history, if nothing more than to check up on its accuracy."
B000OJFV3S Note: I just saw the first episode with XFinity On Demand.This immensely poular series is interesting. I like historical dramas. However, my problem is that there's no historical summary prior to the series, as there is in The Borgias. A historical summary of past events leading up to what occurs in the series is most helpful, so I was somewhat lost as to who is who and who is doing what to who and why. That being said, this series is intriguing."
B000OJFV3S Acting is perfect! Love history and almost perfectly accurate with history. I wish the tutors did not end with Henry VIII but continued with Henry's son and then Mary and Elisabeth. After all common?"
B000OJFV3S If your into history you'll love this!!! ***** for all seasons!! It's a must see. Not for younger children!!! I love to see how people lived in the 1700's."
B000OJFV3S If you want serious history, you should be reading a book.  If you want entertainment with a historical base, television is a good choice.  I am not in a position to pick out the errors of omission and commission in this series.  How many there are is not important to me.  This is not a history lesson and I wish to be entertained.  As entertainment, The Tudors succeeds!  The acting is excellent, the settings realistic, the dialog intelligent and believable.Henry the VIII is young, active, good looking and powerful.  He has two unfilled desirers, to have a son and to conquer France.  Season 1 has him working on both.  The King's favor is all-important, the series captures this and shows us why.  Without being boring, we are given enough background to understand the situation and see why Henry selects a course of action.  Many of his reason are not the best but this gives us insight into a complex personality.While knowing the story, the telling is fresh and enjoyable.  I rented the first DVD from Blockbuster for 99 cents.  After the second episode, I ordered season 1.  This is on a par with Rome and Deadwood as enjoyable entertainment with some historical background."
B000OJFV3S I had read an article on Jeremy Irons who I guess stars as an older Richard and decided to start from the beginning. Glad I did."
B000OJFV3S My best friend and I are addicted. A riveting show that will certainly grab your attention! For people who enjoy history and period time pieces, this is the perfect show for you. An amazing cast, an amazing attention to visual detail and a story line that just couldn't be made up! A small warning though.... it is NOT suitable for children."
B000OJFV3S As I said with the other seasons I love it and the actores are greatI have watched it about 10 times"
B000OJFV3S This series is enormous in scope and devilishly all consuming. The characterizations and plots are astoundingly good and prove to be historically accurate in every vein.The acting is superb as are the cinematography, editing and presentation. I suffer no guilt at addicting myself to catching up on this splendid offering. I can say that there has not been one boring minute during the 20 episodes I've viewed."
B000OJFV3S I love this series - elegant historically accurate costumes and backgrounds with outstanding performances and a director who tells it like it really was - this is one of the very few  films I will watch again."
B000OJFV3S While the series is very loosely based on the events of the life of Henry VIII the performances by JR Meyers, Sam Neill as Wolsey, and Jeremy Northam as Sir Thomas More really make the piece.Natalie Dormer is pitch perfect as Anne, even if we can see through her and her family and find her annoying! Maria Doyle Kennedy as the Queen is superb. She is warm, human, dignified and we actually feel sorry for all the king is throwing away for a woman who ultimately proved to not be worth it. And how much he will destroy in England in the process.Henry as a 'sleeping lion' is wonderfully portrayed. The series starts and ends looking like a 'bonkbuster' but there is a LOT of interesting stuff that will pique your interest in the real history if you can get past the nudie bits.Squishing his 2 sisters into the one who marries his friend Charles Brandon was silly and pointless, and it is amazing they never once mention Scotland in the whole 10 hours! Margaret Tudor married the king of scotland, Mary the old senior King of France, not Portugal, and he died 3 months later.The Thomas Tallis parts were just silly, and partly for shock value and more sex, but I think they were trying to show a bit about the 'common man'.The scenes between Henry and Anne light up the screen--it is interesting to see the contrast with the second series, when they are barely in the same county, let alone room. (GREAT acting in both).The costumes, settings and acting make this, while not perfect, certainly an excellent way to savor history and the period."
B000OJFV3S Amazon's video-streaming is high-quality and the Tudors is no exception.  My husband and I love this show and while it's not 100% historically accurate, I've learned about English history a lot from watching."
B000OJFV3S Though the series has taken some liberties with historical events and omitted others, this is still an entertaining drama. Henry at times became quite annoying with his tantrums, and his habit of casting aside those who anger him or no longer hold his interest while historically accurate made me dislike him as well. That said, I don't imagine we are supposed to like him over much. The side dealing of scheming and the power of the church back then made for good drama. All in all I enjoyed it though the sex scenes I could have lived without. I'm not prudish in the least. My dis like is more in the form of boredom. Yawn, yet another sex scene when I'm more interested in plot development. I love history, and while this shows a made for good television history instead of the more accurate events, it was fun to watch. One example is that Henry the 8th son didn't die as a small child at all, and it wasn't the sweating sickness that killed him. Those who must see things as portrayed accurately will be disappointed."
B000OJFV3S its better than most shows on tv but that's not saying much. its not very historically accurate from what i can tell but it's interesting to watch"
B000OJFV3S What show are the rest of these reviewers watching? I was excited to see this after reading the reviews, but barely made it through the first two hours. Incredibly boring, like a lavish network soap with all that implies. The history is sketchy; if you're going to twist history, at least make it fun and appealing in some way that the truth does not.This is one of the slowest and most unpleasant tv shows I have seen in some time. Then again, I don't watch tv, only tv shows on dvd that reviewers I usually trust found to be good. Guess that's not the best way either! Oh well, I found The Office (the funny version) and Arrested Development that way, so it can't be all bad. Didn't work this time, though.Pass."
B000OJFV3S So fun to watch, keeps your interest all the way through.  Incorporates many historical events.  Great actors, beautiful costumes.  Triggers a person's interest in history, wish I had paid better attention in class all those years ago, but maybe I would have if history had come to life like it does on the Tudors screen."
B000OJFV3S There is probably nothing more that I like to watch than a costume drama, particularly one set at a time when men were swinging swords and showing off their legs in hose. A Man for All Seasons, Ben Hur, Elizabeth, Anne of a Thousand Days, Quo Vadis, Braveheart....I could go on and on, but you get the idea.The Tudors is a costume drama fan's dream come true. Sword fights, beheadings, lusty men and women rolling in the hay and in other places...beautiful actors, great music, all abound in The Tudors. While the history shown is not always accurate, it's close enough to get the point across, and you're just having so much fun watching the high drama, you really don't care if it isn't exactly dead on point accurate. It's right up there with Rome (which to my great sorrow was only on for two seasons) as a &#34;go to&#34; show to revisit when I want the thrill of seeing yesteryear as it probably never was.Sarah Bolger gives a fantastic performance as Princess Mary, Henry Cavill  is great eye candy and does a nice job portraying Charles Brandon, and while Jonathan Rhys Meyers doesn't look a thing like Henry VIII (who was never that handsome), he captures the &#34;over-the-top&#34; behavior that Henry often displayed. But perhaps my favorite person throughout the entire series was Bishop Chapuys, played by Anthony Brophy. I wanted to cry when we received word in the show that he'd died. I thought Mr. Brophy did an excellent job.  Maria Doyle Kennedy also turns in a stellar performance as Queen Katherine.So I can highly recommend not just this Season, but the entire Series with great pleasure who anyone who likes to see men in codpieces and wearing velvet!"
B000OJFV3S I'm rewatching this for about the 15th time. It's reaaally good. Can be disturbing, seeing the nasty ways people were slated to die - and for stupid reasons; but alas, it's all true. Recommended, for adults."
B000OJFV3S I have been watching The Tudors since it came on the air and it has grown on me every season.  Yes, this is truly a fictional series based on truth but you won't care as you become engrossed in the series.  A viewer can end up doing research and reading websites and books in search of the truth.  The show is well acted, lush and a lot of fun, which it should be.  Henry VIII went down in history due the creativity of his marriages and his religious beliefs.  His daughter from Anne Boleyn turned out to be Britain's greatest monarch so something came out of it.  A fun show and a great entertainment.  I'm so surprised that Showtime didn't cancel it due to the cost."
B000OJFV3S I just finished watching the entire first season of \"The Tudors.\" When the show first premiered on Showtime, I watched the pilot episode and never bothered to watch it again. I thought the show was visually appealing, but way too melodramatic and historically inaccurate for my taste. However, I recently read a fascinating book about Henry VIII, and I needed something else to satisfy my Tudor fixation. I watched all the episodes of \"The Tudors\" On Demand in less than a week, and I really enjoyed them.In order to appreciate this program, you have to be willing to accept the show for what it is. Yes, the majority of the characters and plots in the show are based on real historical events, but this is a cable television series, and of course things are going to be changed to appeal to a larger commercial audience. As a result, all of the people in King Henry's court are much more attractive than they probably were in real life, and there are some major alterations to historical timelines. Still, I'm impressed that the producers actually did get so many things right with the show, a
B000OJFV3S Modernized version, but well written and well acted. Lots of sex though, definitely not for kids to watch! Once you start watching, you get hooked and wanting to keep watching and wanting more. Really good show, just keep in mind, it's entertainment."
B000OJFV3S A really grasping tale of young king Henry VIII is a story based explicitly on lust and deception, lawlessness and arbitrariness still well inherited into valid law and order to date somewhere in the modern-looking world."
B000OJFV3S I chose the Tudors to view as I am interested in all things about Kings and Queen histories.  The script seems to accurate.  The costumes of the period were remarkable.  I loved the entire series.  This particular season is rated for the mature audience not for high school.Viewing Henry VIII was incredible, and the wives of the king with all the court secrecy and plots was awesome, and apparently, from history real."
B000OJFV3S Rome has clearly inspired Showtime to produce this miniseries in 10 one hour parts, portraying Henry VIII's more youthful and vigorous days.  The timespan is a small one, from his growing discontentment with Catherine of Aragon, to consummating his love for Anne Boleyn... so we only get to wife number 2 - plenty of scope for sequels, but did leave me with a bit of frustration at times wanting to see a little more resolved.As it is, the key players here are Henry VIII, in his low 20's, fighting fit and clearly horny (there are some fairly explicit scenes towards the beginning of the season).. Cardinal Wolsey (played with great presence by Sam Neill) the corrupt but efficient First Minister, and Sir Thomas More, the fervent Catholic and conscientious humanist.The series thrives on a combination of terrific performances, well written screenplay and flawlessly depicted Tudor atmosphere of the Court.It falls short of Rome's success by failing to have a counterpoint to the Royal drama - the scenes of `Real' England, the bars and backstreets, are only rarely seen, but could be considered vital to understanding the England of the times.  Having some lowly characters in situations of poverty, may well have helped accentuate the drama.Having said that, and despite a few forgivable departures from history, this works well as a refresher on Tudor history, and is a first at seeing Henry VIII in his prime as a real human being.Kudos to Showtime, and I await the next series with bated breath..Extras are modest, but rewarding - a couple of 5 minute featurettes on costume and sets, and a lengthier one with a tour guide taking us round the real Tudor historic sights in London, all moderately interesting.  A documentary depicting the real history may have also been a welcome addition, but is lacking.Also included are first episodes on some other Showtime series - a cunning plan, and a welcome one."
B000OJFV3S This series is MUST TV!  Worth it just for the history story, but much more entertaining than most series.  The costumes are works of art and the actors are great!  I recommend the entire series!"
B000OJFV3S What Showtime's historical drama The Tudors lacks in historical accuracy, it more than makes up for with it's wonderful production design and well chosen cast.  Jonathan Rhys Meyers stars as King Henry VIII, whose sexual appetites are only matched by his desire for power and to ultimately get his way.  The only person in his court that matches his desire for power is his closest advisor, Cardinal Wolsey (Sam Neill), who Henry's subordinates Brandon (Henry Cavill), Norfolk (Henry Czerny), and George Boleyn (Nick Dunning) seek to remove from power.  Involved in their plans are Boleyn's daughters, specifically Anne (Natalie Dormer) who catches Henry's eye and becomes a thorn in the side of Henry's wife Katherine (Maria Doyle Kennedy).  The performances are great, the production is grand, and as a whole, The Tudors is thoroughly entertaining and engrossing.  It lacks the epic feel that say, HBO's Rome, manages to weave; but the potential here is high for the show to become something special indeed.  All in all, if you're looking for pure historical accuracy, you won't find it with The Tudors, but instead you will find an entertaining historical drama that delivers the goods."
B000OJFV3S Love, lust, betrayal, egocentric King....good times. This what the Tudors were all about. You know what they say, absolute power absolutly corpus"
B000OJFV3S The Tudors great series.,a history lesson embellished with lots of mystery an sex a gore !Costuming and scenes are amazing .ACTING SUPERB."
B000OJFV3S I wish I learned more about the English monarchy back in the day when I was in school. I may not have been interested back then but I am now. Learning more about these events and a possible storyline, fictional I'm sure, does make it entertaining. What more can I ask from a TV series?"
B000OJFV3S As a fan of period movies, I could not miss the Season 1 of \"The Tudors\".  Henry VIII, King of England is known to most as a man who broke from the Catholic Church to become Head of the Church of England and marry six women. Such infamy secured him a place in history, but so was the fact that it was his daughter with Anne Boleyn - Queen Elizabeth I, who was one of the most benevolvent rules of her time.  In any case, season 1 has four DVDs that will entertain you for almost 12 hours.  Perfect time to watch it would be this holiday season.  I was suprised that series had so much sex in it but also the twists and turns about historical background for Henry's decision-making and his pick of the closest advisors on his court is something I wanted to understand better.  Writers do get sloppy towards the end of the series and the language is not as sophisticated as one would expect it to be on the Court of one of the greatest kings of his time.  I find Jonathan Rhys Meyers to be excellent in his role, but perhaps too young to play a king married for 20 years to Queen Catherine.  Maria Kennedy who play Queen Catherine of Aragon, Queen of England is graceful and dignified.  Unlike the actress Natalie Dormer portraying Anne Boleyn.  Ms. Dormer is too coarse and unsophisticated in her role for a someone (like Anne Boleyn)who was witty enought to keep Henry's interest for so long,speak fluent French after being at the French court for many years.  This portrayal of Anne Boleyn is not befitting of a woman who was a mother of one of the most influential queens of the british royal history.  Court politics, intrigues and the switch of loyalties will keep your attention.  The lessons learned are the ones that apply event o today's modern times and that is perhaps the one more reason for having this series so popular.  I cannot wait to see season 2.  Costumes and jewelry are breathtaking."
B000OJFV3S King Henry VIII was a pivotal figure in English and Western history.  As the Protestant Reformation sweeps Europe, the great question is whether England will remain Catholic, under the Pope's authority, or whether the King's authority shall predominate in England.  King Henry VIII settled this matter for all time, at a time when religious authority truly mattered to the conduct of national affairs in Europe.This series is dazzlingly presented, with fine acting and a gripping, if somewhat leisurely, storyline.  Jonathan Rhys Meyers turns in a bravo performance as King Henry VIII--his intensity in the role is vibrant and convincing.  Sam Neill, as usual, is particularly fine as English Cardinal Wolsey, the King's Chancellor and confidant.  Along with Meyers he dominates Season One.  All of other the key roles are splendidly cast, and the sets are lavish; this is a beautiful production.Season 1 takes us from Henry's ascension to the throne, during which he gains confidence in his role of King of England and head of state--to his love of Anne Boleyn and his rejection of the queen.  The viewer sees in action Machiavelli's admonishment in The Prince that it is deadly to cross a Prince, and dangerous to be his friend.This series is eminently watchable and a great introduction to a critical period in European history.  If it takes liberties with history, the discerning viewer will not mind.  Highly recommended.  RJB."
B000OJFV3S I am enjoying the Tudors very much. Some acting could be improved b
B000OJFV3S Great cast.  Surprisingly substantive and high production quality.  Showtime always felt like HBO-Lite to me and this series is a direct competitor to Game of Thrones without the dragons."
B000OJFV3S I didn't know what to expect. But this is hard to stop watching. It's gripping. And they picked the right actor to play the psycho king. Worth watching."
B000OJFV3S \"The Tudors\" is unlike any television show ever broadcast. The series is wonderfully produced with a huge budget, the acting is worthy of Oscars, and the story, although told before, is presented here fresh and is excitingly original. This 10 episode series dramatizes the life of King Henry VIII of England and his attemmpts to have a male heir for his dynasty as well as the international problems that beset him. The first season details the King's attempts to divorce his wife, Katherine of Aragon, and his lust for Anne Boleyn. The series is racy with many explicit sex scenes, but what makes \"The Tudors\" work are its strong scripts and the acting by its leads, most notably Jonathan Rhys Meyers who portrays Henry not only as a hungry sexual predator, but a man who loves his country and his people. The series won many Emmy nominations, most notably one for Meyers, for his soaring portrayal. \"The Tudors\" is beautifully produced, with amazing costumes and sets that add to the lustre of the series. In all four seasons worth of episodes will been made with seasons 2 and 3 available on DVD (season 3 comes out on DVD in early 2010)."
B000OJFV3S Yea, this and Romney will ingratiate us with our friends...Yea, this and Romney will ingratiate us with our friends...there is that enough words?Edit: Bad acting - oh my god can't they find an actor that can actually sit a horse? Whenever they get on a horse it reminds me of those cartoons when I was a kid where the character was out of sink - the horse goes down the rider goes up - a jarring tribute to those who were raised in the saddle. I'm sure that the 12 people that did not like my review live in their mother's basement and keep a bottle of liquid silicone and a box of Kleenex next to the remote."
B000OJFV3S King Henry VIII to me will always be remembered for having 6 wife's and beheading  two of them. And for being  was a religious nut that forced others to think like him or be burned alive."
B000OJFV3S Casting could have been better here, as could some of the acting.  The music is nothing great either, and I don't care much for the fellow playing Henry.  The first season drags out all the business with Anne Boleyn, Catherine of Aragon, and Thomas Wolsey, also.The costumes and locations are wonderful, and there is some entertainment to be had.  Apparently the history is inaccurate, though I can't really comment on that since I am not that familiar with the era and people involved.Okay for a cheap rental, but nobody needs to purchase this."
B000OJFV3S Great opening season into history of Henry VIII. First establishing key members of his court. Introduction of different historical players. Not sure hoe close if follows history but interesting."
B000OJFV3S Not English history, buy very enjoyable.Buy all the seasons -- you won't regret it."
B000P56MYS This is the 6thseason in the shield series. 1st if you have never seen the shield, its a very gritty, raw and dark show. Its a story about a strike team in who pushes the laws beyond the legal limit. If you like cop shows you need ton see this."
B000P56MYS I reviewed Season 5 in detail but I will tell you that if you like cop shows be prepared for some dirty cops in this one, even though they have a good side also.  Vick and his crew go about catching the bad guys with no holds barred and there is no such thing as PC to them.  They do, however get the job done where others would probably not.  Absolutely the best cop show my wife and I have ever watched."
B000P56MYS Vic Mackey is one of the most real characters in TV police work.  I'll be sad to see the end of this season and the last one end"
B000P56MYS The hardest part about watching these episodes is knowing that this is the next to the last Season in the series."
B000P56MYS The Shield is one of the best tv show ever! It is super intense. This show has a lot of violence, nudity and language so definitely for a mature audience."
B000P56MYS Like so many series do after a few years, Season 6 starts feeling too much. Granted the whole series is extremely intense but now I'm starting to be disillusioned with the many character and he episodes are becoming a bit choppy and sometimes meaningless. Still great acting and gritty drama, but it feels like a next to the last season for this series."
B000P56MYS At the time this show took you by the throat and shook you like a rabid dog. Others have followed now, but this show got people pto pay attention to what the &#34;real&#34; world is like and moved away from cliched, saccharine sweet, happy ending, sycophantic melodrama and brought us, kicking and screaming, into a new age of TV drama.If you havent wanted the series .... All I can say is batten down the hatches, fasten your seat belt and enjoy the ride!"
B000P56MYS A really great show. One of the best cop dramas ever made. Way better than the Sopranoes. All seasons of this show were good. This one was very good. This is a show that always has you wanting more and it comes through. A must buy series!"
B000P56MYS In this season Vic is trying to be as good as he can and not pull his usual crooked methods. The writing is still very good for an adult show. while my wife does not like the show I am enjoying every episode........when she is gone."
B000P56MYS Great job by Michael Chiklis and Walton Goggins.  This series was so good, I watched the first four seasons in a short period of time.  I am savoring the seasons left and watching them once a week."
B000P56MYS With Season 6 we find Shane in a conundrum over happenings from Season 5.  To make matters worse, Shane and Vic are at odds.The writing is still tight but the camaraderie between the Strike Team is very, VERY loose.  In the end, Vic and Aceveda form an alliance that benefits each other -- for the time being.Even though at this point the series has run the gamut and is heading for an end, it is still 'must see' viewing.  Like a soap opera of life unfolding in front of your face, The Shield and Farmington Division are part of an effort for FX to provide very sharp work to the masses.Great job to those folks who were believers of the network before it had a chance to fold."
B000P56MYS The Shield: Season Sixwas Shawn Ryan's real farewell to his ne'er do well Strike Team: when Shane (Walton Goggins) puts a grenade in Curtis Lemansky's (Kenny Johnson) lap out of fear he may be an informant, it's all grisly cliffnotes from thereon out. The demented, righteous and corrupt Lt. Kavanaugh (played uncomfortably well by Forrest Whitaker) succeeds with the help of Acevada to put Lemansky in a position that is completely untenable: go to jail and possibly be killed by Antwon Mitchell (Anthony Anderson) or flee to Mexico and face the same fate as Vic's semi mentor, Ben Gilroy.We see Vic's psyche begin to defenstrate as he can find neither rhyme nor reason to Lemansky's sudden Salvadoran gang style death, and boy, when Vic's psyche begins to defenestrate, EVERYONE'S in trouble.  His ability to lie and delude himself to satisfy his own emotions--in this case, revenge--is demonstrated to such a terrifying pitch by Michael Chiklis that one cannot help but wonder why Ronnie Gardocki (David Rees Snell) didn't become his own man in time.Lemansky was the glowing nucleus of the Strike Team, the man with ethics enough to keep Vic and Shane's putrid souls alive with some measure of joy and balance them out a bit.  What is worse than his grisly death, perhaps, is the discovery that another Strike Team member did it.  Dutch begins to come into his own as the Team fades, and since it's now only three people, Claudette gets more leverage.The introduction of Kevin Hiatt onto the team shows what *might have been* if Claudette herself was not corrupt--since Vic is on the verge of losing his badge, she could have hired him as the head of the Strike Team, but she chooses Vic because of his animalistic street smarts.  Never once was this show boring; never once monotonous; every episode blisters with meaning, commentaries on the human condition and everything else within a very short time frame, which is why I rank it as superior to the Sopranos and The Wire."
B000P56MYS I own all seven seasons of the Shield. Season six has good episodes that helped build you up for the final season seven, but doesn't give you any clue that things will end the way they do. The series stays fresh even after Season Five which could have ended the series (which I think was the best besides the First season which got me hooked on  this TV show)I don't think anyone should just purchase only one season of this series, even though all were good in different ways."
B000P56MYS Keeps you wanting to see more and more I just finished season 7 was a great series wish there was more."
B000P56MYS This season is good, but not great. That can be attributed to the fact that there are only 10 episodes for the season. It mostly deals with the fallout from Lem's death at the end of season 5. Because season five was also short, only 11 episodes, this season should just be considered a continuation of that.The first couple of episodes wrap up the Jon Kavanaugh storyline. There's also a new leader for the Strike Team, Kevin Hiatt, the San Marcos Murders, Vic searching for Lem's killer, Julian is promoted to the Strike Team, Dutch not meshing with Billings, Tina teaming up with Danny, Dutch trying to get with Tina, Shane cutting a deal with the Armenians, and a new bad guy behind the things going on in Farmington.This season was good, and probably would get a 5, but compared to the first 4 seasons of the Shield, it just wasn't in the same class."
B000P56MYS I gave it this rating because of how this TV series was setup and how it keeps you involved into the series."
B000P56MYS Caution: Spoilers ahead (although I personally believe that most of the people who read the reviews on this series are fans, not newcomers).The Shield: Season Fivewas a shocker...while Season One opened with the details of Vic Mackey killing Terry Crowley, there's an unspoken ethic in this realm of Terry being a \"rat\"...yes, Vic killed a fellow cop, \"but\"......the same can't be said of Shane's grenade toss and the death of Lem. It was a senseless death, uncalled for...Lem spent most of the fifth season coughing up blood and drinking Pepto Bismol over the stress caused by his decision to \"take one for the team.\"But in the world of all great Shakespearean tragedies / Greek dramas, it was the necessary catalyst for Shane's ultimate fate in the final season.In Season Six, we also get Vic's Stike Team \"replacement,\" Kevin Hyatt. I think we pretty much know coming out of the gate that Hyatt is a weasel (as is more than abundantly evident from his post-one-night-strand behavior with Paula Garces' officer Tina Hanlon, but we also see it much earlier in the season). We also see the irony of Forest Whitaker's \"Kavanaugh\" meeting his final downfall for becoming Vic in order to take down Vic, and Wyms (CCH Pounder) fall to the same behavior as she lies to Vic upon Hyatt's entry in order to keep him on board in his final days, believing he has a chance at keeping his job (he doesn't). It's the same behavior, but Kavanaugh falls and Wyms rationalizes her actions. In the final season, Vic has the last laugh...sort of.In short, virtually every member of the cast makes an ill-conceived, fateful decision in this season, leading up to the Season Seven climax. A lesser show could be accused of manipulative scripting, but when it comes to The Shield...with the benefit of hindsight...these were all carefully considered, logical moves.A powerful season no matter how you look at it."
B000P56MYS Vic is back, baby! I'm certainly an unapologetic fan of this show primarily because it's a study of a well-written, character-driven offering.Avail yourself (if haven't already) to this bubbling cauldron of people being people - while not always pretty or flattering - that is fairly \"real.\" Sure, I like Law & Order but it's a little too tidy and \"TV\" for me sometimes while The Shield is right on the cusp of non-premium Cable edginess. Any Shield fan or crime drama junky will not be disappointed."
B000P56MYS Season 6 is very intense and full of suspense.  This series has been excellent and season 6 is know exception.  It gets pretty gruesome with murder and mayhem being the norm.  This season is a real love/hate  relationship between all the favorite actors in the series because the plot begins to change and becomes thick with evil doings and secrets found out with revenge being the name of the game."
B000P56MYS I HAVE TO ASK MYSELF CONTINUALLY IS CHIKLIS JUST ABOUT THE BEST ACTOR I HAVE EVER SEEN? HOW IS IT THAT HE CAN IMBUE A TRULY HEARTLESS CRIMINAL WITH JUST ENOUGH HUMAN QUALITIES TO MAKE ONE KEEP HOPING THINGS WILL GET BETTER FOR HIM? ALL THE ACTORS ARE REALLY GOOD AND THE SCRIPT'S TWISTS AND TURNS KEEP THE TENSION BOILING."
B000P56MYS wow i loved this series it was jammed pack with action. i can't believe it is over hopefully they will have another great series like it"
B000P56MYS I have been watching this series for a while now.  I always heard good things about it, it is amazing how much corruption is in the series.  The end is near and the series goes out with a bang."
B000P56MYS The Shield is one show with great stories, very good acting. This show is for adults.I recommend this show. The Shield contains violence and sex."
B000P56MYS I gave this show 5 starts. It keeps you wanting to watch more. I finish watching all 7 seasons in a month. It is addicting."
B000P56MYS Have enjoyed the unexpected turns that this series takes - very unexpected - which keeps my interest! Have enjoyed watching it all in order!"
B000P56MYS Alex character in this show is good.  I didnt like the lanaguage on the show. But did watch season 6. Just a like to much violence for me that is why I only gave it 4 stars."
B000P56MYS I have always marvelled at the writing staff on THE SHIELD.If you've watched it from Season One til now, you've had to be amazed at the explosive twists and turns of the ongoing plots swirling around Vic Mackey and his Strike Team.  Somehow the writers have never written themselves into a corner--and I was certain they had in the early seasons!When this show began, I was in no mood for another cop show.  The friend who pushed the Season One DVDs on me assured me that this show as worth checking out.  I've been a fan ever since.I saw Michael Chiklis on \"The O'Reilly Factor\" and Bill O'Reilly brought up the comparison of THE SHIELD with THE SOPRANOS.  They're both critically-acclaimed crime shows about seriously flawed men on different sides of the badge.  As much as I've loved the first three seasons of THE SOPRANOS, they just never got their groove back from Season Four on.  People are still griping about that controversial \"cut to black\" finale.But THE SHIELD has hit the high marks every season.Love the cast, love the stories, love the show.  (Make sure you watch it from the beginning though: it's worth the ride)."
B000P56MYS The Shield - wherein it is proven that nothing elevates a TV drama to a place above daytime soaps more than graphic violence, profanity and gore combined with corrupt cops, grotesque pimps, ho's galore, violent mobsters of all ethnic varieties, rapes and pillage. Throw in a generous bunch of victims and perps, both repulsive and sympathetic, and you get an excellent drama that will satisfy all your voyeuristic needs. Good writing plus good acting plus good production values create a memorable series. If you can imagine Elmore Leonard and James Ellroy collaborating on The Wire and dropping it into the ethnic cauldron of Los Angeles, you'd get The Shield."
B000P56MYS I have submitted comments on previous seasons of 'The Shield' and I continue to recommend this very entertaining and raw TV series!W.J.Milton"
B000P56MYS It was a shame to see this series come to an end."
B000P56MYS Season 6 is a slap in the face for those who faithfully followed this series for 5 years.Something happens to screenwriters when they have to write those last 3 episodes -- they stop being creative and want to simply take the money and run.  They write crap.This ending is even worse than The Sopranos ending -- would you believe it?  They should be ashamed of themselves.I bought Season 6 used, at a great price, and I now would feel ripped off if they had given it to me for free.If you liked the previous 5 seasons, and the characters, do not -- I repeat -- do not watch season 6.  They are stealing money from you under false pretenses."
B000P56MYS entertaining,it amazes me how the lie keeps on getting covered and uncovered.not many dull moments in this series and it is good to watch some of my favorite actors in earlier roles."
B000RLA1KQ I ordered this product and did not receive it; this review is from the uncut televised edition, which(I presume) is the same as the DVD.The theme, as with so many themes in 1950-1970 comedies, is a mild slapstick farce where a man's devotion to marriage is challenged.  Bob Hope is loyal to his wife but a misdialing of the phone gets him mixed up with a sexy movie starlet(played pefectly by Elke Sommer).  The rumor at the time in Hollywood is that Hope had requested to make this film with her as co-star.  I can't confirm that, but seeing the film, you could understand if he did.The film is pretty amusing and if you are a Bob Hope (or, to be honest, Elke Sommer) fan, then grab this.  Phyllis Diller is his \"co-pilot\" and, as always, puts in a perfect performance too."
B000RLA1KQ THIS IS A WONDERFUL BOB HOPE COLLECTION, MOVIES THAT ARE FUN.I'D RECOMMEND FOR ANY AGE GROUP"
B000RLA1KQ Did women really wear their hair this way in 1966. That sight alone on two of the lead females was worth the price of admission. The guys, too, while not quite matching the girls in quaintness to 2010 eyes, came in a close second with those shrunken fedoras they sport throughout.Starting with these laughs which were unplanned when the film was made, there are many more in this Bob Hope vehicle, which relies more on old-fashioned slapstick than on the typical Hope gags. While having little more to do than show her body, deliver a few accented lines, and be somewhat manhandled in closeups unsuitable to a stunt double, Elke Sommer still more than earned her pay by just being second banana to Hope. Phyllis Diller, a frequent support player to Hope in his various comedy venues in those years, does her particular thing well. True she was an acquired taste, as they say, but in this film, she does provide some fun. The remainder of the supporting cast do what is required of them to give the star his laughs. Hope, himself, nearing the end of his film career, has better material and, therefore, more laughs than some of the other films he made as it became only a marginal activity to being America's favorite comic here and abroad. At this time, he had something like one-third of the twenty all time hit shows on TV with his specials devoted to his entertainment of the troops, most recently in Viet Nam, where a bitter struggle was rapidly escalating.So for many good laughs, no irony or wit, no character development, no symbolic meanings, a story line just strong enough to carry the sight and sound gags, I can, still laughing, recommend this as feather-light, totally escape, viewing."
B000RLA1KQ This collection contains most of the Hope movies of the 1960s - some of which I saw when released in movie theaters. Unlike his earlier 'Road Shows' these movies are all in color and some have his side-kick Phyllis Diller. Only a couple are ones I consider sort of funny (I'll take Sweden & Boy did I get the Wrong Number). I got this collection because my husband is a Bob Hope fan. But, he watches these shows a lot less often than he does his 'Road to -- wherever shows. In fact there are a couple of this collection he has not yet watched."
B000RLA1KQ \"Boy, Did I Get a Wrong Number\" is my favorite Bob Hope film. I have loved this movie since I was a child, and now MY kids watch it over and over. Phyllis Diller on a motorcycle is a sight to see! Just give it a chance....it's a great lighthearted, fun movie that isn't the usual Hollywood \"dirty word and perversion\" fest. There is some mild innuendo going on, but it's tame compared to what is on modern \"family\" shows these days."
B000RLA1KQ The Bob Hope MGM Legends Collection contains seven of the funny man's films, spanning over two decades of Hope's illustrious screen career.  Bob Hope (1903-2003) got his start in vaudeville, and enjoyed a successful career in radio and on the stage, and became a huge star in film and on television.  In the movies, Hope's style was usually characterized by fast talking, witty repartee, and generally being light on his feet.  After teaming with Bing Crosby and Dorothy Lamour, in The Road To Singapore (1940), the first of the seven \"Road\" pictures, Hope's career elevated to new heights.In chronological order, the films in this collection are They've Got Me Covered (1943), The Princess and the Pirate (1944), Alias Jesse James (1959), The Facts of Life (1960), The Road to Hong Kong (1962), I'll Take Sweden (1965), and Boy, Did I Get A Wrong Number (1966).  A quick summary of the films follows:They've Got Me Covered (3.5 stars)Set in Washington D.C. during World War II, Hope plays a newspaper reporter who is on the trail of some Axis agents who are trying to implement a nefarious plan.  Dorothy Lamour co-stars.The Princess and the Pirate (3.5 stars)Bob plays an entertainer on a ship bound for America, who gets tangled up with a princess (Virginia Mayo), when the ship is captured by pirates.Alias Jesse James (3 stars)Set in the American West, Hope is an insurance salesman who sells Jesse James (Wendell Corey) a life insurance policy, and then has to try and make sure that no harm comes to the infamous outlaw.The Facts of Life (4 stars)Comedic legend Lucille Ball co-stars with Bob in this sensitive and funny drama about marriage, love, and fidelity.  Not to be missed.The Road to Hong Kong (2.5 stars)The final installment in the \"Road\" series finds Hope and partner Bing Crosby involved in an out of this world escapade, as Russians agents send the pair on a rocket trip to the moon.  Joan Collins co-stars.I'll Take Sweden (3 stars)Hope is a father worried that his daughter (Tuesday Weld) may marry the wrong guy.  He takes her to Sweden to derail her wedding plans, but once there, both father and daughter find romance heating up.Boy, Did I Get A Wrong Number (1966) (3.5 stars)Elke Sommer plays a starlet looking to get away from it all, who gets a misrouted telephone call from a real estate salesman (Hope), which instigates a kooky escapade that threatens to break up two marriages.These seven films illustrate that while Bob Hope's unique comic style evolved through the years, in many respects, it remained essentially the same.  Ranging from Westerns, to swashbuckling tales, to wartime adventures, to the close of the Crosby era, to coming to terms with the beatnik generation, the affable guy with the quick wit, endless quips, and ski slope nose was there to entertain.  As this set has apparently gone out of production, getting a copy may unfortunately be a difficult and expensive proposition.Due to a glitch at Amazon, this set and the film Boy, Did I Get A Wrong Number are linked as being the same product, so this review is listed for both products."
B000S9FEFY I really enjoyed the series with a mix of detective and personal drama with some humor thrown in for a good mix."
B000S9FEFY &#34;NO KA OI&#34; in Hawaiian means &#34;Is the BEST ! ! &#34;Five stars to the writers and the cast."
B000S9FEFY I really love the cast of characters and how they interact.  Good actors and interesting stories.  Having humor mixed in is great."
B000S9FEFY THE writing on t his show is awesome,great care and skill to keep it authentic and the actors are extremely good.The story line always  t interesting.."
B000S9FEFY I love The Closer and this DVD set does not disappoint. Great show, great value!"
B000S9FEFY Each season gets better and better while developing the characters and the characters' relationships.  Love the show and still enjoy watching it multiple times."
B000S9FEFY This show grows on you and will instantly become one of your favorites.  This season is the best by far.  The cast is amazing but of course the show is carried by the excellent performance of Kyra Sedgwick.  Wow.  To see Brenda lee Johnson working over a suspect to get a confession using her skill, creativity and intelligence is television at its best.This is the glue that holds the show together but this 3rd season also brought us more into Brenda's personal relationship with Fritz and also with her parents.  Both are very enjoyable, inventive aspects to add yet even more dimensions to the character that is Brenda Lee Johnson.The subjects are timely and very interesting.  All I can say is I watch this show on the edge of my seat and find it to be of the highest caliber compared to other shows out there."
B000S9FEFY I was late to start watching the Closer on tv and no sooner did I find that it is a great show than it was in it's last season.  So I am so glad to be able to buy the season's I missed.  I go through Amazon on my Roku and the whole thing is just great.  It's a good show to watch and Amazon and Roku make it easy to obtain and watch.  Before then I was buying dvd's and they were over running my house."
B000S9FEFY We love &#34;The Closer&#34;.  A terrific cast, excellent writing, engrossing procedural.  Too bad they through in a little too much &#34;fluff&#34; towards the end of the series (we don't think Brenda's mother and father added anything to the plots).  But we watch the episodes over and over again."
B000S9FEFY I enjoyed watching this show. It isn't as good as a show like Law & Order: SUV. This show kept my attention. If you like police shows, you will probably enjoy this show."
B000S9FEFY The Closer is one of the best shows on tv.  Keira Sedgwick is great, but the entire cast ensemble has wonderful chemistry."
B000S9FEFY Awesome show with great story telling and humor. Really enjoy seeing how each character develops from season to season and conflicts abound in each episode. It is a captivating show."
B000S9FEFY Really enjoyed the closer. Watched this from the start to the finish and enjoyed it completely. The things people get away with!!"
B000S9FEFY She is a hard hitting, get your man at al cost, swaggering female.  I like her role and Kyra played it very well.  I also liked how the man had to come to respect and revere her because she knew and did her job so well."
B000S9FEFY I very much enjoyed, season 3 and all of the seasons I have watched so far. It is a program worth watching."
B000S9FEFY Once you've started, you'll find it hard to stop.  Watching these great videos is like a narcotic.  You just want to be injected with another one, and another.  Then when they are all done you have to go through a withdrawal phase of disappointment that there aren't another 100 to go.Great fun, edge of your seat humor and drama combined.  Every actor fits the part perfectly and the bad guys are bad and the dead people are really dead. The star, Kyra Sedgwick, is outstanding and never lets you down."
B000S9FEFY Didn't start watching this show when it originally aired until the middle of Season #5.  I started watching it from the beginning on Amazon Prime.What an awesome show.  Kyra Sedgwick rocks.  If you've never seen it before, it's worth paying the cost for Amazon Prime,  Don't miss it!!"
B000S9FEFY The series continues with the same format, a crime with a few dead ends and personal lives that continue to grow in different directions.  Yet, the series grows on you.  Each of the members of her elite homicide squad all detectives face life with laughter, tears, anger, and joy keep you hooked in the LA Police's back-story - keeping you wanting more."
B000S9FEFY the characters are great, like the story lines, the southern &#34;charm&#34; can be a little much but that's what it is.............."
B000S9FEFY One of the best shows ever on tv. It's not the same without Kyra. I bought all 7 seasons! The Closer offers pretty much everything!"
B000S9FEFY this  series deserved all the accolades for it remains reviting season after season with excellent character developmentand many plot variations so one never tires of viewing.  Kyra never stops being very much female while being an excellent leader with her team.  A very enjoyable series."
B000S9FEFY This was one of my favorite TV shows to watch on TNT on Monday nights. What's best about The Closer are the characters we all love starting with Brenda Lee Johnson with that Georgia drawl, her flirtatious affair with FBI Fritz Howard and as ever the priority crimes team led by wise cracking senior detectives Flynn and Provinza. (I miss all those snappy one liners Provinza came up with on the Closer---the pair are more serious on the new Major Crimes...it's just not the same)Lt. Tao who is computer savvy and loves all the high tech stuff, Buzz who does all the crime scene video taping and prisoner interrogation's, Lt. Sanchez who always refers to his fellow officers as &#34;sir&#34;, and the rest of the crew. This was a top notch series, with great acting, well written snappy story lines, and was always very entertaining. I always loved the episodes when Brenda's parents visited and they always fit in Christmas episodes during the holiday season. Watching the series on instant stream I get to enjoy all the wonderful episodes all over again. I recommend this series to everyone. This was a summer fill in on TNT that turned out to be so successful that I think it really helped TNT launch other high quality weekly TV series."
B000S9FEFY These series are well written with outstanding acting.  I like the fact they have been able to hold the cast together, as well.  I would recommend them to anyone that likes mystery, drama and police business."
B000S9FEFY I have loved this show from the start.  With Prime I am able to go back and review all seasons in case I missed any.  Really sorry there are no new seasons."
B000S9FEFY Just keep this series coming. We love it and didn't find it until after 3 were made and the fourth just about out. We fell in love hook line and sinker. Well acted, well written, well produced and ok the cat's just so darn cute. Keep them funny or make more funny ones. Not as happy with the serious ones though it's ok now and again just don't go there too often. Secret they developed a cast that plays off each other as in real people relationships. Works for them and works for the fans. More more more. More kitty too....perhaps....meow...."
B000S9FEFY Love this show. Love every character. These are seasons that will be great to watch over and over for fans of the show."
B000S9FEFY The premiss of this show is very close to that of Prime Suspect. I don't really care because it is a good show. I like the actors and the chemistry between them, even the negative chemistry. Definitely worth watching."
B000S9FEFY I had never seen it from the beginning, so watching alll 7 seasons was a real treat!!! Helped pass all the snowy winters we have in northern Micigan....thanks Prime Video"
B000S9FEFY Fabulous!! Another great season. THe only negative would be that there isn't enough episodes!! By the time you are finished watching the last episode you have to wonder how the poor woman survived this season!! Can't wait until next season!"
B000S9FEFY I own all 7 seasons of the Closer and watch and re-watch (is that a word?) them all the time.  I bitterly regret that the series only ran for 7 seasons.  The Closer is brilliant."
B000S9FEFY I love they way she reels them in and lowers the hammer! That, mixed with a love for chocolate and a southern acdent."
B000S9FEFY I 'enjoyed the entire series of this show, and thought it would be around ten series before it ended.' but, I still have hopes that something great will develop when the show puts all the 'main players back into play, and hopefully will show a new vision for the series with even more powerful females in leadership roles."
B000S9FEFY This program illustrates humor in uniform.  The interactions of the actors creates a synergy that just works.  We certainly enjoy this pergram"
B000S9FEFY Love the series and interaction between characters. Want to be entertained with a clean and thoughtful plot line? Watch The Closer, all series."
B000S9FEFY Fantastic ensamble cast with a wonderful female lead. Stories are character lead which I like. This is a can't miss series"
B000S9FEFY The Closer Season 3 is 5 stars.  I recently found this show and I'm hooked.. I am however sad the show is over.  I love that fact there is comedy and drama.  Thank you ... Thank You SO much.. lol"
B000S9FEFY Saw the series on tv a few years back and decided we'd forgotten and missed enough episodes to re-watch the series."
B000S9FEFY I have watched 1 and 2 and now working on 3 it is good and i watchen i want a quick cop show fix"
B000S9FEFY I missed this series the first time around, watching one or two episodes.I'm wading through all the episodes on my Kindle Fire and enjoy the dramatic and, sometimes, comedic plots of this interesting show. The characters are a pleasure to watch and the show was very well produced. And the commercials......don't miss those at all."
B000S9FEFY I'm enjoying the series.  wish the last two seasons were on &#34;prime&#34;  as of now, I'm watching all the seasons on &#34;prime&#34; for the second time."
B000S9FEFY It is so great to see a headstrong woman following her own personal convictions in order to get the criminal confessions needed to prosecute.  I love the way she comes up with ways around things by finding &#34;loop holes&#34; when promising not to prosecute and then has the FBI prosecute instead thereby keeping helr word."
B000S9FEFY I didn't think the series could get any better but this season was better than the first 2.  So much more of the characters and the stories got even better."
B000S9FEFY The third season has a lot of change in store for Brenda Johnson (Kyra Sedgwick). SPOILERSFritz proposes and Brenda has a mysterious ailment that makes her emotions go bananas for awhile. The Third season of \"The Closer\" is among the best to date particularly with the two two part episodes. \"Til Death Do Us Part\" is a complex mystery that doesn't provide easy answers for Brenda and her crack Priority Homocide Division. Many of the characters in the show also face change including a possible forced retirement for Lt. Provenza.The set has a nice transfer with solid colors and an anamorphic widescreen transfer. The extras although not overwhelming great are solid but then you really aren't buying this for the extras are you? We get a good featurette that talks about the art of interrogation where police officers discuss how they often get confessions and how they have to do the exact roleplaying that we see on the show. We also get deleted scenes for a number of episodes as well as a gag reel. Unfortunately there aren't any commentary tracks (the strong two part episodes would have been perfect for commentary tracks since they are both the most complex and, in the case of \"Next of Kin\", comedic (Brenda, Fritz, Provenza and a suspect have to travel cross country to return to L.A. during the Holidays with Brenda's amusing parents).I did run into a glitch with the second disc where the disc was either defective or there was a problem during the transfer where \"frames\" are skipped during an entire 10 minute segment (although the dialog is fine).As with the previous seasons the writing, direction and acting are top notch better than a lot that we see on regular network TV. A great series continues to get better with the third season of \"The Closer\"."
B000S9FEFY I never watched it when it was on TV so I am really enjoying watching all of them now. I really like the main character and how Kyra Sedgwick portrays her."
B000S9FEFY This was the worst show on tv . A bunch of cardboard characters , wooden acting , stupid cases and vulgar and tasteless jokes . This was totally repulsive garbage and the fact that TNT kept it on seven seasons shows they are a stupid network ."
B000SXKBXU This was one of the most mind numbing movies I have ever seen. Cary Grant did the best he could with this plot and his costar...don't waste your time or money!"
B000SXKBXU ROOM FOR ONE MORE (1952) looks amazingly dopey and restrained, even by 1950s standards. Based on the autobiography of George (Cary Grant) and Anna Rose (a dreadful Betsy Drake), the philanthropic foster parent poster-people, ROOM seems to drag a bit at 88 minutes ... but it is the children who truly make this film a delight. I'd never seen this film before and that made it the more interesting to watch.George and Anna Rose fostered several children - though they did not adopt them, preferring to rely on the welfare of the day to help them raise the children. A lot of this film is an interesting but shallow look at the system as it was in the 1950s. One is struck by how seemingly cruel the whole country was back then.Jimmy John Wilson (a spectacular Clifford Tatum, Jr., who fell off the radar in 1956), a boy in iron leg braces, steals the show as he recovers and struggles with having a family. The culmination is his shedding of the braces and joining the Boy Scouts. Of course gravel-voiced little Teenie (the famous little George Winslow), a kind of slightly more vocal Buster Keaton type, really steals the scenes. He blurts out something he shouldn't; when confronted with all the angry glares, he shrugs and says flatly, \"Shoot me.\"Also impressive was Ben (a very talented Larry Olsen), a warm-hearted average kid with a dry, keen sense of humor. Somehow he manages to slip a hilarious, inoffensive gay joke in his dialogue - you'll have to watch for it since I refuse to spoil.This an all-around 1950s classic of sorts, but do not look to the sets or even the director for that mark of excellence: it's all in the kids. This film seems to have inspired lots of other films and TV shows, but I was deeply moved by the lessons it teaches. The orphaned children taken in by the Roses no doubt understood these lessons - and we should learn them since they are just as relevant today."
B000SXKBXU I bought this movie simply because I love old Cary Grant movies.  I took a chance and I'm glad that I did. What a great movie this was and it made me seriously consider becoming a foster parent."
B000SXKBXU This movie is a reminder of what kindness, love, and patience can do for a family and a community. On the surface, It may seem to present a way of solving today's complex problems in simplistic terms. However, children who have been abandoned by the adults who were supposed to give them a sense of security and unconditional love need someone's patience, kindness, and love, as well as a sense of fairness or justice, just as much today as when this film was made. Each of the foster parents in this film demonstrated the qualities I mentioned, and then some. Good for them! And, watching the film reminded me that there is always more we can all do to help lift children above the harsh negatives of this world."
B000SXKBXU I am a huge Cary Grant fan, I thought I'd seen all of his movies, and today, this gem came to my attention. I sure miss the values, the love and the care for one's family and neighbors as depicted in this movie. I was born in the 60's, so I remember scouting, and the morals and values that were taught. I remember friendly neighborhood children, riding bikes and going to the beach.I didn't expect to get choked up watching this, but I did, as well as laugh out loud at times. This story is about a family with a heart for children. They bring two children who are living in orphanages, into their homes. The transformation that love, discipline, and a home can cause on even the most devastated child. How I wish things could go back to the way they were. I know it wasn't as idyllic as is shown in movies, but I definitely miss those days. I'd give this 10 stars if I could!"
B000U6I0B0 Great show!! If you love science and mayhem on a weekly basis this is the show for you there is also a dose of comedy in it for ya as well."
B000U6I0B0 I have enjoyed Eureka thoroughly.  They have a great cast of characters, it is humorous at times, awesome at others.  I think its well done, and I am not a big fan of syfy.  You should watch it, you'll enjoy it.  Nice break from the usual TV fare!!"
B000U6I0B0 Eureka is a great series that, since its in a area 51setting, anything can and does happen."
B000U6I0B0 If you enjoy a good deal of comedy with your SciFi you will probably enjoy Eureka. There certainly are plenty of serious events, but with a regular mix of comedy to keep things from getting to dark. Kind of like the X-Files which had plenty of serious episodes but then were visited by unusual people including \"The Lone Gunmen\" to keep things in perspective. The second season is a must have for anyone that bought the first. This season continues the investigation of the alien artifact along with the further emersion of Sheriff Jack Carter and Zoe into Eureka's community.Many of the budding relationships have now fizzled and new ones have began that may seem less odd or more depending on your perspective. This is not high brow SciFi for the most part although some of the ideas are based on conceivable research. Eureka is a town of Mensa types that have their own projects and inventions that they develop. It seems they aren't under the same rules as the rest the country so anything can happen when their experiaments go wrong. Good quality DVDs and excellent replayability, but I'm still not crazy about cardboard fold up cover."
B000U6I0B0 Totally enjoyed Season 2. The DVD shipped fast however,one of the disks was loose and has signs of some rubbing during shipment. The DVD played fine with no glitches so all is good."
B000U6I0B0 \"Eureka - Season Two\" picks up right where the first season left off, and the events of the previous season color the story and plot lines. The characters have also better settled into their parts in this season, making the interactions much more enjoyable. The acting, writing, and special effects are very good (perhaps even better than the first season).This is a smart and funny series that we watch with the entire family. Highly Recommended!"
B000U6I0B0 This series was very well done on all levels.  It was excellent escapism entertainment in that I could always depend on the story line to be happily resolved.  Everyone of the characters were believable, and mostly likeable.  There is no crime to having a formula that leaves the audience wanting more.  The writers did a good job, the actors did a good job, the content was interesting, and the plot was fun."
B000U6I0B0 It's nice te see a series thats fun to watch some of the things re far fetched but that's the fun parts"
B000U6I0B0 One of the best shows on cable. Not only was it funny but in a way educational as well. Too bad SYFY canceled it."
B000U6I0B0 Eureka is a fun series and this is before everything gets complicated.  Enjoy these early episodes and recognize the hints and subtle plot develop lines."
B000U6I0B0 Apparently the little genius town of Eureka hasn't quite run out of disasters yet, even with the destruction of the Artifact.In fact, Eureka's problems get worse as the show's writing becomes better, starting with the citizens bursting into flame. The second season of \"Eureka\" is more confident and well-balanced than the previous one, and it takes the characters, quirky humor and tight writing into brand-new territory. Including Carter walking around naked.The timeline has been restored, and Carter (Colin Ferguson) and Henry (Joe Morton) are trying to adjust to their past lives. Carter also is convinced that the future will unfold just as it did in the other timeline.But during a solar flare viewing, a guy violently combusts -- and soon other people start combusting. Carter searches for a link between the victims, and finds that someone near him may be next. Meanwhile, the Pentagon decides to remove Nathan Stark (Ed Quinn) from Global Dynamics' big chair, and replace him with his estranged wife Allison (Salli Richardson-Whitfield). My, that's awkward.Other problems pop up over the season -- shared dreams, personal forcefields, \"ice funnels of death,\" falling debris clouds attracted to the GD headquarters, invisibility projects, Fargo's frozen grandpa, Biblical plagues, Carter becoming unnaturally attractive to all women, and an attempt to recreate the Big Bang that apparently turns everyone (except Carter) into driveling idiots.But while the Artifact has been effectively destroyed, its presence is still felt -- Allison's autistic son Kevin has formed a strange connection to it. And when a brilliant scientist creates a deadly alchemical bacterium -- which turns all iron into gold, then rust -- it may lead to a showdown over Kevin's future....There's a darker current running through the second season of \"Eureka\" -- Henry is more subdued and haunted, and a little boy's life is in danger. But don't worry, because thankfully the writers don't switch too far into the dark zone -- the focus is always first and foremost on our Everyman Sheriff, and how he tries to deal with the Horrific Crisis of the day.In fact, the second season flows very easily, with a more relaxed pace and a colourful, diverse array of science-based problems -- including robot geese. There's lots of great dialogue (\"Jo made it seem like the sky is falling.\" \"That hasn't happened since 2004, and that was more of an igniting of the ionosphere\") and hilarious comedic moments, such as Carter's naked public shower and the shared Zorro fantasy. But there are some sweet moments too, such as Fargo's grandfather coming to terms with the life he missed out on.I wasn't too impressed by Ferguson in \"Eureka's\" debut season, but he really gets to blossom in this one -- he's quirkier, cuter and has a knack for physical comedy. He fits in better with the Eurekans. And he brings a lot of life to Jack's problems, whether it's the weird stuff, or the more realistic threat of his ex-wife taking his daughter out of Eureka.Quinn and Richardson Whitfield also do well, as Allison and Nathan try to adjust to their new positions, as well as some renewed sparks. And the other characters get rounding out -- Jo gets in touch with her inner girly-girl, Zoe clashes with some genius \"mean girls,\" Taggart has a maternal experience, and Fargo gets in touch with some family members. Also has to deal with the possibility of dying.Of particular note: Morton brings a feeling of dark pathos into many of Henry's appearances, reminding us what he's lost and leaving us wondering what he's planning. And it's worth noting that a trio of \"Stargate SG-1\" actors make some very solid guest appearances -- particularly Michael Shanks as an embittered, myth-obsessed scientist.The second season of \"Eureka\" sticks to the humorous sci-fi angle, but expands the characters -- as well as some of the darker subplots. Definitely a great little series, and promises to stay fun and suspenseful."
B000U6I0B0 Although this season of Eureka did not have a particularly strong story arc that carried throughout (the questions of \"the artifact\" are never answered in a satisfactory manner), it really doesn't matter. The show is just so much fun to watch! It's the strength of the characters that makes it shine- Sheriff Carter, Deputy Lupo, Fargo, Zoe, Alison, Stark, and of course, Henry Deacon. It's a delight to see the chemistry that occurs between all these well written characters, as they attempt to save the town of Eureka from a new crisis each episode. Sure, it's pretty formulaic, but that's part of what makes it so good... it's familiar, and comforting, and the formula just plain WORKS.Unfortunately, the resolution on this DVD is not very good (it's old technology, after all), and it's not available on Blu-ray. But if you can stream it from Netflix in HD, it looks fantastic."
B000U6I0B0 Absolutely loved Season 1.  For me, Season 2 is the same plot over and over, continuing from Season 1.  The characters haven't developed much past Season 2.  Although I enjoyed Season 2, I probably won't buy anymore of the Eureka DVD's due to the repetitiveness. Overall, the idea of a town full of genius scientists is so cool!  I was hoping for a bit more innovation of the plot line because the idea of the show is wonderful and entertaining and because this show has so many great reveiws."
B000U6I0B0 It took me a couple of shows to get interested in this series but I plan to watch more seasons. It is amusing at times with some sci-fi thrown in. Everything you think can go wrong in this town does but the Sheriff takes care of it, usually by the end of the show."
B000U6I0B0 Eureka has outstanding actors cast perfectly in their roles, and what great roles. The situations the script has them in have me laughing out loud! I find myself eagerly forwarding to the next act!"
B000U6I0B0 If you liked or didn't like &#34; Eureka&#34;, I'm not going to review it, you already know what you liked about it. I enjoyed the whole series. I have a couple of favorite episodes from Season 2. I like having the disks. Cable and internet service goes out from time to time, so it's nice to pop in the dvds and watch on my Sony portable. I was glad they ditched the funky potato foam of the 1st season package. This one holds the dvds correctly in place. The box is not going to fill up the landfill, it's going to remain with me for a long time to come, and then it will become a collectible, right?"
B000U6I0B0 I like this show because it is entertaining without relying on large amounts of sex and violence. This season builds on the first with an expaninding multiple plot lines."
B000U6I0B0 I had never heard of this show until I signed up for Amazon Prime and started watching it on Prime instant video.  I fell in love with the show and the characters.  I am really very sad that they have cancelled it.  I could watch it for hours every day and never get tired of it.  It seems like every show I ever find that is an interesting quality show they have to cancel  I'm sure there are a lot more sci-fi fans out there that are upset about this.  Here's wishing they would bring it back!!"
B000U6I0B0 good enough to watch / have on in the background. Would be 10 billion times better without the Max Headroom idiot (Matthew George \"Matt\" Frewer) (what kind of idiot named Matthew needs Matt w/in quotes w/in his name, now if his name was Matthew George \"the Dork\" Frewer it would all make sense). The guy has the worst fake Australian accent ever & is horrible trying to be crocodile Dundee. Luckily the dum dum is only in about 5% of the scenes."
B000U6I0B0 This season is a great follow up to season one.  The show continues to be fun and engaging.  I have been mini marathon viewing 2-3 episodes a day and have not gotten tired of it yet."
B000U6I0B0 Although I would call myself a sci-fi buff I truly enjoy a show that challenges our mindset.  Years ago (probably 58 yrs.) a comic strip had a detective-Dick Tracy- with a wrist watch that was also a camera and a communication device.  I have lived long enough to see something similar to it come to life.  Long before the first spaceship went into orbit Flash Gordon another comic hero was circling the distant planets in a spaceship.  Sci-Fi for many is boring for me I enjoy seeing the imagination of men/women become reality."
B000U6I0B0 My husband watches this he likes it. I am not into science fiction so I don't really like it it's fast moving"
B000U6I0B0 Eureka is the best show on television. I buy each season to have and watch whenever I like. The storylines and the actors are first rate."
B000U6I0B0 Funny, different, find it ironic that the. O brain new sheriff is the hero in each episode. A little hokey, but fun"
B000U6I0B0 Eureka gets even better in it's second season, we get more of the fargo character and the stark character is still around. He goes in the third season and his presence is missed by many.  The show remained true to it's premise and it still does,  with lots of crazy science related disasters affecting people with usually sheriff Carter's quick thinking to get them out of the mess in some form or another.  Eureka is so engaging because it's a great place , filled with great characters and it's the kind of place that one would hope does exist somewhere in some form. The dvd's have deleted scenes and other features too. The picture quality is excellent and the series comes in a good case as far as I can tell.  This is a good family scifi show that can appeal to anyone who likes a great tv show. the only downside is that scy fy hadn't yet figured out that they should make more than 13 eps a season with this one. ( wharehouse 13 too). If it's your biggest hit then give us more of it!  which thankfully they do in season 3 and four of eureka!  But the show is endearing and fun and is worth watching with someone you like because they'll like this show too."
B000U6I0B0 You can't go wrong on this series. It is truly excellent. It has been a long time since a new Sci-fi as fantastic as this one and one which has not been dumbed down for a change. This is a technology buffs dream come  true. Plus it is a clean, wholesome program for the entire family. It never fails to engage your attention and teach you something new using technologies so advanced, it is new to all of us. Every episode has been wonderful. The interaction between the cast members has been magic. Congrats to the person who selected the cast.It was a stroke of genius to start their new series in July each year. Eureka was the only game in town as far as new TV programs at that time of year. Seems none of the other Cable channels have caught onto the fact that we also watch TV in the summer.We are happy to see Henry back to normal. The writers had almost ruined his character between the dark moody scripts and changing hairdo's. Henry is one of their main characters whether they like it or not. His many talents make him a multifaceted character which never fails to surprise us.Oddly, I thought I never liked the character of Stark until they killed him off last Tuesday in a real tear-jerker ending. Now the show seems empty without his egocentric abilities. A key necessity in such a lab of high tech covert projects. I liked it better with him in it. They need to bring him back... perhaps by finding out that he was thrown into the future rather than deleted.I know shows will get rid of expensive actors and trade them for a couple lesser actors.... but the trade-off of Stark for Thorne and the new sister of the Sheriff are not even close to the same caliper as Stark and neither adds anything to the series. The new additions are just excess baggage. It would be no loss if they both disappeared.As far as Thorne's trimming of the employees role... The gov't has never cared about how much tax money they waste..and they don't usually lay off their black project scientists... so her coming in and acting like it is a private corporation needing to be slimmed down makes no sense.Not to mention why the Sheriff's sister would be allowed to be in a closed town filled with black project employees and scientists who use classified products out in the open.This looks like an early attempt to cut costs. In the corporate world, you're allowed to show a loss on your taxes for 3 years. After that, they lose the tax breaks so most new companies will start trimming employees between year 2&3 and will usually pick their highest salaried employees to cut and try to replace them with someone cheaper... unfortunately, they usually end up with someone who can't do the job... which is why they are cheaper to hire.They need to let the viewers decide on major cast and plot changes... not some pitbull exec in the network sales dept... like the ones who canceled Star Trek and Outer Limits.Let's hope some idiot in charge doesn't cancel or ruin the spirit of Eureka like they have managed to do in the past to every decent show. Especially those programs which are over the heads of those cable network goons. They need to remember that most viewers are not on Nielson and they are not getting accurate ratings from them. They should also be careful about allowing a sponsor to ruin the program with too much interference... and Degree is coming close to that point in just a few episodes this yearBut so far, Eureka is still a one-of-a-kind program which never fails to entertain and bring delight to the viewers."
B000U6I0B0 Watched all 5 seasons in about a month or so... whenever we were both home and able... it was super fun, quirky and just a good time. SOOOO sad to have it end but there were a lot of time travel, worm hole situations so I can bet it was getting challenging to keep it fresh! GREAT show!"
B000U6I0B0 Season 2 of Eureka was just as good as Season 1. The writing was tighter, the acting was smooth. There were a lot more one off plot driven shows rather than multi-episode story arcs but very enjoyable. I highly recommend the entire run and Season two is a fine addition to both your collection and the show."
B000U6I0B0 I enjoy the fanciful science and the character interactions.  The actors are good and the stories are just plain fun.  They are the kind of shows I like to watch more than once."
B000U6I0B0 We watch Eureka over and over and over.  One of the best shows for us to fall asleep to while watching on the iPad.  Just enough comedy and science to make it funny and not all the heavy drama that most Sy-Fy shows want to include.  Never understood how this show would be cancelled and Warehouse 13 'replaced' it...no comparison.  Oh well..guess that's enough words for now."
B000U6I0B0 my husband and I  really have been enjoying this show just found out about it from our grandkids and have had fun watching it"
B000U6I0B0 EACH STORY IS GOOD TO WATCH. IT WILL KEEP YOU LAUGHING. AS WELL AS TRYING TO FIGURE WHAT WILL HAPPEN NEXT."
B000U6I0B0 I love this show!  I can't wait to get to the next episode to see what they come up with next."
B000U6I0B0 Love the writing for this show and the ideas they present.  A must see!! Definitely add to your watch list now."
B000U6I0B0 I liked the first season of EUREKA, but frankly found a lot of the stories a tad flat and not especially gripping.  But the storytelling was much stronger in Season Two and the interrelations between the main characters much more involving.  In just about every way, the show improved in its second season.I like also that some of the characters who were not especially important in Season One got fleshed out in Season Two.  It was especially good to see Zoe finally get involved in the story in a way other than being just a pest or a pain, as she was in Season One.  And late in the season Ever Carradine joined the cast as Sheriff Carter's sister, a really nice addition to the cast.  But none of this was as important as the greatly improved writing.  Although the show continued to be a tad too episodic for me taste, many of the standalone episodes were more interesting than what you usually find in a show of this type.  Several of the stories were pretty original and even the ones that were somewhat derivative managed some unique touches.  In nearly every way the show managed to cohere in improve.  Basically, it just got more and more entertaining."
B000U6I0B0 A light-hearted look at a possible future with lots phony physics and graphic effects.  Well, we knew that in season one and still look forward to each episode, playing one a night in our viewing program."
B000U6I0B0 I like they way they introduce different technologies into the show.  The characters are believable, although the script writing is weak sometimes.  Overall, if you like science fiction based on cool technologies, you should enjoy this show.  My teenagers and I like to watch it."
B000U6I0B0 The unique story line continues in season 2.  Jack Carter keep things in perspective by layman standard as usual. A perfect straight man in town full of mad scientists... I loved it."
B000U6I0B0 I like this show, Sheriff Jack is super handsome. The story is cute.  I wish there were more seasons of this show because it is super addicting.  It isn't too stuffy like a lot of sci fi shows.  It is set in our time I like that too."
B000U6I0B0 I really like this series. everyone works well together. if you like comedy with some drama thrown in, you'll love this."
B000U6YXPM Good characters but slim on story. I like the angelic presence, but wish the show was just a bit more broad in it's spiritual references."
B000U6YXPM I watched this long after I should have quit hoping it would become redeming in some way but it kept getting worse.  I would not recommend it."
B000U6YXPM It took me a while to get into Saving Grace, but by the end of the 3rd Season, I was sorry to see it end. I watched it on Amazon Prime, and it was well worth my time and efford."
B000U6YXPM Life is complicated. This story line is clever and serves that  truth well.I like the idea that Angels can be like ordinary, overworked people.The character Holly Hunter portrays is &#34;Grace&#34; itself. She is her own worst enemy, drinking and sleeping with various people, yet committing her precious time on earth to bringing justice to, and for those who have been wronged.In spite of her endless rotations of addiction to work, sex and alcoholic drink, she makes deep commitments to her detective team, so they may help serve justice to victims of life and circumstance.Then along comes an Ordinary Angel that attempts to open the window to Grace's soul. The question becomes; will Grace respond to the bumbling ways of the Angel and find a way to save herself?  Cool ideas!"
B000U6YXPM Series Creator: \"Nancy Miller\" penned a nice semi-hard hitting TV version of a La Femme Nikita with severely rough edges Oaklahoma Police Dept. Detective that has fallen under the watchful graces of an Angel assigned to provide the Detective with a second chance at redemption for all of the dimwitted, narrow-minded, self destructive decisions she's made.Nicely done, almost different and indifferent to the usual Playmate Bunny types depicted in commercial Television dramas, petite \"Holly Hunter\" manages to drive this series forward with a Napolean complex hellbent on rough-housing anything, and anyone that gets in her way. While the themes are adult oriented, the nature and style is more akin to the whimsy of teenage boys--with enough preadulescent attraction for Tomboy girls--to offset oncoming hormonal desires, which makes \"SAVING GRACE\" highly entertaining viewing for the youth of my soul...  GBJ"
B000U6YXPM Saving Grace is the show I love to hate. The main character, Grace Hanadarko is a completely unlikable character with very few redeeming qualities. She is in a down spiral into self destruction (and hell) and she does everything in her power to hasten it. A cop, Grace has many inner demons. She is very promiscuous and uses sex and alcohol to escape her inner demons. Sex, adultery, alcohol and violence, that is Grace's life. She is a good cop though and, although a bit violent on the job and an affair with her married partner, she has an interesting sense of justice and a desire to get the criminals.One night, while drunk driving, Grace hits a man and in a moment of desperation asks God for help. Well, God answers in the form of Earl, her own Guardian Angel, her last chance at redemption. Well, Earl is far from the traditional angel with wings, he is a scruffy looking, tobacco-spitting, and rather sketchy looking angel. He tells Grace she is headed straight to hell and that this is her last chance. Earl provides Grace with guidance and clues to something that she has to figure out (the big reveal of the season). Through Earl and the rest of the cast, we delve into the inner psyche and past of Grace, a deeply troubled and scarred woman that has suffered through many things including the death of her sister (Oklahoma bombings).Grace's self destruction is even more interesting when we learn that her brother is a priest, her sister is a perfectionist and a bit OCD stay at home mom and her best friend (San Giacomo) is the voice of reason in more ways than one and offers unconditional support. The way all these characters are contrasted against Grace provides a very interesting view of Grace herself and whether she will straighten out. Although I dislike the show and I dislike Grace, one must admire the multi-layered and complex character that Holly Hunter plays with perfection. Truly, her acting skills shine through and although I hate the show, I can't help but watch. It is just like those reality TV shows that you really don't wanna watch, but can't help doing so."
B000U6YXPM I kind of like this show, but it never really grabbed me.  Still I did watch 2 seasons of it."
B000U6YXPM One of the best new series to come along, within the realm of &#34;The X-Files&#34; and &#34;House&#34; - and, unfortunately, this show ended all too soon."
B000U6YXPM Too bad it was cancelled...it is raw in your face, sometimes brutal, dark but also funny!  Holly Hunter is a gas."
B000UERE3M A REALLY FUN SHOW, EVERYONE SHOULD GIVE IT A TRY, CANT'T WAIT FOR THE NEXT SEASON"
B000UERE3M This is an enjoyable Psych episode that pretty much follows the show's normal format of flashbacks and improbable coincidental occurrences, and it works well. We like Psych and tend to watch the older episodes on Netflix over theRoku 2 XS 1080p Streaming Player, but this episode wouldn't stream so we bought it on Amazon since it was the next in the series.No spoilers from me: This is a Christmas themed episode that has Gus and Shawn going to Christmas dinner at Gus' parents house where Shawn tries to impress Mr. and Mrs. Guster, but things don't go too well when a neighbor is found murdered.Sometimes the acting is a little over the top and often boarders on downright silly, but it is a very clever and fun show.Highly Recommended!CFH"
B000UERE3M The item was just as described.  Also, I really enjoyed watching the DVD's -- I would recommend that everyone buy a copy of Psych Second Season!"
B000UERE3M Never get tired of Psych. I want all seasons."
B000UERE3M Without a doubt, Shawn Spencer is the public's favorite fake fictional psychic detective. Of course as far as I know, he's also the only one.But that doesn't stop the second season of \"Psych\" from being a rollicking good time, full of crazy schemes and baffling murder mysteries. James Roday and Dul&eacute; Hill actually become even more entertaining, with less slapstick and more of a reliance on eccentric plot twists, pop culture references, and crimes that get ever weirder.Shawn (Roday) and Gus (Hill) get swamped by reality pop culture when American Duos comes to Santa Barbara. The cruel British judge Nigel St. Nigel (Tim Curry) hires them to protect him, because he thinks that someone is trying to kill him.A live wire and a poisoned sandwich later, Shawn agrees -- especially when a drugged-out female judge almost dies. But out of all the people who loathe Nigel, which one tried to kill him? Then the police suspect that Shawn has lost his touch when he announces that someone was killed by a dinosaur, and is confronted by a sexy FTD psychic.But that isn't the last or least of Sean and Gus's problems -- a chop shop with secrets, bounty hunters, Gus's parents accused of Yuletide murder, jockey deaths and fixed races, nanny-related robberies, electrocutions on the catwalk, and going undercover at a telenovela, a school for the gifted, and a retirement community. They even have a run-in with a wealthy, crazy woman that Gus drunkenly married on spring break years ago... and it turns out her new fiancee is a bit shady.Finally, Shawn and Gus are pursuing one of their weirdest cases ever. First a security guard is suspected of stealing a 3000-year-old mummy -- but then it appears that the mummy actually murdered the guard. Can Shawn figure out what is going on -- with the mummy murder, the police chief, and his oddly-behaving father?Although it didn't break much new ground, the first season of \"Psych\" was very fresh and entertaining TV. Fortunately creator Steve Franks is sticking to the old adage: \"If it ain't broke, don't fix it,\" and the second season doesn't deviate from what works -- there's still lots of comedy, spoofery, silly dialogue (\"It's spontaneous psychic krav maga!\") and enjoyable mysteries.The first episode kicks things off a bit weakly, since the \"American Idol\" joke gets stretched out too far. Fortunately the mysteries after that get much more solid, deftly juggling even the funny-sounding plot twists (strangulation by mummy bandage? Refrigeration trucks?). You even get an endless parade of pop culture references, from Michael Jackson to \"Shaun of the Dead,\" James Bond to wikipedia.com. Gotta love that.But the best aspect of \"Psych\" continues to be its kooky dialogue. Usually Shawn provides it (\"I hunger for the meatballs the way a jackal salivates for an injured possum\"), but other characters get to as well (\"Hola. Me llamo Inspector Carlton Lassiter. Me gusta queso\").Shawn and Gus remain an entertaining pair of twentysomething everymen, with Roday continuing to be eccentric, lovably charming and kooky -- although Shawn gets quite a shock in the cliffhanger ending. And Hill gets more attention, with Gus pursuing models and faking psychic powers. We even discover a secret past involving sweater vests, spring break, and a drunken wedding -- lots of fun.And the supporting cast remains solid -- Corbin Bernsen gets to participate in a couple of the cases as Shawn's hard-nosed dad, sometimes in loud tropical shirts. Timothy Omundson continues to be entertaining as harder-nosed cop Lassiter. And Maggie Lawson rounds off the cast as the \"enigma wrapped in a little blonde riddle\" who is Shawn's love interest, as well as a counterpoint to Lassiter.The second season of \"Psych\" continues the eccentric crimes and equally odd crimesolvers, mingling comedy and mystery with only a couple weak spots. Sweet black licorice!"
B000UERE3M \"Psych\" is a hilarious show, and the second season improves upon the wonderful formula established in its first effort. Once again, this show is all about character, and the chemistry that exists between series stars Shawn and Gus is second to none, on any network or any show. It's a delight to watch these lifelong friends engage in their wildly inappropriate adventures as they attempt to solve mysteries that they really have no business getting involved in (not to mention the hilarious flashbacks to their childhood). Lassiter, O'Hara, and \"Dad\" all continue to shine, rounding out the wonderful cast of characters who each complement the show perfectly. Though every episode of these season is fun to watch, a couple of standouts for me were \"Gus' Dad May Have Killed an Old Guy\" and \"65 Million Years Off\" (in which Shawn accuses a T-Rex of murder!)."
B000UERE3M This season of Psych is great, the duo of Shawn and Gus are even funnier and have to solve even funnier cases. The character development between Shawn and Juliet is also furthered.I would definitely recommend this season to anyone looking for a good laugh."
B000UERE3M The season starts out with possible the best of the Psych episodes - American Duos. Tim Curry is brilliant, of course. 65 Million Years off, Bounty Hunters! (Kevin Sorbo!), Lights, Cameras...Homicido and Shawn (and Gus) of the Dead.And There's Something about Mira has the best line ever \"I should have been that goat!\"The Chief takes on a larger role - and well played.Gus and Shawn continue to be their solid selves.My only minor complaints are Black and Tan: A Crime of Fashion\" - Shawn isn't good looking enough to be a model, but Gus is? Really? Also, the set up for the appearance of the mother. Could have lived without that"
B000UERE3M For the second season of this wonderful mystery/comedy show, the producers wisely left things pretty much alone.  Shawn Spenser (James Roday) comes from a long line of cops.  But he rebelled against his father's (Corbin Bernsen) wishes and didn't become a cop.  Instead, he pretends to be a psychic, using his finely honed observation skills to get the information for his \"visions.\"  He's even opened Psych, a psychic detective agency with best friend Burton \"Gus\" Guster (Dule Hill).  And he has an impressive track record, much to the dismay of Detective Lassiter (Timothy Omundsun).  Rounding out the cast are Santa Barbara Detective Juliet O'Hara (Maggie Lawson) and Interim Chief of Police Karen Vick (Kirsten Nelson).And what a collection of cases they have this year, too.  Shawn and Gus join the TV sensation American Duos to find out who is trying to kill the head judge (played by Tim Curry).  They become models to find out who killed both partners of a fashion house.  Shawn must clear Gus' parents of murdering the neighborhood crank.  When Gus' uncle (guest star John Amos) comes for a visit, Shawn and Gus have to switch places, without the police figuring out that both of them are faking it.  Equally complicated is a case where a real psychic is brought in and Shawn must keep his secret from her.  Shawn puts his credibility on the line by claiming one victim was killed by a dinosaur.  And in the season finale, Shawn pins the crime on a mummy.This show has real come together and is firing on all pistons now.  The mysteries are tight and confusing.  I might piece things together a little before Shawn, but not by much.  And it doesn't matter because the entire fun is getting to the end.  The over the top physical humor has been toned down this year (and that's a good thing), but there is still plenty of laughs.  You've got cultural references spewed in mile a minute dialogue by Shawn and Gus, comedy from the character's relationships, comedy from the situations, and some physical humor.  I can't stop myself from laughing out loud while I watch this show.  And the cast does a great job holding it all together.  They bring high energy to each episode, but they keep it real.If you have missed this show, you have definitely missed out.  Don't let another day go by without becoming a fan."
B000UERE3M this is a fun intro to these two crazy guys.  they are so silly and loveable. the characters are fun and well developed."
B000UERE3M I had just finished seeing the episode of Monk when they had just gave the announcement that this show was coming up next,  I had never seen the show before and decided to give it a try and now I am grateful to have made that choice.  The two characters Shawn Spencer(James Roday) the thirty-something son of a police officer who while having a photographic memory was taught by his father to remember immaculate minute details, and Shawn's best friend the more down-to-earth and responsible Burton 'Gus' Guster(Dul&eacute; Hill) decide after a misadventure with a crime and helping to solve it to open their own detective agency(Actually more of Shawn's idea).  The main gimmick is that Shawn uses his incredible deductive abilities as a somewhat scam pretending to actually be a psychic solving cases.  Whether or not the police believe him to be psychic his high solve rate lands him a position with the police department as their resident psychic.  The series is vastly hilarious and seeing some of the scenes that the two main actors do is amazing,  the most memorable for me from the first season is the season one episode finale Scary Sherry:Bianca's Toast believe me you'll laugh insanely seeing their antics on this episode. The show also has four other main cast to the show but of course you'll most of the time will try and keep up with Shawn and Gus.  The extras are also nice you have the gag reels, commentaries from the cast and producers, some deleted scenes, and see some adventures of Shawn and Gus when they were kids.  The video is widescreen and for the most part clear and sharp there are a few scenes where there is some graininess but those are mostly scenic scenes and not when the actors are in the shots.  So if you're looking for a change of pace from shows like C.S.I or NCIS here's a more comedic look at the crime solving efforts of are two favorite private psychic detectives..."
B000ULTV4U It is great. Over and over again, I can watch these and I do. It is always a fun time."
B000ULTV4U Monk was a very good show. I have enjoyed all of the seasons and this was just as good as the rest. Very well done."
B000ULTV4U It must be admitted that the fifth season of \"Monk\" had some rough patches, where Monk's OCD was overwritten and the plots got a bit limp.But the obsessive compulsive detective is still going, and fortunately \"Monk\" is still one of the best shows on television. And the sixth season continues \"Monk's\" grand tradition -- solidly-written mystifying stories, quirky detecting, and some excellent acting from Tony Shalhoub. Even better, the two-part finale really shows \"Monk\" off at its absolute best.As the season opens, Monk (Tony Shalhoub) finds that his obsessed groupie Marcy Maven (Sarah Silverman) needs to hire him, despite a restraining order. So she \"buys\" him at a bachelor auction and makes him work on a bizarre case -- her dog is being accused of killing someone, but the dog died before the murder took place. Needless to say, there's more than meets the eye.Among the other cases the OCD detective has to deal with: a framed rapper, murder on a nudist beach, an investigation overlapping with Julie's love life, stolen safety-deposit boxes, treasure maps, a daredevil who might be his archnemesis, insomnia, going undercover in a cult, a newfound painting hobby, and a shot Santa. He even has to investigate Stottlemeyer's (Ted Levine) girlfriend.But the story takes a darker turn toward the end of the season. Monk finds a lead for the \"six-fingered man\" who killed Trudy, and confronts him... and after a struggle, the six-fingered man is dead. A rural sheriff arrests Monk, but Monk insists that he's innocent -- and he's determined to find out who is framing him. But with the police after him and a conspiracy in motion, can he solve the murder before he's caught?\"Monk\" had a bit of a rough patch in the fifth season -- some of the episodes simply didn't gel, and Monk's OCD was written strangely. Fortunately \"Monk - Season Six\" goes back to what makes the series more enjoyable -- a couple of episodes don't work, like the rapper and the creepy little cult, but these are overshadowed by the better mysteries.Nope, most of the sixth season is a string of solid murder mysteries -- lots of baffling crimes, obscure clues, and new eccentricities for Monk. Despite all the murder and bittersweet moments, the episodes are peppered with some comedy as well, such as the slow demolition of Stottlemeyer's brand-new car. And there's still plenty of bittersweet (\"I'm going to be buried next to Trudy. I can't wait\") and/or hilarious dialogue (\"She had the oldest profession.\" \"Stonemason, huh?\").And the last two episodes of the sixth season are among the best the series has ever produced. A seemingly straightforward crime story blossoms into a heartrending, suspenseful, dramatic, and genuinely unpredictable story, and gives us a few more clues about Trudy's death.Tony Shalhoub is lovably oddballish as Adrian Monk, never turning his tragicomic character into a cartoon -- you just want to hug Monk and give him some perfectly symmetrical cookies. Traylor Howard does a solid job as Monk's assistant, and Levine gets to show Stottlemeyer's warmer, laid-back sides, while Jason Gray-Stanford is consistently fun as the puppy-eager Randy Disher -- even getting to sing a Johnny-Cash-style song about Monk's apparent demise.The sixth season of \"Monk\" has a couple rough patches, but soars up to brilliant heights near the end. And the obsessive-compulsive detective still seems to have quite a bit of work ahead..."
B000ULTV4U This has been one of the funnier seasons I think.  The stories are quite good, a notch up from Season 5 I felt.  Overall the writing here feels as solid as Monk's ever been.  Some of the episodes are a little far-fetched (Monk on the Lam?), but what they may lack in beleivability, they surely make up for in creativity and comic value which serve as a nice added bonus to Monk's tweaked out heroics. Some funny episodes, my favorites probably being \"Mr Monk and His Biggest Fan\" which starts the season off with a bang, \"Mr Monk and the Naked Man\" where Monk confronts his taboos about nudity at a nude beach (this episode was almost deep), \"Mr Monk Joins a Cult\" (kind of silly but I liked the bizarreness of the whole scenario), and \"Mr Monk Paints His Masterpiece\" in which Monk's new hobby starts earning him good money! I can't think of any episodes that I didn't much like. This was a good season."
B000ULTV4U Between Natalie's driving skills, the special appearance by Norman Bates, and confusion and mayhem between the Julies at the end - Wow.  HILARIOUS!!!!If you're a fan of Adrian Monk and you've never seen this episode and you want to laugh - this is THE episode to watch."
B000ULTV4U We see a lot of character development here as the series stretches and the story lines are still good.  Quite  worth your hard earned cash."
B000ULTV4U Why mess with success?  That seems to be the idea behind this season of Monk.  And while it wasn't as strong as some of the other seasons have been, it was certain still fun.The season opens with Sarah Silverman reprising her role as Monk's biggest fan.  She hires Monk (Tony Shalhoub) to find out who is framing her dog for murder.  The catch?  The dog died before the murder took place.And there is more fun to be had.  Monk suspects Captain Stottlemeyer's (Ted Levine) new girlfriend of murder.  Natalie's (Traylor Howard) daughter Julie (Emmy Clarke) gets her first boyfriend and learns to drive.  Monk takes a job as a security guard at his bank to catch a robber.  And he must deal with the consequences of shooting Santa.  And he falls under the spell of cult leader Howie Mandel.When I reviewed season five, I did mention that they were occasionally crossing the line from character to caricature.  That seemed to be more of a problem here in my eyes.  In fact, there were several in a row near the beginning that seemed to be forced for laughs.  The episodes dealing with the nude beach and the rapper were painful instead of funny.  And some of the others had a been there, done that feel to them.On the other hand, there are still so many good moments.  This is especially true of the two part season finale which advances the Trudy storyline when Monk is accused of murdering the six fingered man.And I can't fault the acting.  All four leads (including Jason Gray-Stanford and Lt. Disher) continue to do great jobs bringing their characters to life.  I was disappointed that we only got to see Julie a couple times.  And it is sad watching this knowing that we won't get to see the late Stanley Kamel any more as the excellent Dr. Kroger.Monk may be showing its age.  But it is still fun and entertaining.  Fans will welcome the newest season into their homes."
B000ULTV4U I have been a big fan of Monk since its first season. It just keeps getting better."
B000ULTV4U I'm a monk-a-holic for sure. I watch episode after episods and I get sad when I'm coming to the end of the season.I prefer Julie to the other assistant."
B000ULTV4U Monk's 6th is just as hilarious and entertaining as the previous seasons. Adrian Monk is still miserable and continues to help Captain Stottlemeyer and Disher with solving murders, with the help of his devoted Assistant, Natalie. Throughout this season, Monk must deal with his crazed fan, help a rapper, teaches Julie Teeger about love, hang out with his psychiatrist's son, shoots Santa Claus, joins a cult, becomes a fugitive, and finally has a new lead in the murder of Trudy. I highly recommend MONK: SEASON SIX!!!"
B000ULTV4U Season six was another good season for Monk.  The two hour finale had me excited.  Monk is hilarious and Natalie is still keep things together.This is a must-see season!"
B000ULTV4U What happened was this.....spoilers ahead.......Mr. Monk tore through the sixth season with stronger emotions, even beating up a guy who had something to do with Trudy's death. Dale the Whale returned to try to torment Monk, who had to fake his own death for a while.  Also, Julie Teeger got more screen time as she blossomed into a teenager, while Randy Disher was given more attention as well.  The captain continues to maintain a strong presence on the show, and so does Natalie.  Dr. Kroger holds his own.I missed Monk's brother Ambrose, though."
B000ULZLYY Sherlock Holmes, Columbo, Hercule Poirot -- genius detectives are usually a bit quirky. But no other is as quirky as Adrian Monk, the obsessive-compulsive detective -- and \"Monk: Complete Series \" compiles every episode of this funny, likable little mystery series. Tony Shalhoub shines as title character, solving the case with his gift/curse and his willingness to go anywhere... that doesn't have germs.Adrian Monk's wife Trudy was killed in a car-bombing, and the devastated detective fell apart completely. Years later, Monk (Tony Shalhoub) is partially recovered, but he still is obsessive-compulsive and has dozens of phobias. The only way he manages is with his assistant Sharona (Bitty Schram) -- and later her successor Natalie (Traylor Howard) -- babysitting him.Courtesy of his friend Captain Stottlemeyer (Ted Levine), Monk is called in for dozens of bizarre, baffling cases. His excellent memory and his OCD (\"It's a gift.... and a curse\") allow him to see patterns and details where other people see nothing.Among Monk's cases are going undercover at a prison, a killer dentist, a deadly Christmas gift, an elephant used as a lethal weapon, a billionaire mugger, saving Willie Nelson from a murder rap, trapping a black widow, the death of a 115-year-old man, the Mafia, garbage strikes, rock concerts, a cult, real estate, a murder on a sub, a voodoo curse, UFO sightings, martial-artists, murdered models, and a guy who leaped out of a plane -- and died by drowning.But as quirky and bizarre as the cases is, it never stops hitting the heartstrings. Monk becomes attached to a little boy and a murder victim's dog, and it's a credit to this show's writers that the ending of those episodes aren't maudlin or sappy. And he is still passionately devoted to his dead wife, and his quest for her killer is a story that stretches across the whole series.\"Monk\" is the sort of show that usually gets cancelled after five episodes -- it's well-written, amusing, and smart. So by TV standards, lasting eight seasons is nothing short of miraculous. Like any long-running show it has its duds (\"Mr. Monk Takes His Medicine\" always makes me cringe), b
B000ULZLYY I'm enjoying the Christmas marathon.  I have been laughing at each episode since I've started watching.  Monk is quirky, obsessive compulsive, intelligent, yet relatable.  All the characters are (relatable) - Randy is a hoot and Captain Stoddlemeyer is funny without meaning to be.Monk is educational.  After watching this series for years (I haven't seen all the episodes yet) I'm guessing how people died, cause of death, etc. by telltale clues.  Does this mean I should quit my day job?  Probably not quite yet, but in the meantime I'll visit the sites in the City as an homage to one of my favorite former, former, former police detective.PS - A good bonus is that this show isn't as gruesome as CSI (another favorite, but I admit, I can't watch brains leaking out of someone's skull without cringing)."
B000ULZLYY I love this series he makes me feel like a normal person.  This is fun series allowing you to enjoy the oddities of others with the ability to solve the crime."
B000ULZLYY monk was a smash hit on tv for all of it's series. The show was followed by another hit 'psych' on the same network. Which gave that cable channel two really competitive hits. Monk didn't end it's run from bad ratings , instead fans were happy to see tony shaloub play this character for another 8 seasons. But he was tired of it so the show left the air with the central mystery finally solved. the early episodes featured bitty scram,  she was a excellent aide and did a great job as monks nurse aide. She wanted more money and was fired after a few series. this is a common mistake that many actors make. Only it's worse for women. roles for men are many. there's FAR less for women and a actress on a hit show shouldn't bail unless she has another real offer. this happened to terry farrel on 'becker' and she hasn't worked much sense. tony was well known for 'wings',one of the best of the 1990's sitcoms in the u.s. and a worldwide hit. You can see the show on reelz network in hd today. here he is the lead character and he creates a really sympathetic compulsive detective. ted levine is excellent as his friend capt stotelmyer. The second actress who plays the aide to monk also is engaging and did a fine job.  The whole series is still well lvoed , just like wings is and hopefully a reunion show is in the works for sometime in the future."
B000ULZLYY Season 1- Monk is a hilarious and an incredibly entertaining series. Three years earlier, Adrian Monk's wife, Trudy was murdered by a car bomb. He has extreme O.C.D. and relies on his Nurse/Assistant Sharona to help him while he solves murders with Captain Leland Stottlemeyer, and Lt. Randy Disher. Throughout the season Monk investigates an assassination attempt on a Mayoral Candidate, goes to an asylum, takes a vacation, deals with an earthquake, helps prove the innocence of Willie Nelson, and much more.Season 2- Monk's 2nd is just as hilarious and entertaining as the previous season, perhaps even better. Adrian Monk is still miserable and continues to help Captain Stottlemeyer and Disher with solving murders, with the help of his Assistant, Sharona. Throughout this season Monk investigates a murder at Trudy's high school, goes to Mexico, help prove the innocence of Sharona's sister during a stage play, figure out why a paperboy is killed for the newspaper, gets married, goes to jail, and finally gets a new lead in the murder of Trudy.Season 3- This is probably my favorite season. During the course of this season, we say good-bye to Sharona Fleming and hello to Natalie Teeger. Monk investigates Warrick Tennyson's role in Trudy's murder, gets fired, helps an organized crime family, becomes a contestant on a game show, gets stuck in traffic, goes to Las Vegas, adopts a kid, and much more.Season 4- Throughout this season Monk returns home on HALLOWEEN, stays in bed because he's sick, gets drunk, goes to a fashion show, figure out who would want to poison Stottlemeyer at the Christmas party, gets amnesia, stop a killer astronaut, and figure out if Trudy Monk had faked her death.Season 5- Throughout this season Monk deals with a garbage strike, loses his eyesight, attends his college reunion, goes to a rock concert, finally meets his dad, goes on the air, and much more.Season 6- Throughout this season, Monk must deal with his crazed fan, help a rapper, teaches Julie Teeger about love, hang out with his psychiatrist's son, shoots Santa Claus, joins a cult, becomes a fugitive, and finally has a new lead in the murder of Trudy.Season 7- Monk is forced to find a new therapist because Dr. Kroger has died. Throughout this season Monk matches wits with a chess player, helps a boxer, gets stuck on a submarine underwater, meets his other brother, fights City Hall, and much more.The Final Season- In the end, all the pieces will fit together. Throughout this season, Monk serves as a bodyguard for his favorite actress, investigate a UFO sighting, goes undercover as a Mafia boss, celebrates his Birthday, receives a surprising visit from Sharona Fleming, and finally solves the murder of his wife, Trudy. It all comes down to this. This season felt a little rushed, but is the perfect ending to the Monk saga. I highly recommend MONK: THE COMPLETE SERIES!!!"
B000ULZLYY I had to grab this Amazon deal!I started watching Monk during the ION Channel weekend marathons. The USA network has become known for it's great character driven shows.  Monk is another one of those characters that you immediate love and sometimes identify with. I love seeing how he develops through the show, coming to grips with his wife's murder and eventually solving it."
B000ULZLYY MUST HAVE!Doesn t get better than this.......unfortunately they stopped after 8 years!Maybe the most impressive acting in a long time......"
B000UU4IVM Just now catching up on this series. High end production values and very good story telling. As with all good sic-fi, it is about the human condition as much as it is about &#34;aliens.&#34;"
B000UU4IVM I started watching this series because I saw a reference to it on &#34;Big Bang Theory&#34;.  Now I am hooked.  It's surprisingly thoughtful and well-written.  Watching this on Prime let's me plow through the episodes quickly.  I would highly recommend this series to any Sci-Fi fan."
B000UU4IVM When I saw the remake of Battlestar Galactica I had the memories of the original show casting heavy doubt on the story being worth the time to watch.  After making it through the first two seasons on Prime Instant Video I can see that I should never judge a show by the quality of a previous one of the same name.  Other than the names being the same in some cases this show carries over nothing from the original and sets itself apart from most shows and takes us to a place far more intriguing than most any do.  I'm not sure what to expect from the remainder of season 3 and 4 but the by the end of 2 and beginning of 3 the story lines that had been set in place went into hyper speed and had more action in 5 episodes than many shows do their entire run.  The writers have no problem pushing the envelope of character development and change as circumstances move so fast it has left my head swimming and my interest peaked as for where they can go from here.  But if the first 2 seasons are any indication then I'll just have to hang on and enjoy the ride hoping the end is not a disappointment after a mind boggling first half.  If you like Science Fiction that pushes the limits of human behavior then you don't want to miss this show."
B000UU4IVM Still enjoy watching although season 2 is a little slower.  It is great to watch without commercials.  A lot different than Battlestar Galactica from the 1980s.."
B000UU4IVM Being the stuff of awkward nerds and Dwight from The Office, Battlestar Galactica was the farthest show from my list. But now, I'm hooked. Great character development, soundtrack and storyline. Love it."
B000UU4IVM Season 2 had episodes that aren't all related to each other.  Each of these episodes is compelling in its own right.  It is in this season that we learn how complicated the Cylons are and we see each side in the war having setbacks.  The crew and human race is unable to follow their mythical script in a direct way, leading to a false start on New Caprica."
B000UU4IVM Good stars, good casting of characters, good writers. All the things I want in entertainment. I do believe that the TV series writers are turning out far better work than the full length movie writers."
B000UU4IVM Great story, excellent acting and character development. Great blend of drama and action, convincing effects. Of course no commercials on Amazon Prime."
B000UU4IVM BSG is always good TV.  When in doubt, look to Tricia Helfer and Grace Park, two of the hottest women on TV.  The show, built on the premise of a pretty lame show really developed the characters over the seasons.Tricia Helfer is particularly amazing in her role as an angel to Guyus Baltar, Park does a tremendous job in her multiple roles...oh yea, the male cast members are pretty good.  This show took the BSG concept way beyond it's origins to a full blown series."
B000UU4IVM Awesome series so glad to have Amazon Prime so I can see those shows that I didn't have the time to watch."
B000UU4IVM This was unlike any other &#34;space&#34; drama show, past or present.  It was a dramatic show that just happened to be set in space. All 4 seasons were awesome (I've watched the series from &#34;end to end&#34; many times and I never tire of it).  Whether you like sci-fi or not, it's worth every penny."
B000UU4IVM I like the characters and the plots are wonderful.  It definitely keeps you interested in what is happening and going to happen."
B000UU4IVM The shows twist on life and religion to me is very interesting for people that like sci-fi shows & have not see this should give it a try .. So far in this season they are still trying to find the planet .. Which they never been too and they say, it's the best planet of them all .. Lol earth !! One things for sure this season as a lot of things happening .. B
B000UU4IVM One of my favorite television series of all time along with 'The Wire'and 'Breaking Bad'.Like 'The Wire' this is a complex, Dickensian study of human nature,not afraid of asking big questions, and meticulously plotted like agreat novel, so that each episode is a chapter in a much larger whole.Just as 'The Wire' used the overly familiar clich&eacute;' world of the copshow to jump off from and shatter our preconceptions, and 'BattlestarGalactica' uses the sci-fi series, and the idea of human versus robotwars the same way.This is thinking person's sci fi, in the tradition of Arthur C. Clarke,or Isaac Asimov. It's about why we are how we are, what it means to bea human being, morality under constant pressure in times of war,fathers and sons, impossible loves, metaphors for modern and recentpolitics and real world situations.My wife, far from a sci-fi fan was hooked after 3 episodes, and we torethrough 5 years of shows in just a few days. It's that addicting.The acting is all at least quite good, and some cast members areremarkable, creating characters full of depth, complexity andcontradiction. The writing is terrific, allowing the characters tochange and grow, but always in ways that make sense, creating seeminglyinexplicable conundrums, only to find surprising, sometimes shocking -but ultimately logical and satisfying - ways to explain where they'vetaken us. The special effects are generally very impressive for TV,even if they're not really why you watch this show.It also has some of the most tense episodes of television I've everseen, and some of the season enders left me completely wrung out andblown away. I was sad to get to the last episode, just as one is sad tofinish a great book.I haven't bought it in other forms, so I can't compare, but generallythe blu-ray set (the non-Cylon box) is quite complete, and well packaged.However, I have read accounts that quality control was a bit of a problemand I didn't escape the bugs. On a couple of my discs there wasa slight 'pulse' to the image at times. At first I thought perhapsit was a strange, but intentional, lighting effect, but looking at it carefullyit seemed more a reproduction problem.This isn't just the intentionally added grain, a look I don't love, but acceptas an artistic decision.Since then, I've read similar comments from others, so I'm not crazy(or at least not in this case!). So, if you do order this, you might wantto make sure it's returnable, and try to do a quick quality check the bestyou can. Of course, if the problem is intermittent, and mostly in the laterdiscs, as was in my case, by the time I saw it it was way too lateto ask for an exchange.None-the-less, for me, the quality of the content way over-rode theoccasional image problems (and I'm a perfectionist - my wifenever noticed the pulsing until I pointed it out.).As far as getting the individual seasons on blu-ray, it looks as thoughyou can do better buying the box set, although prices fluctuatequickly here on Amazon and elsewhere, so I'd advise you do the mathand figure out the most reasonable way to own the complete set.Also, Amazon UK currently has a complete region free blu-ray boxset for about $100 with shipping.  It seems to have all the same extrasas the US box set.  Well worth considering as long as the price holds up."
B000UU4IVM I'm really enjoying this series, starting to watch multiple episodes at a time because I want to move the story forward.  Always a good sign when you want to do that!I'm sick to death of Baltar, but that just means that James Callis is doing his job.  Love Starbuck.  Love Sharon.  Love Number Six.  Still happy to see Richard Hatch and think he's great.Working my way through Season Three now."
B000UU4IVM Battlestar Galactica was a perfect series, and season two just exemplifies how great the story line progression is.  As the drama increases and bonds of family and friendship are tested, with great twists and turns watching just one episode will never be an option."
B000UU4IVM If you thought the first season was gut wrenching and mind blowing, the second season one-ups the first.  Sex, drugs and rock and roll sum up the scenes from this season."
B000UU4IVM I don't care for this version of BG. First, Boomer and Starbuck are women they should have made them men. Don't get me wrong their should be women fighter pilots but because they were 2 of the main characters practically every episode was about sexual intrigue, jealousy, and who's sleeping with who this week. Secondly, they use bullets instead of lasers. My guess is the producers did this to save money on special effects. Third, the society of this advanced culture still has people smoking and alcoholics and they haven't even cured cancer. A society enlightend and advanced as this(at least 100-200 years or more advanced than earth) would have cured the addiction of smoking and acoholism and/or outlawed it. Almost every actor was a drinker, smoker or both. I suspect tobacco companies and alcohol beverage companies paid the actors and probably the producers under the table to smoke in the series. They also would have cured cancer and almost every other disease. It looks like they were practicing 1940's medicine."
B000UU4IVM Great cast, great concept, great long series you can immerse yourself in.  Interesting how some of the actors don't look nearly so good in other projects.Ending of series takes easy way out."
B000UU4IVM I am not a critic but have found this series very enjoyable.  This is so much better than the original series that it is simply a step up in entertainment.  A good way to fill in some winter and bad weather hours."
B000UU4IVM I watched the original Battlestar Galactica with Loren Green years ago but this one is so much better. Good si-fi  and a great cast of characters and story lines to keep the series interesting. I was hooked after season one and looking forward to season three."
B000UU4IVM This is my second time watching season II of BSG...I cried. After Sharon was saved by Tyrol and Aggethon and she pulled the blanket over her head and cried, I cried also. This show is unbelievable and sooooooooo good. When was Cdr Adama made an Admiral! This show made me change my mind on interrogating prisoners, especially women. I know I will get slammed for this, but I don't care. I'm a woman first and foremost, and above all is. This show speaks to so much."
B000UU4IVM I have already reviewed the series in Season !, and this season was a strong part of it.  Worth watching for people who really crave deeplly human stories."
B000UU4IVM really good show, i love the way they dramatised there plight from the very first episode to the last episode the mini series was done great job."
B000UU4IVM I purchased the entire seasons (1 - 4) and have found them both entertaining and worth the cost.  Over time, the re-watch high-lights the missing in-depth interactions of the characters, but also brings out details that might have been missed on the original broadcast. Again, I am biased becuase of being a fan of BSG."
B000UU4IVM Every time a episode ends I can't wait to start the next one. This show is awesome,if you like scifi you'll really love this one."
B000UU4IVM In  a way this Series seems to be about the ends days of our time, and hope after the battle is over. At least that's the impression I get."
B000UU4IVM I was hooked on the first episode of season 1. I love the characters. Even the music is great. Have you noticed the sounds of the ship and the size of the doors between rooms? Just what one would expect if one were on an actual spaceship. The most annoying thing though is the voice of Gaius Baltor. Makes my throat hurt listening to him."
B000UU4IX0 If you've not seen the newer Battlestar Galactica, you really should.  It is great Science Fiction.  Heck, it is just a great story, period!  This is a series best watched in &#34;binges;&#34; that is, watch an entire season in one week, preempting your normal TV viewing.  When you do that, it is much more like watching a movie, or a serial movie, than it is a TV series.  There's action, adventure, romance, war, life-or-death situations and decision, emergencies, subterfuges, blackmail, treachery, even treason!  Not to mention some of the prettiest Cylon models this side of the Galaxy.One could nitpick this little thing or that minor nuance...but hey, this is great television.  Enjoy it.One caution:  There are many scenes inappropriate for younger than 14, and more probably up to 17 or 18.  Even as an adult, I find myself keeping the remote in my hand to be able to fast forward through some of the spicier scenes.  That is the single negative critique I'd have of this series, and it is not a trivial critique.  The newer BG is NOT something to let your kids watch willy-nilly; just because the old series was PG-rated.Again, a very good show...just keep the remote handy."
B000UU4IX0 Season 3 started with a Roar....just like a good movie....and that went on for afew episodes...till drama got in the way....crying babies and more drama that wedid'nt really need.... i dont mind knowing a bit of the crew's relationships butthis season they waste a lot of episodes on this crap. And if you are smart youcan see where this serie is going and how it possibly gonna end.So ..yep lots of great single episodes that gives Science Fiction a big boost butwe known that drama and Religion will eventually take over.So ..at this point...im only looking at the good episodes and i am fast fowardingthe social drama parts that are making me fall asleep.But by the end of this season....things once again are getting interesting...very interesting...and cant wait to watch season 4."
B000UU4IX0 I think the first two seasons are my favorites by far.  There are some excellent moments in Season three; however, I think it became more of a drama than what it had been in the previous two seasons.  Unlike Babylon 5, it is clear that Battlestar didn't have an overarching direction.  Great writing, but...."
B000UU4IX0 Season 2 through the first few episodes of season 3 which I consider part of the season 1-2 story line were great.  Season 3 the writers missed the mark by a large margin.  I just finished forcing myself to watch season 3.  The first two seasons I couldn't believe I had missed this show when it was on, after season 3 I'm speechless at the waste of time it was.  All sorts of character development which should have been woven into the first two seasons, and only warranted being short flashbacks and segments of the better shows to fill in some blanks as to why certain characters where the way they were, but to waste a season on it?  The whole farce of a story around the man who allowed the original attack and became president only to have him walk free?  I've wanted to personally put him out an airlock since episode 2 of season 1 and they finally get his butt on trial and let him walk?  Its not a letdown, it is maddening that I wasted the time.  I understand Season 4 picks up and gets back on track thank god.  Bottom line is except for the freeing from New Caprica the rest of season 3 was not worth watching.  All the background on the Admirals marriage, and the character background should have been boiled down to 10% of the first two seasons, not stretched through an entire season 3.  Oh, and let's just have a season where the enemy just goes away and focus on labor unions and peoples dysfunctional childhoods.  Frak them all."
B000UU4IX0 Great series.  Action packed.  Would like to have seen more of the other crewmember's stories and less of Gayas Baltar and his imaginary girlfriend."
B000UU4IX0 I don't have a ton to say except I love this series. Period. Watch it from the beginning and you will not regret it."
B000UU4IX0 In this series, good characters are sometimes bad and show serious flaws and the worst characters demonstrate heroics.  The exodus from New Caprica introduces a new dynamic to the series with the added complexity of character flaws in everybody.  I didn't like some of it but was always captivated."
B000UU4IX0 Season Three continues right where season 2 left off at.  With the Cylon occupation in full force and the pressure being on for the colonists of New Caprica and the President Gaius Baltar.  Fans of the show before won't be disappointed with plenty of action between the various characters and the Cylons (them having their issues themselves).The Cylons attempt to make peace with the colonists by starting up a police force made up of colonists of New Caprica.  It just insights the rebels as many view the new police as traitors conspiring with the Cylons.More background of the characters are revealed and the tensions are flaring over Baltar's impending trial for crimes against the colonists that will seperate people and thrust them onto opposing sides with varying views on death being the penalty and others wanting the justice system to actually do what it should do.  If anything Season 3 of BG continues to do what a lot of shows can't...be consisent."
B000UU4IX0 Ron Moore, one of the brains behind Star Trek: Deep Space Nine, took his darker view of sci-fi to the new Battlestar Galactica series with generally positive results. This isn't Star Trek by any stretch of the imagination. In fact, it's tough to compare BSG to any other sci-fi show. It combines an in-depth story arc, top-notch acting, realistic special effects, and a pseudo-documentary cinematic style to create a unique experience.Unlike Star Trek, BSG tries to depict a gritty, realistic vision of humanity's future. In the first few episodes, a race of evil robots called the Cylons attack 12 human colonies, leaving only a few tens of thousands of humans left in the galaxy. The humans band together in a convey of ships to search for Earth.Amongst the main characters, the acting ranges from good to excellent. In particular, Edward James Olmos as Admiral Adama is absolutely amazing at conveying the burdens of command. I first saw Olmos as Detective Gaff in Blade Runner and never could have imagined him as the star of a TV series, but he really shines. Mary McDonnell as Laura Roslin also wins plaudits as perhaps the most convincing female president ever portrayed on TV.I love some of the individual episodes from Season 3. Starting off the season with much of the crew forced under Cylon occupation was brilliant. We get to see the characters really put through the ringer. And they change. There are some really compelling moments. One of my favorite episodes focuses on labor disputes in the fleet. It's a small glimpse into life for the hoi polloi in BSG, but it really makes you ponder what life would be like under such circumsances.That said, Season 3 is the point at which BSG really started to jump the shark for me. While I liked the idea of beginning the series with part of the crew under Cylon occupation, the Cylons just don't work as the main villains. I still haven't gotten over the idea that they're perfect imitations of people. However, in Season 3, the Cylons just leave any pretense of being machines. They act like people in all but name. They have petty jealousies, fall in love, and argue amongst each other. Worst of all, several of the episodes follow Gaius Baltar on a Cylon base ship and there's a \"love bed\" on the ship! A bed with bright red sheets and plushy mattress just for Baltar and his Cylon women. I definitely started getting sick of the Cylons by this point.Overall, I love individual episodes of BSG, but I don't like where Season 3 is taking the larger story. Individual episodes can have great character moments or engage in deep moral questions. However, when character and morals take a backseat, the series flounders. Still, it's definitely must-see television for sci-fi fans."
B000UU4IX0 This show is much much better than I had ever hoped. It succeeds brilliantly on all aspects, from storytelling to acting, from direction to production, it is first rate. I had lost interest in the show during season two and had no real desire to watch season three but I saw the dvd and it was an impulse buy. I spent the last day watching the entire season and I was captivated. It is so rare for a science fiction show of this quality to be made anymore. It is truly one of the great seasons ever and, if the Emmys truly meant excellent in tv, the show would receive nominations all over the place.I should point out one person in particular, though I do not even know his name. The actor who plays Gaius Baltar is truly exceptional. It is worth watching just for his performance alone, but that is not to diminish all the other fine actors. There is not a weak performer in the whole season.An AMAZING season."
B000UU4IX0 I'm arriving a little late to this party... had started watching the re-imagined series when it started on the Sci-Fi channel, but lost track.  Over the past year I have started to pick back up from where I left off and I am not pleased.  While I love the concept of the new Battlestar Galactica, loved the earlier character development and the backdrop, I found the end of season 2.5 and the entire 3rd season to literaly be all over the place and disjointed.  The careful crafting of a story so elquently done in both the pilot episode and season 1 are no where to be found towards the end of season 2.5 or 3.  As the show has progressed it has become a very simply written, spiritual, religious mess and the characters are not as cohesively developed as they once were.  The writers must have changed.  I've got a bad feeling about season 4...Not total trash, but certainly not what the pilot episode or season 1 were.  Such a shame!"
B000UU4IX0 What can I really objectively say, I am a total BSG junky and this was a great season.  The writers and actors really put a human face on a concept of a maybe not so distant future and then make the characters human in every sense.  Fos BSG junkies this is a season of healing after a traumatic start to the season and it's one of those seasons where you have to see it from beginning to end to really see this season unfold."
B000UU4IX0 was new & all episodes played with out flaw. fast shipping. great series makes you want to see the next episode. great for science fiction fan."
B000UU4IX0 The first two seasons were so great, there had to be a \"letdown\" season. Don't get me wrong, season 3 is good, just not compared to sea.1 & 2.  The first 2 seasons were just OUTSTANDING science fiction at its best.  Still worth owning in your dvd library."
B000UU4IX0 Spoiler related wording (basically going around the spoilers, relating to them but not specifically stating what they are):This episode was amazing. The two part judging of Gaius Baltar was really good to. The revealing of 4 more Cylons out of the final five was amazing; especially when you find out who they are. It blew my mind to find out. Anyway, this episode, and the last one, have an intriguing element, the music, that is interesting and weird. I don't really understand why music, but it probably has some meaning. The build up in this series has been really great. This series is now in my top 5. I don't know where to put it. It's awesome. To anyone who hasn't seen this episode or the last one yet, don't skip these, these are very important and amazing episodes. You'll be blown away at the end of this episode, of that I assure you. Really, I do have to wonder who the fifth Cylon is. That's the question that will probably echo through the next season. Great season, awesome series so far, can't wait to watch the next season.Oh, final note, as I didn't list it before. You get to see a someone you didn't expect to see in this episode. Plus, that person has news, great news. It's interesting to see that person again. It really adds to the excitement of the ending of this season. I had to wonder if Lee was hallucinating or not at the end. However, I'm going to guess no, even though that is a really mind-boggling idea. The music at the end was a really big help as it really did add to what was going on; a perfect element to add.This series is awesome. I'm going to love seeing what happens next."
B000UU4IX0 Although the plot at times lost the &#34;find Earth&#34; focus, the season maintains high levels of tension, drama, lightness, loss, and surprises."
B000UU4IX0 Battlestar Galactica was (and still is) the best of its genre ever aired.  All 4 seasons were fantastic, but season 3 was superior (outside of the series finale). Even if you're not a sci fi fan, if you haven't seen it you're missing out..."
B000UU4IX0 This is one of the best written scifi series ever. It is worth watching every episode.  It will be enjoyed by any person who enjoys Star Trek type shows."
B000UU4IX0 What's going to happen next .. In this season after (spoiler) finding a planet which they can live on things happen that they have to leave it and keep on the search for earth.. There are many problems on season 3 that has you thinking of human life, based on the show and what flips are next to be shown on season 4.. Overall a great season .. So far this show has me hooked.."
B000UU4IX0 Already perched on the mountaintop of cinematic stories in the first two seasons, the third actually raises the level of excellence to new heights. Much of the characterization  the initial seasons developed so well actually becomes still more integral in this, the third season. I became more invested in the safety and sanity of what I have now begun to view as colleagues - their varying motivations, whether well-considered or foolish, with pride, joy, fear, or disapproval. WIth so many human issues being addressed and so many characters involved in simply dealing with the hardships of their trying life, I'm now feeling, as I watch, that I'm living it with them. At this point I find myself wishing the series will never end!"
B000UU4IX0 One of my favorite television series of all time along with 'The Wire'and 'Breaking Bad'.Like 'The Wire' this is a complex, Dickensian study of human nature,not afraid of asking big questions, and meticulously plotted like agreat novel, so that each episode is a chapter in a much larger whole.Just as 'The Wire' used the overly familiar clich&eacute;' world of the copshow to jump off from and shatter our preconceptions, and 'BattlestarGalactica' uses the sci-fi series, and the idea of human versus robotwars the same way.This is thinking person's sci fi, in the tradition of Arthur C. Clarke,or Isaac Asimov. It's about why we are how we are, what it means to bea human being, morality under constant pressure in times of war,fathers and sons, impossible loves, metaphors for modern and recentpolitics and real world situations.My wife, far from a sci-fi fan was hooked after 3 episodes, and we torethrough 5 years of shows in just a few days. It's that addicting.The acting is all at least quite good, and some cast members areremarkable, creating characters full of depth, complexity andcontradiction. The writing is terrific, allowing the characters tochange and grow, but always in ways that make sense, creating seeminglyinexplicable conundrums, only to find surprising, sometimes shocking -but ultimately logical and satisfying - ways to explain where they'vetaken us. The special effects are generally very impressive for TV,even if they're not really why you watch this show.It also has some of the most tense episodes of television I've everseen, and some of the season enders left me completely wrung out andblown away. I was sad to get to the last episode, just as one is sad tofinish a great book.The third season represented a bit of a transition to something atouch more surreal, a little odder, which would pay off fullyin the last two seasons.  There are moments where the show seemsto have lost it's way a bit, but it comes back quickly, and somethings that have a 'what was that about?' feeling in season 3will be very important in what's yet to come.  Trust the show."
B000UU4IX0 so i truly enjoyed the first two seasons of Battlestar...truly awesome, military sci/fi show, insane sets, great plot, good acting and those Cylons. all great....the end of season two had some difficulties. alot ALOT less action and more crying. lots of crying. lots of drama. lots of forgetting the entire purpose of the show.season three is where ive ended my battlestar lust....i truly cant take Starbuck anymore, whiny brat...could care less about her romantic interests nor her false bravado.entire spisodes went by with nary a mention of the Cylons.....which, lets be honest...is the best thing about the show.it seems they lost focus or they changed course to appeal to the more 'dramatic' aspects while shelving the 'sci/fi' alltogether.terrible mistake.... i fear season three is when i say frack off Battlestar....you had a AMAZING thing going."
B000UU4IX0 This show is a lot of fun to watch, and who knows, maybe you'll get to see Kara Thrace become Ms. Marvel in an upcoming Avengers movie ;)The struggles between a father and son, humans marrying &#34;toasters&#34;, and the race for be the first to find the long lost Planet Earth.  This show has great depth, and is a lot of fun to watch :)"
B000UU4IX0 I continue to be amazed at how much I love \"Battlestar Galactica.\" I usually don't enjoy science fiction, but this show is unlike any other sci-fi series I've seen before. In fact, \"BSG\" just may be my favorite television show of all time, which says a lot!Season Three of \"BSG\" picks up right where Season Two left off. The majority of people have been living on New Caprica for more than a year and are trying to build new lives for themselves. Unfortunately, the cylons eventually managed to track the humans down. After invading New Caprica, the cylons convinced President Gaius Baltar to cooperate with them. Now people live in constant fear of the cylon occupation. Resistance leaders including Chief Tyrol and Colonel Tigh continue to fight the cylons and attempt to come up with an escape plan, which is a very hard thing to do since both Adamas and their respective ships jumped away from New Caprica as soon as the cylons invaded. Obviously, the Adamas and their small crew can't just abandon the rest of humanity, and an elaborate rescue attempt is planned.I don't want to reveal too many details about the season and spoil things for people who may not have seen it yet. However, there's a lot that goes on in Season Three, especially where Tyrol, Tigh, Tory, Anders, and Starbuck are concerned. If you thought the Season Two finale was shocking, just wait until you see what happens at the end of Season Three!There are a few small issues I have with this season. First of all, I think there are too many \"one-shot episodes\" that don't really seem to advance the main plot of the show at all. Having a few episodes like that is fine, but I think there were an abundance of them this time around. Also, I'm not sure how I feel about the way certain music served as a major revelation during the season finale. Hopefully Season Four will do a good job of explaining things.Overall, though, this was a great season. I'm very sad that there's only one more season left, but I can't wait for it to start up again in March."
B000UU4IX0 I loved it was exciting, an funny  It was worth Watching. I would see it again If you like Sci fi this is the one."
B000UU4IX0 Another great season.  Good stories, incredible acting, does Edward James Olmos ever do a bad take? The entire run of this series seems to parallel current US politics and keeping with this theme, the President is starting to frack me off. What is her problem?  She is showing the same symptoms of fundamentalist elitism as \"W\".  I'm expecting her to walk on the bridge of Galactica and announce that she's the \"decider\".Basic Jr. College Anthropology has shown that when 2 cultures come together the first thing that happens is a lot of hatred and fighting (the humans vs. cylons).  Next comes a blending where they begin to need each other and lastly is a merger where they share a manifest destiny and work together towards this goal.The series seems to be moving in this direction but I'm sure the writers will pull the rug out from under us momentarily.  Gosh, I love this series."
B000UU4IX0 This was a memorable season for the show, revealing a lot of tension.  I am not sure, however, how satisfying it was.  Yes, I'm giving the season three stars and they produced quality work.  However, while I am enjoying the events, I'm not sure that I'm enjoying the characters.  I find myself in the odd position of not being sure if humanity -- as represented by the main characters -- is worth saving.  All of these people are deeply flawed.  I don't feel actual respect for any of them.  Of course, they are in a situation like none in which I have been, so perhaps I'm being overly harsh.Battlestar Galactica is a decent show.  The actors for the most part do their jobs well and the individual stories are interesting.  I'm just finding myself questioning whether I should be rooting for the enemy... or for anyone at all."
B000UU4IX0 Even I have to admit that season 3 drags on some, but it is very insiteful as you learn quit a bit about the Cylons.  And the season finally will leaving you with your heart stopped and your jaw completely on the floor."
B000UU4IX0 I have to say, this season was one of my favorites, not knowing if Starbuck would comeback, Adama's will to continue on the search for earth,  Boltar's relationship with the Cylons, The Cylon Athena....where do I start."
B000UU4IX0 The 3rd season of Battlestar Galactica begins with the scene on New Caprica.  Tight loses his wife, and Starbuck loses her emotional stability at the hands of the Cylon occupiers.  The colonists on New Caprica are then rescued by a carefully orchestrated surprise mission by Pegasus and Galactica, and the series goes back to the search for Earth.  In between, Starbuck is killed, and then comes back to life; and Balter is imprisoned on a Cylon ship, then imprisoned on Galactica.  We also have 4 of the 5 humanoid cyclons revealed, along with President Roslin's re-acquintance with cancer.  
B000UU4IX0 I love the stories. I especially love that all the characters are shown to have both good and bad points, just as real people do."
B000UU4IX0 Firstly, I have never seen the show.  I love science fiction but usually only in the movies because I find a lot of the sci-fi shows on tv to be low budget with poor scripting and acting.This show however looks fantastic, if you didn't tell me it was a tv series I'd think it was a movie.  Aside from looking great the story looks to be engaging, exciting and just plain entertaining.  The whole point of this download is to get you into the show and to get you updated on what has happened so far, it does that well, I feel like I could just jump in and start watching the show.**A warning though, if you plan on buying/watching all of the old Battlestar Galactica episodes in the prior seasons I'd hold of on watching this as it will spoil it for you.**I recommend taking a look.  And while your at it take a look at the other free download, it's good too.  Here:SCI FI: Inside Battlestar Galactica"
B000UU4IX0 Very good serial video and has excellent visual and audio.  The continuing story is fascinating and the plots are reasonable and the acting is great.  Hard to downgrade any production of this quality."
B000UU4IX0 Warning! The following contains spoilers. If you haven't seen Season Three and want to remain spoiler free, do not read this review.Season Three of BATTLESTAR GALACTICA was the most debated and controversial yet. Much of the controversy stemmed from the number of hot button political topics it addressed. What other show would take several major characters we know and love and have them execute another character we had known from the beginning of the series for collaborating with the enemy, demonstrating in the process the extreme danger to justice inherent in independent military tribunals (disturbingly similar to the ones that the Bush administration has advocated)? What other show takes up the logic and ethics of suicide bombing by having \"us\" attack \"them\" by the death of another semi-recurring character in an effort to kill recruits for the local police force? Many of the episodes outraged those on the political right, as the parallels with the situation in Iraq was, despite efforts to minimize the resemblance by references by creator Ron Moore in interviews to Vichy France, became increasingly blatant. To his credit Moore, a member of the left but a self-admitted Rush Limbaugh listener, has not had the show lean too heavily to the left for most of the show's run, but in the season's first several episodes that balance fell away. And in the most controversial episode of the season (debated on Internet boards more passionately than I can ever remember any episode of any show) the question of whether genocide against a murderous enemy is justified, pitting several of the major characters on the show against each other.On the other hand, Season Three had several surprisingly uninspired episodes. All of these were of the \"stand alone\" variety. All of the \"mythology\" episodes (to use the X-FILES terminology that Ron Moore himself often uses) were outstanding. In posts on boards, podcasts, and interviews Moore has said that most of these episodes are produced by the insistence of the network. The thinking is that having nothing but arc episodes intimidates potential viewers. But the brute fact is that at this point in the series it is a sheer impossibility for anyone to start watching at this point. This is the beauty of DVDs. Anyone who wants to watch BATTLESTAR GALACTICA can by buying the DVDs, borrowing them from a friend, downloading them from iTunes, or renting them from Netflix or their local DVD rental store. Bizarrely the networks don't seem to have comprehended the ways that viewing patterns have changed.Season Three is structured around the Cylon occupation of New Caprica and the ongoing effects of that occupation following the rescue of the humans by Galactica. Many of the characters on the show never quite get over their experiences there, in particular Tigh and Kara. Interpersonal conflicts that were created on New Caprica, especially between Kara and Lee, take much of the season resolve, and the whole New Caprica experience doesn't really come to an end until the close of the trial of Baltar in the season finale. In one way or another the experiences there color almost everything that happens during the season.Instead of summing up individual episodes or talking about the major story arcs, I would like to highlight my ten favorite moments of the entire season.1. The Adama Maneuver: During the rescue on New Caprica Adama gets crucial Vipers into the fray by jumping into the upper atmosphere of the planet. Since Galactica cannot fly in an atmosphere, they launch the Vipers as the ship plunges in a fiery ball towards the surface, jumping again just a couple of hundred feet before smashing into the earth. It is - and I say this with little fear of contradiction - the most extraordinary special effect in the history of TV. No one who has seen it has been able to forget it. It is inconceivable that the show won't win the Emmy this year for Best Special Effects (but then, it is impossible to see how they lost to LOST and its black smoke effect last year) and when it does, this is the special effect sequence they will show at the awards.2. Leoben has imprisoned Kara in a living situation that parodies that of a married couple. As they dine Leoben stands beside her and tells her how beautiful she looks. She smiles and rams a pair of skewers through his neck, kicks him back and falls on his chest stabbing him repeatedly. She returns to the dining table, takes a bite, then daintily dabs at her mouth with a napkin, oblivious to the blood that covers one of her hands.3. The death of Jammer: In \"Collaborators\" several characters we've known and loved kill Jammer for being a collaborator during the Cylon occupation of New Caprica. We've known Jammer since Season One when he, Cally, and Socino tried to make a still. But that doesn't prevent him from being shot out an airlock. Nearly as good was the near execution of Gaeta later in the same episode.4. Five great Sharon moments. This is a total cheat, but here are five great moments involving Sharon in Season Five. 1) The last time we saw Sharon in Season Two she was deeply distrusted from not having told Galactica about Cavil being a Cylon. She had told Helo that she wanted nothing to do with him or anyone on Galactica. Our first shot of her in Season Three, her cell door is open and we see it filled with comfortable furniture: a desk with books, an end table and coffee table, wall hangings and curtains, a comfy chair, and a large and extremely comfortable leather couch. Adama is sitting beside her drinking tea and he tells her that he feels all alone, except for her. Clearly in the previous year, somehow Sharon had become just about Adama's closest friend. 2) Because of the new trust Adama has in Sharon, she becomes an officer in the colonial fleet. Through the rest of the season she repeatedly tells others - whether human or Cylon - that she has given the fleet her word and she intends to keep it. Though some doubt her, Adama's faith in her is repaid repeatedly in the season. 3) Sharon enters the Cylon Detention Center on New Caprica to recover the launch keys that are crucial if the humans are to escape from New Caprica. She gets interrupted by D'Anna Biers, who tries to tempt her into coming back to the Cylons with the news that Hera is still alive. Sharon responds by putting a bullet into both her D'Anna's knees. She walks away, saying \"Adama wouldn't lie to me\" (and it turns out he didn't, since he didn't know that Laura stole Hera and faked her death). 4) Sharon and Boomer come face to face. One of the season highlights had to be the show's two major Number Eight's meeting. The irony is intense, since at the beginning of the series Sharon was completely on the side of the Cylons and Boomer was with the fleet, unaware that she was a Cylon sleeper agent. Now, however, Boomer like D'Anna before her tries to convince Sharon that she doesn't belong with the humans. Her reply is to the point: \"I made my decision and I know where my loyalties lie.\" 5) Boomer does, however, tell Sharon that her daughter is still alive and is on the nearby Cylon basestar. After Adama confirms with Roslin that Boomer's story is true, Sharon rescues Hera by talking her husband Helo into killing her so that she will resurrect on the Cylon resurrection ship. Only seconds after reaching Hera she plots her return to Galactica. The irony is that only a few minutes earlier Roslin was dressing down both Helo and Adama for their faith in Sharon. Knowing that Sharon is downloading into a new body she tells them, \"And now all of our lives are in the hands of Sharon Agathon. All we can do is hope that your wife is worthy of the unconditional trust you place in her, Captain. And you as well, Admiral.\" What is wonderful is that Laura states all this as if it is in doubt. But less than an hour later Sharon is back on Galatica with Hera. Oh, and Sharon is given her own handle: Athena, a nod to the original series in which Athena was Adama's daughter. And in this one Sharon has become one of his surrogate daughters.5. \"Exodus, Pt. 2\": I said I wouldn't summarize any episodes and I will resist doing that here. But this episode, which contained \"The Adama Maneuver\" I mentioned above, is easily one of the two or three most unforgettable episodes in all of BSG. At the end of 2006 the well-known Internet TV website The Futon Critic issued its annual list of the Top Fifty episodes of the year. With total justification they named \"Exodus, Pt. 2\" the number one episode of 2006, not just of BSG but of all television shows combined. It was that good. Four beats made it stand out. First, Saul Tigh's killing of his wife Ellen for collaborating with the Cylons, second the Adam Maneuver, third, the rescue of Galactica by Pegasus and its destruction, and fourth, Kara learning that Leoben had lied to her by telling her that Kacey was her daughter.6. The fight between Kara and Lee in \"Unfinished Business.\" In the Season Two finale we learned that somehow Lee and Kara had fallen out with each other so completely that they were barely able to talk to one another. In this episode we get that back story. Adama has called for a series of boxing matches to air out grievances that crew members feel towards one another. We see Lee and Kara's story intercut with their pounding on each other in the boxing ring, learning of the night of passion that they spent with each other and their declaring their love for one another, and of Kara's sneaking off and marrying Anders the next morning. As Kara and Lee (who she is able to fight evenly partly because Helo beat up on him in an earlier fight and partly because Kara resorts to dirty fighting) collapse into each other's arms, their faces bloody messes, she tells him, \"I missed you.\" His mouth filled with blood, he is barely able to say, \"I missed you too.\" Her face buried in his shoulder, you can see her smile broadly as the episode ends. One of the best episodes in the show's run.7. In a stunning scene on a Cylon basestar, D'Anna Biers tortures Baltar while he manages to project to a beach where Six makes love to him to get him through the ordeal. As he tells Six \"I love you\" D'Anna hears the words as addressed to her and although torturing him feels deeply moved. It is a sequence that has to be seen to be believed.8. Adama and Laura's intimacy. Through Season Three Adama and Laura grow closer and closer, as intimate as two people can be while remaining completely Platonic. They still have conflicts. When Laura tries to justify stealing Hera and faking her death Adama walks away without even listening to her. And in the finale Roslin feels betrayed by his vote of Not Guilty in Baltar's trial. But you get the sense that they have moved to a new level. That they have an intimacy that can't be affected by mere disagreement. The highpoint of their intimacy might be their smoking dope on New Caprica and cuddling while gazing up at the stars. It is so wonderful to see two people who have shouldered so much in order to save the remnants of humanity to get a few minutes of peace/9. Lee Adama's moment on the stand. During Baltar's trial Romo Lampkin (magnificently portrayed by Mark Shepard) calls Lee onto the witness stand even though he is serving as co-counsel. Jamie Bamber's performance is one of the season highlights and perhaps the best moment in a season finale stuffed to overflowing with truly great moments.10. The last ten minutes of the season: In the final few minutes of the season we learn the identify of four of the Final Five: Tigh, Tyrol, Samuel T. Anders, and Tory (the four T's--giving additional credence to the thought of some that Kara \"Starbuck\" Thrace is the fifth member) by their response to a song that they keep hearing in their heads, which turns out, almost impossibly, to be Bob Dylan's \"All Along the Watchtower\" (leading some to refer to them as the Dylons). Then the Cylons attack. The four new Cylons ponder what to do before Tigh magnificently tells the other three: \"The ship is under attack, we do our jobs. . . . My name is Saul Tigh. I am an officer in the Colonial Fleet. Whatever else I am, whatever else it means, that's the man I want to be. And if I die today, that's the man I'll be. But those lines are rivaled by the last of the season, as Lee pursues \"a bogie at my ten\" in his Viper and discovers none other than Kara Thrace, who had died spectacularly three episodes earlier. She looks at Lee, assures him that it really is her (a fact confirmed by executive producer Ron Moore, who also confirmed that the four Cylons really are Cylons), and tells him, \"It's gonna be okay. I've been to Earth. I know where it is. And I'm gonna take us there.\" The camera pulls up over their two Vipers and then rapidly pulls back through the colonial fleet, through the pursing Cylons, back through the nebula and an arm of the Milky Way, and then rushes across the galaxy to our solar system, focusing on earth as the season ends. It is an utterly breathtaking moment.This is absolutely essential television. If you care for great television, this is the kind of stuff you have to care about. The tragedy is that while every major television critics has passionately praised the show and while a host of major publications from TV Guide to Time to Rolling Stone have proclaimed it the best show on TV, it has struggled to find viewers. The irony is that many Sci-fi fans don't watch it because it doesn't resort to the clich&eacute;s that dominate the genre and make it in most cases completely unchallenging television and many mainstream TV fans don't watch it because they mistakenly think it will only appeal to Sci-fi fans. It is what it is: the best show on TV. You need to watch this."
B000UU4IX0 I was never a fan of the earlier Battlestar Galactica of the seventies. I preferred to watch Star Trek. However, I am hooked on this remake. The acting is great and the plot captivating. The characters are believable, and the cinematography quite spectacular. There are many twists in the story: you will be eagerly awaiting the next episode. My favorite character: Kate `Starbuck'!Though I did not like Battlestar Galactica Razor, and actually started Season 3 with low expectations because of it, I ended up loving Season 3.Season 2 ended with the Cylons discovering and invading New Caprica. Gaius Baltar, the President of the twelve colonies, surrenders to them, while Galactica and the rest of the fleet escape.Season 3 opens with the stranded Colonials struggling to survive under the Cylon rule. A terrorist group is formed to fight the Cylons, and sacrifices are made. We see humans strapping themselves with bombs, and blowing themselves up in the presence of Cylons and their human sympathizers.Can we stop for a second here? Isn't this what the Palestinians are doing in Israel, and the Iraqis in Iraq? What are the producers of this show trying to tell us? Is it that whenever a nation takes over another all means at one's disposal should be used to attack the invader, including using humans as bombs? Furthermore, terrorism is shown to be in the eye of the beholder. To the colonials, the terrorists are freedom fighters. To the Cylons, they are simply terrorists. There are some provocative scenes, but after all, this is the kind of world we live in.We are shown Admiral Adama struggling with his crew to save the colonials, and to resume his quest to find Earth. The following is a spoiler so stop reading now if you haven't watched the show yet: Adama does come back to New Caprica and rescues the Colonials. The Season continues with trying to find Earth. New clues are discovered, and a planet is found where early Earth settlers lived.Season 3 focuses on the human element, survival, and punishment. Even after the Colonials are rescued by Adama, some crew members take the role of vigilante, ejecting betrayers into space out of an airlock. These `victims' are not judged by a jury of their peers, nor are they given legal representation.  Again we are shown how people broken by war resort to unconventional and immoral actions that are fully justifiable by them alone. Again, depends through which eyes you are looking. Adama did not see such actions justifiable, and he put a stop to them. However, the perpetrators, or self-appointed jury, were never charged.I very much liked the episode where a chance is given to Adama to exterminate the Cylons. There is talk of genocide, and many in the fleet are against exterminating the Cylons. But wait a second. Cylons are machines. If today we decided to destroy all Windows based PCs in the world in favor for Apple, would this be genocide? What if some of the Windows PC contained human DNA, would destroying them then qualify as genocide? Meanwhile, though, the Cylons decide against exterminating the human race, resorting to living in harmony with them. Again, the writers manage to include provocative topics in this series. Isn't this what good TV is all about?Another episode I liked was the trial of Gaius Baltar, bringing to mind scenes from John Grisham. Again, whether Baltar is a traitor or not depends on the eye of the beholder. We know he was forced to take certain actions by the Cylons, but we also know that he had his own motivations in certain actions as well. His trial brings up many provocative and controversial topics. I personally thought that episode was the best one. I like it when TV episodes make me think days on end.The Season ends with a huge revelation: some of the Galactica crew are actually Cylons. I won't tell you who, because I know some of you who haven't seen the show will read this review, and this revelation could spoil the whole season! Just let's say you will be utterly surprised. However, I think the writers took a big risk with such a revelation. We'll have to wait for Season 4 to see what all of this means. Will the Cylons and human beings end up living in harmony?Starbuck is also resurrected in the last episode. We saw her die three episodes earlier. She says to Lee,\"It's gonna be okay. I've been to Earth. I know where it is, and I'm going to take us there.\" Is she a Cylon too? Did Lee see another Starbuck copy?I really enjoyed the bonus disk, \"The Story so far.\" This episode recaps all that happened from the beginning of Season 1 to this Season. There were many scenes I had forgotten, and this episode sort of brought everything together again.There is only one issue I have with this show: I think there are too many standalone episodes that don't really seem to advance the main plot of the show. The major appeal of this show (at least to me) is its continuity: how each episode continues on the previous one. Seeing too many standalone episodes kind of destroys the flow of the storyline, and slows down the action.Battlestar Galactica is a great show for all sci-fi fans! Like Razor, Season 3 is shot in HD (High Definition)."
B000UU4IX0 I can't believe it took me so long to start watching this show. Season 1 is by far the best but the series as a whole is excellent. The show is filed with mystery and intrigue. Spoiler alert, it's something good happens to these poor people be prepared because something worse is coming."
B000UU4IX0 Don't miss this series. Best scifi of its kind, actually fairly unique. Great characters and great story backed by wonderful fx and cinematography"
B000UU4IX0 I really liked seasons 1 and 2, but it seems like life aboard the battlestar Galactica is becoming redundant.  I guess there are only so many things you can do in space when finding new planets and interacting with new beings isn't your thing...."
B000UU4IX0 You really have to see seasons 1 and 2 to follow along with series, but each episode is interesting on its own. Admiration goes to the actors and series details, as each intertwines the past set of episodes into the newer ones, with added intrigue and drama as the race to Earth continues. Animation and science fiction detail add to the realism, although most of the scenes are more about societal changes and moral issues that make each episode build on the next."
B000UU4IX0 Have loved this series from the first episode. The characters, the music, the sound effects, and the scenes of the ships in space. Going to hate  for the series to end."
B000UU4IX0 I didn't think it was possible to match or improve on the previous seasons of this fearless series, but then I watched season 3 on DVD.What's best about this show is that the writers and producers are not afraid to take on the tough issues of our times and reflect them back to us through the characters and storylines on BSG.This time, we follow several characters on story arcs which alter their lives forever.  There's Lee Adama and wife Dee, whom he married mainly to try to get over Kara Thrace.  Kara herself is revealed to be the daughter of a bitter, abusive mother.  Lee's complicated relationship with his father, William, is further strained to the breaking point during Baltar's trial.  In the meantime, Saul Tigh continues to drink himself into a stupor over having killed his beloved but traitorous wife, Ellen, and then discovers a horrifying truth about himself along with several colleagues.  The heretofore likeable Felix Gaeta turns out to have been in league with Baltar, to a degree, and then perjures himself on the witness stand.  And the Cylons themselves show us more faces, more personality, and more of a purpose than they ever have before.  Lastly, Agathon and Athena must deal with the fact that she's a Cylon and their baby daughter is a hybrid.  I hope that more will be done with this in the last season."
B000UU4IX0 As with all reviews this is about both the qualty of the set and the show. If you disagree post a review as these reviews are designed to help fans who haven't purchased or seen the show make a decision NOT whether you agree or disagree (that's what the comments section is about). Moving on...Every season of every TV show has episodes that don't stand up to the best that has come before and after.The show looks very good. The extras include podcasts, deleted scenes a terrific extended episode of one of Ronald Moore's favorite episodes \"Unfinished Business\". There are also 2 episode commentary tracks in addition to the podcasts ported over from the web from the original broadcast. David Eick's video blogs are also included as well as the webisodes (which I never got around to watching so it is kind of cool having it here). I would appreciate more behind-the-scenes type of specials but I like that sort of stuff. Fans who just want the episodes will be pretty well served by its presentation here.This is another really good set. I am disappointed that we don't have a Blu-ray version (yet) and I find it unlikely that Universal will be releasing this on HD-DVD with the collapse of the HD-DVD consortium. The show looks better than the standard definition broadcasts but not quite as sharp as the high definition. I'm looking forward to the fourth and final season of this terrific show. I'm also looking forward to Moore's future series (I am a bit disappointed with \"BG\" producer David Eick's update of \"The Bionic Woman\" which, while it has its moments can't even compare to \"BG\").PLOT SUMMARY AND SOME SPOILERS FOLLOW:  The third season has to my mind some of the best episodes of the series particularly during the episodes on New Caprica leading up to the deliverance from the Cylons. When we last saw the survivors of humanity they had settled on New Caprica. They were abandoned by the Galatica and Pegasus when multiple Cylon warships showed up in orbit because Adama (Edward James Olmos)and Lee (Jamie Bamber)felt that they weren't prepared to take them on. We get a healthy glimpse into the rigors and harshness of the Cylon occupation showing that, interestingly, they aren't any better or less flawed than their human captors.Saul(Michael Hogan)has started a resistence movement carrying out guerilla warfare against the Cylons to try and cause as much damage as possible in hopes of helping Adama on the ground when the Galatica returns to save them.From there the series deals with the fall out of settling on New Caprica in the first place, how humanity will deal with collaborators (it's one of the most riveting episodes of the season in my opinion), find out that the Galatica and the Cylons are on the right course for Earth and that there is a mysterious plague striking the Cylons. As with previous episodes the show deals with a number of ethical issues that other shows wouldn't (and couldn't) touch. I know that there are those that were disappointed with the 3rd season feeling it ran too long or that many of the stand alone episodes were weak but I would disagre; I felt that the quality was consistent with the first two seasons dealing with interesting and complex themes."
B000UU4IX0 I'm a newcomer to \"Battlestar Galactica\" and am only now watching the series on DVD.  After a somewhat lackluster Season 2.5, BSG got back on track with an action-packed Season 3.  The colonialists have settled on New Caprica, only to be invaded again by the Cylons, although the Cylons have a different intention this time.  The season is full of action and intriguing plotlines, as the colonialists mount a resistance movement to escape from New Caprica, which reverberates throughout the entire season.Season 3 contains some extremely strong plotlines and episodes.  I was particularly impressed with \"Collaborators\" in which the resistance deals with the colonialists who worked with the Cylons in various ways.  The episode is powerful and reflects the kind of long-term implications of war; creator Ronald Moore aptly compared this episode to the kinds of things seen in France after WWII, for example.  I'm always a sucker for the darker, more politically-tinged episodes of BSG, and this one really did it for me.The season contains several stand-alone episodes that don't continue the main plotline of the search for Earth.  Some of these episodes work well, especially \"Dirty Hands,\" which considers the blue-collar workers who are toiling in the fleet under nearly impossible conditions.  Unfortunately, some of the stand-alones are less successful, particularly \"Hero\" and \"A Day in the Life.\"  Overall, I was pleased with the directions in which they take the main characters, although I was disappointed that Duwalla's part continues to shrink and be less satisfying.  I also was not fond of the turn taken by Starbuck as she follows her \"destiny.\"  I've never been a Starbuck fan, and I found this entire plotline irritating.  Hearing Ronald Moore give Katee Sackhoff constant tongue-baths on the dvd podcast commentaries just added to my irritation.  The woman does all her acting by curling her lips, clearing her throat, and making weird snorting giggles.  Please make her stop!  Ok, I feel better now.Fortunately, the season ends with some very exciting episodes.  Foremost among them is the reveal of four of the final five Cylons.  As is typical of BSG, the season ends with some great cliffhangers that promise to take the series in intriguing new directions.  What I perhaps love most about BSG is its willingness to make changes rather than resting on its laurels.  The story is constantly driving forward and taking us to new places, which is sometimes uncomfortable but always thrilling.  For me, Season Three was better than Season 2.5 and about in par with Seasons 2.0 and 1."
B000UU4IX0 For two seasons, I watched Battlestar Galactica expecting a type of greatness that just never seemed to be realized.  It had its epic moments, of course, but I always felt as the drama was held back just when it should have been accelerated.  In this third season, however, the drama, character development, a
B000UUEEIE This years' series is not as good as previous years. Bought it thinking that it would be."
B000UUEEIE I found this season to be the worst of the lot (so far) and am entering the home stretch of the show with a bit of trepidation. Overall though the season is littered with some good moments and the seasons ends in such a way that I still look forward to the concluding seasons. Recommended if you want to watch the entire series."
B000UUEEIE After watching the first three seasons of 'Rescue Me' this season may disappoint some fans, it's still an excellent TV show, but they seemed to steer away from the firehouse banter that we've all become addicted to. The show is laced with wit, action and drama of the best kind. The cast is colorful with layers of deep emotion. After a long break I eagerly await season five! The show is filmed in widescreen and it looks great on a big screen. This season includes commentary and some interesting extras."
B000UUEEIE Haunted firefighter Tommy Gavin (Denis Leary) knows about tragedy all too well.  He doesn't quite remember what happened at the beach-house at the end of the previous season of FX's Rescue Me, but all he does know is that he is under investigation, while Sheila (Callie Thorne) picks up the pieces.  To make things more hectic, Tommy and his estranged wife Janet (Andrea Roth) are taking care of the new baby, that may be Tommy's or may be his late brother's (Dean Winters).  Tommy's concerns over the baby's safety come into question as well, which leads to a decision that could forever destroy any repairs made to his marriage with Janet.  In the meantime, Chief Reilly (Jack McGee) gets worse news; Sean (Steven Pasquale) starts to grow a pair in regards to his new marriage to Maggie (Tatum O'Neal) and learns a big secret about Probie Mike (Michael Lombardi) in one of the series' funniest and shocking moments; Kenny's (John Scurti) relationship with an ex-nun takes a downward turn; Franco (Daniel Sunjata) has a big decision to make while trying to get back his daughter from Alicia (Susan Sarandon); Tommy's daughter Colleen (Natalie Distler) starts to rebel in a big way; and a new recruit (Larenz Tate) makes an impact on the group.  While the drama and character development was high in the fourth season of Rescue Me, there was just something about this season that didn't feel all that compelling compared to what has been done on the series before.  Also, there was a bit of an uneven feel with a number of already established characters (particularly Probie Mike), but despite the flaws, the fourth season of Rescue Me is still a more than solid season of the series.  The season concludes on a bit of a down note, but seeds have been planted for some big time developments to come.  All in all, Rescue Me continues to entertain and even impress, and here's hoping that there's more drama to come from Leary and company."
B000UUEEIE Haven't received it yet......Planning on taking it with me on Vacation, won't return till Feb 15th"
B000UUEEIE This was free on Amazon Prime. After watching for three and one half seasons, suddenly they want $2 plus meaning about $100. Feel like this is a bait and switch. Amazon Prime offered me $5 and told me to complain to the studio. Feels like reading half a book and losing it."
B000UUEEIE There's definitely some oomph missing from this season, with Tommy being weak and helpless much of the time.  Colleen has become completely stupid and annoying.  And I miss Jack McGee.However, the Jewish fire chief is wonderful, Tommy's soliloquy about Connor, given while sitting on the edge of a tall building, is excellent; and there are still interesting stories and subplots--enough of them to make it worth watching the show.May I just add that the cover art of Leary on the DVD box set is freaky?"
B000UVUMDO The superb acting by Glen Close makes this a great series!  Never get enough of watching the multiple plots and surprises."
B000UVUMDO this is a great series that I wish could go on and on. I watched end of previous season for a refresher before new one started to keep up with all the twists and turns."
B000UVUMDO What an incredble series!  Very well written.  Never knew what would happen next.  Extremely intense and you will be \"hooked\" after the 1st episode.  Anxiously awaiting season 2!!"
B000UVUMDO I watched the first four Seasons of Damages on Amazon Prime, but could not find the 5th Season anywhere. This was a few months back, and suddenly, I saw Season 5 offered on Prime, so I watched it. I enjoyed it, but the &#34;3 weeks later,&#34; 2 months earlier nonsense made me want to go back and watch Season  1 again (probably will watch all again with little time in between) to see if I remembered what happened correctly. I love the plot and the actors; I do not like the crazy skipping in time sequence, and I don't see the point in trying so hard to confuse the viewer. I'm watching again to try to see if I get it all correctly, but it should not be this hard. I probably would not have bought any seasons after the first, if it had not been offered on Prime, for this very reason. I do think I'll watch the other seasons again; the twists in the plot and the crazy time sequence makes viewing again interesting--just for one to make sure one got it right!  Damages would clearly be a five star show if it were not for the time sequencing. Whoever thought that up needs to think again!"
B000UVUMDO The two things that make for engaging TV watching.  The plot is razor sharp and the players are as good as it gets.  One of the best dramas in recent years."
B000UVUMDO This griping premiere season has a good story, actors/actresses to carry the main plot (principle case) to its suspenseful conclusion, and film direction that continue to compel my interest in every season. Glen Close is a ruthless and stalwart prosecuting attorney that is &#34;everyman's&#34; advocate. Her co-star, Rose Byrnes, does a splendid job of being her &#34;assistant&#34;. However, good people are hurt in the &#34;process&#34;; the ends just may justify her methods."
B000UVUMDO I was interested at first because it grabbed me into it....but then soon found out with it starting backwards in story got to be boring. Each character seemed to be defined in detail made me lose interest.  I soon began to know what would most likely happen next per series and then did not care to watch."
B000UVUMDO Once you figure out the central gimmick in this FX series, you'll untie the complexities of its plotting and character development. It's really simple. No one is actually who they appear to be, right down to the minor players and even those who appear less than briefly. It's brilliant, really. They have hidden agendas, hidden relationships and hidden skeletons. The other gimmick is the constant time shifting: scenes play out \"Three Months Later\" etc etc constantly throughout, but you only get a tease of what's really going on. The writing here is top-notch, and old Glenn Close really outdoes herself as the Machiavellian lawyer who bends every ethics rule that ever existed on her way to trying to win damages cases. Unrealistic? Well, yes. This is a TV show. Ted Danson is great as a corporate villain, by the way, as are other name actors in later seasons. If you like court dramas, this one is miles above most."
B000UVUMDO I took a while to git in the swing of the story.  When me got into it we liked it good enough to order the rest of the seasons. The acting is very good, the writing is good also but it jumps around a lot."
B000UVUMDO Clearly a great program, just a little odd, and it jumps around from past to present, then present to past. Glenn Close is an absolute evil(you figure out the rest), and scary in this series. There are so many unexpected twist and turns that I spent the weekend watching season 2, don't leave the room put the streaming on hold. Fatal Attraction was just a prelude to this actress' ablilty to play a role."
B000UVUMDO Loved Season one, a must see. Once you get through season 1 you'll want to continue watching just to find out what's Patty Hewes' next move."
B000UVUMDO The Good Wife has become a traitor, we always thought she held to some kind of loyalty standard to the firm. I turned it off two weeks, doubt that I will watch anymore. Too bad, what are they reaching for, they had enough plots going, I think they have ruined the show."
B000UVUMDO to your sleeping time.  The show is very addictive and intriguing as it keeps you into it throughout every episode.  Of course we have Glenn Close playing as a top notch, take no prisoners and ruthless attorney defending people that were swindled out of their pensions and savings from the corrupt boss played by Ted Danson.  Who also does a wonderful job is his role.  As does the new attorney played by Rose Byrne who starts out as a wide eyed, the world is wonderful person.  But by season end so many things will happen to her that will change not only her views.  But her very way of life as well.An excellent show and an well written and directed first season.  There are so many other characters in the show that do their thing acting as well.  Well worth your buying but rent a couple episodes first to make sure this show is your cup of tea.  Really looking forward to the next season of Damages without a doubt."
B000UVUMDO This show is full of villains and good guys and always keeps you guessing. Each night, we look forward to watching what next twist will be thrown at us!"
B000UVUMDO This series was phenomenal!!!!! Glenn Close was awesome!  I ended up watching all the seasons, and was so disappointed that the show ended!"
B000UVUMDO Boy was this a great series.  I sincerely hated that it ended.  Glenn Close is fantastic as well as the rest of the cast."
B000UVUMDO This is nasty pure trash. Humans should not treat others this way. It is thoroughly not enjoyable. please trash it."
B000UVUMDO Crazy scarey characters the plot twists and turns .Evil series with thiroughly despicable people but addictive and I can't stop watching it  but sort of like a mosquito bite you just can't stop scraping"
B000UVUMDO We only watched a few of the episodes because though we like what Glenn Close has done in the past, we found this series very difficult to follow with the confusing flashbacks and the subject content was not to our taste."
B000UVUMDO I was told by a friend that this was a good series and it is. I would recommend this series to anyone who enjoys a good &#34;Who Done It?&#34;  So many twist and turns that you don't see coming.  WARNING:.....it's like a book you can't put down until it's finished."
B000UVUMDO ..done with style and grace. Wow, this started off as interesting but was full-blown riveting by mid-season. The characters develop with the story and it's amazing how well-acted and nicely written the first season is.  Ellen (Rose Byrne) started off ok for me but became fascinating as the story thickened.  As tension boils over her character seems only to grow more and more subdued in expression, if not with a touch of melancholy, yet with power underlying an understated performance.  G. Close is excellent, as usual, having mastered the art of Queen b*tch, and Danson puts in a fantastic performance - wow, it's been so long since I've seen him in action. His character is simultaneously sympathetic and corrupt - a likable bad guy, though for all his corruption he still doesn't generate the contempt that Patty Hughes does (Close).  He hasn't shined like this since Cheers, and it's great to see him step back into such a convincing and full-bodied role even this late in his career.  Danson's charm still works to great effect here.  His lawyer Ray Fiske, is multi-faceted and excellent, as are nearly all the other supporting actors in the series.  What's not to like?!  Didn't I catch somewhere that Soprano writers or producers were at work here?  Wouldn't be surprising.  This first season is of similar caliber."
B000UVUMDO This show does for the courtroom TV genre what \"The Shield\" did for cop shows.  That is, it knocks you off balance, jumbles things around in a soup of moral ambiguity, and just really pumps new life into a tired genre.  You won't be sure who (or if there is one) the protagonist is throughout the whole season.  Glenn Close is her usual intimidating self, Zeljko Ivanek plays a star litigator, Tate Donovan his counterpart, and of course TED DANSON is amazing as the alternately shocking and hilarious Arthur Frobisher.  At 19.99, this is a steal, consdering people used to line up to pay 100 bucks for 12 episodes of shows like the Sopranos..."
B000UVUMDO Good acting--well cast.  But some of the Machevilian manipulation was a little too clever by half and that it worked out so flawlessly strained credibility."
B000UVUMDO &#34;Damages&#34; is what riveting television is all about.  The characters are rich and deep, their motivations mutli-faceted, their loyalties complex, ever-changing, or just non-existent.  Glenn Close is brilliant as Patty Hewes, portraying nuanced emotions with a deftness rarely seen on television.Season 1 focuses on a lawsuit against a &#34;pump and dump&#34; business owner named Arthur Frobisher (played surprisingly well by Ted Danson) who convinced his employees to empty their pensions and retirement plans into the company's stock before selling every last share he owned.  Acquitted in a criminal hearing, it's up to Patty Hewes and her firm (including the incomparable Rose Byrne as new associate Ellen Parsons) to make things right with the employees who've been left with nothing.It sounds very court-centric on the surface, but it isn't.  There's mystery, double-crosses, schemes, DIRTY LAWYERING!, and even murder.  The story is told creatively.  We see flashes of the present, but the majority of the narrative takes place in the past.  We see the case unfold and the events that led up to the harrowing opening scene.  As the present plays out slowly over the season, the past eventually catches up. When the two meet, it's sheer brilliance.  All those threads finally connect and weave a tapestry of pure entertainment."
B000UVUMDO You will not regret buying this series.  Glen Close is outstanding.  All of the performances are amazing.  You won't be able to stop watching.  Many twists and turns.  The entire writing staff should get an Emmy.  I hope they get the other seasons in blu ray fast!  Can't wait."
B000UVUMDO Viewer be warned, for a legal drama there is really not much in the way of courtroom scenes. It has more to do with the legal process (deposition, finding witnesses, filing motions, etc.).I've been watching this on Netflix instant and was hooked from the first episode. It starts out as a CSI \"Who Dunnit\" approach, showing someone who was murdered followed by a random woman roaming the streets covered in blood. Each episode reveals a piece of the puzzle, until everything makes sense with the final episode and brings you up to speed. By the time you catch up, the season is over and you're amazed they were able to draw you in for so many episodes. And, you want more!The cast is amazing with some heavy hitters. Ted Danson stars as Mr. Frobisher, a multimillionaire businessman who will stop at nothing to keep his money safe. Glenn Close plays Pattie Hughes, a rough and tumble lawyer who has many, many sides to her. Trying to figure her out is darn near impossible. She adapts to anything thrown at her and seems to be one step ahead at almost all times. The second season features Mario Peebles, Timothy Olyphant, William Hurt, and Marcia Gray Harden. There are others I'm sure, I simply do not recognize them.All in all, great series that keeps you captivated and entertained. Watch an episode and see for yourself!"
B000UVUMDO One of the biggest treats of the 2007 television season was \"Damages,\" a wicked and wonderful legal thriller from FX.  Headlined by Glenn Close, I expected to enjoy this show--but I wasn't prepared for the level of sophistication, complexity, and intelligence it offered up from its first twisty, and twisted, moments.  Made for adults, this drama demands attention and may not be for the casual viewer.  With its intricate plotting and structure, the story is told from different time periods interwoven throughout each episode.  Essentially, snippets of the story are presented in each time frame, so the audience is left to speculate about the full truth in any given instance.  However, as the season progresses, the pieces start to connect in unexpected ways that can both surprise and frustrate.  I'd compare the narrative flow of \"Damages\" to that of a fine novel--telling you just enough so that you are tantalized to stick around for the next chapter.The plot of \"Damages\" is a knotty web that is difficult to describe briefly.  Ostensibly, the show revolves around a naive young lawyer played by Rose Byrne.  The opening scenes show a bedraggled and bloodied Byrne stumbling down the streets of New York--apparently the victim (or perhaps the perpetrator) of an act of violence.  Cut to six months earlier and a proper introduction is made.  Byrne is seduced and recruited by a major law firm run by Glenn Close.  Close seems to have a hidden agenda, but Byrne is quickly overcome by the trappings of success and acceptance.  The firm is handling an enormous class action lawsuit against one of the town's most prominent businessmen, played by Ted Danson, and Byrne ends up squarely in the midst of much legal intrigue.  What follows includes lying, blackmail, corruption, and even murder--no one in this story remains an innocent.While I actually think the plot is the real star of \"Damages\" (I don't think I've ever said that about a TV show before)--it certainly doesn't hurt that the cast is uniformly excellent.  Don't be surprised if you see Close front and center come awards time.  Her thinly veiled menace and cutting remarks make for classic villainy, but Close pulls it off in a way that you can't help but love!  Byrne and all the key supporting players are solid and believable.  I particularly liked Zeljko Ivanek and Peter Facinelli, but the real revelation to me was Ted Danson.  Honestly, I've followed Danson since he was a bit player in \"Body Heat\" and I think this is by far his best role.  Mixing equal parts charm and bile, this is a great actor in a beautifully written role.Again, I don't recommend \"Damages\" to everyone--I only wish I could!  If, however, you love sophisticated drama--give this a shot.  The DVD format is the perfect way to watch this show at your own pace and enjoy all its subtleties, surprises, and delights.  But, be reminded, if you sit down to watch this show--WATCH IT!  Otherwise, you might not appreciate how intricately put together \"Damages\" really is.  KGHarris, 12/07."
B000UVUMDO I can't get enough of this show!  I just finished watching 3 episodes and would be watching a 4th if it weren't almost midnight.  Great acting and suspenseful story."
B000UVUMDO I had no idea what I was getting into with this show, and it continues to grab me and yet shock me every episode.  If you had always agreed with the expression &#34;kill all the lawyers&#34; , this show will give you reasons.  It is filled with outstanding acting...Glen Close is breathtaking in her evil.  One thing about it....trust no one.  It is not an easy show to watch but you can't help coming back for more."
B000UVUMDO just about when you think you have figured out where the plotis headed somebody betrays somebody and it is going in a differentdirecrion."
B000UVUMDO Even though I usually to choose programs that are less graphic, this show is gripping & I'm now almost through the second season. The actors are quite good at making me detest their characters!"
B000UVUMDO Had heard great things about this series and sampled 5 shows last night.  Very addictive series with great suspense.Love the diverse characters and smart dialogue.  Lots of plot twists.  Brilliant acting by Glenn Close and Ted Danson.  What a great find!  Looking forward to more nights of viewing."
B000UVUMDO The cast is great and perfectly cast. I watched the entire 1st season in a week and the second season the following week."
B000UVUMDO This is supposed to be a legal drama about a class action lawsuit. But rather than lawyers, all the characters are basically gangsters on both sides of the case. Glenn Close gives an extraordinary performance and Rose Byrne does better than expected, but the story and script really let them down.At the heart of the story is basically a lifted-from-Enron case where the employees of a bankrupt company are going after its former CEO. But its a superficial resemblence because whoever wrote the script understood little about such matters.Ted Danson drags the whole piece down. Since Glenn Close is playing an evil character, Danson's character has to be played as arch-evil. Mustache twirling evil. And Danson delivers an astonishly stupid broadly drawn evil character. And he is probably close to what Danson imagines every non-Hollywood CEO to being. Danson goes out of his way to make sure that there is no possible way to have any sympathy for rich Mr. businessman. And thats really the only way for the story to work given that Glenn Close is playing a gangster.For a series about the law, there is very little \"law\" in it and what law it has is done unimaginatively. They never get beyond the depositions. They never follow anything like the timeline of a real case. And why not. To the main characters, law is a distraction. If lawyers spent time on legal matters, when would they have time all the gangster stuff: Hiding and killing witnesses, blackmailing the opposing lawyer, spying, stealing, witness intimidation, bribing prosecutors, containing the ambitions of the underbosses and so on. The character Glenn Close somewhat resembles is the lawyer Sean Penn played in the film \"Carlito's way\".One of the core problems with the Glenn Close character is that her word means nothing. Every deal she makes, she goes back on. A stand alone character can work like that. But not someone running a law firm. Any organization runs on a certain level of trust. A lawyer operating within the profession depends on a certain level of trust. If she was going to act like that, she needed in the context of the show to keep herself innocent and to preserve her image at all costs.The series would have been more interesting if it had been more realistic and if both sides in the case had been shades of grey. And to cover all the stages of a case: (1) Selling the client to take you on as a lawyer (2) figuring out a strategy(3) depositions and discovery, (4) negotiating over a settlement (5) Witness prep (5) jury selection (6) the trial.The combination of amoral gangster lawyer and ruthless crusader for justice also really doesn't work. Every time Glenn Close starts to talks about \"victims\", it comes across as totally false.By the end of the season, they have started walking down the sad road toward making excuses for Glenn Close's behavior. Dead baby drama in a cemetary is an incredibly cheap way to drum up sympathy.This is another of those things where the potential and most of the actors end up being greater than the script that they were given."
B000UVUMDO One of the great things that the explosion in DVDs has given us is a chance to revisit television shows that we might not have had a chance to watch. It also gives us the chance to watch TV shows that are serial like and that we abandoned when we missed that all important episode. Such is the case with DAMAGES.This FX series follows a young beginning attorney named Ellen Parsons (Rose Byrne) who has just been hired by the most notable attorney around, Patty Hewes (Glenn Close). Patty is a no nonsense player who lives to win and will do nearly anything to make that happen. When Patty takes a case, more than likely her client will be the winner.At the moment, Hewes & Associates are involved in their biggest case yet, a class action suit against an unscrupulous CEO named Arthur Frobisher (Ted Danson) who sold out his stocks and left the employees of the company with nothing. While the government was unable to prove any wrongdoing, Patty and company are dead set on recouping the losses these people incurred for them.But all is not fair in love and war and this case is nothing less than a war between giants. While Patty uses everything at her disposal to try and bring Frobisher to justice, he and his lawyer do everything they can to block her or to make sure that no one talks, even possibly resorting to murder.But that's the thing about this show. As it progresses the fine line between who is wearing the white hat and who is wearing the black becomes clouded. Attacks on witnesses, payoffs, dog killings all seem like the work of the defendant. But then again, could they be the tactics of the plaintiff trying to make someone uncomfortable enough to make a wrong move? Add to that the fact that young Ellen has connections to the case that may have resulted in her being employed to begin with and we end up with a subplot that ties into the main.The twists and turns of the legal world, in and out of the courtroom (more often out) make for dynamic viewing that holds you in its grip from the opening scenes of Ellen leaving an apartment covered in blood until the last episode. The acting is better than can be expected on most TV shows and the direction shows a storytelling technique that moves the plot along while holding your interest from week to week or in this case from disc to disc.Keep in mind while this is a solid piece of drama for viewers, it is not a piece that is recommended for children as it is filled with adult content. But for adults who are looking for drama, this is one that I would recommend."
B000UVUMDO Great show well done keeps you in suspense throughout.  The quality on the free amazon prime is great don't pay for hd"
B000UVUMDO Riveting tale that tells us too much about the dark side of human nature. Redeeming value of story:  the only benefit of lifestyles portrayed is &#34;stuff&#34;. The pseudo quest for power, respect, justice is doomed as we try to manipulate others and our circumstances. We lose everything that matters at the levels this story spirals down to. So who would aspire to be these kind of people?"
B000UVUMDO Damages is the best of manipulation, murder, a
B000UVUMDO \"Damages\" is that kind of show that has you on the edge of your seat  completely confused as to what is going to happen next and in utter surprise when you discover each piece of the truth. It was one of the best shows of last season without a doubt. The show centered around Ellen (Byrne), who begins to work in the lawfirm of Patty Hewes (Glenn Close) who is a ruthless, self-serving and completely unpredictable lawyer. She focuses her work on a class action lawsuit against Arthur Frobisher (amazingly played by Danson) for insider trading. The first scene of the first episode shows Ellen running half naked in a raicoat covered in blood in the streets of New York. In each episode we discover a new piece of the puzzle and the events that led to that first scene. The past/present technique is masterfully used making each viewer very involved in solving the mystery. The performance of actors is excellent and the show is amazing. Damages is truly a great show."
B000UVUMDO If you like to watch a group of awful people lying and doing awful things to each other, then this is one for you. It's hard to find anybody to like in this show. Add that to a bizarre editing style that keep jumping around in time previewing what is to happen in the future -- then jumping to the past? Where's the present?Lots of character and plot manipulation to keep the story going to the point of ridiculousness.The acting is very good and the casting very good, just a hateful story.It being a serial, I got sucked in and slugged it out finishing 2 seasons, but the ending of the 2nd season didn't even make sense, other than, incredulously, setting up for more seasons. I was so glad to not look at Glen Close' face anymore, that it was a relief that it was over. Out of complete boredom, I may take a peak at the 3rd season, if nothing else, to see how the heck they will try to patch the absurd ending to season 2."
B000UVUMDO I loved the first season. My only issue is that I got impatient and wanted to know who did it after the first episode."
B000UVUMDO With the cast it could have been better. I think the direction and writing made this rather a long drawn out negative show. Not one bit of light at the end of the tunnel and pretty much ambition and greed leading the way...Washington DC all the way. I get enough of this lovely life on the news. Do not consider it entertaining when it is being played out in our lives. But hey that is just me, you may love it."
B000UVUMDO The first season of the show Damages with Glenn Close starts out with a cat and mouse game and the stakes just get higher and higher the more shows you watch. Cutthroat isn't even the word with this show... it goes above and beyond. Not only that, during much of my watching, I wasn't sure if I was watching a cat or a mouse at any given time! I came back too, to watch seasons two and three.Great acting and incredibly fast changing story line. Enjoy!"
B000UVUMDO This is a really great TV series and I really enjoyed the many twists that kept me guessing throughout the episodes--and guessing wrong most of the time. I've always wanted to be a lawyer, among many other professions, and I immediately picked up this series upon seeing it at the Duty Free shop at Heathrow International Airport.This series exposes the world of litigations, and how they operate.  The whole season is about a class action lawsuit targeting one of the wealthiest CEOs (Chief Executive Officer). When lawyers try to win at all cost, lives and fortunes are lost. Is it worth it all? Are lawyers angels or demons in disguise? How far would we go for money? Is money worth destroying the lives of others? Are secrets worth killing for? Would we kill for money? How much money is enough? What is the price of betrayal, and when is betrayal ethical? These are just a few of the questions you will be asking yourself as you go through this series.The way the series is structured is that it shifts between past events and future ones. I did find this system to be confusing at times, but it does have its merits.This is a fast paced series. The acting is superb and the episodes are very well written and believable. The ending is spectacular, and unanticipated. I can't wait for season two."
B000UVUMDO Glenn Close and Rose Byrne do a brillant job in this drama series.  It will keep you riveted.  Awesome show!"
B000UVUMDO This is a great series. I already bought season 2 and 3. I have never been a huge Glenn Close fan but after seeing the first season I have completely changed my mind about her acting. Every second of this show kept my attention. A definite must see..."
B000UVUMDO Very depressing the entire time, yes it's suspenseful and has a great cast, but there wasn't a silver lining or even the smallest joke."
B000UVUMDO Everything about the first season of Damages was superb, the writing, the acting, the story line.  It was interesting to see Ellen's character slowly begin to change from the innocent, trusting young lawyer, to the suspicious character portrayed by Glen Close.  The show really is all about trust.  The key line that sums up the entire season is spoken by Close's character Patty Hewes, &#34;Trust no one.&#34;  Not exactly a great message to instill in people, but it works well in a TV drama about lawyers.  Other than Ellen and her boyfriend David there really aren't many characters in this show worth admiring.  Everyone is lying to everyone, which makes it difficult at times to figure out what is really going on, but as the old saying goes, &#34;The truth has a way of rising to the surface,&#34; and all lies are revealed.  All in all, great show.  Highly recommended."
B000UVUMDO You know how The Wire: The Complete Series starts out slow but in the end everything comes together and you realize that you've watched the greatest show on television? This is the opposite case. Call it theTrue Blood: The Complete First Season (HBO Series)effect. Every episode is exciting and drives the show forward. Every episode has something cool that keeps you watching to the next one. And the title sequence? VERY cool.Yet when it's over, you'll feel like you've just wasted 13 hours. It's not so much that the whole thing falls apart at the end due to the stupid denouement of the major mystery (although the answer as to why Rose Byrne comes into a police station all bloody with a dead boyfriend in her bathtub is very stupid) but also because once it's over all of the missteps in the piece become glaringly obvious. When you are watching it, you just enjoy Glen Close and Ted Danson at their crazy manipulative best. Glen Close is in pure bunny-boiling evil form (and she does kill the dog) and Ted Danson is like a version of Sam gone to pot without conscience. The games that these two (and Danson's lawyer) play to one up each other are particularly amusing and convoluted.Sadly, once it's over the plot holes become way too obvious. A simple malfeasance case is probably too dull to sustain an entire show, but in one episode, Glen Close manipulates one of her own witnesses to lie in deposition in order to ruin her case and make the Danson camp think that they are winning. In another episode Close kills a dog which I believe might be problematic even for lawyers. And Ted Danson openly talking to one of the people suing him in order to manipulate the lawsuit is just dumb all around. And if we enjoy watching Glen Close be evil, why do the writers think that we need to see her crying like at the end ofDangerous LiaisonsBut really, the entire thing falls on Rose Byrne's tiny shoulders and Rose Byrne is just not up to the task. Yes, she's supposed to be a naive lawyer just out of law school but most of the time she comes off as utterly stupid. When her assistant ruins all of her appointments and messes up her day, she has to wait the entire episode to fire him. And it's supposed to be some kind of fall from grace when she's no longer a nice person. Partially it's the problem of the scripts. She is supposed to be naive, but most of the time the scripts make her act like an utter idiot. But mostly, it's Rose Byrne's fault. When Glen Close is telling her that she admires her because she is very shrewd, well there's nothing all that shrewd about her. Even though, it's obvious that she's been hired in order to get to a witness, there's nothing about her acting that suggests that she's anything other than a vacant and pretty face to be manipulated. This is Mary Sue characterization at it's worse. She has nothing to offer, yet everyone claims that she offers the world. And if this is a woman who comes from hardscrabble circumstances who clawed her way to the top of her law school class and can turn down a 130K starting salary, we SHOULD believe that she's actually intelligent and shrewd and just as much of a force of nature as Glen Close. She SHOULD be Glen Close's chaacter in process.Instead she's just dumb. Sure, it's fun watching Glen Close push her around and play with her like a tiger playing with a bunny rabbit; but if the script is telling us that she's this amazing lawyer learning how to be a manipulative powerhouse, then that potential should be obvious. Yet it's not. And that's w
B000UVUMDO I love how cleverly this show moves. The mindless sex is a serious detraction. I can't enjoy this otherwise wonderful show with my 14 year old. I know people have sex... I don't need to watch their version of fulfillment."
B000UVUMDO I just finished Season 5 and loved how everything came full circle. This show is not to be missed. Patty and Ellen forever!!!"
B000UVUMDO There aren't any eccentric characters that make you laugh like Denny Crane on \"Boston Legal\" nor are there any cases neatly tied up at the conclusion of each episode with a bow on them. \"Damages\" follows a single case and the follow out from that case from its beginning until its bitter end. \"Damages\" begins with  Ellen Parsons (Rose Byrne from \"28 Weeks Later\" and \"Sunshine\") bloodied and battered walking the streets of New York until she is discovered by the police. From there the series takes a trip back in time six months earlier a case that Ellen worked on as a new attorney at Patricia Hewes (Glenn Close) & Associates. It's a civil case where Hewes is suing multi-billionaire Arthur Frobisher (Ted Danson) for hollowing out his company and robbing 5000 employees of his company of their pension plans in the process. Having escaped the prosecution of the U.S. Attorney's Office, Frosbisher now must defend himself from claims that he benefited by selling his stocks before his company collapsing and getting away scot-free. Frobisher of course insists that he is innocent and was as much a victim losing the company he cared for as the employees. We see the entire case unfold before our eyes, the double dealings, double crosses and underhanded attempts by both the Hewes and Frobisher's attorney to gain the upper hand in this litigation.\"Damages\" is compelling, fascinating and well written featuring a wide variety of characters with their own agendas. No one truly is an angel here although the nave Ellen comes mighty close as she finds herself dragged into Hewes' world and manipulated as much by her boss as she is by the opposition in the case. A personal connection between Ellen and the case is uncovered which also makes Ellen suspect that the only reason she got the job was so that she could be used to gain the upper hand in the case. In the process Ellen sees her ambitions and dreams pull further and further away from her reach just as she thinks she is climbing the corporate ladder of success.  Hewes tells Ellen at one point, \"trust no one\" and the same could be applied to everyone involved in the case.Academy Award nominee/Emmy winner Close, Emmy Award winner Danson, Bryne, Tate Donovan, Peter Riegert, Michael Nouri and a host of film/TV/Broadway veterans bring these characters to life with a vibrancy rare in series television. If the story sounds like it was ripped from the headlines, the Enron, Worldcom and other scandals where corporate CEO's betrayed the public trust and manipulated the market inspired the series but it's the compelling characters and drama that will make you stick around to the conclusion of this 13 episode FX series.The opening had me scratching my head in puzzlement--it looked like crappy low-rez video. It's a faade like everything else here as it is simply a sequence showing us the raw reality that Ellen finds himself trapped in. As the show jumps back six months in time to the beginning of the case, we get a beautifully rendered high definition video image. There are a couple of problems with video noise that occur. It isn't a perfect presentation on Blu-ray but it looks extremely good.Audio sounds marvelous with a TrueHD 5.1 mix that uses the format quite well. It isn't compressed and has terrific dynamic range. The 5.1 format is nicely used given that this is primarily a dialogue driven show with nice ambient effects captured in the surround channels.I was surprised that we only get two audio commentaries on this set as I had hoped for more but both are effective and insightful. Glenn Close, writers/producers Todd Kessler & Glenn Kessler, Daniel Zelman and director Allen Coulter appear on the pilot episode discussing issues they ran into shooting on location in New York during a nasty winter, issues they ran into with trying to bring the series in on budget but without messing with the quality of the show. Close is a bit quiet during the commentary it would be fun to hear her let loose on one by herself or with a moderator. I would have loved to hear Close and her co-stars on a separate audio commentary track discuss the craft of acting, their approach to the material and some of their thoughts during their performances but what we do get is quite good.The second audio commentary features actor Zeljko Ivanek front and center dominating the discussion with the Kesslers and Zelman joining in with technical tidbits from time-to-time. Ivanek has long been one of my favorite character actors and he has largely been underused in many TV shows and movies so its nice to see him get a character as juicy as defense attorney Ray Fiske to sink his teeth into southern drawl and all.\"Willful Acts\" is a half hour behind-the-scenes documentary on the making of the series. \"Understanding Class Action\" is designed with an interfact that gives viewers a background on how class action lawsuits work and a definition of the various phrases thrown around in the series. \"Trust No One\" clocks in under fifteen minutes and focuses more on the characters in the series. We also get a variety of deleted scenes. The really cool feature of this set is that the disc is enabled so that the player can remember which episodes you've watched and jump right back to the one you had next in rotation if you choose the \"play all\" feature.\"Damages\" is a terrific, compelling legal drama. All 13 episodes of the series plus the extras are on three Blu-ray discs and you also get an insert that gives you the title of each episode, a brief synopsis and credits for each one as well."
B000UVUMDO Really great first season. Full of twist and unexpected turns. I can't wait to watch season 2! It can only get better!"
B000UVUMDO This show has too much blood and killing!  I don't like the fact that the show is always going back to the past which creates confusion at times."
B000V5Q8JQ Where is Calvin Klein tween's EMMY for her performance.  It is so great that David Carradine's daughter (echo!) gives an even better performance than her dad on Criminal Minds.  I've taped the last scene on my dvr a few times when the episode has reaired because her performance is SO satisfying but rewatching her earlier scenes is important to understand how devastating her character is.  She does crazy things with her face in her scene with VDO who is wearing one of his BEST suits and of course, John Glover is wonderful from his first scene when it is obvious what a burden his daughter's existence is to him but never more so than when he silently rubs his eyes in the interrogation room with the speaker is turned off - in one room, not the other.  There is a HINT of his character's resentment of his former protege that will be given the spotlight in his reappearance in a later season.  FUN."
B000V5Q8JQ Vincent D'Onofrio is the best. I miss this show so much. I can watch over and over and never get tired of this show!"
B000V5Q8JQ First off, what happened to Barek & Carver? I know the actors left the show, but there was no explanation given at any time as to why their characters vanished from the series. Barek & Carver were the perfect foils to Logan and Goren/Eames. That is partly why I'm giving this season III stars instead o the usual V. The other part stems from my disgust at the fourth episode. Seeing the particular class type of people in that episode portrayed sympathetically just nauseated me. aside from that episode and the unexplained departure of Barek & Carver, it w
B000V5Q8JQ L&O; Criminal Intent is one of my favorite Cop ShowsI'd put it in my top 5 without a Doubt!This season was a tad differentMostly due to NBC's lack of Passion for this Great Cop/Crime Dramascenes look different,  it has this  very different looking Neon Color patternMusic starts every episode  (It very much tries to look and feel like CSI) But, it's still CIThank God I don't understand CSI at all (it's a super Lazy Cop show) yes it's a insane ratings machinesBut, in my defense so is A&E;'s Duck DynastyEven though it tries to borrow tacky gimmicks made famous by CSI  (It still has great writing and acting)This season is without a doubt a re-boot in a wayThe events of Season 5 changed lots of NYPD's Major Case SquadCaptain  DeakinsCaptain  Deakins was forced out due to trying to protect Detective LoganA.D.A.

B000V5Q8JQ I just recently discovered this show . I have seen several past episodes on daytime TV. So, I decided to start acquiring seasons when I came across them at a reasonable price - new or used. I found this Sixth Season at a great NEW price. So a good addition to my DVD TV Library.  I've found a few others 'on sale'. This way I can see the early episodes/seasons and  how the characters have grown through the years. Cool"
B000V5Q8JQ I have not been able to view this packet yet but it appears to be new as ordered.thank you very much"
B000V5Q8JQ I don't like this season as much, because D'Onofrio is less hot, but the writing is better. However, Vince letting himself go just makes me feel a little sad inside. &#34;Seasons change... people change... &#34; If only he had valued his hotness. :/Anyway, Eames continues to be awesome, but this is the season where Vince had a breakdown and they had to bring in some other cops. DUN DUN! I really don't like the episodes with Chris Noth and his little freckle-boy-woman. Whatever. Chris Noth is okay, but he's no Vincent D'Onofrio. Chasing his &#34;white whale,' Nicole Wallace, comes to a sickening conclusion."
B000V5Q8JQ Criminal Intent is by far the best of all the Law and Order shows on TV ....Season 6 is no exception. Especially the Goran episodes are really good.I can`t wait for them to release season 7"
B000V5Q8JQ I am a big Law & Order Fan, loved the connection of Bobby * Emmes , and the other role players that followed. Jeff Goldblum , a few Captain changes but the strong writing and Dick Wolf who is still going strong with a new series based on real DA's . I was sad to see the CI series end , SVU still in production with major role changes and lets not forget the original 20 seasons of Law & Order which is my next purchase. Great to have in your library. You can watch them over and over a catch something you missed. Well Done great that Amazon has them available."
B000V5Q9Y0 Law & Order: Special Victims Unit - The Eighth Year is another entertaining season of my fave show. Some of the standout episodes include: Choreographed, Burned, Haystack, Florida, and Annihilated. Christoper Meloni and Mariska Hargitay are talented actors and so is Ice-T. I highly recommend this top-notch show, enjoy!"
B000V5Q9Y0 Great season as always. Actors are great. Story line is great. What more can be said?"
B000V5Q9Y0 I like this tv show because there is a great story line in each episode. They find and catch the perp and prosecute them. I have all the seasons."
B000V5Q9Y0 Law & Order: SVU is definitely one of my favorite shows on TV.  I only discovered it about a year and a half ago and have since become completely addicted.  I purchased the first seven seasons and noticed that the eighth season was not on DVD yet.  That didn't make much sense to me because this season aired in 2006-2007.At any rate, I'm so happy that they are releasing season eight now!  I only hope that season nine follows soon after.  And after this season is finished, I hope they don't wait too long to put it on DVD as well.If you like Law & Order, chances are you'll like this show too."
B000V5Q9Y0 I now own 9 seasons of this video, I have always loved the Law & Order series, all of them  and hope to own them all."
B000V5Q9Y0 Maybe these are all starting to run together for me, or maybe it's just that I was lukewarm to this particular season, but I just didn't find it as watchable as the majority of the other seasons.  It is the eighth year, and that's a high mark when it comes to ideas and plot-lines.Law and Order SVU is about the special cases.  Those cases of rape, child abuse, and elder abuse that typically deal with hard to face victims and emotional tragedy.  They're hard to watch, but because of a generally stellar cast it has become one of the most popular series out there. While you don't have to watch the season in order, it is good to at least try because there's a bit of background on the detectives that you could miss out on otherwise.  But the episodes are primarily stand-alone, with each resolving by the end of the episode.There were a few stand out episodes in this season.  \"Confrontation\" takes a horrible fear of rape, and multiplies it by having the rapist come back again and again for insidious purposes.  \"Scheherazade\" has a killer telling a tale, but drawing it out to elude his own death.  But with these episodes come a bunch that after watching the first time, I just skip over them when I rewatch the season.  And those are the episodes near the end that involve Benson's half brother plot.  I know they were trying to twist things around but it just didn't grip me and I thought her tale better when she didn't family ties.  At least the last episode had some pretty big cliffhangers, making you wonder what was going to happen and eager for the next season.Characters:Christopher Meloni as Det. Elliot StablerMariska Hargitay as Det. Olivia BensonRichard Belzer as Det. John MunchIce-T as Det. Fin TutuolaDiane Neal as ADA Casey NovakB. D. Wong as Dr. George HuangTamara Tunie as Dr. Melinda WarnerDann Florek as Capt. Don CragenConnie Nielsen as Det. Dani BeckAdam Beach as Det. Chester LakeThe original cast of characters are all here, but there are a few more that had a considerable amount of time in this season.  Nielsen as Detective Dani Beck replaces Hargitay in the first half of the season.  While she was ok, she wasn't as good as Hargitay, and it was a relief to see her come back.  Meloni too just didn't have the chemistry with Nielsen like he does with Hargitay and so his performances weren't as moving as they normally are.  Belzer and Ice-T continue to play a secondary role and had an average amount of screentime when compared to the other seasons.  I did like the few roles played by Beach as Detective Chester Lake.  He had a calming presence about him that I enjoyed.This series is not for the faint of heart and especially not this season.  There is violence, staged scenes of rape, abuse and other harsh topics that not all will want to see.  But the show is gritty and tries to be realistic so it could be hard for some people.  The majority of the camerawork is on the detectives but they do have to process the crimes so at least one time in every episode, there's something tragic to see.Not the best of the seasons but I'll certainly keep watching.  When it's been around this long there's a reason for it, and I know the series can certainly improve to its former glory again.Review by M. Reynard 2013"
B000V5Q9Y0 \"Law & Order\" stars Mariska Hargitay and Christopher Meloni in 22 Season 8 episodes heavy on drama.  The scripts deal with sex crimes, their perpetrators and victims with often frank language and disturbing, emotionally provocative scenarios.  Guest stars in the eighth season include Marcia Gay Harden, Tim Daly, Blair Underwood, Bernadette Peters, Kim Delaney, and Kal Penn."
B000VU2STU This show is incredible.  Finally a well-written storyline that hooks you immediately!!  Damian Lewis does a phenominal job. I liked him instantly and have consistently watched as his character grows. Life has excellent script writing.  I really enjoy this show and hope it continues.  Life requires viewers to actually have a brain as it stimulates deep thought!!  WONDERFUL!  Keep it coming!!!!"
B000VU2STU Life is my favorite show of the season.It is well acted, well written, with a fascinating and original premise.The show is full of philosophy, i.e. mans search for meaning and justice.Add to that a couple of beautiful actresses thrown into the mix, and \"Life\" is a thinking man's perfect show!03/01/08I just rewatched all the pre stike episodes this week...And again, I think this is the best drama of the year and one of the best ever on TV. If you haven't seen this show yet, do yourself a favor and start at the beggining and get addicted like me."
B000VU2STU Prison changes a man, and it certainly changed former LAPD police officer Charlie Crews. From 1995 to 2007 he served hard time for murders he didn't commit. When DNA evidence surfaces proving his innocence, Crews is released and reinstated in the force (he also lands some serious settlement money). Now Detective Crews finds himself working with a new partner even as he covertly seeks answers to what the hell happened.LIFE looks to be a very promising cop detective show, and not because the mysteries themselves are dynamite stuff or anything. No, the viewing addiction lies in watching the lead actor work his craft. Britisher Damian Lewis is simply fabulous as the wounded, brooding protagonist, trying to piece his life back together. It's fun watching Crews apply his askewed perspective on his cases. I'm normally not a fan of folks who sling zen about, but Lewis makes it an integral part of his character. And if it's a loose cannon with an agenda slinging that zen, all the better. After all, zen helped Crews survive the penitentiary. I also like the little touches which remind us that Crews is still coping with his new found freedom, whether it's his habit of munching on fresh fruit (they never have fresh fruit in prison) or his preference for light and open air or the fact that he still doesn't have furniture in his home.Lewis's supporting cast is so-so. I do enjoy Sarah Shahi, who's a former Dallas Cowboy cheerleader. She plays the no-nonsense Dani Reese, Crews' new partner and not ecstatic about it. It's true that her character tends to fall in the generic character-saddled-with-demons category, so, yeah, nothing new from that angle. But I think she has very good chemistry with Damian Lewis, and I just love her bemused or irritated reactions to Crews' barrage of philosophical quirk. Two other actors who nicely play off Lewis are sexy Brooke Langton as Crews' smitten attorney and Adam Arkin as Crews' former inmate and current best friend and financial adviser.I like the show's use of interview clips. They reveal certain insights and usher several sub-plots into the light. We learn, for instance, that Crews' former partner didn't stand up for him and that Crews' beautiful wife had divorced him while he was serving out his time. We even get a teeny whiff of the conspiracy surrounding Crews' frame-up. More layers and foreshadowings, thanks to these clips.SPOILERS now.With the steady influx of crime drama on TV, I wasn't planning on tuning in to this show. Then the pilot changed my mind. Other standouts? \"Powerless\" is the powerful sixth episode, focusing on Dani as she pursues a rapist who'd been haunting her AA meetings. \"Farthingale\" (episode 8) is a fun one, an intriguing mystery which begins with a man having been half blown off by an exploding stove. Then there's the intense two-part story arc (episodes 10 & 11: \"Dig A Hole\" & \"Fill It Up\") as Crews finally tracks down the man who committed the murders for which he was incarcerated. In \"Dig A Hole\" we also get to see a showdown of sorts between Crews' new and former partners.SPOILERS end.I can't stress enough how good Damian Lewis is on this show. I remember him from HBO's great wartime mini-series,Band of Brothers, and he made an impact back then, too, and was even nominated for a Golden Globe (although he didn't win). Damian Lewis, with his complex performance here, elevates LIFE from a humdrum procedural into a riveting police drama. And the latest from the grapevine (I think it was TV Guide) indicates that NBC's picked up this show for the rest of the season. So LIFE is good."
B000VU2STU interesting from the start. i am not typcially a fan of any sort of cop show, but this one was so good i cannot wait for the next episode. bought the season pass before it was even half over.the writing here is particularly good for network tv. this show could easily have been on hbo. i just hope nbc doesnt drop the ball on this one. judging from the rest of the slate available so far, this is the only one that isnt insulting and stupid. indeed its grand, nuanced and wonderful. and as i said, very very smert."
B000VU2STU Despite the Monk-like, strange habits exhibited by the Cop-turned-Prisoner-turned-Detective, Charlie, the story provided an excellent synopsis for a cop trying to recapture what he had and then some, while secretly solving his past.  I'll give a few more episodes before making any solid commentments, but LIFE is so far, so good."
B000VU2SW2 Chuck Bartowski works for a huge electronics store in Los Angeles, Buy More, but is still annoyed at being framed for a misdemeanour he didn't commit which led to him getting thrown out of Stanford University several years earlier. Bryce Larkin, Chuck's former best friend and the guy who framed him, sends Chuck a mysterious email which causes him to pass out. When he wakes up, he discovers that he has downloaded the Intersect - the entire American secret database on international criminals, terrorists and other restricted subjects - into his brain. With the Intersect itself destroyed and Larkin dead, this means that the CIA and NSA need Chuck to help them defend American interests. Thus, he is forced into a double life of maintaining his working life at the Buy More whilst also helping CIA agent Sarah Walker and NSA agent John Casey fight international crime using his subliminal knowledge.Right from the start, Chuck puts its colours on the mast: this is going to be a show where the idea is to watch it and enjoy yourself, with even the vaguest hint of realism thrown out of the door. In an age where American network shows are being ignored in favour of 'edgy' cable series, it's a relief to find a show that is just so much damn fun.Chuck works on a number of levels. The casting is excellent, with Zachary Levi making for an appealing protagonist, balancing geekiness with likability and a growing ability to cope with the crazy situations he's been thrown into. The ridiculously attractive Yvonne Strahovski makes for a great straight-woman as Sarah, who pulls off the 'coldly professional CIA agent' character well but then develops the role to become more conflicted in her loyalties as the season progresses. The mighty Adam Baldwin - Jayne from Firefly - is also great as Casey, whose first instinct in any situation is extreme violence. The supporting cast, notably Chuck's family and his fellow workers at the Buy More, are also well-cast and entertaining.The show also has a great deal of geek-cred. One episode hinges on Chuck and his best friend Morgan (Joshua Gomez) being able to carry off their Halloween trick of dressing up as a sandworm from the Dune books, whilst in another Chuck reminisces on bonding with an ex-girlfriend over playing EverQuest. Another episode uses (classic 1980s text adventure) Zork references as a plot point. References range from the pretty obvious to the fairly obscure, and catching them is fun in itself.The series follows the now-traditional structure of having a season-spanning arc mixed up with lots of stand-alone episodes. The arc is actually fairly slight (there are hints that the NSA are building the Intersect 2.0 and indicating that once it is ready, Chuck will be expendable) but there are some ongoing character arcs and developments from episode to episode that work quite well. One character point - that Morgan has a huge crush on Chuck's sister - is actually a bit stalker-ish in the first couple of episodes due to the writers overegging it, but they sensibly pull it back and then dispose of it after giving Morgan another girlfriend later on, resolving the issue before it becomes too much of a problem.The individual episode storylines are mostly enjoyable, particularly the season finale in which the entire Buy More is cleared out after listening devices are discovered and the characters have to discover the fate of the store manager's stuffed fish. Something that is slightly problematic is that the somewhat mundane storylines at the Buy More or involving Chuck's family are often more enjoyable than the spy stuff, which is often formulaic (though always watchable). There are problems that ideas are reused a few too many times (particularly with Casey getting into trouble with a beautiful female agent which goes a bit wrong, which happens twice within a few episodes), b
B000VU2SW2 Great Show!  Nerds and Spooks.  It's the perfect partnership.  Chuck, a Stanford drop out, working at the Buy More, gets an  email from his sort of best friend.  The email contains current and past U.S. intelligence.  The email imprints all this data into Chuck's memory.  Soon after, Chuck meets Sara and falls head over heals for her.  It turns out, she is his handler, and charged with keeping him safe, and the information intact.  This is the story of how Chuck grows out of being just a Nerd Herder, to a real spy with the help of friends, family, the CIA, and Sara.  It's a story of nerds, love, action, and comedy.  We love it."
B000VU2SW2 What do you get when you combine a bumbling geek with hard hitting spies? A truly entertaining comedy/action/adventure, sure to satisfy most geeks and non-geeks alike. Will the geek get the girl? Find out..."
B000VU2SW2 Based on the promos, this show didn't appeal to me at all.  But I downloaded the free pilot figuring I could always just delete it if it wasn't my cup of tea.  But I found that I liked the main character and although the premise is unlikely, so are most TV shows, if you think about it.Its really more of a drama that has humor, rather than a comedy with drama (if that makes any sense).I will watch this one."
B000VU2SW2 stupid show, stupid plots, some actors made it fun, sort of.who bought this thing for the network?  Are they still employed?"
B000VU2SW2 \"Chuck\" was one of the outstanding new shows of the 2007-2008 TV season.  It is a nicely balanced combination of action, spy spoof, and romantic comedy, featuring an outstanding cast and some sharp writing.  \"Chuck: The Complete First Season\" contains all thirteen episodes from a strike-shortened season, and some nice extra features.The premise: Chuck Bartkowski (Zachary Levi) is a twenty-something computer geek working for the BuyMore, a big-box electronics store in L.A.  He shares an apartment with his loving older sister Ellie (Sarah Lancaster) and her hunky doctor boyfriend.  His life has been stuck in neutral since being kicked out of Stanford, framed for cheating by a roommate who also stole his girlfriend.  One day, Chuck gets an email from his old roommate, which mysteriously implants a secret intelligence database known as the Intersect inside his head.Suddenly, Chuck must lead a double-life,  By day, he labors in the BuyMore with his offbeat co-workers, including his slacker best buddy Morgan Grimes (Joshua Gomez).  By night, and sometimes by day, he is a CIA asset.  He is \"handled\" by CIA agent Sarah Walker (attractive Australian actress Yvonne Strahovski) and hardnosed NSA assassin Major John Casey (Adam Baldwin).The Intersect causes Chuck to \"flash\" on various passing clues, prompting a weeky mission to foil some villian and his or her dastardly plot.  Invariably, the untrained and inept Chuck is told to \"wait in the car\" while Sarah and Casey pursue the bad guys.  Also invariably, Chuck ventures from the car and either needs rescuing or bumbles his way into rescuing his handlers.  Even though played tongue in cheek, the action sequences can get quite tense.At the heart of the series is the slowly evolving relationship between Chuck and Sarah, who as cover for her role as bodyguard, poses as his girlfriend.  For the totally smitten Chuck, this pseudo relationship is \"complicated.\"  The highly professional Sarah is not quite able to avoid developing feelings for the good hearted, decent and loyal Chuck.  Their efforts to pass off their relationship in front of Chuck's family and co-workers are the source of endless comedy and some genuinely touching moments.\"Chuck: The Complete First Season\" is very highly recommended as outstanding entertainment, just a little reminiscent of the old \"Get Smart\" series in an updated way.  Chuck has been renewed for a full second season of 22 episodes; the action and the romantic comedy continue."
B000VU2SW2 NBC's CHUCK is such a welcome surprise and one of the best and funniest TV shows I've seen in a while, something which normally is an omen for immediate cancellation (but, thankfully, NBC picked it up for the full season). CHUCK achieves that heady mix of humor, action, espionage, and even a dash of romance (or pining, to be more exact). And it'll have you rooting for the nerd hero Chuck Bartowski, the physically hapless but nonetheless invaluable new member of the U.S. secret agent fraternity. Whereas, before, Chuck was someone who for thrills lived life vicariously thru video games and films, he's all of a sudden forced to cope with experiencing the very intense real thing.Several SPOILERS follow.The 411 on the premise and plot: A rogue CIA agent, just before being killed, downloads a wealth of top secret government files into the brain of his old college roommate Chuck Bartowski, a seemingly disastrous choice at first blush. Chuck is a social misfit, a computer geek who toils at the Nerd Herd electronics department of the Buy More supermarket. His support system consists of his best bud Morgan, who's even more of a loser than Chuck, and Chuck's lovely, protective sister Ellie (Sarah Lancaster), who is perpetually concerned for him and his lack of a social life. That Chuck lives with Ellie and her laid back boyfriend, Captain Awesome, doesn't exactly win him points with the cool set. But, for Chuck, things are about to change.Chuck meets Sarah Walker (Yvonne Strahovski), who seems to really like him. But Sarah is really a CIA agent sent to wrest the stolen intel from him. Finding out that the top secret data is imbedded in his noggin, she is then assigned to keep tabs on him. To do so, Sarah works at Wienerlicious and poses as Chuck's chica. Meanwhile, the NSA trots out its top operative, the no-nonsense John Casey (the awesome Adam Baldwin), who as cover hires on as a Buy More sales clerk.Nowadays, danger and intrigue lurk at every corner for Chuck Bartowski, who finds himself leading a double life and is now sometimes referred to as the Intersect (mostly by Casey). He speedily proves his value when the data in his brain enables him to put two and two together and uncover an assassination attempt. Soon, he's tangling with ninjas, shadowy agents, terrorists, and bombs - and that's just in the first episode. Further shows would unveil even greater peril and more mystery. Seeds of distrust are sown as Chuck also struggles with the constant hedging and fabrication brought on by his CIA and NSA minders. More importantly, despite obstacles put up by his nemesis, the evil Asian dude Harold Tang (okay, he's not really evil...but he's bald), Chuck's trying out for the assistant manager gig at the Buy More. Good luck, Chuck.End SPOILERS.CHUCK is a consistently funny, funny show doubling as a straight-up spy thriller. There are plenty of slick, potent action sequences, but the heart of the series is the comic fish-out-of-water premise of the geek caught in serious cloak-and-dagger environs. The show provides a steady dosage of nerd/slacker humor which always has me smiling for the duration of the episodes. And, instead of Chuck suddenly developing kung fu skills, the series makes sure that Chuck remains inept and a bit cowardly (Chuck would prefer to refer to it as being \"prudent\"). Zachary Levi as Chuck is wonderfully straight-faced yet has that comic timing down pat. He's very sympathetic as a guy whose big heart is shyly on his sleeve.Which leads us to another focal point of the show: Chuck's tentative relationship with the beautiful Sarah, who as a spy is forever on her guard and who's still grieving over her recent past with a fellow agent. But there's a connection between her and our favorite Nerd Herder, as Sarah realizes that Chuck really is a most decent dude. But only time will tell if it pans out. Australian Yvonne Strahovski is well cast as the lethal and accomplished secret agent, who can kick enemy agent heinie even a she dances sensuously with a clueless partner (yes, that would be Chuck). Yet Strahovski, when called for, can lend a torn, vulnerable air to her calculating superspy (check out \"Chuck versus the Nemesis\" to see just how conflicted she becomes). And, holy ministrone, she's hot! On the other hand, I don't think the looming Adam Baldwin is hot, but he's one of my favorite dudes to watch on TV. Fans of Joss Whedon will remember Baldwin from his memorable recurring roles in ANGEL and FIREFLY. Here, he makes for an intimidating sales clerk and government spy.I am currently in solid geek heaven with CHUCK. Here's hoping NBC continues to support this show for a busload of seasons. Here's to Chuck (and friends) waging war against irate Buy More patrons, staving off calculating co-workers, and also fending off some of the most diabolical enemies of America, mom, and apple pie. And all that while shouldering the stigma of a dead-end job. Way to go, Chuck!"
B000VU2SW2 New original shows like Chuck, Reaper and Pushing Daisies made tv worth watching last season despite the writer's strike. Despite bad movies in 2007 having Chuck in the title \"Good Luck Chuck, Chuck and Larry\", a tv show named Chuck was a success. It's about a normal guy named Chuck (Zachary Levi) who works at a Best Buy type store called Buy More. His life changes when he inadvertently downloads critical government secrets into his brain. Two agents get assigned to protect him. One is a sexy woman who he instantly has a big crush on named Sarah (Yvonne Strahovski). As his luck would have it, she also gets assigned to pose as his g/f. While pretending though, he's not even allowed to date anyone else. She's who he wants anyway but he can't really date her either.While the under-rated and always cool tough guy Adam Baldwin plays the other agent assigned to protect Chuck. Levi, Strahovski and Baldwin all work well together. It's Joshua Gomez though who sometimes steals the show as Chuck's best friend Morgan and who's also a co-worker of his. Chuck has a hard time hiding from his family and friends that he's working with the CIA.The show always has many twists and turns while often being very funny as well. It's probably one of the best comedy/spy shows to ever hit television. Probably the only bad thing about this season is that it ended early due to writer's strike and doesn't have a season finale. If you missed it when it was on, I recommend getting the first season."
B000VU2SW2 This is one of the better series to have appeared lately. Chuck is one of the Nerd Herd at Buy More who gets the complete memory of a supercomputer downloaded into his brain. He ends up being chased and protected by some secret agents, one who of course is a pretty blonde. You see the thing. But while this might have been a complete failure, the creators of the series have managed to come up with one of the successes of TV of lately."
B000VU2SW2 Chuck Bartowski's (Zachary Levi) life was going no where fast.  True, he is head of the Nerd Herd at his local Buy More.  But he lives with his sister Ellie (Sarah Lancaster) and her boyfriend Devon (aka Captain Awesome, played by Ryan McPartlin).  His best friend is Morgan (Joshua Gomez), a fellow nerd who also works at Buy More.But things change drastically when Chuck gets an e-mail from former friend Bryce Larkin.  The e-mail contains all the files of the intersect, the complete intelligence files of both the CIA and the NSA.  And, to make things more exciting, Bryce has destroyed the original files.All the information gets downloaded into Chuck's brain, making him a highly valuable government secret.  So valuable that he has two bodyguards, Sarah Walker (Yvonne Strahovski), a CIA agent who pretends to be Chuck's girlfriend, and John Casey (Adam Baldwin), a NSA who moves in next door to Chuck and takes a job at Buy More.Whenever Chuck sees something from the intersect, he flashes on more information.  Unfortunately, these flashes are at random and uncontrollable.  And Los Angeles seems to be a hot bed of activity.  Even with two agents guarding him, Chuck finds himself in over his head with his new life as a spy.  Can he survive and keep his secret?Yeah, yeah, I know what you're thinking.  The premise sounds unbelievable.  And if you stop and think about it, it is.  Fortunately, the show never gives you time to think.  They cram everything into these episodes.  There's action and intrigue, developing storylines involving the intersect and Chuck's past, romance with Sarah that she is not willing to admit is there, and plenty of laughs.  Many of the laughs come from the sub-plots focused on the Buy More.  But we also get laughs from Chuck's reaction to his new world.But in case this all sounds disjointed, let me assure you it works beautifully.  Everything is balanced and blended so that it seamlessly flows from one event to the next.  And the characters are outstanding.  Honestly, that is what holds all of this together.  Even gruff Casey is fun when it comes down to it.If, by some chance, you missed this show when it premiered last fall, correct that now.  You'll be hooked by the time the second episode is over and watching them as fast as you can.  Personally, I can hardly wait for season 2 to start."
B000VU2SW2 I do enjoy this show, but it would have to group it among my guilty pleasures. The tone is somewhat uneven and the show does fail to provide those moments that will make you have to watch the next week. A bit campy at times, which does he
B000VU2SW2 I really enjoy Chuck. He is Everyman, caught up in situations beyond his sphere of experience. But Chuck rises to every occasion--often with fear and trembling--and somehow survives. The cast, many of whom were new to me, is great."
B000VU2SW2 The first season of Chuck is something you don't see on TV everyday. They have combined humor and action in a way that keeps everything fresh. It's the right balance, and they have the right actors to keep the material exciting. Zachary Levi is the only person I can see in the lead role now. I had never heard of the guy before watching Chuck, but without him the show wouldn't be half as good. Having Adam Baldwin of Firefly and Serenity fame is a nice bonus, not to mention Yvonne Strahovski (try saying that one) as Chuck's super spy partner. The stories are a bit silly at times, but this show is just a blast to watch. For pure entertainment value, this one ranks high on my TV shows I don't miss list."
B000VU2SW2 If you want an awesomely funny everyman show, pop this one in the DVD player, sit back and just enjoy the absurdity, emotion and action."
B000VU2SW2 ... but I can't think of anything to add that hasn't already been said.  It's a wonderful show, a clever blend of humor, romance, and action.  Great acting, great characters, etc.  I'm writing this mostly because I've been re-reading Cerebus and I just had to give 5 stars to a show I bet Dave Sim doesn't like.  Hehehe."
B000VU2SW2 The show is great.  It's geeky but not too geeky, it's funny but serious and action packed too.  I like the casting, Chuck is great.This episode sets up the premise for the entire series well and I can't wait to see what the rest of the season holds.  I'll be setting up a season pass for this one!"
B000VU2SW2 Charles \"Chuck\" Bartowski is an average guy working in the electronics department of the local BuyMore - average job, average friends, average life. He lives with his sister Ellie and her boyfriend Devon, and though both are lovely and supportive, the fact that they're both doctors (and that Devon is aptly-nicknamed \"Captain Awesome\") means that they're a constant reminder of Chuck's inability to get his life together. He's still hung-up over getting kicked out of university after his best friend Bryce Larkin framed him for cheating on an exam - and stole his girlfriend along the way.But then one day, completely out of the blue, Chuck gets an e-mail from Bryce. He opens it, and unwittingly has an entire database of government secrets downloaded into his head. Turns out that Bryce was a rogue spy for the CIA, and the last thing he managed to do before his death was send the stolen file to Chuck's computer.Now whenever he sees someone or something that's connected to international espionage, he has \"flashes\" that warn him of various criminals, terrorists and assassins in his midst (of which there seems to be a surprising amount in his neighbourhood). Enter Sarah Walker and John Casey. The former is a CIA agent that's been sent to find the missing data by feigning romantic interest in him, only to release that it's hidden within Chuck's brain. The latter is an intimidating NSA operative (and the man who shot Bryce) who is incredulous at the thought a man like Chuck could have a super-computer implanted in his brain.The two of them are relegated to monitoring Chuck (Casey as a BuyMore sales clerk, Sarah in the Wienerlicious across the road), occasionally drawing him into operations when they're in need of the specialized information stored inside his head. Just to add a little intrigue to the proceedings, Sarah poses as Chuck's girlfriend - given that she's stunning, all of Chuck's family and co-workers think he's hit the jackpot.Needless to say, you'll need to suspend your disbelief if you're going to enjoy \"Chuck\". MoreGet SmartthanSpooks, moreJames BondthanThe Bourne Identity, this show plays around with the spy genre, infusing it with comedy, action-sequences, pratfalls, wisecracks and romantic complications. Most of the premise is based on Chuck's fish-out-of-water experiences in the world of espionage, and thankfully the writers don't feel the need to turn him into an expert any time soon. Armed with only his technological know-how and sheer dumb luck, Chuck occasionally gets to save the day, though the heroics are usually left to the professionals.It's only in the relationships that things are taken a bit more seriously. Chuck pines for Sarah, but she has a dark history of her own that's gradually revealed over the course of the thirteen-episode first season. Comic relief characters such as Morgan Grimes (Chuck's best friend) and Captain Awesome are given moments of pathos and three-dimensionality. Chuck's relationship with his beloved sister is strained when his double-life starts interfering with hers. And eventually it transpires that there was more to Chuck's expulsion from university than he first realized.\"Chuck\" managed to survive the Writer's Strike and went on to run for five seasons, bourn up by the breezy writing and the versatile acting. Australian Yvonne Strahovski is a real beauty, but manages to combine the lethal efficiency of her character with a real warmth and vulnerability, whilst Adam Baldwin was a shoe-in for the role of John Casey (he's basically slightly-less psychotic version of Jayne fromFirefly). Sarah Lancaster is a joy as Chuck's older sister, and Joshua Gomez manages to make Morgan's obsession with Chuck's life not quite as creepy as it sounds. But it's really Zachary Levi that carries the show as the sweet-natured, in-over-his-head Chuck, who is simultaneously delighted and terrified by the new direction his life has taken.It's all tailor-made escapism for your average twenty-something nerd, in which a shy and self-effacing everyman is treated to wild adventures and a gorgeous love interest, but with an overarching plot that plasters over some of the more one-off silliness."
B000VU2SW2 Warning!  Spoilers!CHUCK VERSUS THE NEMESIS is the latest in a string of very nice episodes.  I've not been charmed by everything in this series.  There are fans of the show who love Morgan and those who utterly detest him.  I'm of the latter camp.  And early in the season I almost gave up on the show due to the series initial emphasis on standalone episodes couples with more Morgan than I could tolerate.  But there has been slightly less Morgan (a little of him goes a very, very, very long way) and far more in the way of a serial structure to the show.  As a result, my interest has gone up sharply.This episode picks up from the previous one, in which Sarah kissed Chuck, only to discover that her former lover/CIA partner Bryce was still alive.  Obviously, this complicates everything.  I'll keep the spoilers light except to add that the episode ends with Sarah being forced to choose between staying on her assignment with Chuck or going off with Bryce.  Given that she has a longterm contract on the show, there isn't a great deal of tension.  The question obviously isn't whether Sarah will end up staying, but under what conditions.I'm coming to like this show more and more as the ongoing story continues.  I'm really delighted that it has not persisted in offering nothing but standalone episodes.  I've mentioned in many reviews that the one massive advantage TV has over the movies is the serial format.  A TV series can develop a narrative and provide character development that no movie ever made can even remotely hope to match.  Shows that turn their backs on that natural superiority of TV to movies do not receive my respect."
B000VU2SW2 I enjoyed the first episode (pilot) of Chuck when it first aired on NBC. I became a fan and watched it until the show ended. Season one was one of the best seasons and I am glad I own it."
B000VU2SW2 There's everything in the world to love about this series - great plotline, excellent character development, witty dialogue, great soundtrack, and incredibly inventive premise.  All of the actors from the primary players to the support cast does an excellent job.Chuck - the leader of the Nerd Herders at the Buy More gets an email from his former college roommate.  The email downloads a super computer into Chuck's brain.  Suddenly Chuck (a likable but aimless college dropout) becomes one of the CIA's most important assets.  To protect Chuck the CIA and NSA bring in two specialists - Sarah and John Casey.  The entire series becomes what happens to a normal old, every day guy when something really extraordinary drops into his life.  Throw in a little spy danger, some romance, and some crazy family and friends and you've got Chuck."
B000VU2SW2 This show at first looked a bit laughable to me, but I assure you this is a well conceived series. All the actors have been chosen with great care, and they interact with one another as though they had been working with eachother their entire lives. They have great chemistry in every scene, it's like they're best friends in real life. The show has alot of comedy which is only broken up by action and dramatic story telling. What I love about the show is it's many references to movies, television, and video games. Chuck is not James Bond, not even close in fact. It is hilarious watching him try to fit into the world of espionage. He does have two bodyguards Sarah and Casey to protect him. Sarah is a beautiful blonde agent that is sent to be his girlfriend (lucky guy), and Casey is the heavy artillery side of the team. It's really fun to see Chucks and Sarah's relationship grow throughout the season. They clearly have great chemistry and that leads to some romantic moments. It's sorta like on LOST with Jack and Kate you know they want to be with each other but the plot dictates otherwise just teasing you here and there. Chuck also has a best friend Morgan who is responsible for most of the laughs as we watch his pathetic life, and the way he clings to Chuck's every move. Chuck and his family really keep the show grounded and really relatable to the every day guy. This show began well and only got better in season 2.The picture quality is another thing all together. It has grain in almost every frame. The picture is just filled with noise almost the entire time. It really is distracting and is quite disappointing. Chuck surpasses the picture quality with it's amazing characters and stories. The extras are decent with some deleted scenes, a gag reel, and audition footage.  The series is a mix of Alias, Mission Impossible, and Get Smart. It is the ultimate comedy hour mixed with great action."
B000VU2SW2 Yes, my inner-geek rejoiced minutes into the first episode of Chuck:S1, with the reference to Prince's \"Batdance\" song.  Constant pop-culture references are just one of the things that makes Chuck about the best show on TV and probably too smart to last very long.The cast is fantastic: from Chuck himself to Big Mike, Captain Awesome, Morgan, and even the cameo roles, everyone is well written with depth. Adam Baldwin is one of the most underappreciated comedic actors in Hollywood. Its a damn funny show, but more than that, it includes a little bit of everything, from suprisingly solid action to a dab of romance.My main worry is how long they can sustain the show's formula, from Chuck's memory flashes/missions to the tension between he and Yvonne Strahovski.  But I will be there for the whole ride."
B000VU2SW2 Based on all the 5-star reviews, I bought Season 1.  Watched it and holy bejemus was I shocked!  This show is horrible, people!!!!  What the heck show are you watching???  First, the story is way way way over-the-top unbelievable.  Chuck becomes a national security asset and CIA and NSA agents just randomly take up minimum wage jobs near him to, what, protect him?  And why wouldn't the CIA girl, Sarah, take a job INSIDE the Buy More?  Why is she all the way across the parking lot at a stupid hot dog shop where she can't even see him?  You take a job to protect someone you can't see????  And then Chuck just totally randomly \"flashes\" on people and things that he just randomly runs across and that randomly starts each super retarded and super lame random \"adventure\"????  The actors (and characters) are horrible across the board, all of them boring, unfunny and uninteresting.  The show is not funny in the least.  I mean Big Bang Theory, yeah, that's a 5-star show--great characters, great actors, funny as heck, witty, solid stories.  Chuck by comparison has none of those things and is truly a bottom-of-the barrel 1-star show."
B000VU4GW2 The premise is not something I remember being done before now. It  has been brought to life with consumate skill by Damian Lewis and Sarah Sahi as well as Adam Arkin.Watch it and decide for yourself."
B000VU4GW2 It is a catchy plot line similar to The Finder. I enjoy the mind games Crews comes up with. The plots were good and kept me interested."
B000VU4GW2 Riding the Band of Brothers wave of Fame Damian Lewis is great.  This was a great show.  Loved the cast.  Fun to watch the actors work together.  This show, like many, was not given a chance when it was on NBC.  From what I heard many did not care for Crews' flakiness but that was part of what made the show unique from all the other cop shows.  Well worth the watch."
B000VU4GW2 Often you have to give new shows a while to warm up,  and episode 4 or 5 is much better than the pilot.  But Life really knocks it out of the park from the first episode and it doesn't go downhill at all.  I'm so sorry that this series didn't really make it,  because I loved it. Charlie Crews is a fascinating character, complex,  striving.  I loved the 'Zen' theme.  The series as a whole has 2 streams - the overarching who set up Charlie and killed his friends,  and the week to week cases and both are excellent.Watch it, you'll want to watch the rest."
B000VU4GW2 good premise for plot. the actors are believable in their roles. action is high paced and keeps me interested in remaining connected."
B000VU4GW2 Great casting.Fascinating lead character and gripping plots as well as an interesting background story unfolding..I can't wait for the next episode."
B000VU4GW2 This is a good series with Damien Lewis, of &#34;Homeland&#34; fame, playing a former LAPD police officer, who returns to the force after having been wrongly imprisoned for twelve years.  He's received millions of dollars for his false imprisonment, but rejoins the force to track down those who set him up.  It appears that there are only two seasons, but we are enjoying it."
B000VU4GW2 Unique show. Can't wait to see how season 1 ends."
B000VU4GW2 Life Season 1 has great characters, excellent acting, and a plot that keeps you wanting to go on to the next episode.  Season 2 is every bit as fascinating."
B000VU4GW2 However, its uncanny and somewhat bizarre cases in Southern California become  a bit much on a regular basis.  Nevertheless, the theme of a law enforcement officer's return after having spent twelve years in prison for a crime he was later cleared of, is entertaining. I rate it four stars."
B000VU4GW2 A lighthearted detective series with well played characters.  Even though it concerns murders the show is full of lighthearted dialog.and the characters work work together."
B000VU4GW2 My wife and I watched all of Seasons 1 and 2, and found them to be entertaining, funny, and very enjoyable.  I particularly liked the fact that the show represented two people, acting as partners, who found each other interesting, but not sexually irresistable.  I was very sorry to learn that there was nothing after Season 2.  Surprising.  I would have thought that finding sponsors for this show would have been easy.  Maybe too many Christians afraid of Zen."
B000VU4GW2 This show is a little dark - the premise being a cop spends 12 years in jail for a crime he did not commit.  Although he is awarded big bucks when he is freed, he goes back on the job.  He is not welcomed back.  I think this is probably true to life.  The acting is good.  I do not care for the female head honcho...  I think she had something to do with the original setup."
B000VU4GW2 I will be so shocked if NBC doesn't do a season 3, this is such a fantastic show. This is a quality show. I adore a quirky, unique charachter (but not in a Monk way, ugh). This show is fantastic, wonderful actors and superb writting. I've seen every episode and will be buying the DVDs for my collection."
B000VU4GW2 Who was Damian Lewis anyhow?  W O W what a dynamic character as Detective Charlie Crews in the TV series &#34;Live.&#34;  NBC really dropped the ball by letting this series go with only two seasons.  NBC blames the 2007-2008 Writers Guild strike by cutting the first season to only 11 episodes.  NBC started the second season on Monday then flipped it to Friday, back to Monday, then back to Friday and eventually to Wednesdays I think.  I loved it but I couldn't find it most of the time.  There are 21 episodes for the second and sadly last season of &#34;LIFE.&#34;  Regardless, we have an albeit short first season but it is a block buster.  LIFE is a show that should have been a multi-season series.  NBC was harassed by idiot reviewers who couldn't see through their thick glassed windows having been scratched by watching too much TV for their prior reviews.  LIFE is and will always be a classic.  Damian Lewis and Sarah Shahi has a 'pop your eyes out' magnetic on screen performances.  The best recurring actor was Garret Dillahunt as Roman Nevikov.  Roman is the greatest hope for a TV nemesis ever.  Introduced in the first season, you will find him back in full force in season two.  They did wrap up the series successfully in season two.  When the final episode &#34;One&#34; aired April 8, 2009, the music was remarkable.  Thankfully, I had the episode recorded so I could identify the songs. Soon, I learned that the DVDs and all future airings of the last episode would never have the original songs.  Today, when you watch the last episode &#34;One&#34; you will find the ending flat due to the ridiculous faux pas of NBCs license for the songs. None-the-less, LIFE is a spectacular &#34;32-episode&#34; series that will always be in the hearts of viewers who worked hard to find it."
B000VU4GW2 This is a good show and the only thing I don't like is there are so few episodes.  The character is very Zen but he wields a lot of power.  He is played well by the actor.  Sorry, I am very poor at remembering names but the show is very good."
B000VU4GW2 Charlie Crews trough Damian Lewis approaches detective work through a combination of intelligence, in zen. Wrongfully imprisoned the shows always has a great lead case and solving his own is advanced. It is the greatest shame this show was not picked up ongoing. I&#8217;ve watched it 3 times since it was cancelled."
B000VU4GW2 Discovered this quite by accident and watched the entire season in one weekend.  Love the interaction between Crewes and Reese and the mystery within a mystery concept."
B000VU4GW2 Life has a good pace, is clever and ironic, with likable characters. It is not the nasty bloodbath you see in so many shows these days."
B000VU4GW2 I like the scripts but am not sure about the lead actor..sometimes I like his acting but I think it would be betterif he was a little more sarcastic. I know he has gottenvery wise in mind and body but with knowledge comes asense of humor and I would love to see him go just a littlebit more into what he is hinting at now...just a little more sarcasticafter all he has earned that no matter how grounded he hasbecome...The scripts are full of it I just wish he would take a littlemore advantage with the delivery..It needs that ZING!!! Forgiving isfine but complacent is just too much to ask..I'm thinking..But that's just me.."
B000VU4GW2 Compelling, funny moments, great characters, excellent casting & performances. Really good writing! Just finished my second run through this season. I don't often replay episodics, but this one is THAT GOOD!"
B000VU4GW2 I haven't watched TV in years-got fed up with the high cost-low return from the various cable/satellite companies available.  I do watch some of the shows available online offered by the different networks on their sites. Amazon happened to offer the first episode of Life free.  Free is a good thing and also a great way to gain viewers like myself.  I am hooked.  \"Life\" is not your run of the mill cop show.  Charlie is not your run of the mill cop.  I own season 1 on DVD and have already pre-ordered season 2(have to love Amazon's price guarantee)and season 2 is a must see and in my case must own.  If you haven't seen Life you haven't lived."
B000VU4GW2 Quirky, clever, and very satisfying, Life is an excellent police procedural that takes place in Los Angeles. LAPD detective partners Crews and Reese are perfect foils, seeming opposites that play off each other's best and worst personality traits in such a way that the viewer ends up liking both characters, a difficult feat. Actors Lewis and Shahi do an excellent job. Lewis' American accent is spot on, and Shahi (a very beautiful woman) does the tough-cop, no-nonsense, recovering addict role just right. Other characters/actors are also great. Although I wanted the series to go on and on (it was cancelled), please don't be hesitant to watch the 2 seasons that are available. The underlying mystery, developed a little at a time through each episode, is satisfyingly (if perhaps not completely) resolved at the end. I watched the last episode last night, and I'm a little sad now. I will miss Crews and Reese."
B000VU4GW2 A story that lets you follow without complications or convoluted stories. Easy to get hooked. a different anti-hero but very entertaining."
B000VU4GW2 This is definitely one of the most interesting and intriguing crime dramas I have seen in a long time.Too bad it only lasted two seasons.  I love the main character with his Zen philosophy, which made for some very nice creative lines from the writers."
B000VU4GW2 I never saw this promoted on TV and I wish it had been more popular so there were additional seasons. It's unique and funny. It is an unusual, almost unbelievable storyline but it unfolds in such a way that - if you stay with it - you become hooked. At least I did. I want to know more about why this cop ended up in prison, what's with him and his lawyer, his partner, his exwife and just about everyone else he knew and meets up with. Damien Lewis' character is definitely a contradiction. One of the things I don't like is the repetitive interviews with people about what they think of the cop going to jail. It's seldom new, they keep playing the same stuff over and over. That is a bit annoying. But the series and the actors are great. Adam Arkin has a quirky part, very similar to the character he played on Northern Exposure and equally effective."
B000VU4GW2 Loved it on TV but missed some episodes. Was nice to be able to watch the whole thing. Don't know why they didn't keep it going."
B000VU4GW2 I like how off the wall the show was.  It was very entertaining.  I have shared this show with several friends."
B000VU4GW2 So far I enjoyed watching, very funny sometimes.12 more words required, this is why I don;t review more often,what is wrong with my first line."
B000VU4GW2 This is a wry and dry entertainment that is quite good and enjoyable to watch. The only quarrel I have with it is that 43 minutes (give or take) is too little to tell a story that doesn't rely  entirely on bang-bang with guns or words. The star, Damian Lewis, is just right for the part, (or the part was written to be just right for him),  carrying off the role of the police officer who served a wrongful dozen years in prison, with a proper mix of the fey and the aggressive in pursuit of the  real killer in that case, as well as the cases now assigned to him. As his new partner on the police force,  Sarah Shahi, nicely fills the role of the more aggressive of the two, without descending into the current curse for policewomen (and other females in authority positions) on television: over aggressiveness, arrogance, a constant in your face attitude and superwoman command of every means of physical aggression. They are tiresome; her trimmed down version makes a good counterpart to the completely laid back Lewis. Adam Arkin, makes and excellent but not obtrusive ex-con buddy fo Lewis. He hits the special demands of that buddy role, present but never over-shadowing the star, just right.So, season  one, a good start for what could be a long lasting show."
B000VU4GW2 unlike anything else you've ever seen anywhere.ahead of it's time.funny and deep at the same time.season 1 was short because of the WGA strike and the show never found it's audience.  for a show this different, one and a half seasons wasn't enough."
B000VU4GW2 \"Life: Season One\" is something completely different in a police procedural.  Charlie Crews is an L.A. cop who spent 12 years in prison for a mass murder for which he was framed.  Sprung from prison by a crusading attorney, Crews is back on the police force with a promotion to detective and a multi-million dollar legal settlement.The show operates on several levels.  Charlie Crews must readjust to life on the outside, where there is sunshine, fresh fruit, unfamiliar technology, and a large empty mansion to live in.  His wife and his former life are gone, although not entirely.  He approaches his new job from a unique angle, shaped by the Zen philosophy he adopted to survive inside.The police force has decidedly mixed feelings about his return; his new partner, Dani Reese, is a recovering substance abuser under pressure from their chain of command to find a excuse to get rid of him. She is also the daughter of a retired policeman who may have been responsible for Charlie's frame-up.The cases in each episodes would be fairly ordinary but for Charlie's Zen angle, which allows him both insight and compassion. In one heartwrenching confrontation, Charlie is forced to shoot an armed and dangerous suspect, then comforts the dying man by convincing him he is only having a bad dream.Charlie's secret crusade to unravel the conspiracy that put him in jail gives him ruthless enemies who seem uncannily aware of his every move.  Each episode teeters on the knife-edge tension that Charlie can be sent back to jail or even killed if he gets too close to the truth.  Charlie gets help from his former cellmate, a white collar criminal; his attorney, who dangerously mixes a professional and a personal relationship with Charlie; and his ex-wife, who has considerable guilt over divorcing Charlie in prison.\"Life: Season One\" is very highly recommended as a different kind of police procedural.  British actor Damian Lewis carries off Charlie Crews with a grounded, offbeat charm.  The early episodes are a little jarring, counterpointing Charlie's new life with the one he lost.  However, the series settles into a good rythmn, building to a hard-hitting season finale."
B000VU4GW2 i liked the flow of the show, loved the way that Diann, and Charlie were together...Didn't like the parting of the two....Why did they not have a season 3....on the last show of season 2, you are left hanging....Not good...."
B000VU4GW2 the lead character is definitely different and at times I don't think all of his elevators are on the same floor, But it isn't bad and a good alternative to the same old, same old stuff they put on TV"
B000VU4GW2 A little too quirky sometimes for us experienced TV detective show watchers-- still enjoyable, just outside the realm of realistic. The female partner is, disappointingly, a weak link."
B000VU4GW2 A different kind of a movie. The story unfolds a little more with each episode. I will watch season two."
B000VU4GW2 One season is not enough. Great concept of a wrongfully convicted man being released back into his old life. I loved how he used what he learned in prison to better live in the free world. Great cop show."
B000VU4GW2 We really enjoyed every minute of this show!!  The acting was great and the story line sure keeps you interested.  We are looking forward to watching Season 2."
B000VU4GW2 This is another man's search for himself in which the hero,  Crews, goes to great lengths to eradicate the evil that harmed him.  The series is too long.  It should have been a mini-series."
B000VU4GW2 I just sort of stumbled onto this show, was pretty hooked after the pilot, each episode got better and better. I really enjoyed the multi-plot format, wittiness, twists & turns, and for the most part, I was surprised. Kept watching episode after episode, 3 am, time for bed! LOL Too bad there weren't more than 2 seasons."
B000VU4GW2 I found this show very interesting...only seen 3 episodes so far but I've enjoyed the storylines. I would recommend it"
B000VU4GW2 This program was excellent in both character development and plot.  The interlocking quest of the main character throughout all episodes and the obvious faults of all three chief role players kept one's interest right through to the end of season two and leaves one hoping for more.  Why such a superior show as Life should discontinue production after two seasons while meaningless senselessness goes on season after season after season is an intellectual puzzlement."
B000VU4GW2 Prison changes a man, and it certainly changed former LAPD police officer Charlie Crews. From 1995 to 2007 he served hard time for murders he didn't commit. When DNA evidence surfaces proving his innocence, Crews is released and reinstated in the force (he also lands some serious settlement money). Now Detective Crews finds himself working with a new partner even as he covertly seeks answers to what the hell happened.LIFE looks to be a very promising cop detective show, and not because the mysteries themselves are dynamite stuff or anything. No, the viewing addiction lies in watching the lead actor work his craft. Britisher Damian Lewis is simply fabulous as the wounded, brooding protagonist, trying to piece his life back together. It's fun watching Crews apply his askewed perspective on his cases. I'm normally not a fan of folks who sling zen about, but Lewis makes it such a quirky and integral part of his character. And if it's a loose cannon with an agenda slinging that zen, all the better. After all, zen helped Crews survive the penitentiary. I also like the little touches which remind us that Crews is still coping with his new found freedom, whether it's his habit of munching on fresh fruit (they never have fresh fruit in prison) or his preference for light and open air or the fact that he still doesn't have furniture in his home.Lewis's supporting cast is so-so. I do enjoy Sarah Shahi, who's a former Dallas Cowboy cheerleader. She plays the no-nonsense Dani Reese, Crews' new partner and not ecstatic about it. It's true that her character tends to fall in the generic character-saddled-with-demons category, so, yeah, nothing new from that angle. But I think she has very good chemistry with Damian Lewis, and I just love her bemused or irritated reactions to Crews' barrage of philosophical quirk. Two other actors who nicely play off Lewis are sexy Brooke Langton as Crews' smitten attorney and Adam Arkin as Crews' former inmate and current best friend and financial adviser.I like the show's use of interview clips. They reveal certain insights and usher several sub-plots into the light. We learn, for instance, that Crews' former partner didn't stand up for him and that Crews' beautiful wife had divorced him while he was serving out his time. We even get a teeny whiff of the conspiracy surrounding Crews' frame-up. More layers and foreshadowings, thanks to these interview clips.SPOILERS now.With the steady influx of crime drama on TV, I wasn't planning on tuning in to this show. Then the pilot changed my mind. Other standout episodes? \"Powerless\" is the powerful sixth episode, focusing on Dani as she pursues a rapist who'd been haunting her AA meetings. \"Farthingale\" (episode 8) is a fun one, an intriguing mystery which begins with a man having been half blown off by an exploding stove. Then there's the intense two-part, season closing story arc (episodes 10 & 11: \"Dig A Hole\" & \"Fill It Up\") as Crews finally tracks down the man who committed the murders for which he was incarcerated. In \"Dig A Hole\" we also get to see a showdown of sorts between Crews' new and former partners.SPOILERS end.I can't stress enough how good Damian Lewis is on this show. I remember him from HBO's great wartime mini-series,Band of Brothers, and he made big noise back then, too, and was even nominated for a Golden Globe (although he didn't win). Damian Lewis, with his complex performance here, elevates LIFE from a humdrum procedural into a riveting police drama. And since NBC has already indicated that this wonderful drama series will be picked up for a second season, well, LIFE is good."
B000VU4GW2 Once again, a unique show, with great writing and acting, is killed off before it has a chance to build an audience.  I somehow missed this show completely when it originally aired back in '07-'08.  This indicates to me how little this show had to have been promoted when it initially aired.  I discovered it only recently on streaming Netflix and I believe the second evening I began watching it I got so hooked I sat up watching episodes until nine o'clock the following morning.  I could not believe a network show this good only lasted two seasons and got such low ratings.  Damien Lewis and Sarah Shahi made for a great detective duo and each episode was incredibly well written with unique plot lines. I had never seen a show with so many great guest stars that I never seen anywhere else before. All facets of this show just screamed QUALITY and ORIGINALITY, but not surprisingly this meant a death knell for LIFE.  A similar type show with a similar fate was last years PRIME SUSPECT with Maria Bello.  It didn't even last a full season, I don't think.  So if you want to guarantee a brief tenure for your new show, simply hire quality actors and writers and it'll be gone before you know it.  Congrats again to you network execs!  And you wonder why your audiences have been decreasing year after year.  In the word(s) of Homer Simpson (AS WELL AS NETWORK PROGRAMMING EXPERTS).........DOH!!!!"
B000VU4GW2 ....trust me.  Is it perfect?  No.  But at 19.99 its a steal considering what is being charged for other formulaic cop shows of much lesser value."
B000VU4GW2 LIFE the tv series was only on two seasons, 2007-2009.  I missed it then and am soh so glad I found it now.  Just finished season one and will order season two.  So very well done.  Rand Ravich gets my kudos for a job well done.  LIFE is a cop show, centering on Det. Charlie Crews.  who is just released from a twelve year prison term, as new evidence clears him  His settlement, great wealth and be a cop again.  We follow week to week stories and Charlies quest to find out who set him up.  Very good supporting cast with Sarah Shabi as his partner and Adam Arkin, as friend and financial advisor, oh, a fellow con.  Try this series.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED."
B000VU4GW2 Not as good as I anticipated, probably since I saw Homeland first.  Still watching season 1 so maybe things will get better."
B000VU4GW2 I never heard of this show.  I watched the first episode. there was something different about it, not sure I liked it.  I had to watch a few more to see if I really cared about the show and the people in it.  I began to care about what was going to happen next--so I liked Life.  Lots of positive messages as well as you never know what is going to happen at any given moment.  Live your LIFE everyday-ON PURPOSE!"
B000VU4GW2 The lead character is interesting with his enlightened view of life.  The episodes drag a little with not very good writing."
B000VU4GW2 this series was a pleasant surprise - every segment we are reminded that this man spent over a decade behind bars and he craves light, fresh fruit and other small comforts we take for granted. Totally likeable, believable character in a harsh world of reality."
B000VU4GW2 A cop that spent 12 years in a hardcore prison who is then acquitted. He returns to work as a detective that has received a multi million lawsuit reward.Damian Lewis (of Homefront fame) , Sashi Shahi (of Fairly Legal) , and Adam Arkin give good performances in this all too short series set in LA. Good story lines throughout!!"
B000VU4GW2 This is a fantastic, compelling, thrilling show.....all the actors are seared onto the screen.....there are so many layers and plots, twists and turns......the prison/police work tension....it just all works very well !"
B000VU4GW2 I liked this show and wish it were still being produced. The lead character is a smart former policeman (detective) who was wrongfully convicted of a crime and served, what, 12 years in the pen until he was exonerated and released. He wins a wrongful conviction suit and becomes rich but goes back to being a policeman. He got through the time in the pen by learning and practicing zen and by being smart. Now he brings that smartness and zen quality to the job of detective. As he goes about his detective duties he is also trying to figure out who set him up for the conviction. It is quirky and unusual - a rich detective, who as a very different outlook on life, is smart, and brings a very unusual philosophy of life to his work. Highly entertaining lead character."
B000VU4GW2 Loved  it and bought Season 2 but slightly disappointed in the turn of events regarding the character inter-actions on Season 2."
B000VU4GW2 I love Damien Lewis; he was awesome in Band of Brothers. But everything else I've seen him in since, has failed to win me over including this new show which I wanted to like. His character (who gets out of prison for a murder he didn't do after 12 years,)is a cop who is quirky and spouts zen phiolosophy to his gorgeous partner all day. Either you like the main characters 'quirky' personality and will get into the show; or you won't which is what I experienced.In addition the flash back storytelling style grew tiresome quickly; Robin Weigert as his Captain and San Francisco Mayor Gavin Newsome's Wife (Jennifer Siebold)both good actors, play very unlikable characters. In fact only Adam Arkin as Damien's ex-con financial advisor, is 'normal' and enjoyable to watch here. A big disappointment as a summer replacement show; get \"Burn Notice\" instead--it's great!l"
B000VU4GW2 He was not the best choice for the part I do not think. Not the type to draw a lot of women to the show. It is like the heat of the night . They never figured out that all the women where tuning in to see Bubba not the star. lol My pop came in and said you gals watching Carol O conner and my mom and I both said at the same time No Bubba . and grinned at each other. And we had never said to each other that. lol"
B000VU4GW2 keeps my interest.  Pleased not to see a whole lot of fighting and car chases.  So far not recurring methdology being played out."
B000VU4GW2 Damian Lewis plays a good part.. I enjoyed most of the story lines not to heavy, and no bad language..such a nice feature."
B000VU4GW2 a little offbeat gets better as it moves along, not totally realistic butsome interesting plots. will be interesting to see what happens."
B000VU4GW2 A little quirky at times.  The lead character is definitely quirky but in a good way.  The homicides can be a little quirky and weird but it makes for an interesting show.  The characters are strong and the actors are good.  Sad to see only 2 seasons to watch and nearly done with Season 2 but I've enjoyed it."
B000VU4GW2 Touching, transcendent, witty, snappy, thoughtful fun.  The female cop character is too mean, closed-minded, and coddled by all the males around her but Sarah Shahi performance is serviceable, and she is extremely pretty.  The Adam Arkin character is a total winner.The 2nd season's plot lines go off the rails, then the series was cancelled, but the first season of 'Life' is procedural perfection."
B000VU4GW2 I like the concept, actors are well cast and production values good.  Too bad there are only two seasons.  I can't wait to watch the next episode.  There is a new crime to solve plus the ongoing mystery of who is really guilty of the murders Mark (lead character, forgot his name) was sent to prison for.  I also like the bits of philosophy interjected throughout the show."
B000VU4GW2 Have only watched Season 1 so far, and I love this show! Damien Lewis is fantastic. I would loved to have been able to just sit and watch this show straight thru because it is that good, but I had to settle for watching it over about 2 weeks time. Can't wait to watch season 2!"
B000VU4GW2 The pile of manure being the innumerable other cop shows out there that do the same exact thing. How on earth do all of them have viewership's? They don't deserve them. They are fairly unoriginal.Not so with Life. It is delightful. The style and such of the cinematography is sleek but unique, a hard combination to come by.The writing is so much fun. One minute deadly serious. One minute laugh out loud funny. And always sharp no matter what.Acting is incredible in every way. Story is fun.Watch this instead of those other shows that are simply boring and tired."
B000VU4GW2 My wife and I had never heard of this series, but found it on Amazon Prime.  The male lead is recognizable from the hit cable series &#34;Homeland.&#34;  Yes, it's another cop detective drama and there's always a murder to solve.  But there are enough other quirky plot twists and the murders also have twists.  You find out right away that the male lead detective was himself framed and spent 12 years in prison for a murder he did not commit.  So these various parallel plots and plot twists keep it very interesting. The acting is good and there is also an element of humor.  So all in all, it is a very entertaining series that makes you want to keep watching it."
B000VU4GW2 This appeals to me because of the story inside the stories.  While the main character is working to clear his name he is also working to clear new cases.  And through it all  cannot see that he is being ripped off by his accountant/manager.  This is a 'Do I laugh or cry' show.  Justice is Blind but some people just keep banging their head against the steel door until it one or the other gives way."
B000VU4GW2 It started out very new and really different.  It just got better.  Like the &#34;people&#34; and also the &#34;police &#34; work was still brought into the storyline.  Do like to have more of that - and less of the personal &#34;stuff&#34; - not watching a &#34;soap&#34;.  Too bad the show apparently did notstay on long."
B000VU4GW2 I had watched part of the first episode a while back but decided against it for one reason or another and then I forgot about it.  Recently I saw it come up again and decided to give it a second chance.  Am I ever glad I did.  I love this show!  I really like the format of it - the way the characters' actions and dialogue are set up.  Adding Alan Arkin to the cast was an excellent choice.  He's such a good actor as is the main character Charlie, played by Damian Lewis, who plays this insightful man who is so grateful for the simple things in life having been in prison for many years for a crime he did not commit.  Very refreshing!"
B000VU4GW2 Plots for individual episodes are average. Dynamics between the regular characters are high octane entertainment. Recurring theme of season is riveting--- who REALLY killed the people our hero was framed for. And how will they be brought to justice. And how will our hero survive all the conspiracy surrounding him in his quest to make things right?  Stayed tuned  keep watching. I will"
B000VU4GW2 I loved this show!  I watched the first season in sequence and then followed it w/ season 2.  This is another fine tv show that falls victim to corporate poor choices in not finding an audience to keep it on the air for more than 2 season.  Highly recommend."
B000VU4GW2 I felt that the new show &#34;Life&#34; was interesting. The pilot episode offers some background on a cop that was wrongly convicted of a crime. He is released and after negotiating a multi million dollar settlement with the Police Deaprtment goes back to work as a detective in the Police Department. He has a very zen approach to life and is trying to solve the crime for which he was convicted. His partner is a young woman that is a recovering addict. She has little patience for him and is suspect of his methods.Still, I found that the show was not compelling. I think it went over the top and released too much information on the first episode when they should have held back a little. Everyone loves a good mystery!Dani Reese's (the woman agent) emotional responses were confusing. On one hand, she has little patience for her new partner ready to disclose everything he does wrong to her superiors and at the end of the episode, protecting him. She seems overly emotional in some scenes and then stoic in others. She is a recovering addict. I would have disclosed Dani Reese's addiction history maybe a bit later. The show just needs better writing.Damian Lewis played his character well, if he was going for the quirky Zen guy. But, the way he speaks (an attempt by the writers to make him interesting) is not that compelling. He has no censor and that's ok. But, the writer's attempt is so transparent as to make every line that comes out of Crews (the main character played by Lewis) unbelievable.Claudia Black is a good actress, why they would recast her is beyond me."
B000VU4GW2 I was remarkably sorry to only see 2 seasons of this show. I enjoyed watching so much. I made a marathon and viewed both seasons over about 2 days. Fantastic and full of engaging acting. Lots of talent."
B000VU4GW2 Loved this series.  Interesting, different, wonderful performances and very well directed.  Couldn't ask for more.  Look forward very much to season 2!"
B000VU4GW2 This show was a real &#34;sleeper&#34;.  The main characters were excellent and played off each other very well.  It's to bad the series ended after 2 seasons."
B000VU4GW2 Stories on multiple levels, good characters and good timing. Peel an onion, Russian dolls, take your pick for how each episode advances multiple story lines. The cars add some metallic spice."
B000VU4GW2 The network that had &#34;Life&#34; must have kept it more secret and covered up than the Benghazi fiasco, which is why, without yet watching season 2, that they cancelled it prematurely.  I &#34;found&#34; &#34;Life&#34; backtracking from &#34;Fairly Legal&#34;, another secret show, staring Sarah Shahi... and what a surprise to find Damian Lewis was the actual star which interested me because of his staring work on &#34;Homeland&#34;.  So, seriously, I backtracked into Life from more current shows.  I ran into Fairly Legal on &#34;Cloo&#34; channel.  They had a &#34;marathon&#34; of Fairly Legal and I wasn't really paying attention at first and became more and more involved until I just loved that show.  I searched for it only to discover... as always, a wonderful little show had been tossed out just when it was really hitting its stride.  I've given up on &#34;networks&#34; being bright enough to keep quality shows so these days I skulk in the back roads of the internet searching for entertainment jewels.... LIFE!Life is based on Damian Lewis's character Charlie Crews who was framed for murder as a cop and spent 12 years in prison.  He's later freed by discovered DNA evidence and FREEDOM + giant financial settlement + back to work as a detective as a settlement. You'd think, &#34;all about revenge&#34; but that, so far, appears to be a background, almost silent thread.  Sarah Shahi's talents, acting skills, and drop dead gorgeous looks are largely wasted but she adds some great dramatic tension as &#34;Crews&#34; new partner, Dani Reese.So far (Amazon is nagging me to review before I've completed the 1st season) Crews and Reese go about each show solving murders.  Crews pulls off an apparently complete Zen-new-age-self-help slightly demented from horrible prison experience, nice guy and Damian manages to pull off a stormy but silent darkness under the zen appearance. Reese (Shahi) has apparently been assigned as Crews's senior partner as some kind of unknown punishment and her sub plot appears to be to find a way to bounce Crews out of the police force but instead, very gradually through the season grows to believe he's sincerely a nice guy and a good cop.  There are plenty of plot curves for nearly all the characters that keeps the viewer 'coming back'.  I'm fortunate, I waited until it was cancelled so I'm already prepared for a fantastic 2nd season that flies off a cliff believing the &#34;next&#34; season that never happened would be even better still.Don't put a lot of stock in the idea that the show may not be worth watching because it is just another terrific show mangled by some money grubbers who didn't know they were about to hit the lottery.  Great characters, great actors being great characters, enough sub plots going on to always leave you curious for the next episode and nearly always an unexpected surprise.  Maybe Cloo will pick up a season of &#34;Life&#34; to marathon on some weekend like they did with &#34;Fairly Legal&#34; and folks will have a enough taste to find an alternate source, from networks, to enjoy &#34;Life&#34;.... a good TV series with at least two up and coming entertainment stars."
B000VU4GW2 Life is one of those dramas that leaves you thinking about what you would do if you were in a similar situation. While the series was intended to go more than the two seasons available, it comes to a somewhat satisfactory close at the end of the season, but definitely wanting more. Damian Lewis is outstanding as Detective &#34;New Money&#34; working his way through cases facing the LAPD. Strongly recommended (both seasons)."
B000VU4GW2 We have watched about half of the episodes via Prime Streaming Video and have enjoyed them. The lead character adds that edginess that adds  dry comedy and drama. We will continue to watch!"
B000VU4GW2 It appears that this program only lasted two seasons..I like Damian Lewis very much, the premise of the show is interesting and I enjoy the relationship he (Lewis) has with his new partner, Reese.  Adam Arkin also plays an interesting character.."
B000VU4GW2 It had everything, great chemistry, mystery and spirituality. The one show that makes you want to listen to buddhist meditation tapes."
B000VU4GW2 Season one was great, surprises without being super strange, decent characters, nice story progression while keeping each episode interesting.Season two is what killed this show though, bringing in the new character as a love interest for the partner was a joke, not that they brought someone in, but who and how.  Other than that the second season is worth watching too."
B000VU4GW2 Too bad it only lasted 2 seasons.  However, they did wrap everything up nicely in the 2nd season for it."
B000VU4GW2 Love this show. Wish it had continued"
B000VU4GW2 For a pilot this was great.  I need to see more of it to decide if i will really like the series or not but I suspect the show will make it through it's first season.It is entertaining and interesting definitely worth a watch and a look at the second episode."
B000VU4GW2 This is a good show, just not really moving. It is a good who dunnit for anyone to watch. Nice show."
B000VU4GW2 Very average. Not very interesting at times. A lot of eye candy gets thrown in t keep your attention as the plot very slowly unfolds."
B000VU4GW2 It's funny, serious, and well done.  If your looking for great entertainment you need to watch this series. Season 2 is just as good."
B000VU4GW2 Another Damien Lewis triumph.  I've been impressed with this guy since he did the two mini-series The Forsyth Saga and Band of Brothers.  Band of Brothers was a stand-out performance since he was a Brit playing an American officer of the 101st Airborne.  Nicely done by him and he is a coming actor.  Just needs the right launch pad.  Life is a good choice.  It has a great hook and the right quirkyness to make it really interesting and not like the usual drivel on American telly . . . the rest of the cast is good as well and with the continued good writing this show has a chance to succeed where most shows fail if they don't have CSI or Law and Order as part of their title.  So, if you want to watch something different and not the usual display of bullets entering a human body and puncturing various organs close-up this is a good one.  Life is good."
B000VU4GW2 Quick Overview: Detective Crews was sentenced and served years in prison for a crime he is now exonerated for. He received a hefty settlement but decided to return to his work where he got a new partner. Together they solve murders. When he is alone, he is tries to solve the murder he was put away for.Love the Life television series. I don't know how I missed it when it was airing. Damian Lewis is great. His character, Crews, is eccentric but smart. He often looks like he is about to board the crazy train and then suddenly it all makes sense. Then he does it again! He is a little crazy and a little genius. Pretty obnoxious sometimes too."
B000VU4GW2 Life is one of the freshest new shows on TV right now. I love the main character, I love Adam Arkin's character, I just cannot recommend this series highly enough.The zen take on everything really makes this an offbeat yet engaging cop series."
B000VU4GW2 I was not sure of this show so I took a chance and watched the first episode, it was a fresh look at crime drama.  A cop, wrongly accused (not so surprising a plot----aren't they always???) but still I continued watching.  The interesting hook was that he not only took the references huge settlement but had negotiated to keep his old job as a detective in the same place that accused, arrested, prosecuted and jailed him.  Hmmmmm, different. The humor is a sideline to a jaundiced look at the new/former workplace and although I think the female partner's role is a bit over the top, the cases are interesting and the tracking of who actually committed the crime he went to prison for is well thought out and executed. Thank you.&#8203;"
B000VU4GW2 An excellent ensemble cast.  Damien Lewis is magnificent.  When this became available through Amazon Prime, I rabidly devoured an episode...and then another...and then all of a sudden, Season 1 was over and I wondered at how deeply engrossed I became in Charlie's story and how much I had grown to care about him and his partner, Danni.  So now I was craving to know even more of Charlie Crews, et al. An excellent ensemble cast.  Damien Lewis is magnificent.  Now it on to season two."
B000VU4GW2 I enjoyed LIFE season 1 so much, that I also watched season 2.  The writers didn't leave the viewers hanging as to who the real killer was, but there was enough mystery left to make us look forward to season 2.  I like the chemistry and rapport between partners Crews and Reese.  I'm glad to see that both actors (Lewis and Shahi) have found other projects.  Adam Arkin was good as Crews' financial advisor."
B000VU4GW2 great police show. the show is based on a policemen wrongfully sent to prison. Upon his release he rejoins the department. As he does his daily job he tries to find out who framed him"
B000VU4GW2 This was a great series, too bad it's gone. Sarah Shahi and Damien Lewis were perfect in their roles. Great off center cop show. The crime scenes were always interesting and reminded me of the openings to another great series \"dead like me\"."
B000VU4GW2 The actor in the lead role is convincing in his character. All the episodes are fast paced and keep you wondering what will happen."
B000VU4GW2 I loved this story and hope they were able to close up the questions in Season2.  It's a very unique story of police corruption."
B000VU4GW2 I love detective/police based shows.  I found this to be one that caused me to stay up nights watching until I got to the end.  I am now absorbed in Season 2.  Sadly, apparently this show ended after only two seasons.  I recommend it to everyone who enjoys this type of show."
B000VU4GW2 Every once in a while, you stumble across a really fresh, well-written, well-directed, well-acted TV series.  This is it!  Fully engaging...  watched the entire series in 3 days... and went looking for more.  Found &#34;Season 2&#34;!  Yahoo!"
B000VU4GW2 Truly a finders delight....well done...humorous...realistic...charisma and interaction between characters fascinating. Premise seemed far fetched but well played out in Season 2."
B000VU4GW2 Love the writing, love the characters, and am sorry to find out they only made two seasons. Wish I had watched this when it was on the air. Bring it back for a season three!"
B000VU4GW2 Simply one of the best most well written TV series. I am not going to go into the allegories it is comedy and suspense with a past and a (you would think) a future. Sadly it was dropped by the networks even though I understand it had very good numbers. In all probability it was dropped by some 30 year old noodle-head the top brass thought had brains. Life: good acting great plot watch the whole two year life of the show."
B000VU4GW2 Although shows about the LAPD have been done to death, this one  comes with a twist. He was a cop and was framed for a murder and sentenced to life. He served for 12 years then DNA cleared him. He was given a multi-million dollar settlement, so money is no problem for him and neither is getting some nice female companionship. But he takes his old job back anyway, while he continues to collect clues on how and who set him up and put him in prison,As a cop, he is another Monk, who sees and thinks things most people do not, plus he acts a little odd like Monk always did. He always drives a cool car and still has feelings for his ex, who did not believe him about the murders, divorced him and remarried. He lives in a big empty house with his friend, who he met in prison(white collar crime) and he handles all his financials and is also a good friend. He is very likeable but also a bit odd in a humorous way.Give it a watch and see what you think. Of course I didn't mention that his partner is also very hot, of course. What cop show would be complete without a hot woman cop?"
B000VU4GW2 This is one of the best series I've seen.  It's great to watch the streaming so I can watch episodes when I want.  The premise is different from all the usual cop shows.  The acting is good.  I like the characters.  Each episode has a complete case plus something is added to the backstory."
B000VU4GW2 I have greatly enjoyed watching this show and in fact have watched both seasons twice - yes, it's that good in my opinion. The Charlie Crews character, played by Damion Lewis was brilliantly acted and his partner, Detective Reese (Sarah Shahi), is equally as good. They are remarkably good together once they get passed all the &#34;issues&#34; each of them brings to the partnership. Adam Arkin adds humor as Ted Early, a white collar criminal, to the show as Charlie's old prison mate, whom he protected while they were in prison and invited to live with him and manage the huge settlement Charlie received for wrongful conviction. Charlie's old partner, Officer Bobby Stark, played by the ever fascinating Brent Sexton, rounds out the odd main character cast. Watching Charlie readjust to life outside prison, working with a new partner and solve cases has proved irresistible. Excellent acting by all in developing characters that, to me, are just too irresistible and engaging. That this show was cancelled after only 2 seasons, while absolutely dreadful shows were allowed to continue, demonstrated that NBC lost their touch for gauging the difference between what constitutes good writing in TV land and what does not. Season 1 and 2 are both terrifically written and acted. Kudos to Lewis, Shahi, Arkin, and Sexton for a job well done if greatly unappreciated."
B000VU4GW2 I am so sad that this series was cancelled...it could have gone on and on as far as I am concerned.  Very good story premise, wonderful scripts and the chemistry with all the actors was superb especially Crews and Reese!"
B000VU4GW2 The twist here is that detective Charlie Crews was put in jail for 12 years for a crime that he did not commit.  Imagine going through all  of that and then going back into the police force.  His wife has remarried, and some people still will not admit that he is innocent.  Add to this a partner who does not want to be with him, and you've got a man with some issues.  But he tries to handle them with Zen philosophy.  He also has a constant hankering for fresh fruit, since he never got any in prison.Damian Lewis is sympathetic and likeable as Crews, while Adam Arkin is in solid form as his roommate and former inmate-pal.  He helps to handle Crews' enormous settlement.A nice show with interesting characters. Fans of Deadwood will enjoy Robin Weigert in the role of the commander of the police officers."
B000VU4GW2 I'm on the second season now and highly enjoy the show. Shame they took it off. Had a lot going for it."
B000VU4GW2 After viewing Season One of Life, I immediately went back out on Amazon and purchased Season Two. Great intelligent entertainment - sometimes dark, sometimes funny, sometimes darkly funny.  Damian Lewis is the perfect Charlie.  And I've been an Adam Arkin fan since first seeing him on West Wing, so it was good to see him in a meatier role, one which gave room to show more of his fine talent.I'm stingy with stars, so four stars is very good, per my rating system.  A bit more edge would have earned five stars from me."
B000VU4GW2 Always trying to find something decent to watch on Amazon Prime and came across Life. I was not familiar with Damien Lewis before this show. I liked the characters and story (even though at the end some things didn't seem to make sense). In some ways it would have been nice for the show to go longer than two seasons, but on the other hand, the storyline did wrap up quite nicely on the last show."
B000VU6K0I The question is \"Did We Really Need to Rebuild Her?\" After watch all eight episodes of this Bionic Woman remake, I say NO!This last TV season NBC choose to remake the Bionic Woman for the 2000's. In trying to gain success like Sci-Fi Channel had the other 1970's remake  Battlestar Galactica, The producers took a gritter style...and It failed on many levels.As lovely as Michelle Ryan is, she is NO Lindsay Wagner. Ms Ryan tries to give this piece heart. The Character , a bartender , is given her bionics after an auto accident with her Government surgeon boyfriend.  She is saddled her with a felony kid sister (Lucy Hale) who was dumped on her when their father disappeared. Ryan is one of the reason's to watch this show.However, the heart of the show is buried deep within sub plots of the previous sort of Evilish bionic woman Sarah (Katee Sackhoff from the remake Of Gallatica) and ideas of double crossing people that seemed to be ripped off from old ALIAS plots. This new Woman is told is a soap opera form, which weaken this piece.The highlight of the show after Ryan  is Miguel Ferrer as the mysterious  Jonas. He plays a tough as nails agency boss, better than Richard Anderson ever played Oscar Goldman. His stone cold demeanor works well in this character, better than he did in Crossing Jordan (which season one is coming on DVD soon)The funnest thing about this new Bionic Woman. She  has $50,000 dollars worth of bionics parts, up from the 1970's amount of six million..inflation, inflation, inflation!I am sadden that only eight episodes (which are all presented here) were made of this series before the writer's strike of TV season 2007-2008. It had promise, but we may never know if it could have developed. NBC Network  has not stated if this show has been renewed for the next season. So these eight episodes may be the only  episodes of this seriesI can only wish that someone would release the classic Six Million Dollar man or the original Bionic woman on DVD...Now that was great television!Bennet Pomerantz AUDIOWORLD"
B000VU6K0I This is typical filler for those times when there is nothing else to present on TV. This is a standard soap opera with a few not to many quasi-sci-fi visions sprinkled in with no logic.Michelle Ryan is cute but there are a lot of cute actresses. I wish her luck in finding a vehicle with redeeming social value and not this mindless rehash of old plots."
B000VU6K0I So why would they leave her disadvantaged with only one arm, eye and ear Bionic? Yes, both her legs are bionic, but as long as they had her on the table why not do the job right? Especially compared to Sarah's obvious superiority."
B000VU6K0I In the pilot, the look and feel of this show does for the Bionic Woman, what they did for Battlestar on the Sci-Fi channel( if not quite as gritty). Where as the original was just silly, this seems (so far) as a well thought out story, with people that we may come to care about for (good or ill).The subplots, of Jamie's reletionships with her sister, and evil crazy counterpart, for me (at least so far) make for good drama.They've got my interest, I just hope the show lives up to the pilot."
B000VU6K0I I remember the bionic woman from many years ago and I guess it didn't compare to the original but I enjoyed it and was a little disappointed that it was cancelled"
B000VU6K0I I was a huge fan of The Bionic Woman and The Six Million Dollar Man...sooooI was excited and skeptical about this show being made.  However, I purchased the DVD set and then read the reviews.  I agree with some of the reviewers about the problem this series faced.  The comparison to the original, the lack of continuity, etc.  However, I feel this show is being way to harshyl judged.  While I can see the problems of this show, I feel that in time the kinks would have been worked out....there were only 8 episodes from what I can tell and find out and the chemistry between all the characters was spot on right out of the gate.  I feel it would have only got better.  The show was still finding its legs when the strike happened.  How long could this show have gone?  That is anyone's guess, but if the strike had not happened, I certainly think it would have continued for several years.  I personally enjoy seeing Sarah, she, to me, is much more colorful and 3 dimensional than the other characters....I just have to say, over all, I am glad that I bought this set, I would have continued watching the show based on what I have seen and watched objectively, I don't think anyone could disagree with this."
B000VU6K0I If Katie Sackhoff had been hired to play Jamie Summers and if the writers had all been fired and replaced by people capable of actually writing good stories, intelligent characters and compelling stories this might have been a great show.  But she wasn't, they weren't and it most certainly was not.  I also sincerely wish Hollywood would stop casting pretty over talented or even suitable for the part.  Very disappointing."
B000VU6K0I All the parts were there for a truly fine series.  Good actors awesome budget...  well ok maybe not all the parts.  The story lines while interesting were executed poorly and the special effects just didn't do justice to the show.  What really stuck out to me as unacceptable were the fight scenes.  Jamie Sommers routinely injured people by accident when she forgot her new \"strength\".  In the fight scenes she couldn't fight here way out of a wet paper bag.  One super punch and the guy gets up not even a bruise, no broken bones nothing.  When she gets hit in her non bionic parts pretty much the same thing.  She can take a punch better than ALI ever could.They say the writers strike condemned this show to one season.  I really doubt that.  I would not purchase a second season."
B000VU6K0I This was really well done, the writers strike probably cost this series it's sophomore season, Michelle Ryan wad lovely and likable , what a great American accent. The producers of Battlestar loaded this revival with lots of subplots and Galactica cast members... Especially Katee Sackhoff (Starbuck ) who steals scenes as the bionic prototype gone bad. Ryan's older sister cliches are improved by the secret life angle, over all a fun series."
B000VU6K0I This re-make of the classic series Bionic Woman is not as wretched as some would like to say. Overall it suffers from a slightly dull athmosphere, and it is true that the writing could have been tighter but the acting is rather good and the effects are first-rate even if they are somewhat in the background. So the story is quite simple, underachieving bartender Jamie Summers is almost killed during an accident and re-built by her experimental-surgeon boyfriend. Afterwards it is quite straightforward. But as I wrote it is not as bad as some other reviewers put it."
B000VU6K0I One of the best things about DVDs, notably the release of TV series on DVD, is the fact that you actually get a chance to watch some of the best shows on TV that you may have missed the first time around. Such is the case with BIONIC WOMAN.This remake of the hit 70s show that starred Lindsey Wagner (that was a spin off of THE SIX MILLION DOLLAR MAN) updates the original, keeping only what's necessary. Jamie Sommers is young, in love and pregnant. After breaking the news to her boyfriend Will (Chris Bowers), the pair are broadsided on the way home.Damaged to the extent that she might die, Jamie is saved by Will as his true occupation is revealed. The man she thought was a simply college professor actually is a brilliant surgeon who works for a secret government agency. And rather than lose Jamie, Will takes her to their facility and enhances her.While her legs, one arm, one ear and one eye were completely obliterated, this facility replaces them with bionic parts, mechanical computerized parts as well as nano technology that boost her healing. Horrified at first, Jamie begins to accept the new her. When Will is killed by the last candidate for bionics, Sarah Corvus (Katee Sackhoff), Jamie joins the agency that rebuilt her.That's the simple set up for the series. Super strength, eyesight, hearing and more. Working for a government agency. And with a revenge motive strong enough to fill any number of stories. But the series doesn't stop there. As well as her new found life, Jamie has a kid sister to raise. Troublesome and a handful, the teen was dropped at her doorstep by her father and was the reason Jamie stayed where she is. A combination of love and loss revolve between the two.The series takes a natural progression, from Jamie being talked into her new career path to how she deals with Sarah. The series shows her progression, her training and her learning to deal with her abilities. But what makes this series work best is that it's not a straight out remake. Instead, it takes those bones from the original and makes the story it's own.Michelle Ryan stars as Jamie and does a fantastic job, showing a young woman who takes what life throws at her and survives. Miguel Ferrer does his smarmy best as the cold hearted bureaucrat who's in charge. Sackhoff is equally casts as the killer who wants to change but has technology that wasn't perfected within her.Cost of living what it is, there is no way Jamie can have been made for a mere $6 million. Times have changed and so has this show. But that's a good thing. While the original seems silly to look back on now, science fiction fans can find much to enjoy in this one. Look for it on your shelves or add it to your own. It's a series worth having."
B000VU6K0I As a fan of the original Bionic Woman, I am appalled by the liberties taken by the writers in this show. First of all, they have completely altered the story of Jamie Summers, the original Bionic Woman. The story presented in the series is COMPLETELY different. I don't undertand why they didn't just change her name.Second, the acting of Michelle Ryan is not the best. Still, I do think she is doing the best she can with what she has been given. But, she displays no emotion, barely any tears when crying. Her face looked completely emotionless when her fiance died or when she was at his funeral. The show just doesn't deal with her emotions. They have concentrated so much in the action and the lines that they have forgotten an important part of television, facial expressions and body language. The younger sister seems to be the only one displaying an emotional range in the show.The show is not that cohesive. They do not explain certain things. Why was the sister sentenced(?) or prohibited from using computers? The show just doesn't tie in things together.The show has a very nice visual style (hence my rating of 3 stars) and I think it has some potential, but a lot of things have to be fixed. These facilities, very low budget by the way, where she trains have really bad security and look like a basement. They should vamp up these settings and make them more hi-tech. The plotlines and the writing should deal more with how Jamie feels about all of this. She took everything so matter of fact (except for the initial screaming after her operation). Someone needs to wake her up and say \"Woman, you are Bionic! React! I would also like to know how she knows all these fighting techniques. Was some computer implanted into her head? I mean, she did not train for that long!In conclusion, the show has a lot of things that need fixing. And the first thing should be for Michelle Ryan to start showing some emotion and act better."
B000VU6K0I With so much real quality television around, I suppose it's inevitable that some just don't quite make the grade.  And in an age when writing on television on TV is reaching such high standards, it's a shame that in the end it's the writing that lets this down.It's also worth remembering that if you plan to purchase this, it is only EIGHT episodes - yes, that includes the pilot.  So Jaime Sommers is in a car accident, gets her limbs, eye and ear replaced with superior bionic parts by a covert group who go around saving the world each week.  Hangers on include her younger sister who lives with her and knows nothing of her secret life, and later, a boyfriend.  And for character development, well, in 8 episodes, that's all we have time for, folks.  Think of it as Alias, with added bionics, minus any of the charisma.Acting is fine - Michelle Ryan hits the required notes of all American woman, and woman who you believe can throw a punch, but somehow never quite convinces of having the superior IQ of the character - again, mostly the writing and not her fault.  Miguel Ferrer is the boss, to add Hollywood clout.  Let's face it though, If Miguel Ferrer is who you turn to to add clout.. well. Need I say more.  One of the highlights is a story arc with Isaiah Washington who turns out to be the most believable character in the series, and a delicious cameo over several episodes with Katee Sackhoff, from Battlestar Galactica.  Since the producer of this series also brought that series to the screen, it is especially disappointing that it is on story and writing that this series stumbles.So we have a fairly hum drum series which relies completely on its high concept, and lacks pazazz.  All the same, it's worth remembering that 10 years ago this would have been a welcome addition to the TV schedule... it's not a bad series - it just has such strong competition these days, that why wade through sloppy scripting and lazy character exposition?"
B000VU6K0I Interesting remake of the original...The Pilot was ok...nothing special, nothing great...to me having \"Starbuck\" in the series beginning is not a real draw after having to endure Battlestar Gafartica remake with her in it...Other than that, the episode didnt really do much.  Im guessing this series wont last much longer than its predecesor unless they really vamp up the whole concept.Hope you folks like it..."
B000VU6K0I The show was great.  It was entertaining and action packed throughout.I'll have to watch a few more before I really decide how much I like it.  Part of that will depend on the main character, I'm not sure about the casting for her yet, something feels off but maybe she will grow on me."
B000VU6K0I This episode shows the kind of potential that THE BIONIC WOMAN has and is easily the best so far.  The widely reported rumor is that there has been disarray on the set of the show.  The good news is that NBC seems to be a big believer in the show and has taken every possible effort to make it a success.  The other bit of good news is that the show is already quite good, even if in disarray.  Now, it is also perfectly possible that things were confused on the set, but that many of the difficulties were solved by excellent editing.  But if one didn't know from other sources that the production is supposed to be a bit of a mess, you wouldn't be able to tell by the finished episode.  After a few episodes show runner Glen Morgan left the show.  Jason Katims, who is the executive producer of FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS, has been taken on as a consulting producer.  I've read also that a number of FNL writers have gotten involved with THE BIONIC WOMAN.  NBC clearly thinks this show could be a hit for several years.Clearly, NBC's reaction to THE BIONIC WOMAN shows the beginning of a trend in responding to productions that have some onset confusion.  The prototype was last year's BROTHERS AND SISTERS, which by all accounts was simply a god awful mess.  The initial show runner quit over creative differences (she is now the show runner, ironically, for the show that runs opposite THE BIONIC WOMAN, ABC's PRIVATE PRACTICE) and NBC was forced to put together a new production team.  The result was a completely rejuvenated program, one that by the end of the year was enjoying both respect by critics and dedication by fans (of which, I must confess, I am not one).All of which excites me.  If THE BIONIC WOMAN is this good while the production team was not a smooth running machine, what will it be like once it is tuned up?This episode lays out what will clearly be a major story arc on the show, the strained but unbreakable connection between Jaime Sommers and Sarah Corvus.  Some people have complained about Michelle Ryan's performance as Jaime, but I think she has been fine and that she will get even better as her character is allowed to develop more confidence.  I think the problem is not Michelle Ryan, but that Katee Sackhoff's performance as Sarah Corvus is just so spectacularly good that she makes everyone around her look bad in comparison.  Sarah Corvus dominates every scene she is in, much the way that on BUFFY Faith and Spike tended to take over when they put in an appearance.My one concern with the series at this point is how good it is going to be when we get less Sarah Corvus.  THE BIONIC WOMAN started filming before BATTLESTAR GALACTICA did, so that Katee Sackhoff, who plays Starbuck on the latter, was available for early episodes.  At some point we will inevitably see less Sarah.  My understanding is that Sackhoff's boss, David Eick, is working with her to keep her involved with THE BIONIC WOMAN as much as possible while BSG wraps up and having both shows film in Vancouver certainly helps.  Still, at least for a while Sarah will have to play a diminished role.  But one thing seems certain:  no performer on television will play such a crucial role on two series this year as Katee Sackhoff.All in all, I think this episode was a big improvement over the second one.  I liked the pilot, but the second episode was a tad flat.  Hopefully this episode is a sign of things to come."
B000VU6K0I A new show with great potential, but I'll need to see more clarity in the future stories since this one gave bits & pieces of many things to come.  As long as some of the mysteries and/or underlying stories start to come together in 
B000VU6K0I I liked this ones I watched.  I guess I have outgrown this particular type of program.  It was ok but slow"
B000VU6K0I they jumped the story to far from reality eliminate the things that made Bionics and reinvented it as something else and added bizzare plot twist that didn't really make sense.  If you were a big fan of the original this one may disappoint; still special effects are of course better as tech has improved but that's about it."
B000VU6K0I I found myself becoming more interested as the plot lines evolved. The new show has brought in more technology than the original series, while keeping the theme similar. This version is darker and has more edge than the first series. The younger sister started out slightly shallow, but the need of having her watched by older adults was addressed early on in the series Now I think that both \"sisters\" are developing their sibling roles nicely. The actors that support Michelle Ryan have developed into a fine ensemble of people. I would like to see more of Mark Sheppard in future episodes. There are also danglers of plot in each episode. I hope the show continues. It has turned out to be a show I look forward to watching on my PC."
B000VU8DCQ Chuck is the best show ever!! The nerd gets the superpowers and the girl. What more could you want? Ok Zack Levi is also really cute and has the personality to match. This is one of my favorite shows - the nerd is the hero. What more could you want? Don't miss out on this series!"
B000VU8DCQ Chuck Bartowski no longer possesses the Intersect, but has still matured into a confident and capable secret agent. As he mentors the new Intersect, he also has to deal with the fact he and his team are now independent contractors with bills to pay and rival companies to compete with. When, yet again, a dangerous agent comes after the Intersect, Chuck has to call upon his resources and training to stop them.Chuck has always been a curious show, a geek comedy with dramatic and romantic overtones whose tone has often spun on a dime. The show has always done a good job of managing these different tones and styles, keeping everything grounded though Zachary Levi's earnest-but-sympathetic performance as the title character. In the fifth season, the show experiences several additional such tonal shifts, as Chuck is betrayed by his best friend (but it turns out not to be his fault) and, most surprisingly, has his life almost ruined in the final few episodes of the series. For a show that's always been quite warm-hearted and entertainingly cheesy, the surprisingly bleak tone of the final few episodes comes as a bit of a shock.The season - renewed purely to be wrapped up - only consists of thirteen episodes and it appears there may have been budgetary restrictions in place: our previous season villains were played by well-known actors such as Chevy Chase and Timothy Dalton. This year we get Angus Macfadyen, a very solid Scottish actor best-known for his supporting role in Braveheart (as Robert the Bruce). He does a good job, but lacks the geek-cred his predecessors brought with them. Even more problematic is the fact that he only appears in the last few episodes of the season with little build-up and his character is never really explored in much depth (in contrast to Dalton's hammy-but-complex Volkoff).The truncated run causes issues throughout the season. Storylines that would have been given whole episodes to develop in the second through fourth seasons are here disposed off way too quickly. An entertaining on-going subplot involving Carrie-Ann Moss as a rival contractor (and potential romantic interest for Casey) has enormous potential, but kind of peters out with no real climax or pay-off. Most frustratingly, there is relatively very little action in the Buy More. Big Mike, Lester and Jeff barely get any lines in some episodes, although a late-season subplot that sees Lester and a reformed and sober Jeff finally discovering what's going under their feet does help reduce this problem a little.Most surprising is a divisive late-season storyline involving amnesia. Given the tone of the show, I was confidently expecting some last-minute solution or cure would be found. Instead, we get a highly inconclusive ending. It's not quite The Sopranos, but the series ending without ever answering the central question poised by the last couple of episodes is an unexpected and possibly even brave choice. Whether it's the right choice is one that fans will be arguing about for years to come (or unless the much-rumoured Chuck movie gets off the ground). For myself, Chuck has always been first and foremost an escapist and fun show, not a gritty drama like the new BSG or something from HBO. Ending the show in this manner feels out of character for the series, and a little bit of pointless torture for our main characters who really deserved more of a happy ending.That aside, the final season of Chuck (***) is entertaining, well-acted and often quite funny. The shortened episode order means some storylines aren't developed very well, and the ending will be divisive, but certainly the season is worth watching for established fans. In particular, the way Chuck's character develops across the five seasons, going from nerd to an intelligent, resourceful agent (exemplified by the shots of Chuck on the DVD spines, which cleverly show this development) does pay off very well here."
B000VU8DCQ What can I say, the combination between the goofy but martial arts skilled Chuck, his super hot superspy wife Sarah Walker, and the cast of characters such as Casey and Morgan make it a great show! Highly recommend buying all seasons if you did not think you would like it when it was on TV, I think you'd be surprised!"
B000VU8DCQ such a big fan of the show.  it and the characters actually GREW rather than just got stuck in the non-ending situation syndrome. this final season was a great send-off.  worth every penny to me"
B000VU8DCQ After watching the first 4 seasons of Chuck, I just HAD to get the last season as well - and it was money well spent. It was a little sad knowing the series end was coming, but the writers did a good job of keeping the action flowing right up to the end. All of the characters seemed to get their special moments during this season - the only character I missed was Anna from the early seasons.I don't want to spoil anyone's surprise, but we get a few visits and flashbacks to old characters, as well as a few new ones along the way. Most of the Chuck fans should be happy with the ending as well. Boy, it is ahrd to talk about this season without giving something away, so I will just summarize:If you watched the first four seasons, this season falls nicely in-line, but with a wrap-up in the final show instead of a cliff-hanger season ender."
B000VU8DCQ For the final season of \"Chuck\", producers Josh Schwartz and Chris Fedak faced a daunting dramatic challenge: how to generate new drama, comedy and romance for a great show.  After all, at the end of season four, nice guy CIA agent Chuck Bartkowski (Zachary Levy) finally married his lovely CIA partner Sara Walker (Yvonne Strahovski), after protecting the birth of niece Clara to sister Ellie and brother-in-law Captain Awesome.  Operation Bartkowski was officially ended, leaving Chuck, Sara, gruff NSA agent John Casey (Adam Baldwin), and Chuck's best friend Morgan (Joshua Gomez) without a mission.  The solution: reshuffle the deck.Using money from Alexei Volkov, last season's leading villain, Chuck, Sara, Casey, and Morgan go into the private spy business, only to discover the competition can be quite fierce.  Carrie-Anne Moss (Matrix) has a recurring role as the cutthroat leader of a rival firm, and as someone with a history, and maybe a future, with Casey.  Morgan, who ended up last season with the Intersect in his head, discovers the hard way the challenges of having super spy skills, and in the process damages his relationship with Casey's daughter Alex.  Chuck, reduced to basic nice guy computer nerd, goes through his own period of painful adjustment, before having to face his greatest opponent one more time.  Sara Walker's long-missing mother will make an appearance at a vital moment, while fans will be treated to additional fun with the BuyMore gang, and to additional Bartkowski family comedy (and drama over Chuck and Sara's future).Team Bartkowski will face a series of threats from rogue CIA agents, including one who sets up the team for the crime of the century, leaving the team with a choice of jail or life on the run.  In a tense multi-episode conclusion, Chuck and Sara will battle one last ruthless opponent for control of the Intersect and everything they have built together.  The suspense will be good to the last drop.\"Chuck: The Complete Fifth Season\" has the last 13 episodes of the show and is highly recommended to its dedicated fans.  The DVD set includes the usual blooper reel, deleted scenes, and a few farewell features."
B000VU8DCQ I loved this series. I hated to see all the problems with keeping this series on the air. I will miss this show."
B000VU8DCQ This show I really enjoyed (except the \"evil american agencies\" bit is wearing very thin to me) a funny show without a laugh track is always a plus to me. I don't know if they will find enough material to write to keep me engaged, but the pilot was pretty entertaing, (the action sequence in the biggining was pretty exciting, and the rest pretty funny.I hope they can keep it up.Update November 27, 2007This show has pleasingly gotten better each week. The Characters are more developed and sympathetic.  And while this may not go down in TV history as one of the greatest shows of all time, it continues to be a thoroughly enjoyable way to spend an hour."
B000VU8DCQ Except there's only so much a Subway sandwich can accomplish. And, for such an underdog show like CHUCK, really, a five year run is pretty amazing. I'm already missing this show bad. But at least EUREKA is still around for a few more seasons... wait, what's that about EUREKA?In the course of four years, Chuck Bartowski's evolution has been an eye-opener, Chuck having gone from hapless Nerd Herder to accomplished spy. This fifth and final season finds him coping without the crutch of the Intersect and proving that, just on his own merit and innate skills and savvy, he's still got the goods to kick bu++ in the cloak and dagger community. As noted in last season's finale, thanks to Volkoff's largesse, Chuck and Sarah are now stinking rich. They now own the Burbank Buy More store, still the cover for Castle, their underground espionage lair. With the CIA giving them the stink eye, Chuck and Sarah have struck out on their own and established their own independent security firm. But maybe the biggest \"What the--?!\" moment in last season's finale is that Morgan Grimes has become the inadvertent host of the Intersect. It's a fun twist, initially. But I think we were all laying odds that this sitch wouldn't last.Foremost, I love the show's heart. We eyeball the shadowy conspiracies and the neat spy gadgets and the skullduggery and the wicked kung fu bits, but these elements rapidly become rote when you don't give a what about the characters. It's always been about Sarah and Chuck. They anchor things. It's sappy to say, but despite the geektastic pyrotechnics, it's Sarah and Chuck's romantic arc that we track and feed off from the most. Sarah Walker, who once was this lonely little girl, unwilling to trust, weapons always hot. Chuck Bartowski, hapless geek, heart ever on his sleeve. Their winding love story is pretty friggin' sweet. And, to squeaze out that last drip of dramatic conflict and tension, even in (especially in) the eleventh hour, the showrunners are all too willing to jeopardize Sarah and Chuck's happiness. Yeah, okay, it hooked me in yet again. From jump I cared about these characters. That even eventually applied to the aggravating sidekick Morgan Grimes.Season 5's first major arc deals with Morgan as the new walking CIA database and touches on Chuck's trying hard not to feel too envious or useless. And, somewhere on the periphery, never quite going away, skulks yet another dark cabal out to destroy Chuck. There's a rogue CIA operative targeting our nerd. And Chuck and Sarah's newfound wealth... well, this show's writers just love erecting obstacles for our protagonists.Our spy team for hire has trouble staying solvent. Doesn't help that Chuck and company are in direct competition with the flashier Verbanski Corps, of which boss, Gertrude Verbanski, seems to harbor a personal agenda against Colonel Casey. CHUCK has always had a knack for attracting guest actors steeped in nerd pop culture. This season's guest star bounty includes Mark Hamill, the reprising Linda Hamilton, Rebecca Romijn, Stan Lee (as himself), Bo Derek (as herself), two cast members from COMMUNITY, as well as a welcome recurring run for Carrie-Anne Moss who plays the steely Gertrude Verbanski.With only 13 episodes, this season focuses less on silly shenanigans at the Buy More. Still, fans of Jeffster shouldn't fret. Jeffrey gets a pretty gratifying story arc, and there's a very nice payoff regarding Jeffster in the final episode.My pick of the season: \"Chuck vs. the Zoom,\" for demonstrating Chuck's improvisational tactical skills, and this without the Intersect; \"Chuck vs. the Curse,\" because of Ellie and Captain Awesome's fun and unexpectedly perilous date night; \"Chuck vs. the Baby,\" for shedding more light on Sarah's past; \"Chuck vs. Bo,\" because friggin' Bo Derek's in it; and \"Chuck vs. the Goodbye,\" for all the callbacks and because it's a fine send-off, never mind that we have to infer the happy ending.I dunno, maybe this is a good time for CHUCK to bow out, before it starts flirting with becoming too stale. And maybe I'm getting fed up with buying them Subway sandwiches. But, man, I will miss this show something fierce. But at least WONDERFALLS is still on the air... wait... what's that?!CHUCK - THE COMPLETE FIFTH AND FINAL SEASON comes with 3 discs and offers the following bonus material:- \"Sandwiches and Superfans: The Saving of a Show\" - cast & crew, most of 'em teary-eyed, pay tribute to the show's passionate fan base (00:10:20 minutes)- \"Scoring the World of CHUCK\" - spotlight on composer Tim Jones, the mind behind the music (00:06:08 minutes)- \"Chuck Versus the Final Episode\" - an emotional visit behind the scenes (00:14:25 minutes)- \"CHUCK: The Beginnings\" - the Flash that launched a hit show; cast & crew reminisce about how it all started (00:05:24 minutes)- \"CHUCK: Through the years\" - charting the evolution of the show's characters (00:11:14 minutes)- \"Goodbye, Buy More\" - Time-lapse teardown of the set (00:02:18 minutes)- 2 Exclusive Buy More commercials (featuring Big Mike & Captain Awesome)- Extended version of Series Finale \"Chuck vs. the Goodbye\" (00:52:59 minutes)- \"CHUCK: the Future\" - cast & producers' predictions about the show's characters (00:04:19 minutes)- Audio Commentaries on \"Chuck vs. Sarah\" and \"Chuck vs. the Goodbye\" (both eps with actors Zachary Levi, Joshua Gomez, and co-creators/co-writers Chris Fedak and Josh Schwartz)- 10 Declassified Scenes (or Deleted/Extended Scenes, for those not down with the cloak & dagger jargon)- Gag Reel (00:03:34 minutes)And there's also an episode guide pamphlet."
B000VU8DCQ I was really hoping this show would make another season but alas it was not to be.  I am still buying subs and hoping though.Wendy Farrington is the reason this show ran as long as it did.  She came up with the Save Chuck subway campaign.Wendy thank you for your efforts."
B000VU8DCQ The last season of Chuck is almost as fun to watch as the previous seasons. Almost because you know it's going to end. There are only 13 episodes, but there's a lot going on! I enjoyed it and can highly recommend the final season on CHUCK."
B000VU8DCQ The dvd arrived promptly and in perfect shape.  NOTE: SPOILER ALERT!!!!  I was very disppointed that Sara would lose her memory and she and Chuck would bascially have to start their relationship all over again. The writers couldn't have made it a happy ending for the two of them-come on..."
B000VU8DCQ This is a great new show. The show has excellent oddball humor and great lines. The characters are hilarious and they have made great scene sequences (e.g. Casey getting the cutomer service tutorial) and Chuck just draws you in into his predicament. I especially enjoy when he talks to Sarah about their fake relatiosnhip, if that relationship were in fact real, they would go on a date. Chuck is just a great show, a must watch. The show has refenreces to video games that are fun to figure out. The cast is very amusing and entertaining. The only people that seem out of place are Chuck's sister and her boyfriend or husband, Captain Awesome.UPDATE 11/19/2007:This show is still great. I can't wait for Monday nights to watch this show. The relationships between Chuck and Sarah is so exciting. Every episode, every new development and every character adds even more excitement and fun to this show. And Rachel Bilson's character is great. This show has everything going for it: great and funny dialogue, great performances, amazing chemistry among the characters and great and unbelievable storylines."
B000VU8DCQ Season 5 of Chuck. Wow. I am sad it is over. The production values were high until the end. Still kept the same humor and action mix. I shall miss it."
B000VU8DCQ This show started strong and we enjoyed it for several years but not so much in the last two years. The last season was Ok but with the intersect getting into so many people it lost it's appeal. I was also disappointed with the ending."
B000VU8DCQ Since we have the other seasons on DVD I bought this on DVD not Blue-Ray. We loved this show but I do think they were smart in ending it when they did. Overall, I'm glad we have this just to have the complete series. I liked season 4 better but did enjoy this season as well."
B000VU8DCQ We the fans were lucky to get this final season. The writers and actors knew this as well and pulled out all the stops for the end of this saga. I thought season four was good but a little lacking when compared to the previous seasons. This season however was excellent. The guest stars were impressive as always with Carrie Anne Moss, Mark Hammil, Bo Derek, and many others that made for a pop culture flashback. This season centered on Carmichael industries and how Chuck, Sarah, and Casey were on there own. Oh and also Morgan has the Intersect and Chuck does not. I was a little worried about how this would play out but the writers did an excellent job giving the storyline meaning and depth. I won't go into detail but it was an interesting ride with Morgan Grimes having the Intersect.Also Chuck and Sarah shared a lot of post marriage problems like starting a family and finding a house. It was cool to see these two try to figure out married life while shooting some bad guys. Casey gets a love interest in Carrie Anne Moss which was a nice touch for the gruff Colonel, and wouldn't you know it there was a Matrix reference added for her. The ending while a little controversial was excellent in my opinion. Anyone about to watch the finale should watch the pilot right before it. There are a lot of references to Chuck's first mission. There will also be an extended version of the finale along with audio commentary for the episode (It's about time). Even if you didn't like the finale at least the writers got to end the show on their terms.I'm rating this in advance of buying it because I think we all know it isn't going to look great on Blu Ray. It never has been the standard for high definition. I doubt things will change now. This will be however is the best it is going to look for a while so I will gladly add it to my collection next to the previous four seasons.The final season of Chuck was a wild ride until the final smash to black. It brought back a lot of favorite characters including a previous villain, new characters were seamlessly added to the mix, and the focus never shifted too far from the main cast. Which did an excellent job once again. Zachary Levi deserves an Emmy for his performance in the finale. I said the same for Matthew Fox for LOST and he was robbed. I hope Chuck at least gets a nomination. The final episode will be debated for a long time, but you owe it to yourself to experience the final season of Chuck. In the Pilot Chuck said he was working on his five year plan. Well Chuck your five years on television were some of the most memorable in recent memories and your final missions were just as enjoyable as your first."
B000VVEDWO I was looking forward to this show... I've always enjoyed the shows about time travel.  But I still don't understand what causes him to go back in time.... if it was explained I missed it.There were some clues that I guess were too subtle for me to catch as they happened, and I only 'got it' at the end of the show... Is that what they were going for?  Anyway.. I will probably watch one more episode, and then if it isn't any better I'll pass...."
B000VVEDWO K. Watlet (another reviewer) is crazy!  This was an excellent story!  I really don't see how it will remain interesting as a series but it would have made an excellent miniseries or movie.  The acting was real, the camera angles were good, the shifting back and forth through time was done very well and there were times I didn't know which time he was in.  The only reason I watched it is because it was free and I am so glad that I did!"
B000VVEDWO From what I can tell, Journeyman has gone the way of a lot of promising shows before it with low ratings. It's too bad as this show was starting to hit its stride, and had shaken my initial perception as a Quantum Leap ripoff. To the credit of the producers, the final filmed episode, \"Perfidia,\" offers a neat enough closure to the series that fans won't feel cheated. Hopefully, the Sci Fi channel or some other cable outlet will pick up the show--it deserves another chance."
B000VVEDWO Journeyman looks to be another series with promise. I watched the Unbox download of the Pilot episode, and... If you don't just hate the idea of a show with time traveling involved, this should be a good series for thinking people.The premise seems to be somewhere in a mix of \"Quantum Leap\" (at least the part of fixing what is screwed up with the timeline) but more \"The Time Traveler's Wife, and Ken Grimwood's \"Replay\".Mid ~Season Update November 27, 2007Journeyman is meeting all my expectations for the shows development. I remain hooked!The make or break for this show will be do the real world characters generate enough empathy to hook you on the show, and will the \"fix it\" parts of the plot be interesting.I think there is a good chance they can make this work. I hope I am right."
B000VVEDWO Journeyman is, without a shadow of a doubt, one of the BEST television shows ever produced. The concept of Journeyman is brilliant, the marketing was abysmal, the ratings were satisfactory for a freshman show, the over-all quality of Journeyman is superb. But don't think Journeyman is just a show about time travel. It's so much more. Journeyman is a show about a heroes. Dan Vasser is the hero who goes back in time to help right wrongs. Livia is his hero partner who helps him. Katie Vasser is his hero wife who, through no fault of her own, finds herself married to a time-traveling man who, coincidently is time traveling with his ex-girlfriend. This show could have taken so many low roads with this issue. But never once did it slip into the little nasty things other shows use to pull people in - illicit sex, bad language, drug addiction. Journeyman was one of the few shows in many years that showed humanity at its best. We need MORE shows like this, not less. Why NBC canceled Journeyman is a mystery to many, many fans who continue to proliferate all over the internet, months after this show was canceled. I say to NBC: remember Star Trek? Now, FOX owns the rights to this show. We can hope that Fox does a better job and has more respect for this diamond of a show that got coal treatment. For the fans of Journeyman, WE were the ones who lost. But NBC? They deserve to be in fourth place amongst the networks. They are the real losers here. Thank YOU FOX and UNBOX for offering us the sale of the thirteen episodes of this fine show. Now...as for the DVD...?"
B000VVEDWO Good thing I have a DVR b/c a lot of time was spent rewinding to rewatch the parts I didn't get the first time around."
B000VVEDWO Althought it started out slow, the story picked up enough to capture my attention and hold it through to the end.  I like how he was able to prove his story to at least one person important in his life to give him the chance for a \"home\" that doesn't turn out to be an insane asylum.  The character development was basic, but adequate enough to show hints of other, less obvious relationships that I'm sure will  be cleared up,inlater episodes.  Overall a very good possibility for my interests, so I'll be watching."
B000VVEDWO The show started off as intriguing and has developed into a very solid drama. It has potential to really excel and become one of the best new dramas, but needs more time to develop. Unfortunately, the writers' strike may have a negative effect on the show's future. I am truly impressed with the fairly accurate representation of the Bay Area both historical and present day. There are always a few minor things that get fudged, but, for the most part, it is true to this region. Give it a chance and have fun."
B000VVEDWO When I was watching the pilot episode I wasnt sure if I was going to like the show. Then everything fell together at the end of the pilot and I have been hook on the show ever since.  The acting is great and the time jumping gives you the blast from the past feeling."
B000VVEDWO This show first developed the backgrounds of the characters really well and added the sci-fi elements as a spice to the series. The creaters of the show have selected \"family members\" of the main characters \"Dan & Katie\" who manage to be very similar in features to the two main characters. I think the show has done a superb job of recreating the past of San Francisco and the cultural elements of the years that the main character, Dan, travels too. The stories flow together creating a nice arc of the family interactions and current cultural dynamics mixed with good sci-fi based on quantium theory that the viewer can actually believe. There is a balance between the good that Dan does and the sinister aspect of being watched by the government in recent story lines. While each show can be a stand alone episode, I enjoy watching this show and learning  more about the characters' challenges with the concepts of Sci-fi that influence the show each week. It's also nice to see a family demonstrating love and support of each other for a change."
B000VZUWZW This is a great first season, so fresh and fun! the characters are sometimes ridiculous but you root for them because they are still lovable. Great cast dynamic! Excellent!"
B000VZUWZW I 1st got turned on to this show by my wife. I'm glad in did. This show is pure genius. Once you start watching it, you will be sucked in. This show is very well done and since you are hooked, you will need more. If you are a fan of comedy go get some."
B000VZUWZW At first I thought this might be way tooo nerdy but honestly after a few episodes I'm really enjoying the series.  It's light yet portrays an Aspie really well."
B000VZUWZW Very funny sitcom about a group of friends who don't fit in with mass culture.  I liked how each character is very similiar yet different from eachother.  Sheldon has been my favorite since the sperm bank when he explains about producing a child who doesn't know if he should use an intergral or differential to find the area between curves."
B000VZUWZW I am really happy with this show, the first season is pretty good and the show just gets better over the season's.  If you haven't seen this yet I would recommend it for anyone.  It's just a really funny show."
B000VZUWZW \"Frasier\", arguably the greatest sitcom of all time and known widely as the most intelligent, sadly came to an end in 2004. Dedicated fans of the sitcom were sat wondering what to do next. Myself alike, we simply didn't know what to do with ourselves, we searched frantically for an equally intelligent sitcom alternative which simply didn't exist. Some of us suffered withdrawal symptoms and eventually got over them, while others simply withered away and died whilst huddling in a corner rocking back and forth waiting for \"Frasier\" to come back. He never did.Three years later and Chuck Lorre finally came to the rescue and brought us the utterly fantastic \"Big Bang Theory.\" No, not the theory of the beginning of the universe and everything in it, but rather the most fantastically amusing and intelligent situational comedy to grace our screens since the equally fantastic \"Frasier.\" It's a show much like Frasier that doesn't seek to just pop out one gag at a time, much like a stand up comedy performance, more rather it will create a genuinely hysterical situation from the simplest of things. It is made this amusing thanks to the fantastic writing, acting and non-patronising tone of the whole thing.The show is primarily based around four super intelligent stereotypical nerds and their blonde bimbo neighbour played by the wonderful Kaley Cuoco. The four nerds are the closest of friends and comprise of Sheldon played by Jim Parsons, Leonard played by Johnny Galecki, Howard played by Simon Helberg and Rajesh played by Kunal Nayyar. Each character has their own fantastic quirks that makes them individually a quality addition to the whole ensemble. Specifically Sheldon who is the genuine super genius of the group that contains not an ounce of modesty about his intelligence or his work. Parsons presents an almost seemless character that exhibits the general unease in modern society that you would expect from someone of such an academic nature, yet amongst his peers  exhumes a confidence that portrays an obvious annoyance amongst his room mate and closest friends.Looking at the general synopsis of the show you would be forgiven for thinking that it's a simple \"boy meets girl, boy likes girl, but girl is too good for boy, but boy doesn't realise it so keeps chasing her.\" Throughout a lot of the first season this is definitely portrayed, but it done in such a subtle way that it avoids the annoyance that would no doubt make it a cliche.  This is more about the intelligent banter between the two main friends of the four, Sheldon and Leonard. Leonard is the more down to Earth character, and although a bit of an outcast in his own right, feels the embarassment that such heightened levels of intelligence and geekyness that he possesses which Sheldon seems to look past.Much like \"Frasier\", this presents an extremely intelligent cast and some genuinely good acting along with presenting the prolongued fish out of water idea rather than weekly random situation that would create a string of gags. The acting within is superb and although the characters may seem quite transparent, there's the potential to have much more depth revealed from within. Kaley Cuoco is the unlikely candidate for this as although the last time I personally saw her was playing generally the same type of character in \"8 Simple Rules\", she expresses genuine potential of a great actress and she displayed her great acting skills in the scenes of \"8 Simple Rules\" following the untimely death of the legend John Ritter. Although that may have been fueled by genuine emotion, she delivered her lines with the same confidence and prowess we had become used to whilst playing to the Daughter who lost her Father story.If we get some emotional scenes, then I expect her to be on the front lines of acting within them. Other than the want of some genuine emotion, there's nothing negative I can say about this show. Throughout it uses a genuinely intelligent script that doesn't patronise the viewer by trying to explain everything they're talking about, or presenting a \"moral of the story is...\" angle to each episode. It gets a strong recommendation and I have to ask that if you haven't seen it already, then the question has to be asked. What the hell have you been doing with yourself?"
B000VZUWZW Leonard Hofstadter and Sheldon Cooper are very smart scientist living together in an apartment  in New York City. They are not very popular and their only friends are fellow scientist Rajnesh (Raj) Koothrappali and Howard Wolowitz who often come over to play games.Then Penny moves in across the way and Leonard has a massive crush on her. The show details how their lives collide each learning from the other, often with very funny consequences."
B000VZUWZW This is a great show that just keeps getting better and better.  The writing is very clever and characters are a riot.  I can't get enough of this show, and get a laugh out of it every time I see it, even the reruns.  One of the most original and funny shows to come around in a long long time.I'm happy to see this out on DVD and hope the show continues.  If you haven't seen the show watch a few episodes.  I think you'll  like it."
B000VZUWZW I really enjoyed this show.  It gets 5 stars from me because I lost count of how many times I laughed out loud.  This show has definite potential!  I will definitely watch this one."
B000VZUWZW I don't think I have busted a gut watching a comedy series until watching \"The Big Bang Theory\".  What a wonderful and hilarious series coming from the minds of Chuck Lorre and Bill Prady.The series is about two physicists Leonard (Johnny Galecki) and Sheldon (Jim Parsons) who live in an apartment together.  One day, they get a new neighbor with Penny, a blonde and beautiful woman from Nebraska who has come to California for a better life but after a bad breakup, finds friendship with Leonard and his friends.Joining Leonard and Sheldon are their two best friends Howard (Simon Helberg), a perverted and horny brainiac and Rajesh (Kunal Nayyar), another brainiac but has a problem with his inability to speak with beautiful girls.What makes this comedy work so well are the character dynamics and each of their quirks.  Especially the character of Sheldon who is just the most anal geek among the three but Parson's Sheldon just is incredible.  Included in this season 1 box set are a total of 17 episodes.1. Pilot - Penny moves into the building and Leonard who is smitten by her agrees to get back her TV from her muscle-bound ex.2. The Big Bran Hypothesis - Leonard is addicted to cleanliness and organization and can't stand Penny's messy room, so he sneaks into her room during the early morning to organize her room.3. The Fuzzy Boots Corollary - Leonard has a date with Penny but she doesn't know it's a date.4. The Luminous Fish Effect - Sheldon gets fired from work and decides to stay at home, concocting experiments and annoying everyone.5. The Hamburger Postulate - Leonard's not sure if he'll ever become Penny's boyfriend, so he and a fellow co-worker decide to have sex, while Sheldon doesn't know what to do when his roommate is having sex in their apartment.6. The Middle Earth Paradigm - Penny's having a Halloween party and all the guys are invited including her ex who picks on Leonard.7. The Dumpling Paradox - What happens when Howard gets lucky with Penny's friend?8. The Grasshopper Experiment - Rajesh finds a way to get over his inability to speak to a woman but what happens when his parents plan an arranged marriage and he has to meet with this woman.9. The Cooper-Hofstadter Polarization - Leonard and Sheldon are invited to present their physics findings but instead leads to a fight between the two.10. The Loobenfeld Decay - Sheldon can't tell a lie, so he puts Leonard in a odd situation.11. The Pancake Batter Anomaly - Sheldon is sick and the guys start to panic and go in hiding, leaving Sheldon with Penny.12. The Jerusalem Quality - A child prodigy comes to the campus and Sheldon is feeling threatened by him.13. The Bat Jar Conjecture - It's time for the physics bowl team and Sheldon is the MVP.14. The Nerdvana Ahhihilation - What happens when Leonard orders a (very large) time machine from a film.15. The Pork Chop Indeterminacy - Sheldon's twin arrives and the guys fall for her.16. The Peanut Reaction - It's Leonard's birthday but what happens when he and Wolowitz get an allergic reaction from eating peanuts.17. The Tangerine Factor - Leonard and Penny go on their first date.AUDIO AND VIDEO:The audio is stereo and nothing major since the show is primarily all dialogue.  As for the video, the earlier episodes has a bit of graininess to it.  I thought maybe playing the disc on a Blu-ray player maybe showing a lot of noise but I checked the disc on another player and it seems that the first few episodes just had a bit of it.  But fortunately, not all of it are like that.  If anything, you see it moreso on the pilot.SPECIAL FEATURES:The DVD box set unfortunately doesn't have too many special features.  Included is a featurette titled \"Quantum Mechanics of The Big Bang Theory: A Behind-the-Scenes Look Into Geek Chic\".  The 20-minutes featurette features interviews with the creators Chuck Lorre and Bill Prady and also the cast.What I found interesting about the featurette was learning how the show was created, how the actors were selected and the use of science in the show.I've always wondered what would happen on television with a lot of the sitcoms now nearly all gone from television except on syndication.  But I have to admit that Monday nights on CBS has become my favorite night thanks to \"The Big Bang Theory\" and \"How I Met Your Mother\".I have to admit that \"The Big Bang Theory\" is just so enjoyable to me because of my enjoyment of super heroes, comic books,  technology, video games, science, etc.  Although these guys are more on the extremeness of geekiness, I can't help but love the show.  It's absolutely one of the best sitcoms right now and for a comedy series, I don't think I have laughed so much since \"Seinfeld\".You can find this season 1 set for a great price and I definitely recommend this TV series!  Give it a try, you'll love it!"
B000VZUWZW When this series came out I watched the pilot episodes and laughed so hard that my housemate thought that there was something wrong with me.  I could completely identify with every character in this sitcom and found a very synchronous connection between the characters, the living spaces and work environment and what I had experienced in my life in a former job.  Sheldon's overt Asperger's Syndrome adds an element of humor that allows us to laugh at \"smart\" people without feeling uncomfortable and out of line.  The timing, writing and character development is done very well on this show and it just continues to blossom from one season to the next.If you are looking for a new, quirky sitcom that turns science on it's head at times .... you may find yourself enjoying \"The Big Bang  Theory\" the way I did those first episodes.  I remember laughing so hard I thought I was going to break a rib.  The newness and very succinct humor really got me good.  If you work in a science background and among scientists ... you will find humor in this great show.I love it!"
B000VZUWZW This season movie I thought was great. I love all of The Big Bang Theory shows and watch them over and over whenever I want a great laugh! Sheldon and Penny make the show but they all are really great acting nerds!"
B000VZUWZW Wow! Who knew this show would be such a hit? It is a mainstay in out TV line up. Good laughs and fun."
B000VZUWZW I never get tired of this show. I think it will go down in history with a following like Seinfeld!"
B000VZUWZW This sitcom is bad ass! Its funny as hell! I will be getting all seasons! Plus it came extra quick and came in excellent condition!"
B000VZUWZW I bought this as a gift for my step-mother who had been wanting to watch the show.  She was hesitant to catch re-runs on tv starting in the middle, so I surprised her with the first season.  This season, more than the others, does take a warming up period.  But, that can be said for any new show.  Funny as all get out!  You won't be disappointed with Big Bang!"
B000VZUWZW This show is hilarious! I highly recommend to any and all who enjoy a good laugh and don't mind a sexual innuendo here and there."
B000VZUWZW Love the Big Bang Theory!  So handy to have a couple of episodes downloaded on my kindle for when I travel"
B000VZUWZW Our whole family loves this hilarious ensemble comedy show.Sheldon is an eccentric physicist with Nobel Prize potential and limited social skills.  His roommate, Leonard, is a run-of-the-mill genius by comparison; also brilliant, but self-aware enough to know there is more to life than physics research.  Their social group is rounded out by Raj, another physicist who is to shy to talk when women are present (unless he has had a few drinks) and Howard, the mere engineer of the group.  These four friends are fairly content to watch science fiction films, collect action figures, and chase girls unsuccessfully . . . until they meet the girl next door (literally), Penny, the aspiring actress and \"dumb blonde\" who can teach these four brilliant scientists a thing or two about enjoying life.The characters are all likeable and relatable in their own ways and mostly nice to one another.You might think these characters are over the top, but I have met enough geeks to know that people like this really do exist . . . and really are entertaining.Fun for the whole family; we haven't yet seen an episode that didn't make us laugh out loud!"
B000VZUWZW Big Bang Theory in My Favorites library now can be streamed any time. Wish I had read the fine print and saw it wasn't HD. But it is a great series."
B000VZUWZW When you meet this group of genius nerds, you will be hooked on The Big Bang Theory!  Dr. Sheldon Cooper is played BRILLIANTLY (excuse the pun) by Jim Parsons and has more quirks than a hedgehog has spikes (but he's not crazy, \"his mom had him tested!\")  Penny (their \"normal\" neighbor) is adorable and charming and has the patience of a saint while putting up with her very strange group of friends.  This is an intelligently written sit-com.  I highly recommend this series!"
B000VZUWZW Sure, we have the creators of this show that came up with the concept and, to be sure, there are the characters that bring the show to life... but who really have the brai
B000VZUWZW PLEASE make the stupid laugh tracks STOP! Every other word... ah hahahaha. Unwatchable. Glad I only wasted my money on the first episode."
B000VZUWZW I love this show---the characters are so three dimensional and believable.  kudos to the writers---it's an exceptional show!I tried to write and tell them that Sheldon would never say, \"smarter than me\" which he does in the Dennis Kim episode when he's talking to Howard.  It's \"smarter than I\" and Sheldon knows that.  If anyone knows how to reach the writers, pass it along."
B000VZUWZW TBBT is one of those shows that people do not stop talking about. After hearing all this great stuff, I thought I should jump in! On a day off, I caught a marathon on TBS. I watched about 4 episodes, didn't find them funny, so I decided it wasn't for me. Recently I won a season in my office's white elephant. I thought I would maybe give it another try, because maybe the episodes I saw where just from when the show was in a dry patch. I popped this disk in, I watched all 7 episodes on that disk, and I didn't laugh once. The problem I have with this show, is that it doesn't really make you think, unlike so many other shows out there such as Arrested Development, Parks and Rec, and Community you don't have to think. The jokes are simple and all the jokes are just 'stand-in jokes' and none of the jokes &#34;come out of the charecters.&#34; I know that was kind of hard to understand haha, but the charecters just don't really feel real., How they portray Asperger's is unbelievably off, they portray people with that disease to be self-centered and really not care for anyone. I have a very close family member that has that disease and he is very kind and not as extreme as that character is. If you wanna see a good portrayal of that disease watch Parenthood or Community. and how &#34;geeky&#34; they are. The overwhelmingly loud laugh track ruins the show, and the acting is just awful. I know some of you probably disagree with me, and that's OK. This is just my opinion."
B000VZUWZW Started by watching reruns - never even considered it before...what was I thinking?  This is the 1st TV show ever, ever, ever that makes me Laugh Out Loud!  (I Never laugh out loud)  I'm now addicted & watch every chance I can.  Love each, but the \"Soft Kitty\" scenes w/Sheldon & Penny..."
B000VZUWZW My real pleasure in this sitcom is watching the interplay between the chief geeks: Leonard, who wants to be normal, and Sheldon, who disdains normality.  Perhaps that's why this show has such a following: many brainy types find themselves torn between wanting to fit into the human race, and having little interest in being ordinary.  I teach at the university level, so I see this basic pattern play out among my colleagues every working day.Leonard has fallen for Penny, the pretty aspiring actress living across the hall.  Sheldon has a very narrow range of interests, in which he continually tries to improve himself, but little concern for anything outside his comfort zone.  Leonard would love to shut off the ideas constantly whizzing around his brain.  Sheldon would love to shut off the world and retreat into those ideas for the rest of his life.  Neither one can have what he wants.These brainiacs attract a huge audience, I contend, because real-life brainy types have both these paradigms at play simultaneously.  I'd love, like Sheldon, to care nothing for sex or approval, and just do what fulfills me.  But I'd also love, like Leonard, to reach outside myself and join the human race as an equal.  Sadly, I can do neither.  So I, and studious geeks worldwide, will sit back and watch these nerds fight that battle for me."
B000VZUWZW Utterly hilariously funny. And wonder of wonders just as funny the 3rd time around. My girl-friend, who has no comics or SF interests, got hooked on it two and we've just finished the 2nd viewing of it - at her insistence. No wonder this show consistently pulls in over 14 million viewers every week."
B000VZUWZW Leonard, Penny, Raj, Howard, Sheldon make this the best show on TV. No swearing, somewhat educational, geeks rule is a great message. Will buy every season ever made."
B000VZUWZW This is a great series and It is different from anything that is on TV these days and i like that about this series!"
B000VZUWZW We purchased the first season used and it arrived quickly and in great shape and with the correct number and of discs and the correct season one discs included. We just became interested in the show and wanted to catch up by watching previous seasons so we've purchased each season and enjoy watching and rewatching them."
B000VZUWZW this is the exact type of garbage which sends tv viewers like me away from the networks in general and nbc in particular away in DROVES.the creators of this show dont seem to know the difference between nerdy and prissy-effeminate. one character looks like a guy in a clown suit and the other is a recycled version of niles crane from frasier.the characers are retarded and this sitcom belongs in 1982 right between hello larry and the facts of life.the most offensive thing is the laughtrack which screams at you from almost the first moment.this show is an absolute insult to the viewer will be taught as an example of what not to do with a sitcom. the idea might have been a cool one if it wasnt written in giant crayons.if they are going for the youth demo with this one, people need to be fired."
B000VZUWZW After several seasons of this show I finally started watching it and I'm not sure why I waited as long as I did. All the elements of this show hit every nail on the head for me. A funny show that mixes elevated humor with more crude humor and actually has a developing story line. Who would have thought this would be a good idea? Oh yeah, the guy behind Two and a Half Men, the show that present humor to the lowest common denominator of humanity, whoda thunk it? This is an amazingly well thought out show in the respect of the characters, while presenting certain character archetypes, which I'm sure will be mined for comedy gold in later seasons, we aren't left with mere empty shells of characters. Instead we actually get to love each character individually by the writers presenting the negative side to each characters oddity. Whether it be Sheldon's staunchness in his character and inability to easily adapt to new situations to Rajesh's inability to communicate with those of the female gender, we're presented with characters who are extremely intelligent but also deeply flawed, creating a situation that is hard to parallel and also hard to make a strong comparison to within this genre. While granted the show does still present itself within the sitcom genre and many of it's tropes, it manages to elevate itself above that with some intelligent writing and some brilliantly acted characters. Sadly the main female lead found in Penny is strongly lacking for me in many regards (let's see if they develop that later on) she is somewhat counter balanced by minor side characters like Leslie Winkle, is this enough to alleviate the bimboness that is Penny at times, obviously not but the end of the first season does lead toward some character develop in that regard. I'm excited that I've finally started to watch this show because I've long felt that with a handful of exceptions (Modern Family, the first few seasons of Raising Hope, 30 Rock - who now that I think about it have much stronger female characters) the sitcom genre is dying a painful death in front of our eyes. With these shows revitalizing our perception and expectation of not only the genre but also what is and is not funny, I have some hope for this uniquely American creation."
B000VZUWZW So, okay, I love the concept and execution of the set. It's a simple set with a single Blu-Ray format case housing first the Blu discs, then the DVDs, and coming with a single UV redemption code for the whole season in high def.It comes with a couple bonus features on both the Blu / DVD discs (last disc, I think?)...Overall, I like the execution. I think this is how things should generally be released going forward. Kudos on that, WB! Blu for high def, DVD for low-def or for sharing with friends who haven't yet upgraded and UV for online streaming or downloadable personal digital copy. Kind of like future-proofing. Makes sense to me.However, I'll note that, for whatever reason, the 'high def' video quality doesn't seem all that great. Especially watching on UV via VUDU (haven't tried yet via CinemaNow to see if the same problems persist via a different UV ecosystem provider). It's especially apparent on the pilot episode, but seems endemic. While it's high def there seem to be lots of compression artifacts abounding making he picture look pretty poor quality, especially noticeable on my 60\" TV when you get right up close. It looks pretty bad...So, I put in the Blu-Ray just to compare. It looks *a bit better* on Blu-Ray proper, but there's still quite a bit of graininess. So, I'm a bit disappointed. I don't know if it's 'cause the original was shot at lower def and upgraded, or whether the transfer just wasn't done cleanly from film or whatever.I haven't yet looked closely at season 2 Blu's yet to see if the problems persist with the transfer. I'll take a look more closely at some point and find out.Overall, though, I love the set and the show itself. And since one sits the better part of 8-10 feet away from the screen the artifacts aren't terribly noticeable at that distance. Right up close it's VERY noticeable, especially streaming, probably due to compression algorithms being somewhat 'lossy?' But I can forgive it sin et
B000VZUWZW This quirky little show is a little to close to reality for me to appreciate the humor.  While everyone else in the room is roaring - I'm twitching with unease because I think I dated Sheldon.  Not the star but a real character who, in my reality, was actually named \"Sheldon\"!  I thought brainiacs were sexy - NO -  they are just guys who's brains have outgrown their heads.  The funniest part in this show is the overt discomfort that is evident in these guys when they find themselves in everyday situations surrounded by dumb folk like you and me.  My favorite episode was when Sheldon got the flu and became the center of the universe (unto himself) and the great effort his friends went to in order to avoid him during his illness.  I think this was the show when I mixed up the TV Sheldon with my Sheldon, another whiney hypocondriac. Oh lord - I'm so confused.Bottom line - this is a funny funny show and well worth the price...bg"
B000VZUWZW Where's the humor?  I get this is a popular show and several people told me they liked it but it totally fell flat for me.  I suffered through one episode and then tossed the DVD into a black hole.  HUMOR: D minus; STORY/PLOTTING: C plus; CHARACTERS/DIALOGUE: C plus; OVERALL GRADE: D plus to C minus; WHEN WATCHED: 02/08/2011."
B000VZUWZW Brilliant show and the writing is very good. (I'm not related to the writers)Somebody must have been a geek in highschool."
B000VZUWZW I got the first season of The Big Bang Theory for Christmas and I have to say that I haven't laughed this hard at a television show in a long time. I heard good things about it, but I could never fit it into my DVR's schedule without getting rid of some other shows that I like. The cast of four nerds and a hot blonde is perfect and the writers have to be just as smart as the main characters to come up with such intricate and funny dialogue. This show is enjoyable even if you don't get all the tech geek talk, but if you understand why one of the characters playing Halo 3 gets pissed off and killed because he got a Needler weapon, then this show will blow your mind."
B000VZUWZW Sheldon: Okay, who's on lithium?Leonard: Huh?Sheldon: Look at our logo.  Three electrons orbiting the nucleus.  If you look at the CGI atom that appears between scene changes, the nucleus consists of six spheres, 3 neutrons and 3 protons, although why one of them is pink and another one is gold is beyond me-Penny: I think the pink one is supposed to be me.Sheldon: That would almost make sense, but then why 6 spheres? There are only 5 of us.  In any event, this is clearly a lithium atom.Howard: Actually, as a matter of fact, I used to be on lithium.  Now I'm on Prozac.Leonard: It's not supposed to represent lithium, it's just supposed to represent...atoms, and..stuff.Sheldon: \"Atoms and stuff?\"  Then it's meaningless.  It's gaudy and comical.  If we are to have a logo, it should be something we can respect.Leonard: Thank you, Dr. Manhattan.Sheldon: I'm serious!  We need to get this logo changed to something actually relevant to the big bang theory.Raj (whispers to Howard, smiling.)Howard: Well, maybe, but how would you turn that into a logo?Raj (whispers some more)Howard: Hmm...Nah, I don't think she'd go for itPenny: No. She wouldn't.Sheldon: You all are talking about coitus, aren't you?If you think any of the above is remotely humorous, get this series.  It's even better."
B000VZUWZW The only \"bang\" in this series for me was the sound of my remote hitting the television screen in disgust. My bad, I bought into all the rave reviews for this abysmal, Erkel-ized comedy.Throw glasses onto Johnny Galecki and it STILL doesn't make him funny. (His casting as the weirdo, brooding idiot on Roseanne I always found strange, too.) Are people finding this \"cute\"? \"Smart\"? All I can say if I am over 50% similar to you, do yourself a favor and find some quality TV sitcom reruns to scratch your comedy itch. This will having you banging your head against the wall."
B000VZUWZW Wow what a terrible show...I had to turn it off and delete it from my tivo before I was half way through it so as not to infect the rest of my tivo with \"unfunny\".It's geeky and awkward but not in an endearing or funny way...just in a bad way.  Bad acting, casting, scripting and on and on."
B000VZUWZW I recently moved to Thailand to teach and there is little to watch in English on t.v. I overheard some co-workers discussing how funny the show is, so I bought the first season DVD. It is so funny I finally had to stop eating while watching to avoid choking, so I bought the other two seasons. Right now I'm trying to figure out how to download season 4 to my PC. I've watched all three seasons several times and it still makes me choke on food, but I suppose eventually I'll get tired of it and stop laughing. Hasn't happened yet, though."
B000VZUWZW Being geeks and sci-fi/fantasy fans, the wife and I enjoy the humor of the Big Bang Theory and a lot of the &#34;in&#34; jokes, spoofs, cameos, and general chemistry among all the actors and the situations they get themselves into."
B000VZUWZW When this series first aired I thought it would be a typical clone series of Friends or Joey or the like but to my surprise and happiness I found it actually has a talented and entertaining cast who keep the series more enjoyable as each season comes out.  I like how it plays on the seemingly stereotypical lifestyles of the vastly intelligent but socially awkward and socially talented but slight less intelligent academically and not always in the same group as you would think.  Many people have wondered if the series has a laugh track like some of the early 80's to mid 90's shows, while you do hear laughter it's actually from an audience rather then a mechanical laugh track.Still if you find it annoying to hear laughter in some of the scenes then this series is one you might want to pass over, while it doesn't distract you from what's going on in the scenes more then half the episodes will have for obvious reasons laughing in them. If you're still unsure of the series I'd say get the first season especially for the price it's going for and see whether or not you will become a fan as I highly suspect or this is a series you'll want to pass over either way I still say the series is worth a try."
B000VZUWZW This is obviously a minority opinion here, but I was not especially high on Season One of THE BIG BANG THEORY.  I first have to confess that sitcoms are my dead bottom least favorite genre of show.  I barely make room for HOW I MET YOUR MOTHER, but all in all it is a format that I find pretty dreadful, on the same level of reality and talent shows and crime procedurals.  I hate the limitations of the camera work, the lack of character development, and -- the worst invention in the history of television -- the laugh track.  Moreover, Season One of TBBT did not get the formula quite right.  Much of it was that they hadn't sufficiently found ways to soften Sheldon's character, who can at times be very funny but at other times -- especially in this season -- be excruciatingly irritating.Season Two saw a number of subtle alterations of the show, mainly softening Sheldon, but also increasing the dynamics between the various characters.  But Season One felt slightly off to me.  I can't help but contrast it somewhat with HOW I MET YOUR MOTHER.  The latter almost acknowledges the limitations of the format and constantly stretches it, including a pretty large number of exterior shots on the Warner Brothers lot.  The show also uses their laugh track much more lightly than TBBT.  Both shows suffer from too small of a cast (a common problem with sitcoms).  The  best comedies are not sitcoms, don't have laugh tracks, are not restricted to sound stages, and have large ensemble casts (cf. MODERN FAMILY, 30 ROCK, ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT, PARTY DOWN, early SCRUBS, and THE OFFICE).On the other hand, it is fun seeing a show with lots of nerd references.  Plus, I've actually known a couple of people who were geniuses along the line of Sheldon (though I should say that perhaps my greatest nerd moment was that when I worked in the University of Chicago Bookstore -- before it became a Barnes & Noble -- Chandrasekhar would always do a beeline to me to get help finding books [hey, having a world class genius -- another Nobel Prize winning physicist told me that in his opinion Chandrasekhar would rank as one of the two great twentieth century physicists after Einstein -- acknowledge your competence on books, even as a lowly book clerk, and nod to you as you walk across the campus may be a faint form of achievement, but if you don't understand this you don't understand the guys on TBBT]).  And as a comic book lover it is fun seeing a show with a lot of references to comics (though they seem to be limited entirely to superhero comics, while that makes up only part of my interest in comics).  But all of this was not quite enough to overcome the sitcom limitations, the laugh track, and irritating way that Sheldon was written in Season One.  The good news is that Season Two represented a huge improvement.  It still isn't among my favorite shows (no sitcom ever could be), but it is one that I will continue to DVR after having caught up on DVD."
B000VZUWZW Finally a comedy that provides food for thought! This DVD also has a few extras at the end. Should be a big hit for college grads & faculty."
