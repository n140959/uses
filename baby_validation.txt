097293751X Perfect for new parents. We were able to keep track of baby's feeding, sleep and diaper change schedule for the first two and a half months of her life. Made life easier when the doctor would ask questions about habits because we had it all right there!
097293751X This book is such a life saver.  It has been so helpful to be able to go back to track trends, answer pediatrician questions, or communicate with each other when you are up at different times of the night with a newborn.  I think it is one of those things that everyone should be required to have before they leave the hospital.  We went through all the pages of the newborn version, then moved to the infant version, and will finish up the second infant book (third total) right as our baby turns 1.  See other things that are must haves for baby at [...]
097293751X Helps me know exactly how my babies day has gone with my mother in law watching him while I go to work.  It also has a section for her to write notes and let me know anything she may need.  I couldn't be happier with this book.
097293751X I bought this a few times for my older son and have bought it again for my newborn. This is super easy to use and helps me keep track of his daily routine. When he started going to the sitter when I went back to work, it helped me know how his day went to better prepare me for how the evening would most likely go. When he was sick, it help me keep track of how many diapers a day he was producing to make sure he was getting dehydrated. The note sections to the side and bottom are useful too because his sitter writes in small notes about whether or not he liked his lunch or if the playtime included going for a walk, etc.Excellent for moms who are wanting to keep track of their kids daily routine even though they are at work. Excellent for dads to keep track as my husband can quickly forget what time he fed our son. LOL
097293751X I wanted an alternative to printing out daily log sheets for the nanny to fill out, and this has worked out great! I'm no longer searching my daughter's bag for a crumpled piece of paper each day. It's also nice to be able to look back on previous days and weeks for eating and sleeping patterns. I would have preferred a plastic-type cover, but it's held up well so far.
097293751X This is great for basics, but I wish the space to write things in was bigger. A lot times I need struggle trying to read what the caretaker wrote in because the spaces go together.
097293751X My 3 month old son spend half of his days with my mother and half with a neighbor while I worked.  I had them track his activity (loosely) in this which allowed me to get an idea of how his schedule was developing and how much milk he was eating.  It was the best way to have some cohesion in his life while I was at work.
097293751X This book is perfect!  I'm a first time new mom, and this book made it so easy to keep track of feedings, diaper changes, sleep.  Definitely would recommend this for new moms.  Plus it's small enough that I throw in the diaper back for doctor visits.
097293751X I wanted to love this, but it was pretty expensive for only a few months worth of calendar pages.  I ended up buying a regular weekly planner - 55% OFF! - The Planner - that is 8 1/2 x 11 and has all seven days on the right page and the left page has room to write a To Do List and Goals.  I found this to be more helpful because I could mark each day's eating and sleeping blocks, then also see them side by side - I could see her patterns more easily with a weekly view.  This planner was cute, just not what I wanted.
097293751X The Baby Tracker brand books are the absolute best of the trackers that are available. You can track naps, feedings, diaper changes, activities, and notes. They're easy to use and have a nice clean layout.I started using the Newborn Baby Tracker, which tracks nights and days. It gave me a nice way to track feedings and note important milestones. Once I used up the entire book, I bought this Baby Tracker, which tracks only days since my daughter is sleeping during the night now. Her caregiver notes her activities and sleeping times during the day. It's a great way for me to know what happened. Plus, it's nice to be able to look back and see patterns or trends.
097293751X During your postpartum stay at the hospital the nurses will ask you to keep a log of your baby's feedings, urination and bowel movements. However, when you get home you do not have a nurse to remind you or ask when your baby's last bowel movement was and you are so overwhelmed with the new schedule you can't even remember what day it is. The daily tracker helped us so much because once we got home our baby cried all the time, could not sleep and we were having major problems breastfeeding. It was so bad we had to contact our pediatrician's after hours on-call doctor. Looking at the tracker we realized a trend, the baby was not feeding for a long time AND we had very few wet diapers and bowel movements. This was an indication our baby was dehydrated and the doctor suggested we start pumping breast milk (to see how much we get) and supplement with formula until sufficient breast milk finally came in. The feeding column we wrote how many ounces of breast milk or formula we gave and how long he breast fed for. In the comments column we use it for tracking how much water I drink because I was not drinking enough to make an adequate supply of breastmilk. For a while I wasn't sure what was giving him horrible gas, so I started to track what I ate in case it was a food allergy (we have a peanut allergy in the family). We even write notes about his first smile, who came to visit, ect to keep in his memory box.
097293751X I use this so that our babysitter (grandma) can keep track of what goes on during the day.  We've recorded so many milestones since we received this.  It is a 6 month diary and has room for notes.  I wish the hours started around 6 am and went until 8 pm, but we just write over certain times to suit our purposes. The nice thing is that if we had a rough night and we are super tired, we have something to refer to if we forgot when we last fed the baby or when he woke up. I also like that the front page has a place for emergency comments and a consent form in case your child needs medical care.  It also has a place at the back of the book for immunizations.  I'll definitely get another one in 6 months when we finish this book.
097293751X This book is a great way for keeping track of daily changing and feedings.  My only wish is that it was in a 24 hour format.  But other than that it is great.
097293751X Has columns for all the info I need at a glance when I get home from work. Nanny is able to fill it out easily....love it
097293751X I like this log, but think it would work better with clearer AM & PM sections. Each page is 12 hours so you really need two pages a day if your baby feeds or wets a lot in the early morning hours between midnight and 7am. We're cramming those in to the 2 blank spaces above 7am right now.
097293751X My wife and I have a six month old baby boy and around the 4-month mark my wife decided that she would return to work instead of being a stay-at-home mom. We hired an in-home nanny to care for our little boy and the arrangement has worked quite well ever since. Shortly after starting the arrangement we realized that we would need some sort of journal to track our little boy's activities while he was with the nanny and we were working. We used a plain notebook for a period of weeks until we stumbled on the Baby Tracker - Daily Childcare Journal.--------------------LAYOUT AND USE:The Baby Tracker is really an excellent idea. The journal pages are clearly divided into columns for tracking feedings, nap-time, diaper changes, play-time as well as general areas for notes and tracking milestones. The legibility in the Baby Tracker is a huge improvement over our standard notebook entries that really ended up becoming small paragraphs. In a few short moments you can summarize all of the data in the columns in the totals section and determine key information - how much did baby eat, did baby have a bowel movement, how much sleep did they get, etc.There are, however, some frustrating limitations with this journal. First the entire layout is about half a notebook sheet divided down the middle (portrait layout). This constrains entries to very small spaces on each column and row. For much of the information that is okay - feedings can be summarized in ounces; diaper changes by a &#34;#1 or #2&#34; and so on. However, once your baby becomes more active and you'd like to know more than &#34;tummy time&#34; under the play-time column things start to get very tight on the page.Another problem is that this tracker only covers 12 hours out of a baby's day. That's fine if the intention is only to track hours while a baby is with child care providers. However, we really wanted to track our little boy's entire day which often starts much earlier than 6am. Using this journal that would require the use of a second page.--------------------WHAT I LIKE ABOUT THE BABY TRACKER:(+) Good layout that is easy to read and instantly gather information about your baby's day in a matter of moments(+) High quality paper(+) Consistent quality between the pages--------------------WHAT I DON'T LIKE ABOUT THE BABY TRACKER:(-) Expensive and gets you at most 6-months, less if you use more than one page for tracking your babies entire day(-) The cover is thick but not a hardback and bends easily in a diaper bag(-) The pages should really be bigger. I understand portability is a concern but the current size is entirely too small--------------------CONCLUSION:I ended up making my own format of this journal in a spreadsheet that includes a 24-hour day and more space for comments along with a few other changes and had the pages bound cheaply at a local shop. This is an adequate journal but expensive for what you get and limitations because of page size.
097293751X I thought keeping a simple handwritten journal would be nice.  But I haven't used this thing at all, and here's why:1.) When you're breastfeeding, it's often nice to have your phone close by so that you can keep yourself entertained.  If you are able to grab *both* your phone and this notebook - and a pen - consistently - and at 3 in the morning - you are more skilled than me.  (I don't nurse in the same place every time.)2.) You're also often so sleep deprived that - at least for me - I'd forget to look at what time we started on a side, or what side we started on.  I'm not perfect with the app I have either, but at least I just have to mindlessly hit a button.3.) I really like the app I have (Baby Connect).  It gives me better data.  For example, it can tell me how long on average feedings have been taking (helpful as we start to think about sleep training).  It can tell me that I nursed him 177 times last month (granted that serves no useful purpose other than a feeling of perverse satisfaction).
9729375011 Easy to use, simple! I got this when my baby was 2 months old and love it. It makes it easy to track things and write down developmental notes in an organized way. I know moms who create spreadsheets of their baby's nap times, etc. But I'm not one of those people! This book is practical and great!
9729375011 We used this to help us keep track of pees and poops during that first month. It is really helpful if you breastfeed to keep track of feeding patterns and wet diapers to make sure baby is eating enough. Great book!
9729375011 This item was extremely helpful, especially with 3 adults sharing baby care responsibilities. My husband of mom didn't have to wake me up to ask when the baby had eaten or been changed. It helped me keep a written record to take to Dr appts so I had all the information they ask you for on hand already, and even helped me note and analyze baby's sleep patterns once he got a little older. Definitely a useful item to have.
9729375011 I've been using the baby tracker since the day my daughter came home from the hospital.  We're on the third one now.  It's useful for when the doctor asks how often she's feeding and urinating, but even better for looking at and realizing, &#34;Oh, she hasn't slept in x number of hours.  She's probably crying because she's tired.&#34;  But the BEST thing it has done for me since her newborn days is help me put her on a nap schedule.  I flipped through a couple weeks and looked at when she seemed to be sleeping during the day and looked for a pattern, then started putting her down for naps around those same times each day.  It helps a lot.
9729375011 Of course this has been a great/easy way for me to record all of my baby's routines and a simple way for his caregiver to let me know how the day went.  What I really love about it, though, is that it was so easy for me to jot down all of his major milestones as they happened.  I knew that I wouldn't have time to work on his baby book in the beginning (and sure enough I didn't even get it out until after 2 months), and because I had this book I was able to finally transfer everything over.  Life saver!!  All of the funny little things would probably have been forgotten!
9729375011 I've been using this since the day my baby was born (1 month ago) and it is a life saver!  It is a great way to track when I breastfeed, what breast he ate from, how long, etc.  Plus when pee diapers are changed and poopy diapers.  Our Pediatrician is always asking # of Wets and # of Dirty Diapers per day...so I bring this book to our appts and let her see it all.  I color code each item so its very easy to tell at a glance when he last ate, slept, or pottied.  I plan on ordering 3 more so I have enough to track this entire first year of his life!
9729375011 I didn't think I would really use this and I was wrong.In the hospital they were constantly asking &#34;when was her last diaper?&#34;, &#34;when did she eat and for how long?&#34; - ummmm I was on pain killers for a c-section and a mass of hormones. I finally got this out and started keeping track using this.Yes, you could just use regular paper, but I liked the layout of the pages and it was just what we needed a we slowly lst our minds for the first 6 weeks.I an on giving this as a shower gift to the next first time mom :)
9729375011 I have used this book since my son was born.  It's a great and handy way to keep track of when and how much eats and when I change his diaper.  Makes it easy to discuss his progress with his doctor.  This journal is great for his grandparents who watch him while I'm gone.  They are able to maintain his schedule and it makes it very easy for me to see how he is doing while I'm at work.  Highly recommend this journal for all parents of children especially for those with little ones under a year of age.  I'll definitely continue to buy this every 3 months until at least my son is a year old.
9729375011 I am 4 weeks from delivery of my first baby and was looking for a newborn tracker. From the reviews I read this one looked like it had everything that one needs to write down and remember, so I bought it. I have not used it but I am very happy with what I saw. Hope it ends up being as useful at it looks.
9729375011 I have used this tracker for all 3 of my children and swear by it! It is super easy to leave by the baby's changing table or crib and jot down things throughout the day (feedings, dirty diapers, nap times, etc). I also used it to jot down other important &#34;mile stone&#34; things that I would have quickly forgotten&#8230;like outings, temperature readings, visits from friends to meet him, calls to make, when we stopped swaddling him, etc. I was able to use it as a resource when (many months later!) I went back to formally fill out his baby album since I would have forgotten so many of those valuable little tidbits of information & memories.
9729375011 We found this book at a rummage sale and found it to be so useful, especially when several people are helping with the baby (ex: visiting family, etc.)  We loved it so much that I've bought another one and have almost filled that one too.  I like having the room to write things about our baby's day and development, plus use the \"Notes\" section to write some story, etc.  It also helps \"Dad\" see what has happened that day and feels more connected.  I will be buying another one soon!
9729375011 GREAT journal. We use this everyday to communicate feeding, medicine and other needs when I don't have time to give my nanny the full rundown. LOVE it! I've bought two!
9729375011 I have been using this baby tracker for three months and it has been very useful.  My little one had feeding issues and it was necessary to explain his habits and behavior to the pediatrician and several lactation consultants.  His feeding issues also contributed to sleep issues, which I was also able to track in the journal.  After weeks of sleep deprivation, the Dark Period, I could easily respond to the pediatrician's questions by referring to entries in the baby tracker.It's nice to look back at the Dark Period and see how far we've come.
9729375011 Great way to keep track of important daily activities/tasks when you are trying to get used to your new baby's routine.I include this as a gift to all of my friends now when they are having a baby.
9729375011 Love this book! Just finished our first one and am starting a second one.  It makes life much easier knowing my child's meal and nap times. Much easier to plan you day around baby when you can start predicting what their schedule will be for the day. Excellent for communication for when you don't have your child. Even when I'm at work, that night I know exactly how my childs day has gone just by looking at his book. Plus it makes it easier on the caregiver to learn childs patterns as well. I recommend this to all new moms! Especially during those first few weeks/months when growth spurts are common and you can't remember anything because you haven't slept much!
9729375011 THis has been helpful in tracking the feedings, diaper changes, naps and other developmental things for our little one but I REALLY wish they had laid it out so that you could leave it open and have the left side be AM and the right PM.  The way the pages are set up you have to flip a page to see a full day (starts with PM on the left and A.M. on the right).  It's a nitpick but if they had just let the user fill in AM or PM then the pages would be identical and you could look at a full day at a glance (with your hands full, holding a baby).  Sort of a pain to have to lean forward to pick it up and flip a page over just to see what happend prior.
9729375011 I bought this tracker when my daughter was 4 weeks old. I was having problems remembering how much she was eating, whether she was sleeping better or not. This helped me keep track of those things and more. I could look back and see if there were any changes in her eating habits - it wasI started using it like a little journal that my daughter can see when she's older. I kept notes about her moods, what she did during the day. It even became a good tool to use with my nanny once I went back to work.
9729375011 if I didn't suck at documenting. Not sure exactly what made me think that I could keep up with recording every feeding, diapering, and sleep session. I was able to keep up with it for about 3 weeks...and then it fell by the wayside. I can really see how this would help with finding a schedule but I decided to let baby lead since we have a very flexible lifestyle.
9729375011 Easy to track feeding, playtime, changes, naps etc.  Very helpful when nursing and even when you move on to a bottle. I work F/T so it's great to come home and peruse his day (feeding schedule, play time)  as a secondary account after talking to nanny. Would highly recommend for those Type-A personas.
9729375011 My husband gave this to me as a Christmas gift as our baby was due in February. This is a great book to have during your first month of having a baby. With the restless nights and the nights blending together, it&#8217;s so easy to forget the last poopy diaper or what side and time you started feeding your little one. I used this book religiously for a month. After that, I just stored it into my newborn box. I will defiantly use it again for my next baby!
9729375011 The layout of the hours are a little tricky but it does the job.  The print on each page is a light grey, so trying to journal diapers, bottles, meds in the middle of the night is a challenge.  It is detailed in slots to make notes and I would prefer a journal that does not take space for breast-feeding if one chooses formula only.  I could use the space to make more notes and comment on something cute that day.
9729375011 This is the best way to keep track of when your baby eats, sleeps, poops, gets a bath, etc. It's also a great way to keep track of which side baby nursed on. I took this to all infant doc appt. And it's a great gift!
9729375011 Please, please take this to the hospital with you- you'll thank me later. We did, but it stayed in the suitcase for 2 days because we were SO &#34;out of it&#34; dealing with my c-section,, etc. We  had been keeping notes -on loose sheets of paper- of baby's feedings and diaper output (so crucial those first few days). We were also using an iPhone app that proved more annoying than useful.  Whenever a nurse or pediatrician walked in the room, we couldn't find which paper scrap we'd written it on. Frustrating and inaccurate. Once we started using the baby tracker, we could see easily all the info in one page, quickly update it and keep us on top of things like expected time of next feeding, etc. I have continued using it and it really makes me feel organized and in control. I carry it around the house with baby, and my husband can add entries using the same format- no more trying to rely on memory to see baby's needs and patterns. Can't recommend enough!
9729375011 I find this tracker very useful. I've been using it for my now 3mo son. I keep it by my chair where I nurse him, so I can stay on top of jotting things down. It has helped figure out his sleeping and eating patterns - great!
9729375011 This has been my go to for my scheduling of my twins. They are four months old now and I have their care givers fill this in when they can. That way I have an idea of the schedule they are developing. I highly recommend this!
9729375011 Inside is nice and clean. Columns for diaper changes, amount feed, comments, etc. The time intervals are :30 minutes seems adequate, though sometimes I wish it was a bit more detailed. Also would have liked a ribbon or movable tab/page to keep track of what page in the log book we are at.  All in all, it does what is advertised and keeps us sane on what was done/changed when.
9729375011 While I love the app on my phone (Baby ESP) for my husband and I-- it's not realistic for someone filling in to download the app. Our parents, who frequently watch our baby, have yet to embrace the app world.So, we use this on days when we have help. It keeps track of everything the doctor will ask you. (How many poop diapers, how many pee diapers, how often are you feeding, how often is he sleeping, what's his schedule like). We usually end up entering the data when we get home so our app can tabulate everything for us in easy to read charts.I kind of like this too because it helps us to review what was going on during the day while we weren't at home.
9729375011 I used this for my little on and it was really nice for me as a new mom to have everything so well organized.  There was sufficient space for notes I didn't think, but all in all it was nice to have everything laid out.  If you're organized you could easily make one of these yourself and not spend the money, but when we had our baby I just needed one thing done for me and not have to do it myself and for that it was very helpful.
9729375011 The Daycare workers were offended by the book at first but after explaining its usefulness they realized how handy it is becoming.
9729375011 This is probably one of the greatest inventions. Before my baby was born, I purchased this and figured it's a nice-to-have item.I didn't realize until the first day home from the hospital how I would be RELYING on this simple, but easily organized log book. When you are sleep deprived and learning everything for the first time, you don't know which way is up or down sometimes. It can be extremely overwhelming, especially when breastfeeding every 2 hours. This book is a life-saver. It literally never left my side for the first 6 months. (I bought a second one after the 3 months one was done.)I used it to keep track of diaper changes and what kind (pee/poop), naps, and how long my baby nursed on each side. I also wrote notes for each day so I could see a history of reactions/milestones. It made it easier to figure out what gave my baby gas or why she slept better on certain days.Coupled with the Itzbeen Pocket Nanny Timer (which is also a necessity), I never really lost track (or my mind). It's also great for care-takers too, especially when they are picking up for an hour or two when you run out.Please get this for anyone you know who is expecting a baby and they will thank you! One of the most useful items yet.
9729375011 This product is awesome. It was so helpful to keep track of feedings and diaper changes in those early, sleep-deprived days. Would definitely recommend and will likely purchase again for our next baby.
9729375011 Perfect way to keep track of the day for a little one-- this journal allows for detailed tracking of milk intake, diapers, sleep, and activity. Highly recommended as a perfect way to keep track and organize information in one easy to travel with place!
9729375011 This was a lifesaver especially during the first couple of months.  Being a new mom (and dad) we were exhausted and I can't imagine trying to remember when the baby was last fed, changed, etc. without something like this by our sides 24 hours a day.  It is a good size and plenty of room to write everything down that you need.  It is laid out very well and easy to read/understand when handing off care from parent to parent (or whoever).  Once this ran out I bought another type of journal and am wishing I had just bought this one again.
9729375011 I did a lot of researching on what baby journal to buy and settled on this one and I did not regret it even for a second. This book is perfect! You can keep track of anything your baby does, from eating and sleeping and diapering to all the other things they do like first smile and first laugh. I only wish that instead of being 3 months it would be longer, like 6 months or even 1 year. I would definitely recommend for the first months of your baby's life.
9729375011 I loved this tracker so much, I bought several more and used for the entire first year. It's a great way to see a new infants progression toward feeding and sleeping schedules. In the sleep deprived first weeks it was so helpful in keeping track of diaper count, feeding sides,  etc. Once we introduced solid foods, I could track when I offered new foods to watch for signs of intolerance.  I just purchased again for new baby's arrival. I highly recommend for new or seasoned moms.
B00000IZQI My son's therapist brings this toy over and he just loves it.  He loves to move the ladder on the fire truck up and down.  This is one of his favorite toys and he doesn't play with a lot of baby and toddler toys (gets bored easy).
B00000IZQI I really like these and so do my kids.  They like to roll them around as well as nesting them.  The only thing that could be improved is for there to be 5 cars.  4 is just kind of a random number to teach a young child to count to.
B00000IZQI Both of my boys (1 and 2.5) love stacking and building.  They also love cars.  So this was an obvious choice for a great toy for them.  They both love these cars!  All of the cars have a little &quot;surprise&quot; (the ladder on the firetruck &quot;clicks&quot; as it raises up and down, the siren on the police car spins, etc.) &amp; they are all numbered which is great for counting and number recognition as they get older.  They're also a great way to teach abstract concepts like smallest, bigger, biggest.
B00000IZQI These are such nice cars to teach little ones numbers and the stacking value.  Ours have been scooted across the floor, cat's tail, into walls, you name it and they've always come back for more.  It's just a nice change from the nesting blocks and it's fun to hear all the vehicle sounds that children make with these guys.  I'd buy them again for sure!
B00000IZQI My daughter received this as a gift when she was born and when she was on her tummy I used to line them up for her to look at and try and grab.  The bright colourful colours really held her attention.  When she was sitting we played the &quot;Mummy stack them, Baby knock them down&quot; game and &quot;peek-a-boo&quot; with the smaller colours under the bigger cars.  They proved to be a favourite for pushing around the floor as she was crawling and something to chew on (especially the small green one) when she was teething.  At 2, she still sometimes gets them out of the toy box to stack and knock over.  She is now teaching her baby sister the stack and knock over game!  Great for learning big and small, colours and numbers.  Good value!
B00000IZQI These are a huge hit with my one year old son.  We received these cars as a gift when my son was first born.  He started taking a real interest in them when he was about seven months old and still plays with them every day.  They are simple, durable, do not require batteries, and are easy to clean.  We've traveled a lot with my son and these make terrific travel toys as they pack up easily and don't take up much space since they nest.  The smallest car rattles and is the perfect size for little hands.
B00000IZQI I bought this last month for my 6 month old son, and it continues to fascinate him.  It is fabulous to encourage moving and crawling as I set them around him and they slide away as he reaches for them -- its been invaluable in encouraging him towards crawling and scooting. When he does get hold of them, exploring the ladder on the fire truck develops his fine motor skills too, and he like chewing on all of them and shaking the rattly little one!  He'll probably soon be able to work the sun roof. It will be a stacking toy later too! Great value for money...
B00000IZQI We bought these trucks for our 15 mo. old daughter and 4 mo. old son- We love them!  They are nesting which is fun for our daughter to look underneath the trucks to find the next one or they can stack one on top of the other to make a tower.  Perfect first trucks!  And they aren't too big- a perfect size!
B00000IZQI This is a wonderful toy that is fun, educational, and affordable! The cars are different colors, and each has a different number, 1 - 4, to help a child learn counting and colors. They also stack on top of each other and nest inside of each other.(The nesting feature is great for storage too). Each car has a neat fun feature for little ones to explore (e.g., the small car is also a rattle, the large fire truck's ladder moves, etc.) The cars are also very sturdy (as has been proven by my son repeatedly banging them together,) and they are easy for little hands to grab onto. At 6 months of age, my son really enjoys looking at the toys, passing them from one hand to the other, banging them together, and, of course, putting them in his mouth. I imagine this toy will remain one of my son's favorites as he learns to stack them and roll them on the floor. I would highly recommend this item.
B00000IZQI I was looking for something different than your typical stacking cups for my sons birthday.  His aunt got him these.  What a hit! My son can't quite stack them himself, but he knows how to nest them and sure does love knocking them down when I stack them.  They also have the function of just being play cars, which is nice.  I am amazed at how long my son will play with these!
B00000IZQI For well over a year my son has enjoyed stacking and playing with these cars. They have held up brilliantly to his abuse - they still look like new. Fun to stack, fun to roll. Clever toy that has been a winner with my son since he was one.
B00000IZQI This is a wonderful toy that is fun, educational, and affordable! The cars are different colors, and each has a different number, 1 - 4, to help a child learn counting and colors. They also stack on top of each other and nest inside of each other.(The nesting feature is great for storage too). Each car has a neat fun feature for little ones to explore (e.g., the small car is also a rattle, the large fire truck's ladder moves, etc.) The cars are also very sturdy (as has been proven by my son repeatedly banging them together,) and they are easy for little hands to grab onto.

B00000J3LL I think this is an adorable book. The pieces are all attached and each page has a cute activity. Several things though--1. If you sew you can make one that is more directed to your child. And if you sew you will realize this is very over priced.2. Some of the activities are too hard for the age group that would be playing with this book.
B00000J3LL I had a homemade quiet book when I was a kid and saw some on pinterest.  Since I don't know how to sew, I visited Etsy to see if I could buy one from that site.  I couldn't believe the prices!  I found this and ordered it for my three kids (9 mos, 2 years, and 3 years), and they all love it.  It's pricey, but it's good quality and much easier on the pocketbook than others.  Great book, and I love that all the pieces are attached!
B00000J3LL This book keeps my 2-year-old entertained for a decent amount of time, and I like that it's washable.  It has a good number/variety of activities in it, especially as compared to other similar types of books.There are some activities for babies, but I think toddlers/pre-schoolers will get the most use out of it.  My daughter has a hard time getting the snaps on/off (they require a little extra &#34;elbow grease&#34; and/or for you to hold down the fabric on the page).  There are also some &#34;older&#34; activities, like the clock, or tying a shoe.Overall, good purchase.
B00000J3LL I had a book similar to this as a child and it brings back wonderful memories! My 20 month old struggles with several of the items, such as the shoe laces and snaps. But he loves the zipper and the Velcro shapes and the other pages give him a great way to learn and practice. Overall it's an item that he can grow into and it's super cute!
B00000J3LL my 3 and 4 year old love this book. we take it to church to entertain them and each week they are excited to get it out
B00000J3LL I really like this book. You can show your baby shapes, teach her how to use buttons, zipper and snaps, tie a shoe and tell time. My baby is too young for most of these activities at this time, but she already loves to play with this book. I see a lot of quality time spent with this book in the future.
B00000J3LL I bought this book for my almost 2 year old daughter hoping it would be a nice activity on a plane trip. It is well constructed and attractive (though I must say not as nice as the quiet book my mother sewed for me as a toddler).The activities are:Page 1: Shape matching, different colored shapes match to same shaped outlines with velcro attachments. The velcro spots are a little small and flimsy.Page 2: Clock - the hands move freely, well constructed (my daughter isn't ready to learn the time but likes moving the arrows and talking about numbers)Page 3: Buttoning flowers to same colored buttons (this is too hard for my daughter to accomplish but I have her tell me where to button it by matching colors)Page 4: Tie the shoe - wish the string were a little longer which would make the task easierPage 5: Zip up the dress - my little one likes zippers - wish it had the ability to zip completely open so she could practice matching up the ends of the zipperPage 6: Buckle the pants buckle - this one is tricky!Page 7: Snap balloons on to color matched strings - the plastic snaps take a decent amount of pressure to apply and are a little hard to accomplishPage 8: 4 different texture and color swatchesOverall I think this book will last a long time and my daughter will be able to appreciate it more as she grows older.
B00000J3LL I got this quiet book for my 11 month old - for his 1st birthday coming up. He hasn't been able to play with it yet, but I was very happy going through it. I think he will have years of fun with this book. It provides several activities, which will help him practice skills he will be learning. It's also got bright colors and fun shapes that he is sure to enjoy. Can't wait to give it to him! Thanks.
B00002JV9S Bought for 1yr old son bc his molars were coming in - it's cute, colorful but my son didn't seem to like it.
B00002JV9S My son loves to chew on things and is still awaiting his first tooth. His older brother had the strawberry vibrating teether but I prefer this one because it doesn't look so feminine and it is also less expensive.
B00002JV9S This teether is ridiculous. It's huge, it's hard to clamp down on, and my daughter had no idea what was going on when it started vibrating in her mouth.It's just too big, awkward, and hard to push down on. Not worth the money, in my opinion.
B00002JV9S My son loves this.  It took him a few tries to get the hang of it but its real simple for him to use.  When he bites it and it vibrates, he starts laughing and the tears disappear.
B00002JV9S While I sort of wish I could change the batteries in these things instead of buying a new one when it dies (my little guy HAS to have it vibrate), this was a life saver for me when both my kids (one 4 years and one 6 months) were/are teething. And for my youngest, it's just about the only thing that works.
B00002JV9S This was a favorite as soon as my son figured out that when he would bite it, it would vibrate. It either is really soothing or he just likes how it feels or something because hes 10mo old now and he still loves it...! Handle is great to put links around also to attach it to stroller or carseat!
B00002JV9S My daughter likes this one. She especially loves the rattle at the end and the vibrating motion. I believe this is for babies that are a little more older. I gave this to her when she was 4 months since she keeps on sticking items in her mouth.
B00002JV9S my 5mth old daughter really likes this teething toy. it has just the right amount of vibration and it triggered easily enough where she can activate it herself with little effort. i like that the 3 sides of the star have different ribbing so it feels different on her gums. great product for the money and a must have for a teething baby.
B00002JV9S I thought my daughter would LOVE this product, but not the case..it is made well..But you have to bite down REALLY hard to make the vibration work :( She does however like the toy at the bottom of it!
B00002JV9S Our teething little five month old girl can't really make it vibrate, but the eight month boy grandchild does.  He likes it OK.
B00002JV9S It is a great toy for them to chew and play with, but it is a bit harder for smaller babies to chew on. The vibration was a bit stronger than I was expecting, but it does not seem to bother my son a bit.
B00002JV9S Great teething ring and toy.My 6 mth loves it, its so much fun.he loves the vibration, the little color wheel to the other end he loves to spin.something fun to bite on for his aching gum.I recommend it!
B00002JV9S My son loved this toy form the time he was teething until well after the time he got his teeth in. I plan on buying this for my daughter who is now 3 months even though she is not teething yet, she loves putting things in her mouth.
B00002JV9S The teether just arrived for my ten month old who seems to be cutting his second tooth.He's already figured out how to activate the vibration.  It is soft, yet has some ridges and bumps that he is pulling with his teeth and gums.  I think baby gives it 5 stars!!!There were contradictory reviews on whether the batteries were replaceable or not- the packing says they are NOT.  So unless whoever said they were replaceable is just handier than the rest of us, they do not appear to be replaceable.
B00002JV9S Great toy for teething! My daughter finds this very interesting especially when it gently vibrates and massages her gums. It didn't take her long to press down with her front teeth to activate the massaging action. She's enjoyed this just about everyday since we got it about 3 months ago. No issues with it! I sent one to a friend who just had her baby for when she starts teething.
B00002JV9S I have a 6.5mo old who loves when we tap on toys when he has them in his mouth, yes sounds weird.  Husband is a drummer and got him obsessed with the tapping even when he is drinking out of his bottle my baby will try to tap the bottle with his hands to feel the vibration.  He has a mini dodge ball and he sticks his face/mouth on the ball and all you have to do is tap the ball and he's a happy baby.  I also bought an infant gum massager electric toothbrush because he was always interested when I brush my teeth.  He loves that as well but has to be supervised so he doesn't choke, you think for long skinny objects made for babies that they would make a guard block to prevent any type of choking.This teether will be better if it had an on/ off button, my baby not able to bite down hard enough to turn it on and once again we have to hold it for him to turn it on.  I was trying to find a teether with vibrations he can use by himself.
B00002JV9S I am so glad we invested in this product....at the time the baby was teething like a feind and this was a life saver!!!
B00002JV9S thought would be a great idea for my almost 1 y/o...however, she really doesn't like it.  perhaps if i knew about it/introduced it to her when she was smaller she would be more apt to use it...she does like the rattle aspect of it and i vibrate her tummy, lol.  so it's not a complete waste
B00002JV9S A must in addition to all the teething toys. Next to Sophie the giraffe this is his favorite. I. Don't really know if the vibration massages. His gums, but he does enjoy biting into it a lot!
B00002JV9S This is a great teether.  It is very easy for the little one to stimulate the vibrating action, making it a huge hit!
B00002JV9S This product sucks. My little boy LOVES to chew on things while he's teething - and he bites down hard. He was never able to bite hard enough to get this dumb thing to vibrate. Very disappointing.
B00002JV9S I got this as a shower gift but could not use it for awhile. The handle is kinda big and the chewing surface kinda wide. It also takes a lot of force to get it to vibrate and that took a while for my daugher to figure out, at first I had to hold down one of the corners for her while she chewed on the other. Once she got a little bigger it was a much better toy for her. But don't get me wrong she loved it when she was itty bitty she just needed a little help from mommy.
B00002JV9S I like this product a lot, but was very excited to receive it to apply on my 5 month old who is starting the whole teething process... the product vibrates great, the colors are attractive to her, and as soon as she sees it its the first thing she wants to grab. However, its a little heavy for her and in order to make it vibrate I have to hold it because it requires more strength than her tiny mouth has at the moment. Hopefully as she becomes stronger she can use this product better. 
B00002JV9S The yellow part vibrates once little gums/teeth chomp down on it. easy to hold on to, can easily hook (Via rings or carabiner) to a diaper bag etc. Both my kids loved it while teething.
B00002JV9S Our son's occupational therapist recommended this for our aggressive teether. She thought he was using teething as a way to stimulate and calm himself. He liked playing with it more than he liked teething on it.
B00002JV9S I have two of these teethers and both see variable use as my little guy goes through teething spurts.In between, he actually likes sitting or kneeling on the star to get it to vibrate.But as soon as his gums start hurting, he goes straight for this toy.Also, it's a smart packaging extra to have the 'free ring' on top which clearly doubles for hanging purposes.
B00002JV9S My son is obsessed with this teether!! He was first more fascinated with spinning the bottom part and chewing on that but after 4 months of having it, he has now switched and loves the rubber/vibrating part. I don't know what I would do without this one, I think it is a must have! Not only a teether but a toy as well :)
B00002JV9S It is somewhat difficult for my daughter to get it to vibrate, but when I help she seems to get one relief.  Cute toy snd she seems to like it even when it isn't in her mouth.
B00002JV9S This toy was our go-to when my daughter was teething.  It really soothed her and calmed her down.  When her two year molars started coming in we got it back out for her and she still loved it.  We will definitely be buying another one for our next baby!
B00002JV9S Both my daughters loved this teether. It made them happier than any other product on the market, including a certain rubber giraffe.
B00002JV9S This works well to keep a baby busy. It's just too bad you can't change the battery. The battery hasn't run out yet though. I did buy this previously for another baby and I don't recall the battery running out for a long time.
B00002JV9S Initially, my baby was not able to cause it to vibrate on his own because he just wasn't chomping down hard enough. But now, he can do it. Now, he's able to see the cause and effect of using this. I like that. Plus, I think it feels good on his gums.
B00002JV9S My baby liked the massaging action but it took time for him to realize how to do it. When he finally did, the battery gave out nearly the same day. The battery would work in short spurts after a rest but I wouldn't waste my money on it again.
B00002JV9S Bought this based on the reviews. My daughter is an early teether at 3 months old. My only complaint is that she has a hard time activating the vibration by biting hard enough. This has allot to do with her age. I have to hold one of the corners for her to activate the vibration. She LOVES it, I only wish it had an on/off switch so I didn't have to hold it for her. She actually cries when I try to take it away from her.
B00002JV9S At first my 7 month old could not initiate the vibrating on her own. However after only a day or two she figured it out and seems to enjoy it but still seems to prefer Sophie over anything else. Actually her favorite thing to chew on (she's just now getting her first tooth) is my little coach wallet- I guess she likes the leather or something but she is quite obsessed with it! This massaging teether does keep her busy in the car seat though.
B00002JV9S My baby loves the vibrations on his teeth. He also shakes it like a rattle. This product is good quality.
B00002JV9S At first he was unsure about it, but now he likes to use it. I would say it's more a fun toy to chew on and not actually providing teething relief
B00002JV9S I've bought several teethers and this i one of the best ones. The vibration helps ease the discomfort and the colors make it also very interesting.
B00002JV9S I thought this would be great for my teething baby, but the vibration freaks him out.  He wants nothing to do with it.  =(  It might be a wonderful product for other babies, though!  It appears to be well-made.
B00002JV9S Both of my kids have loved this during the teething stage.  The one complaint I have is that they have to really bite down hard to get it to vibrate so I often found myself squeezing it for them as they pulled it to their mouths
B00002JV9S My baby hated this thing so I cannot comment on it's effectiveness. Bit it seemed like a cool idea. Passed it on.
B00002JV9S If I can recommend one teether to buy for your teething baby, it would be this one. The vibration made it fun and it took the edge off for my little guy. The shape/handle made it really easy for him to hold. We never leave the house without this thing and it is the go-to gift I give to all my expecting friends.
B00002JV9S Baby loves this teether. Nice to have something different from all of the other teethers out there. The nice thing is that when she no longer wants it to vibrate, she still has fun the with handle the spins. Great product and it has lasted despite being thrown all around.
B00002JV9S My friend recommended this teether because her daughter loves it.  However, my daughter loves throwing it on the floor.  Hopefully, it will work better for you.
B00002JV9S We have another vibrating teether that is very similar to this one, there are some differences though.This one is much softer on the outside which could be nice on tender gums.This one has 3 points that she can use to pin point the problem area.Each point has a different texture (bumps, ridges) so there is some varianceThis one seems like it is easier to activateI will say that I don't know if she favors one for the other.  It seems like she uses them both about equally.She also likes to play with it by making it vibrate on her hands, feet, cheeks etc.  We have had a lot of fun playing with it.It's a great find and I wish I had come across it sooner.
B00002JV9S My son really likes this teether.He likes the bottom as well as the vibrating side.My only issue is that it is a bit large and a bit heavy,and he tends to slam it a lot (often on my hand or leg)when I am holding him. Overall, a winner
B00002JV9S I have two and the batteries haven't died which I find impressive. These are well made. A year later, my son still likes these and likes the green spinner on the end a lot.
B00002JV9S We bought multiples of these, just so we'd have them.  It vibrates while our little 9-month-old bites on it!  He never took a pacifier, but this toy is the closest thing--sometimes when he's screaming, this toy is the only thing that'll calm him down.  So glad we found it.  Definitely worth the money.
B00002JV9S The product is great. I would push down the edges to make it vibrate and hold it against my baby's gums and he seemed to like it. However, the reason I gave it four stars and not five is because he doesn't bite down hard enough to make it vibrate on his own, and so he lost interest in it fairly quickly.
B00002JV9S This is one of my twin sons favorite teethers, but they are only six months old and right now it is too heavy for them to hold by themselves, so we have to sit and hold it in their mouths for them.  This is not a huge deal, and I'm sure in another month or so they will be able to manage, but I just wanted to let other parents know that this is not something you can just hand your baby.  Having said that, when we do hold it for them, they love it and want to gnaw on it for at least 15 minutes or so.  Also, it is different from other teethers in that when they are done using it, they don't seem like they are still in pain and need to go gnaw on something else.  They actually seem like they feel better, so we are able to give them less ibuprofen which I feel is really a good thing.
B00002JV9S Everyone should buy this!  Such a soothing gift.  My granddaughter liked to just explore with it as well,  Not necessarily just to sooth gums.
B00002JV9S Our 6 month old can't bite on this thing hard enough to make it vibrate on his own, so we have to squeeze it and help him hold it in his mouth (it's also heavy).  He seems to enjoy the way it feels, but it's actually so hard to squeeze that even our hands get tired after a minute or so.  Maybe better for older teethers?
B00002JV9S Our teething baby absolutely loved loved this product and would seek it out to sooth his sore gums.  Its lasted a year now with no issue or wear and tear.
B00002JV9S My daughter loves to chew on both ends of this teething aid.  She also likes it because it has some weight to it and she can really throw it pretty far! I would recommend this teething aid if you're looking for a vibrating teether.
B00002JV9S A favorite in our house!
B00002JV9S I had this very teether for my twin boys 8 years ago and they absolutely loved it.  So, when my new baby started teething, I sought out the same teether.  I was surprised when it arrived and the packaging stated that the product is, \"safety tested\" for BPA, lead, and phthalates.  It does not state ANYWHERE on the package that it is BPA free.  As a former regulator (of medical devices) I am very sensitive about company labeling and statements.  Perhaps too much so.  But, I would rather err on the side of caution where my child is concerned, and the lack of clear \"BPA free\" labeling on this product gives me pause.  Specifically, when they test it for BPA, lead, and phthalates, is there an acceptable amount allowed?!  If not, why wouldn't the company simply label the product as BPA, lead, and phthalate free?Eight years ago, when I gave this toy to my sons, no one had ever heard of BPA.  My boys put all manner of plastic toys in their mouths, and I'm sure it was all riddled with BPA.  But, in this day and age, when BPA is strongly suspected of being dangerous, I cannot in good conscience allow my new baby to chew on anything that MAY contain it.  And, though someone on this site indicated that a representative from the company TOLD them it was BPA free, I'm still skeptical.  Again, why not label it as such?  Most companies proudly label their products with that simple language that cannot be confused.
B00002JV9S Don't waste your money, my son would rather suck on his fingers than to use this messaging corn teether.  The massager really has to be squeezed in order to work. :(
B00002JV9S I bought this for my 2.5 year old with special needs, on the recommendation of her occupational therapist. It sooths her like nothing else. We put it in her mouth and she immediately relaxes and even falls asleep with it. Unfortunately, from all that use, they don't even last a week in our house. I'm still buying more.
B00002JXFI My son has had this teether since he was 3 months old. I thought maybe he's just too young & not interested in it(even though he did have 2 teeth already) He is now 8 months old, and still isn't very interested in this teether. The reason I bought it was because it was in-expensive and easy for him to hold & pick up. He would rather pick up a toy car, or some sort of stuffed toy, which I understand every child is different. My only big complaint - the star bead on the end. It is hard, and pointy. If it catches my son's sore, in-coming teeth the wrong way, he will cry. Other then that, the colors are great, and definitely catch baby's eye. Overall, it's an OK toy for the price.
B00002JXFI My daughter is 6 mo and loves these. No funky smell, bpa free. Just dont kneel in them! The star has rounded edges. So far so good.
B00002JXFI This is a great toy for teething babies!  The colors catch their attention while the different shapes keep their hands and mouths amused.  The size is just right for them to actually hold on to it too.  I'd recommend it to any parent of a very young child- especially for the price!
B00002JXFI My daughter loves this and it keeps her happy for a long time.  It is also very easy to wash to keep clean as well.
B00002JXFI my daughter likes this a lot.  its more like a teething ring than a necklace, though.  i read some complaints about the star-- the edges of the star are rounded but if choped at a bad angle, I think it could still be an issue, but i watch my daughter with it.
B00002JXFI This would have been an ok teething necklace if it weren't for the Star bead. As another reviewer pointed out, if your child chews on the pointy edge of the star it can be very painful. I have thrown this necklace out after having to pull off the road last week when my child screamed suddenly in the back of the car and was then crying hysterically.
B000034DCJ I was skeptical at first about 'babywearing', I tried it once as a joke with this sling that was given to me and fell in love. It was one of the only places besides the breast that my daughter would fall asleep consistently for the fist 4 months or so.  So I agree with other mothers who say that you have to give it a chance to grow on you. It may seem strange or uncomfortable at first but I still use my sling with my daughter and she's 18 months now. She sits on my hip and watches me do the dishes or fold laundry. Hands free is the way to be!The sling I was given was a bit large for me, and I'm not a tiny person 5'3'' 135lbs. Although it was adjustable I think for my next child I'll try a sling that comes in sizes.
B000034DCJ I got this carrier before my son was born. I was a nanny and have tried many carriers with babies of various sizes. This is the most comfortable and versatile carrier I've tried yet.The downsides are that it is a little challenging to use. I have had to learn quite a few different ways to carry my son, who is just 3 months old. If you don't adjust the carries you use as your baby grows, it can be very uncomfortable for both you. It is also very bulky. It doesn't even fit in an empty diaper bag. My next carrier will be unpadded.
B000034DCJ I really wanted to love this sling.  I had seen several mothers use these before, and the nurse in our childbirth class raved about it.  I was so excited when I received it as a gift.I started using this with my son when he was just a week old. I put him in the cradle position, but I was so afraid he was going to sufficate on the fabric around him, I had to keep my hand in the sling next to his face.As he got older, it did get easier to use.  It was good to use while in the grocery store.  However, it pulled hard on my shoulder.Now, he's 7 months old, and he's crawling and pulling himself up, and he doesn't like to be restrained at all.  I've tried the kangaroo position, but I'm so scared he's going to fall out the bottom because he is quite a wiggle worm.  The last time I used this, the shoulder strap got so close to my neck that it started to interfere with my circulation.I'm glad I had this for the grocery store, but I think with my next child, I'm going to have to rethink what kind of carrier I use.
B000034DCJ I bought this because of all the wonderful things I heard about slings.  I even practiced with my cat before to see if I could put it on and if it was comfortable.  I must admit this is so much more comfortable than the front packs or back packs.  It doesn't cut across the back like the front packs can.  However, my daughter will not go in this.  I had tried from day one to carry her in this.  She screams.  My child hardly ever cries and when I say she screams, I mean turns red and screams.  As soon as I take her out she is fine.  Now that she is older I can carry her like a front pack, but quite honestly, the front pack is just easier.  I wanted to use the sling because I nurse and I should have been able to nurse her while we were out.  She just will not lay in it.  My friend has this and loves it.  Her baby cooperates.  She has carried him in it since she brought him home from the hospital.  She can nurse him while walking.  When my daughter gets older I plan on using it to carry her on my hip.  I watched the video and you can use it to help with back support while you carry your child on your hip.  I hope I can use it like that, but for the next baby, I am not going to use it.  I will stick with the traditional front pack.  These slings are just not very easy on larger women who are a rather endowed.
B000034DCJ My son loves this.  He likes the &quot;kangaroo&quot; position best. He was actually crying the first time we put him in it this way, and stopped immediately.  DEFINITELY make sure the one you buy comes with the video, though.  At our Babies R Us many were just in plastic bags (returns?) without the book and video.  They are a must.  The usual type carriers which have baby putting all their weight on their pelvic bone aren't good for their developing bones.  Slings keep the baby in more natural positions.
B00003TKWE I love these sheets because they are a thick and durable material. They fit on a standard pack-n-play too which is nice. Definitely worth the price.
B00003TKWE fitted co-sleeper sheet, exactly like the one that came with the original bed. no shrinking in wash. shipped fast. will again in other colors.
B00003TKWE I ordered this as a spare for my original Co-Sleeper. There really aren't a ton of places you can buy these, so I wasn't too concerned about the price. All told, Baby Bungalow did offer it for the best price, including shipping.While the sheet is a perfect fit, I was perplexed by the 'button' holes on the under side of each corner. Can't imagine what those are for. That or my Co-Sleeper is on the older side and there have been design changes since.Overall, quality product.
B00003TKWE The color is a close match. It is a good quality sheet. I would recommend to anyone who purchased the co-sleeper so you can change the sheet after spit ups
B00003TKWE I purchased a total of 4 of these, thinking I needed to change the bedding constantly due to spit up.The instructions said to hang dry only so I thought I needed more to get through the week.  It turns out I can just toss it in the dryer and put it right back on the mattress.Had I known I didn't need to hang dry, I wouldn't have purchased any extra and just went with the 2 they gave me when I purchased the cosleeper.The material is average, nothing special.  It holds up well to lots of washes and uses.
B00003TKWE The shipping was quick. The colors are pretty but the sheets themselves are not soft. That was disappointing to my daughter who I bought the sheets for and of course to me. They are not inexpensive so I expected more. I purchased five sheets to go with the co-sleeper I bought her for their first baby. We have not assembled the co-sleeper yet but when I received it the box was all torn and dented. Looking at it the contents looks okay, but we will see when the my son in law puts it together.
B00003TL3H My daughter loves this but like others have said it doesn't fit on the Graco Quattro Travel System.  I have gotten it to work but sometimes it gets in the way of latching the snack tray on the front.  I still love it and so does my daughter.
B00003TL3H it's bright and colorful, and is great for babies who are starting to reach for things. i don't think it was worth $15 though. it's not the most durable stroller toy i've seen, but it's cute.
B00003TL3H I was a little nervous because so many people wrote that this adorable product did not fit Graco strollers well.  I am thrilled to report, however, that it fits the Graco Metrolite stroller perfectly and looks adorable!  Wonderful product!
B00003TL3H my daughter loves this for the past four months (she is 9 months now).  Still will play with it.  only reason i didn't give it a five star was that the food cup in the bug comes off way too easily.
B00003TL3H I just bought this toy because it was the only one I could find in the store for a stroller.. And of course it won't fit on our Graco stroller.
B00003TL3H Baby loved this but the only problem is the straps that tie it to the stroller are not big enough for some trays. Due to this my first one came un-sewed and I had to buy another one and the same thing happened again.
B00003TL3H I received this as a gift, unforutnately it didn't fit on our stroller (pretty standard Graco Travel System) or on our carseat (either our Grace or our Marathon) and so it was pretty useless.
B00003TL3H We have/had a Graco Quattro and a MetroLite stroller and This doesn't fit on either one!!  It was a complete waste of money! Try it in the store on a stroller like you own before buying!
B00003TL7P you couldn't ask for a better diaper pail. one reason is, that you don't have to use certain bags inside the pail...can use a plain trash bag and second is that once you turn the handle over, you don't smell the dirty diapers. great product!
B00003TL7P This is a fantastic product. It has a lot of room to store the dirty diapers, and yet there is little to no smell. You know when it's full because the plunger won't go down all the way, and you can't return the handle to the other position. When you take the garbage bag out, you can tell just how much smell you'd be in for with any other container. I also like that you can use whatever garbage bags you want with this, instead of having to buy special ones. A good buy.
B00003TL7P I originally had another pail and it broke after about 9 months of use, so I got this one. I love it! It is very easy to use and keeps the diapers away from little hands. It has a large capacity and cuts back on frequent trips to the trash can. I keep a stick on air freshner in the bottom and it helps with lingering smells. Also no expensive refills to buy! Great pail.
B00003TL7P Turned out to be a total stink bomb. Read my new review.  It absolutely reeks after 16 months.  Amazon will not let me alter the star rating or it would be only one starDo NOT BUY THIS PIECE OF JUNK.  It WILL STINK TERRIBLY in a little over a year because they put a foam and cloth gasket (porous) to keep the stink in.  Not a good design.[for laughs, I will leave the old review here]We originally got the diaper champ because it was a locking container that could accomodate cloth diapers.  We didn't end up cloth diapering after all, but feel fortunate to have gotten the champ.Reasons we love the champ:*1) Cost- no specialized (expensive) bags.  This takes any mid-sized household trash bag.*2) Effectively controls odors.  We've put some really eye-watering, throat gagging diapers into this contraption and the smell doesn't sneak out- even over time.  However, sometimes you have to brace yourself before opening the cover and tying off the bag.  That smell can bowl you over.*3) Easy enough for visitors to use- too difficult for them to play with.  Many of the \"grown-ups\" in my world can't help but tinker with whatever new items are placed before them.  I'm thrilled they can't figure out how to open the DC.  As it emits a powerful odor when the lid is opened, I'm happy they can't figure it out.  I think this lid will confound any toddler, but it's really simple for parents once you get the concept down.I just wish it could empty its own \"payload.\"  I'll definitely be first in line for the Diaper Champ robot.
B00003TL7P Before my first child was born, I was all set to buy the Diaper Genie but then a friend told me about the Diaper Champ. She said that it did a good job and I didn't have to buy any special bags. So I went out and bought it along with a big box of tall kitchen bags. My son is now 4 months old, and so far it is working great. It is in the nursery and there is no smell at all. I am usually very sensitive about any bad smells, and so is my mom but even she couldnt smell any odors. So far this has been a great product. The lid is definately tight, but it does not bother me much. Hopefully, it will still work when the diapers get REALLY smelly! But so far so good!!
B00003TL7P I love the Diaper Champ!  I have no problems with odor at all.  And you don't have to buy or use special, expensive bags!  Any trash bag will work and it's great.  I like the odor shield bags and they work like a charm.  Easy to use one handed!!  Perfect for the nursery or any room in the house where baby is changed.
B00003TL7P I bought this primarily because it takes regular trash bags, we used it the way it's supposed to be used for the first couple of days but quickly discovered that as the pail gets full the dropping mechanism gets stuck forcing you to clean out the mechanism whenever it's time to change the pail, and it's one more thing to wipe down if a diaper gets too messy.  Also, my husband would load the diaper into the top but routinely forget to flip it over to dump the dirty diaper.  Now I lift the whole lid and toss the diaper in, this allows me to keep tabs on how full it's getting and squeeze in a few extra that the mechanism wouldn't have allowed... and still trap the smell!  Of course this negates the cool mechanism and makes it a plastic trash can with a tight lid, something I could have bought for cheaper.
B00003TL7P I love this product...  My sister in law has a baby 4 months older than my daughter, and she has a diaper genie.  She is stuck having to buy the special cartridges.  So even though the Diaper Genie is less expensive, in the long run, the Diaper Champ turns out to be the one that is less expensive.  Plus with the Diaper Champ you can flip the handle and away goes the dirty diaper. With the Diaper Genie, you have to twist the darn thing and it's hard to operate.  My mother in law almost always has problems with the Diaper Genie at my sister in laws house... she ends up cutting the bags.  When she's at my house, she can't go wrong, just flip the handle! The Diaper Champ is hands down the winner!!!!
B00003TL7P Diaper Champ is great.  But just to let you know that I've been breastfeeding and the poop doesn't stink as much as formula poop.  So I can't tell you if Diaper Champ will be as good at containing the formula generated poop smell, but it's excellent at containing the smell of poop of my breastfed baby!
B00003TL7P I registered for the Diaper Champ after seeing the reviews and I cannot talk enough about it. I just live it!!! It is odorless(so far) and very easy to use - and only with one hand, so you can SAFELY keep the other one on your baby. It's very easy to change the bags, which you can use any 13 gallons one - no expensive refills to buy!!!! I just sprinkle some scented baby powder or spray some Lysol Disinfectant spray everytime I change a bag, to keep it from smelling even a little bit.I highly recommend the Champ, you will not regret it!!!
B00003TL7P This product isn't that bad... however it is not smell proof.  I love the fact that it will take any type of trash bag, but if you do not empty the pail out daily the smell leaks out into your baby's room and it does not smell pleasant.
B00003TL7P It makes so much more sense to just use regular kitchen trash bags, more cost effective. It is easier to use. There were no smell problems AT ALL until about 18months - 2years old, well \"hello - diet change produces stinkier diapers\". Makes sense. . but still use it for wet diapers. Hopefully potty training will happen soon! :)The only down-side, is that babysitters are so \"diaper genieized\" they pop off the side handle trying to do it the wrong way. But the good side is, it is easy to pop back on.The diaper champ is really durable. I highly recommend it to anyone!
B00003TL7P I truly believe this is the best diaper pail on the market...  It's simple to use, can take any garbage bag, and does a fantastic job of containing odors.  BUT, my complaint is -- why couldn't they make it bigger?I've heard it's the biggest one you can buy, but I find it frustrating that my regular kitchen-sized garbage bags are only 2/3 full when the Diaper Champ requires us to remove the bag.  It's wasteful!  (I know the simple solution is to buy smaller bags, but I feel the product should accomodate the most common household garbage bag -- the \"tall kitchen bags\" -- and do it efficiently.  The whole point of getting the Diaper Champ was so that we wouldn't have to buy separate bags for it!)
B00003TL7P I like the Diaper Champ.  My little boy's room doesn't stink from dirty diapers.  I empty it once a week, when it is time for trash pick-up.  I like the fact of using regular trash bags instead of having to buy special bags.  I do wipe it down a couple of times a month.  I have also put in a box of baking soda to help absorb the odors inside.  I highly recommend this product.  It is very easy to drop in your dirty diapers.
B00003TL7P I've had this diaper pail for 3 years now, and it's been through 2 kids (both in diapers for 18 months of that!).  I love this diaper pail! My favorite feature is that it doesn't require special refills--it can use any trash bag (we just use a tall kitchen trash bag).  My 3 1/2 year old still hasn't figured out how to open it, but it's easy enough for me to open quickly.  The only times I have had a problem with odors is if too many diapers are stuffed into the pail.  Even then, these odors can be minimized with a bit of baking soda sprinkled in the bottom of the pail.Although I debate the necessity of ANY diaper pail, this one receives 5 stars from me!
B00003TL7P In registering and purchasing products for my baby, I did a lot of research.  This included reading reviews, asking friends (lots) about products that did and didn't work for them, and actually trying to use some of the products.  I decided to go w/ the Diaper Champ after learning that the overwhelming majority of my friends absolutely hated that leading diaper pail the Diaper Genie and actually trying to use that awful contraption.  In fact in one circle of friends the Diaper Genie was re-gifted about four times b/c they were simply trying to get rid of it. I also did not like the idea of having to buy the special bags that the Diaper Genie requires.  The diaper champ uses regular kitchen bags. I have NEVER experienced an odor problem.  If you want to thwart an odor problem do the following:-Fold the diaper over and close it.-Remember to change the bags!!!  I usually change mine twice a week on garbage day.-You still have to clean the thing!! I usually spray the inside w/ Lysol when I change the bag and/ or wipe it w/ antibacterial wipes.  On occasion I wipe it w/ cleaner just as I would clean by bathroom.-For those complaining about toddler diaper odors.  Toddlers eat solids, their poop smell very adult like!  We have to do things to banish odors from our toilets, the same has to be done for toddler diapers whether you use this product or any other.This product has been a life saver and I recommend it highly.
B00003TL7P Works great! NO smells and holds lot of diapers. Uses standard kitchen bags! What a great product!
B00003TL7P So far we love our Diaper Champ.  We have been using it for 3 months and have had no problem with smells.  We liked the fact that you could use regular trash bags instead of special refills.
B00003TL7P We've used this diaper pail for 16 months now and smell never escapes from it (except when we open it to change the bag). We use plastic trash bags from Target, we pay I think $4 for 100 bags. It's a deal and works great. I could not imagine a diaper pail that would work better than this one.
B00003TL7P i refused to buy the genie for the simple reason of i didnt want to be bothered with refills and i read that it clogged.  so i decided on this one and glad i did.  it is most excellent at keeping the foulest of stenches out.  and i love that i dont have to buy those EXPENSIVE refills.  just use the bags you have in your kitchen!  easy to replace when full and it just works!!!
B00003TL7P I love these pails so much that we have two of them doing diaper duty!! It's odorless, effortless, and holds many diapers!  I also like the fact that you do not have to buy special bags for it and can use ordinary trash bags. A great invention!!
B00003TL7P I bought this pail before my son was born. First we bought the Safety 1st Odor-less pail, but it was broken, and the store was out of stock when we returned it. I read the reviews and found this one sounded the best.I love that it is so easy to use. My husband didn't even want a diaper pail because he didn't expect them to hold in any odors at all. Now that we have this one, he loves it. It's so easy to flip the lid and away goes the diaper. No twisting till your wrist breaks. At first we were using scented trashbags, but I've switched to grocery bags and they work just as well. I change the bag about once a week with either kind of bags. My son is now three months old and wears size 3 diapers. The only problem we've had is that if you don't close the diaper tapes they can stick and jam the pail. All in all it's been a great buy.
B00003TL7P I have three children.  For my first I had a diaper genie which was not only costly with the refills but it was also very stinky. I would not recommend buying that one.  My second child I didn't get any.  Now for our third child I saw the Diaper Champ and figured why not register for it and try it out.  I have to say that I am very happy with it so far. I did dump a little deoderizer tablet in it. I am happy with the fact that I can use any bag in there and dont' have to pay out the nose for replacements.  It's also so easy to use and holds a great deal of diapers.  I haven't noticed any seepage of smells.I would recommend it over the others on the market.
B00003TL7P This is easy to use, but it does not disguise the smell that great!  I did like that you can use any kind of bag with it.
B00003TL7P I love the Diaper Champ...you don't have the need for expensive refills and there is very little odor.  The main odor is revealed when it is time to change the bag.  You almost want to change the bag outside!  I find that if I keep a small air freshener in the bottom, it does help...(like one for a car).  So easy to use, definitely recommend!!!
B00003TL7P This diaper pail has NO ODOR and is the perfect size.  I use normal 10-gallon trash bags from Target.  No complaints at all!  Very easy to use and seriously, you do not smell any poopy diapers!
B00003TL7P We bought this primarily because it had better reviews than the Diaper Genie when we bought it and that we don't have to buy special bags. I love that you can use trash bags. I haven't had a problem with the bag not being full enough. For one, when the Champ is full the trash bag is a bit more then half full, but is also very heavy so you wouldn't want anymore diapers in there anyway. The only problem I've found with it was when my sister-in-law put my 2 year old nieces diaper in there and the smell lingered a bit. Her diapers are MUCH different then my 3 month old son though.
B00003TL7P I have no doubt that my wife and I will be happy with the Diaper Champ (our first baby is due in two weeks).  But we have had to expend quite the effort to find one that actually works.  The first Diaper Champ that we bought had a  piston that would not drop (the plastic joint did not meet and thus caught the piston on its way down).  The replacement Diaper Champ's piston moved just fine but the drum would not flip over easily.  It took two hands and a foot securing the bottom of the can to the floor to get the drum to turn.  This is not one handed operation as the box states.  After a third trip to the store we finally found a Diaper Champ that works.  And you do not even need to ask.  Yes, it was made in China.
B00003TL7P I highly recommend this product for several reasons:1) You do not have to buy bag refills.  You can use regular trash bags which cuts down on additional spending.  The trash bag is also very easy to take out and to put in.2) Traps in stinky diaper odor.  We have never had a problem with the smell escaping.3) Easy to use.  You just put the diaper into the slot and turn the handle, the plunger pushes the diaper into the bag.
B00003TL7P My husband and I decided to get this one over the Diaper Genie because like most people, we didn't like the idea of having to buy special bags.  We went to Costco and bought a big thing of garbage bags to use that seems to be lasting us FOREVER. Our daugher is now 4 months old, and we never had a problem with this. No odor or anything.  Extremely easy to use, no assembly required.
B00003TL7P At only 3 weeks old, my son goes through about a dozen diapers a day.  We have the diaper champ in his bedroom and it's been great so far.  (We'll see once he switches to solid food and his diapers are a bit more stinky!)  It's so easy to use and you don't have to buy the special bags.  We've used kitchen trash bags as well as large plastic shopping bags like the kind you get at babies r us.  One recommendation - get a can of Lysol and spray the diaper champ down when you change the bag.  Overall, I love this diaper pail and would buy it again in a hearbeat!
B00003TL7P We've been using the Diaper Champ for about 4 months now, and have had NO problems whatsoever!  The design is absolutely ingenious and the fact that it takes regular trash bags is a definite plus!  We bought a box of Hefty Trash Bags with that odor patch to use in the Champ and we change the bag about 2-3 times a week, and we've have had no problems with smell.  I usually wipe the Champ off with a Clorox Wipe each time I change the bag, but my husband decided to take apart the Champ a few weeks ago to give it a thorough cleaning with some bleach water, and he mentioned that the gaskets were looking worn out.  So, I called Baby Trend (Diaper Champ manufacturer) and they sent me to two new gaskets and two new piston rings (which I didn't even ask for) for FREE!  The customer service rep. even told me to call and request more gaskets and rings when we notice that the new ones start to wear out, usually after about 6 months.  Overall, I am very pleased with our purchase.
B00003TL7P My biggest concern was would this truly control the odor and yes it did...dirty diapes and soaked diapers.....I only noticed an odor one time and that was because I did not close thelid when I changed out the bag. No need for deodorizers.I use the regular kitchen trash bags and it is so easy to empty...even did while daughter sleep and no noise! I use the scented bags and even if I don't no smell! This holds alot and does not take up alot of space.
B00003TL7P We didn't want to spend a fortune on a diaper pail and refills, so we opted for the Diaper Champ. We absolutely love it. We have used it for three months now and have had no problems with smells of any kind. Best of all, you can use any kind of bag, including reused plastic grocery bags!
B00003TL7P I had checked into all of the pails before I had my little girl.  I heard great things about all of them, but wanted what would be most cost effective for us.  When we decided on the diaper champ, we won!1.  No refills to every buy.  you can use a standard trash bag and you don't have to spend the extra money for those refills.2.  I empty mine once a week on trash day and it is full.  However, there is never a smell eminating from my champ.3.  No stinky smells in my home.  Even though my daughter is only 2 months old, she has some of THE stinkiest diapers I have ever smelt!  But, there has never been any leakage of smell and it does not stink when I open it to change it.4.  I clean it every other week with Clorox wipes and they keep it nice and fresh.  Since those stinky diapers camp out in there for a week, it needs to be freshened up every now and then.Verdict:Get the champ....it will save you tons in the long run!!!
B00003TL7P This is one of the things I can't live without. There are no bad smells until you open it. Using regular garbage bags is a huge money saver and there is plenty of room for tons of diapers! Plus it can also be used as a trash can!
B00003TL7P you can use any ol' bag with this. go to the dollar store and get some of those kitchen bags. they fit it perfectly. you put the diaper in the hold in the top, turn the handle, and pop. byebye poopy diaper! it can hold quite a few. we only need to change the bag once a week. it really does hide the smell. the diaper champ is the best!
B00003TL7P I absolutely love this diaper champ. I was first drawn to it because no special bags were needed. It is so easy to use - one handed diaper disposable with the quick flip handle and so easy to empty. This item is a MUST HAVE!!!
B00003TL7P The diaper champ is such a great product.  I keep it in my baby's bedroom in a corner and it has never produced any foul odors.  I love that I can use regular trash bags with it.  I only have to empty the bag once every 2 weeks (since most of the diaper changes happen downstairs).  But, even going that long, it does not smell.  I would never use one that required refills, what is the sense in that when this one works perfectly?!
B00003TL7P I have used this for 11 months and I love it. What we did was after the baby started having odor in his #2s we bought some of those diaper bags from dollar tree (100 for $1) and put the dirty diapers in those little bags. So easy! Never an odor problem. And I use regular kitchen garbage bags in it, so no special bags to buy.I did research when I was registering before the baby and looked at all of the other diaper pails and this one was the one that came out ahead. I am glad I researched it because I am very happy with it!
B00003TL7P I love my Diaper Champ. My son is 3 months old and we have had a great experience with it. It's simple to use and is cost efficient. The biggest plus to this diaper pail is that you can use any plastic bag you want. As far as some people saying it smells, I haven't had a problem. Once a week I soak it with Lysol and water to keep germs away. I highly recommed this product if you want a clean, simple, and convenient diaper pail!
B00003TL7P the diaper champ does it's job: it collects dirty diapers and conceals the stink. of course you have to clean the whole thing out from time to time (which should be expected considering the toxic waste it stores!), but i never had any issues with smell, unless it was so full it had to be emptied anyway. what sold me on this diaper pail vs. the others, is that this one takes ANY plastic bag you want to put in it, meaning grocery bags, trash bags... nothing fancy. as a new mom (or new parent) you have enough things to worry about and spend your money on; last thing you need is to head to the store for diaper pail bags. no complaints from me on this diaper pail.
B00003TL7P I love this product.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is b/c I use cloth diapers and diaper covers, and it doesn't have a whole lot of room for this type of diapers.  It lasts me about 2 days.... 3 if I really stretch it.It has no odor, other than when you open it, but that is inevitable.Infact, the Babies R Us in my area uses this product in their &quot;mother's room&quot;.  That seems to say alot!And the best part is that its cheapest over the long run... no special bags to buy... what a pain that seems to me.  I use plain old garbage bags... or even very large shopping bags.Great product.
B00003TL7P ALL DIAPERS SMELL, no matter what you put them in, especially once your kid starts solid foods. Get over it. This pail is fantastic.  We use it for our dogs' poop bags, and line it with Ruffies scented trash bags (we use vanilla, they also have lavender, and they are cheap). There is no smell, except in the summer when it is hot (and that's only because the pail is outside on the back porch, the one we buy for the nursery will be inside in the air conditioning).
B00003TL7P I agree it's better than the genie.  I own the genie and served us well.  But when I had the chance to use this product at Babies R Us store, I was so impressed.  It's very easy to use, and it seals out the odor as well.  I wanted to get this for our use, but my genie is still in good use.  Too bad, the champ came late, or we should have gotten this instead.
B00003TL7P This contains the smell and it uses regular bags which makes it the best product in its category.  However, I never use it.  It's so much easier just to throw the soiled diaper in a regular garbage bag and take the trash out often.  We take ours out daily - this product tends to make you lazy and by the time you fill it - YUCK!Save your money and just throw your diapers in the trash.
B00003TL7P love it because it uses the bags from the grocery store.  way cheaper than others.  have to change regulary (2 times per week) when the baby gets on solids though.
B00003TL7P I used to live in an apartment basement with NO WINDOWS and this 'stroke of genius' diaper champ did not smell at all! I ended up not even having to wash out the inside until 4mnths later! Sounds gross I know but that's how awesome it really is! AND it's super easy to use and you don't have to buy bag refills. Need I say more?
B00003TL7P The Champ is the ultimate in Diaper disposal.  We tried the Diaper Genie and found it to be a hassle and more expense than we wanted (2 sets of refills every month).  The Diaper Champ uses regular trash bags (we like the scented 13 gallon bags by Ruffies) and is absolutely a no-brainer to operate!  Simply drop the diaper in the cubby on top and flip the handle!  The diaper falls into the belly of the champ and that's it!  Drop and flip!  No twisting, shoving or cutting like the Genie.  And this is perfect for babies that grow into inquisitive toddlers - the Champ is much bigger than the Genie so it can't be easily hauled around by an adventurous baby and it's easy to keep her out of the messy contents as well (unlike regular diaper pails or trash cans)!Another reason I prefer the Champ is the fact that there are no \"blades\" involved.  I just didn't like the idea of a diaper disposal with blades in my nursery.  The thought that someday she might get into the pail and possibly be cut on the sharp blades used for separating the bags - was frightening!  This is not a worry when it comes to the champ.  Just simple, clean, odor resistant, in-expensive to maintain/operate and safe!I'd recommend the Champ to anyone - buy it, you won't be sorry!
B00003TL7P What I liked:  Contained the smell.  Ease of use.  Takes regular garbage bags (saves money!).  Great capacity (empty it out once in 7 days or so). Sturdy. Easy to clean - I wipe it down with Clorox wipes.What I didn't like: Not especially good-looking and at times the lid gets stuck in a certain position (could just be a problem with mine) hence the four stars.Would buy again though and do recommend it. (I have used the Diaper Genie at a friend's place - didn't like it).
B00003TL7P This is a wonderful product.  One suggestion to the manufacturer--the blue piece that holds the bag in place--perhaps the mouth of this could be made bigger so that an 8 gallon trash bag actually fills up completely before you need to take it out.  Right now, it's only about 1/2 to 2/3 full before we have to remove it.
B00003TL7P We orignially registered for and received the Diaper Genie and had problems with it from the day our son came home from the hospital.  When he was three days old my husband took it back to the the store and announced that he was coming home with the Diaper Champ.  We LOVE it!!!  The fact that it uses regular garbage bags is a huge advantage and we have never had any problems with the smell. . .impressive considering some of the dirty diapers I have seen my son produce.  He is now six months old and the Champ works as well as it did when we purchased it.  In addition, it's very easy to use.  Just flip the handle and the diapers fall through to the bag.  Couldn't be simpler.  We love this product so much that when I see people at the store looking at the Diaper Genie vs. the Champ I will go up to them and tell them to select the Diaper Champ.
B00003TL7P This is a great pail.  It originally appealed to me because of the cost benefit of using any old plastic bag.  We buy the generic tall kitchen bags.  We soon found that another benefit is that you only have to change the bag every 6 or 7 days!  Additionally, it really has a one-handed operation.
B00003TL7P It holds odors pretty well. Its great to be able to use any kind of trash bag you want with it. I do admit, older children's diapers are a bit too stinky in the diaper champ, but I never said this product was a miracle worker. I'm really happy with it and would recommend it to all of my friends and family.
B00003TL7P We like that this product uses regular trash bags while still containing a lot of diapers.  It holds a lot of diapers so it doesn't need to be changed every day.  Highly recommend this.
B00003TL7P Diaper Champ works great! You can use your regular garbarge bags with it. No need to buy re-fills.
B00003TL7P Easy to change bags.Stable when changing bags (others are not!!!) - won't topple over.REGULAR GARBAGE BAGSOne hand use.
B00003TL7P I love this diaper pail...you can use any trash bags...I like the variety that are colored and scented for a nice touch! It's so easy to use. I didn't have any problems with odors til my daughter got older than 12 months. Once she started eating more \"real\" foods, her diapers became much smellier. She's now 19 months and the Champ is still a Champ. We empty it a little more frequently now than we used to because of her smellier diapers, but I think it's a great product!
B00003TL7P I purchased this diaper pail after struggling for several months with the Diaper Genie.  The Diaper Champ was hands down the best diaper pail I used while my child was in diapers (I used three: Diaper Genie, Easy Saver Diaper Pail, and the Diaper Champ).  I didn't have to spend loads of money on the special Diaper Genie bags anymore, it had far superior odor control as compared to the Easy Saver Diaper Pail, and it's really easy to use - drop a diaper in, flip the handle over, done!  I actually developed pain in my elbow from all the twisting the Diaper Genie required as it wrapped each diaper into its little sausage-like casing.  I passed this diaper pail on to a friend once I was finished with it, and will happily purchase it for other friends in the future.
B00003TL7P It is so easy to use. You never have to change any cartridges and you can use an ordinary garbage bag. I love it and we have never had any smell escape from it.
B00003TL7P I love this diaper pail. Yea, if you let poopy diapers sit in it for too long and don't change the bag on a regular basis it will start to stink but  c'mon its a bucket full of poopy diapers.As you child grows, or if you have older children watch out. The handle system fascinates  little ones and they find it amusing that they can put something in, flip it and it disappears,  which is good when it's a diaper, bad when it's,,, your keys.
B00003TL7P Easy to use, easy to clean, cheaper to use, not bad-looking either. Any plastic shopping bag will work in this diaper pail. The only con is that it can be tough to open until you get the hang of it. But it will certainly be an even greater challenge for your child to open!
B00003TL7P Let's face it.  This is a specially designed garbage can to hold human feces.  One cannot expect that it will be odor free.  Mine certainly isn't.  It is my fault, though.  If I emptied the bag more often, there would not be a stench.  But alas, I am lazy.  So when I do change the bag, I also spray some lysol.  Works for me.  I like it that you just have to flip the handle for the diaper to go bye bye.When I first got the product, I really hurt my finger trying to open the thing.  But that was my own fault.  I did not have it on the floor.  When opening the lid, step on the stabilizer ring at the bottom of the unit and it opens with ease.I too love that you do not have to buy special bags for this.  What a pain to have to remember to buy and then spend five bucks a pop on Genie bags.  Thanks, but no.All in all, I really like my Diaper Champ.  It's also taller than the genie which is good for me, I don't have to bend over so much to flip the lid.
B00003TL7P This is a fine product and I am happy with it.  I clean it weekly and since my daughter is on formula now, I never put poop diapers in it and therefore it never smells bad.  My favorite thing is that you can use any plastic sack store bag.  My only complain is that the part that you hook the bags to doesn't connect to anything to hold it up when cleaning.
B00003TL7P After reading all the reviews on-line for this product I chose to register for it, now that I am using it I am disappointed.  I'm not sure if my sense of smell is just that of super hero's or my daughter has super smelly diapers.  Either way her room does have the smell of dirty diapers when you enter and the \"Champ\" is in the back corner of the room.  I guess I'm just grateful that the whole house doesn't smell as bad as her room.
B00003TL7P Stay away from the other brands that require special refill bags.  What a waste of money!  Even the \"new and improved\" Diaper Genie can't compare to the Diaper Champ.The Diaper Champ uses regular size trash bags where the Diaper Genie requires special refills. I can't imagine why anyone would want to constantly buy expensive refills for a diaper pail, when a simple trash bag is all you need.As for the \"smell\" issue. Let's face it - diapers stink. And regardless of brand, ANY DIAPER PAIL WILL NEED TO BE EMPTIED ON A REGULAR BASIS. I really think some people don't realize this.  When I first had my son, I bought a diaper champ to keep at my mom's house.  When my mom used to change him, she'd dispose of the diaper in the diaper champ, but didn't change the pail.  After about a week she complained because it started to stink.  I had to explain to her that it wasn't a \"magic pail\", it was still just a covered trash bin.  (honestly, how did she raise 2 kids?...)  Now, mom's back on track and loving her Diaper Champ.As far as the odor issue goes, I have seen no difference in odor control between the Diaper Genie vs the Diaper Champ - both work pretty well to contain and control odor better than a regular trash barrel, but neither are odor proof.
B00003TL7P OK - my husband used to leave restaraunts when a couple with a baby in a diaper came in, but he doesn't even mind emptying the Diaper Champ at all.  (I know that's mostly because he's responsibile for those diapers now, but it's still a great product!)  We have NEVER noticed a diaper odor anywhere, not even while replacing the bag.Every time one of my husband's friends' wives gets pregnant, my husband buys the guy the Diaper Champ, AND THEY ALL LOVE IT!We have much less diaper odor than my firends with same-age babies have with Diaper Genie.  Also, they say that when you change bags in Diaper Genie, the stench is unbearable.  There isn't a bag-changing smell with Diaper Champ, because the diapers do get some air when the top is flipped to add a diaper.  Aerobic decomposition smells better than anaerobic decomposition, and whatever is going on in there, you smell it when you change bags.We do empty it twice a week (it gets full that often, anyway).It did get stuck a couple of times when it was WAY TOO FULL.  Letting it get too full and leaving it too long may contribute to odor issues, too.Not having to buy special bags saves us lots of time, hassle, and money.I do have one friend who \"retired\" hers to the back porch because of odor.  Her daughter was nearly two years old by then, and the contents of her diapers are a lot different from the contents of an infant's diapers.
B00003TL7P I was recommended this by a fellow mom before we had our daughter and purchased it from Baby's R Us.  It's fabulous!  We've been using it for almost 15 months now and still love it!  We save $$ on those expensive diaper genie refills AND it works great.  We put wet diapers in a seperate trash can (because they don't smell) and so we only put dirty diapers in the Diaper Champ so we only have to change the bag once a week and IT DOES NOT SMELL!!  A few times I'd forget to change it (I change it, my husband takes it out to the trash) and if a FULL bag of stinky diapers is left for more than a few days, it does begin to smell, but ANY diaper pail would stink if it was full for more than a few days.  So I just change it once a week and it's the best, no expensive refills AND NO SMELLS!!  :-D  I'd recommend this to anyone!
B00003TL7P This product was silly to me until my husband insisted me to put on up on my baby registry. I thought it would be silly to just throw away dirty diapers in there where I could just throw it in the trash can to save money. Then again, it was very useful since I have it next to the changing table. One, its holds seal tight of no smell in the baby bedroom. Two, no mess. Three, its very easy to use (all you need is to roll the handle back to dump the diaper and there it goes with a section for your next diaper). Well, my husband and I are very happy to get this in the mail.EDITED: 1/9/06At first I said it was great. But now I'm saying it stinks. It smells after about 3 months if you dont clean the champ itself. Such a hastle right? I think so, so I am going to recomment this item from great diaper champ to NOT SO GREAT DIAPER CHAMP. It's good only for wet diapers not DIRTY DIAPERS! if you dont mind washing the champ once in a while so that it wont stink up your nursery room. I still think old fashion trash can with a lid do much better cause one you know its full, you will throw the trash away. Im giving this a 1 start out of 5 stars.
B00003TL7P To put it simply, this is a necessary item for every home with a baby..-no refill bags (tip--can store extra empty bags inside in the bottom)-easy to empty & clean-no odors-not big & bulky
B00003TL7P I wanted this product because i didn't have to buy special bags for it and it also came highly recommended. The only problem i have is with the handle you use to open the top compartment. The way you have to shove your fingers under it and pull is just too tight. I can't tell you how many times i've chipped a nail or hurt my fingertips because of the force needed to open it. That would be my only complaint.
B00003TL7P This diaper pail is excellent. No odors have escaped the pail in 3 months.  I am very pleased with it.  I do have one word of caution: Make sure there are absolutley no diaper tape edges hanging loose when you flip the cylinder.  They can rip out the filter that keeps the odors inside.  Baby Trend will expect you to send the pail and the original receipt back to them for repairs if the filter comes out. I found that to be a joke since I got this as a gift for my shower (no receipt) and the repair would take six weeks (how I'll never know why).  Fortunately Babies R Us will allow you to exchange the damaged item if it has been 90 days or less.  Save yourself aggravation and make sure everything that goes down is bundled up neatly.
B00003TL7P My main complaints are that it should be deeper or wider as it doesn't even fit a smaller sized garbage bag. The hole to put the diaper in needs to be larger as I am now using medium diapers (I have a 3 month old) and they're on the brink of being too large to fit no matter how compact I make then and how un-soiled they are. I have no issues w/ odor but baby poop doesn't start to smell really bad till they start on soilid so odor will not be a problem no matter what till then and that's many many months down the road.
B00003TL7P My son is almost two, and let me tell you, little babies just don't produce the smells like the older ones. Probably any diaper pail will do until your child is about six months old, and then none will work that great. Yes, you do have to air them out once in a while, and clean them frequently (yay for Lysol), but the plastic does absorb odors no matter what. Our Diaper Champ has reached its limit, and we are going to buy another one.Why another Champ, when it still lets out smells? All diaper pails smell!! Every mother of a two-year-old that I know is going to drastic lengths to air out their pail, no matter what brand they bought. No one will be reusing theirs for a second child.So I'm getting another Champ because I like these things:- I can use it with one hand and can keep the other hand on my baby- I don't have to buy special refils (I do use odor-fighting garbage bags that really help)- I don't have to explain how to use it to babysitters.That's it. Hope that helps.
B00003TL7P I love the diaper champ, it is really easy to use and since you can use regular garbage bags it doesn't cost an arm and a leg for refills. The only downside to this is that it can get pretty stinky long before the pail is full.I wash ours out with lysol each time I empty it, and that helps, but when its hot out- well, just be prepared.
B00003TL7P This is another great baby purchase.  When I brought it home, my husband laughed at me and said that it was just a \"gadgety\" baby thing that we didn't need.  He changed his mind though after we put it into use and saw how well it worked!First, it really keeps the odor in.  I'm pretty sensitive to smells, but this one does a good job of containing odors.  Just to play it safe though, I make sure to empty it every day and a half to two days or so (you could probaby go longer), and I spray it with Lysol as well.  Keeping with that practice, I haven't had a problem with bad odors.Secondly, its economical--its not expensive to buy, and its not expensive to maintain.  Its nice to be able to use regular garbage bags and not having to buy expensive diaper disposal system specific bags.No bad odors and not expensive to buy or maintain---I definitely recommend this product!
B00003TL7P You can't put poopie diapers in this pail, it doesn't hold the smell back at all.  I use it for the wet diapers and it's fine.  I use the scented bags for the poopie diapers and throw them away in my regular garabage that gets taken out every day.  Opening the pail to empty the bag is a little difficult, but it's better than having to buy special bags for it.  The big blue round part on the side broke off for some reason and it wouldn't go back on.  I ended up using masking tape to hold it on.  It serves it's purpose, but I'm not thrilled with it.
B00003TL7P This diaper pail is great and even better that you don't have to worry about running out of bags. You can use just regular trash bags which is awesome. I have three complaints, the first is that you can only use about half the trash bag because of the way it dumps them in there which is kinda a waste. The second is that it doesn't twist shut like the genie does so when you open up the pail you smell all the lovely smells. The last is that it's top heavy when you open it up to put in the bag so you have to manuever it to put the bag in so it doesn't fall over but it can be done. That's the only time it smells though. My baby is breast fed so the smell isn't as bad as formula fed babies but our room smells fresh and clean. These minor details wouldn't make me change my mind. I like not having to buy expensive bags especially with all the other costs a baby brings, and it does keep the smell out which is what it's supposed to do.
B00003TL7P We are 1st time parents &amp; I read all the reviews on diaper-disposal products.  Now our baby is 1 month old &amp; I've never smelled a poopy diaper (and we formula feed) in our nursery which is in our master bedroom.  We are both clean-addicts &amp; love this product. (NO EXPENSIVE REFILLS NEEDED!!!) We empty it twice per week &amp; have NO ODOR problems!Update at 7mos(July04): We managed to get BabiesRUs to let us exchange the DiaperChamp for a DiaperGenie and we were equally dissapointed with it too.  DiaperChamp was great until about 3 mos. &amp; then just smelled all the time.  Diaper Genie was no better - even with toddler-strength refills.  I have found it so much easier to use cheap ziplocks and throw diapers in regular trash that goes out each night anyway (both Diaper keepers required emptying every day &amp; would still smell).  I even tried wiping with Lysol or Clorox wipes daily &amp; those things are just a waste of time, effort and money.  Cheap ziplocks are easy to take with you - will work at home or for travel - and will cost about the same as a refill cartridge MINUS the $30-some bucks for the canister.  Dissapointing - wish it worked!
B00003TL7P Friends told me that the Diaper Genie did not work very well, so bought the Diaper Champ based on on-line reviews and I have been happy with it.  It works easily with one hand, which is important.  Also, it takes any kitchen sized trash bag, so there is no special bag to stock.  While the perfect ordor free diaper pail has yet to be invented, the Diaper Champ is a good as it gets.
B00003TL7P Someone told me not to get the Diaper Genie, but invest my money in the Champ.  What sold me on it is that the Champ uses ordinary garbage bags, nothing proprietary.  As my baby gets older and the poops get stinkier, we do have some odor problems, but we tend to cram the diaper bags as full as possible.  If we changed it every couple of days, there would probably not be an issue.  When we smell something, we change the bag; problem solved.  My only *real* problem with it is that, now that my son is walking, he likes to put things into the hole and turn the handle to watch them disappear.  I keep waiting for the day when he throws away something important and I don't catch it!
B00003TL7P My sister had a Diaper Genie and it always smelled really bad. She constantly complained about it so I opted to try the Diaper Champ. Boy am I glad! It is so easy to use especially since you can use regular trashbags vs. genie refills and the diaper is gone w/ a flip of a handle!! My son is 9 months old and we have NO SMELL PROBLEMS!!! I don't know how some people can complain about smells coming from this thing...it's sealed up like Ft. Knox. You never see the inside of the pail until you empty it. The canister pushes the diaper into the trashbag, thus never allowing odors to escape through the pail. I would have to say the only way you may have an odor problem is if you never empty it!!!!!!!!!!
B00003TL7P ABSOLUTELY NO ODORS!!  I have a beagle who completely ignores the diaper champ, will eat out of every other garbage can in the house, but ignores the champ.  a bit of a struggle as diapers get bigger, but totally worth the money!!! also, a bit of a pain to clean...either outside with the hose or in the tub.  No refills and odor free..can't beat that!!
B00003TL7P This one is the best and a must have! Don't waste your time or money on the other ones.  The Diaper Genie is way too complicated.  It's a trash can so it should be simple.  I shouldn't have to read directions on how to use it!  This one is great because it is so easy to use, I never smell any odor, and it uses normal trash bags!  Why spend money on special trash bags?  I like the cheap roll of scented trash bags for like $2.00.  They work great and they are small so you can keep them in the nursery for quick and easy trash changes.
B00003TL7P My girlfriend recommended the diaper champ over the diaper genie so I put it on my registry.  It certainly seems to contain the odors.  It's great that it uses regular garbage bags - no expensive refill bags to purchase.  The only small problem I've noticed is that it stops working before the pail is full because it stacks the diapers through a narrow hole.  Also, when it's time to change the bag, wear a nose plug.
B00003TL7P Diaper Champ works well for me. It holds lots of diapers and I do not have to spend money on refill bags.  I use tall kitchen trash bags. I am starting to notice an oder escape from the diaper pail but it's nothing that I cannot handle.  I just use that as a sign to empty it, spray with Lysol and replace the bag.
B00003TL7P Love this product - no smell - easy to change the bags - I don't have any complaints.
B00003TL7P This is a good product.  It allows for quick and easy disposal of diapers, wipes, etc. and does not require any special bags.  Unlike other reviewers, I have not had any problems with it getting stuck. It does start to smell when there are poopy diapers in it, but I can't imagine that any product could completely eliminate poopy diaper odor!! If you change the bag regularly, you should not have any problem with odor.
B00003TL7P We like it that this diaper pail uses regular garbage bags instead of specialty diaper pail inserts/liners.  The mechanism works well to dispose of the diapers and attempt to keep the smell isolated, but at a certain level of the room (usually nose-height when you're sitting on the floor) you can still smell poo.  It works well to bundle the diapers into compact little bundles and use the velcro to seal the bundles before you put it in the diaper hole.  Overall, we are very satisfied.
B00003TL7P I spent a lot of time researching diaper pails before I actually bought one. I spoke to other parents to see what they used and most said that the Diaper Champ was leaps and bounds better than the alternatives. Now, owning one myself, I agree. I don't have any problems with oders (uless I'm changing out the bag) and I don't have to spend tons of money on the refill bags. You will be suprised how many diapers you change and how quickly the cost of those refills add up! My son is now 3 months old and we are still on our first box of kitchen sized trash bags....I have two very small complaints which is why I didn't give the Diaper Champ 5 stars. First, I think that it could have been made a little larger so you wouldn't have to change the bags as often. Second, you have to be VERY careful when changing out the bags. The lid is heavy and if it falls on your fingers you won't be really happy. It probably happens to everyone at least once. Overall this is an excellent product and I recommend it over all others out there.
B00003TL7P I read a review below that can explain exactly what we experienced. We've had it for 16 months and it has worked wonderful for us. No smells, change it out once a week, easy to clean. Then a diaper snagged this foam material in the head part, so I pulled the rest of the foam out. Big mistake!!! Now it can no loner retain the stinkiness and we're looking for a replacement. Be careful of overloading and never take out that foam piece that is cushioned between pieces. I have figured out that it is key to keeping the stink out.
B00003TL7P I got the diaper champ because of the great reviews as well as the fact that you can use regular garbage bags.  It works great.  I can't smell anything (and believe me, this is quite something with my baby).  I ended up buying one for upstairs and one for downstairs because it works so well and because I change him so often downstairs.  It's much better than putting diapers in a downstairs trashcan.  The reviews were definitely right.
B00003TL7P If you really want to save money, but still get a quality product, buy the Diaper Champ.I had a friend recommend it to me, and another friend recommend the Diaper Dekor.  When it came down to it, I couldn't make myself spend the extra money for something that needed expensive refills. Every time you have to buy refills, it is almost as expensive as buying a new diaper pail.  Let's face it, babies are expensive and whenever you can save $ you should!!!I buy a box of bags at Target that I use for the kitchen and the Diaper Champ and they cost less than ten dollars for over 100 bags.My only complaint is that it is hard to get the pail open at first to change the bags, but it gets easier over time as it loosens up and you get the hang of it!If I had it to do over again, I would still buy the Diaper Champ!  I think it is great!
B00003TL7P This is a great product! It is excellent since you can use your own trash bags in it and don't have to buy special ones. You can also put the diaper in it using only 1 hand! I gave it 4 stars only since 'once in a while' if the bag is very full, I may notice a slight smell.  But it is truly worth buying! I love mine!
B00003TL7P Works well as diaper pail, but it's awesome as a bathroom garbage can.  No mess, no smell. Very easy to replace garbage bags, you do not have to touch anything.Got it as a gift, and was very skeptical about it at first. (It's only 100ft to the garbage  shoot outside the apartment).  That opinion changed quickly after the first night I had to wake up to change diapers.It holds about 2 days of diapers so never get a chance to stink things up.  Besides you baby will probably poop only 1-2 times /day.
B00003TL7P I initially planned to get a Diaper Genie.  I opted not to because of the expensive refill bags.  I'm glad I didn't buy it.  We live in an apartment and have the Champ set up in his bedroom.  I don't smell any odors unless I open the Champ up to change the bag....which is expected when you have a bag filled with wet and soiled diapers.  We use scented Glad bags to help mask the odor, which helps.  I don't know how it will perform when I switch my son to formula and when he starts solids, so I give the Champ 4 stars.  I'll probably just put the wet diapers in it and take the soiled ones out to the garbage can.  I would definately recommend this diaper pail to my friends.
B00003TL7P I had never liked the idea of the Diaper Genie because of the refills. Not only can they be a pain to install, but who needs one extra thing to watch a supply of? I mean, with babies it's already far too easy to run out of diapers or formula. I couldn't picture myself yelling to hubby, \"Honey, I know you have sixty other things to get...can you also pick up refills for the diaper pail?\"The Champ works great. We use regular kitchen sized garbage bags. We've never experienced odor from the pail. It was easy to assemble, and the diapers fit perfectly into the little nook before they make their way into the pail portion. I also love that you can flip the device with one hand...Highly recommended!!! Makes life easier and keeps baby's room smelling like baby, not dirty diapers!
B00003TL7P We have been using the Diaper Genie for the past 17 months and are very happy with it.  We opted to purchase this diaper pail even though my SIL gave us her used diaper pail (the other popular pail...one that uses its own brand of bags) for free--and we are VERY glad we did.Here's what we love about this pail...*holds a LOT of diapers--a full week of toddler diapers!! (we wrap them nice and tight)*we use our regular kitchen trash bags--cheap!!*holds the odor in nicely! (every now and then I spray down the inside of the pail with Lysol)*easy one-hand use*impossible for my inquisitive child to get the dirty diapers OUT of the pailEvery now and then odors do escape the pail, but that is rare--and it usually just means that we've crammed too much in there and need to change the bag.  Spraying down the inside of the container (and letting it air out) periodically definitely helps.  We keep the Diaper Champ in our daughter's nursery and her room definitely does NOT smell like dirty diapers.
B00003TL7P The Diaper Champ has been wonderful in our home!! It locks away the smell so wonderfully that we purchased a second one for downstairs. I originally chose this one, because it doesn't use costly refills. The lid is quite heavy, so you do have to be careful of your fingers when changing the bags, but that's the only concern I've had with it. When you do open it to change the bags, you may want to do so outside. You'll quickly see just how well it locks the odors in.
B00003TL7P Yes, it does develop a smell after a while. However if you keep up with the maintance that problem is easily solved.Problem:  SmellAnswer:  Baking soda & regular maintanceThe great thing about the diaper champ is you can use regular bags, and it does keep the smell out. After some time with the Diaper Genie there was no way to stop the odor.Another thing, when the Champ starts stinking it is usaully past time to empty it. Empty the champ at least twice a week, if not more. We keep an air purifier in front of the diaper champ and that solves any strong smells when we don't empty it out on a regular basis.If you don't want to spend the money on the diaper champ, try a regular diaper pail with a lid. You would more than likely end up emptying the pail daily and that will keep the smell out(plus regulare maintance), and it is less expensive than the Diaper Champ.There are three diaper pails out that are cheaper:Safety 1st Diaper Pail: 8 gallons it's  a bit small$9.99 at Target & Babies R UsOdorless Diaper Pail: 13 gallons bags @ Target $16.99Easy Saver Daiper Pail: 8 gallons $14.99 @ Babies R UsI have not tried any of these so I can't honestly review them. These are if you are looking for cheaper alternative. I would buy one of these over the Diaper Genie or Diaper Dekor.I still give it 4 stars. It does it job and a lot better than the Diaper Genie or Diapre Dekor, no expensive refills. Everyone has kitchen trash bags that can be used with the Champ or regular grocery bags could be put to use. The good thing about using grocery bags is you will be emptying the diaper champ on a dialy basis therefore elimating build up on odor.I have the older diaper champ and opening the lid to empty the pail was a bit of a hassle. It is enough of a detterent. You get the hang of it.
B00003TL7P I admit when I was an expecting father one of my concerns was diaper changing, mostly because of the odors (anyone with me on this one?) As much as the odors won't go away during changing time, they do -as a matter of fact- dissapear once you throw the dirty diaper in the Diaper Champ. Put it in the top hole, roll the top with the handle, in the diaper goes and bye-bye to all odor!As if this were not already great, there's a big plus to this product, when you compare it to its biggest competitor, the Diaper Genie by Playtex. Although this one costs $5 the first time around, it won't require special bags as the Genie does, which cost $15 per set... this one takes your standard Glad bags you can get in Costco, BJs, Sam's or your local supermarket, so rejoice! (for diaper odors are over when the diaper goes in); and don't spend too much money to accomplish such a mundane task: make sure you get your Diaper Champ!
B00003TL7P I LOOOVE this diaper pail!  Its the easiest to use!  after using the diaper genie for 2 months i decided i had enough with the refils and with how much of a pain it is to use.  I purchases this diaper pail in its place and i loooove it!  No more refills, it uses the same bags as my kitchen garbage!  And it holds alot more! I only have to empty it like once a week as oppsed to every other day with the diaper genie.  This is worth the few extra buck because you arnt spending 5 more bucks every othe rweek for refills!  I have a bunch of poopy diapers in mine and you cant even smell them! and i love the fact that you dont have to open it to put a diaper in so i can do it one handed.  Just toss the diaper in the top and flip over the handle, its sooo easy!  And with the diaper genie i noticed that the smell would leak out a bit when you opened the top.  It is a little bigger than the other pails, but it holds alot more!  I would definatly recommend this product to anyone looking to buy a diaper pail!!!!!
B00003TL7P My son is four months and this product is perfect.  No smells at all!  Holds a decent amount of diapers, my husband empties it once a week.  No down side, all pluses here!  Especially no special bags to buy.  And when your child is out of diapers, you can use it as a regular trash can to put food or pet waste in.
B00003TL7P I like the fact that you don't have to purchase brand-name insert for this product, but can use any garbage bag.  I have to say, though, that after my daughter started solids, the odor control has not been great unless the bag is changed frequently.
B00003TL7P You cannot imagine how much money you'll save and it doesn't smell AT ALL!!! You can use any kitchen size garbage bags without a problem and use it for A WEEK without having to change the bag. IT'S WONDERFULL!!!
B00003TL7P I hate the Diaper Genie so I was excited to try this Diaper Champ out and I have to say I love it. I hear so many people complaining about the smell and I have to say they're nuts! (no offense)My son is now 5 1/2 months old and is nursing but also eats most solids including table foods when were out at a restaurant. His diapers have definately changed in odor but I have not noticed any odor coming from the Diaper Champ.Usually we change the bag about once a week, every garbage day so no dirty diapers are sitting in there for longer than a week. I also fold my diapers up into what my husband calls an egg so the diaper itself helps control any odor.I have not even noticed a bad odor when changing the bag or I would do it outside to keep the odor out of the baby's bedroom.So why so many people are noticing an odor problem with this product is beyond me. They've got to be doing something wrong.Oh and the unit does need to be cleaned...if you get a big blow out diaper like babies are known to do, and you get poop on the pail, it does need to be wiped off. A good wiping out with some antibacterial wipe, every week or two doesn't hurt either.
B00003TL7P I LOVE this product. My sister (mother of 2) recommended this to me and I am so grateful. It is not anymore difficult than emptying my kitchen trashcan and it smells a lot better! This is a must have for any new parent!
B00003TL7P I love the fact that you don't need a specific bag, and a cheap garbage bag is enough. But it doesn't keep smells in at all. I didn't realize I was buying a large one either, so even though it's far from full you have to take the gab out. But it's just the nature of garbage.
B00003TL7P It holds almost a week's worth of diapers, and you don't need expensive refills - any kitchen bags work.  At first I had a problem with some smell, then I realized if you flip the lid back and always keep the same side facing in - then there is no smell at all!  It is also to wipe clean if you do get the chute a bit dirty.  I second that you just need to fold up the diaper (with wipes inside) neatly, but that is not a big deal.  The latch isn't terribly difficult, and I wouldn't want it to be too easy since it sits in my son's room.
B00003TL7P This is one of the items that I absolutely love, something I'd rather not live without. The only time I've ever noticed a smell is when you leave the poopy diapers in the pail too long.Love it!
B00003TL7P I LOVE THIS PRODUCT!  MY HUSBAND AND I CHOSE TO USE CLOTH DIAPERS ON OUR SON AND THIS WORKS GREAT FOR HOLDING THEM UNTIL THEY GET WASHED.  WE NEVER NOTICE A SMELL COMING FROM IT.  WE ALSO LOVE THAT IT USES REGULAR TRASH BAGS RATHER THAN NEEDING SPECIAL BAGS.  IT HAS BEEN A REALLY GREAT PRODUCT FOR US AND WE HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT TO ANYONE WHO IS CLOTH DIAPERING THEIR BABY.
B00003TL7P We registered for the diaper champ mostly based on the reviews and the fact that no special bags were needed. I am very impressed with how easy it is to change the bag and I have not had any problems with smells. We use the odor guard trash bags but I doubt it has much effect (it doesn't in the kitchen anyway). The diaper champ is super easy to use and very cost effective. Would definitely recommend
B00003TL7P THis is the only one I have ever used, and i have to say I LIKE IT! It is easy to use, i just put in a white trash bag and dumped the diaper down the shute. It holds a ton of daipers, and the smell is not bad at all. I did notice now that my daughter is 15 months her poop is stonger and i dont put those in there, due to the smell. But diapers with pee only do not smell at all. The only bad thing is you need to ensure you dont get #2 on the shute or if you do it will stick there. It is really easy to use, and doesn't take up a lot of space.
B00003TL7P The Diaper Champ is a life saver.  We have had no problems with odor at all as some other reviewers have complained of.  We empty it out about 2 times per week and only when we open the lid to take the trash bag out do we smell anything.  Once it's sealed shut, no stench whatsoever.  No complaints about the Diaper Champ, especially since it is so easy on the pocket-book compared to the rest of the diaper pails out there.
B00003TL7P The Diaper Champ came easy to assemble- only took 2 minutes to put together!  The design is simple, yet brilliant, and the odors are sealed inside the Diaper Champ until the bag needs to be changed.  Our baby's room never smells!  We didn't even think about buying the Diaper Genie because we thought the idea of buying special bags and odor discs was ridiculous.  We normally use standard tall kitchen trash bags, but if you're into reusing plastic shopping bags you can even use them in the Diaper Champ (although you'd need to change the bag everyday...BUY IT!
B00003TL7P I love this product. You can use any regular trash bag. So far we have noticed NO odors. It is easy to use. It fills up somewhat quickly, but you can make it last longer by wrapping diapers tightly before placing in the champ. The price is very affordable as well.
B00003TL7P We started with the Diaper Genie as most new parents do.  We hated that thing!  The \"new\" design still needs lots of improvement!  The bags never fit right and then it never spun right.  And after about two months it just sat there in the corner of her room and was never used.As she entered into toddlerhood we started having some bad diapers just becasue of her cutting teeth and diet changes.  We decided we had to have something so we started researching.  The Diaper Champ is the best we found!There are no specail bags to deal with or buy!  We use the cheap $1.99 13 gallon vanilla scented bags from the grocery store but you can use any bag you have laying around.  There is also no trick to it.  No spinning it or anyhting!  Just flip the handle and the diaper is gone!Now it will start smelling if you leave it with diapers in it for an extended period but all of them will!  We empty ours every day and we have never had an odors from it!  It is far better than just a trash can or the Diaper Genie and it's fairly inexpensive as baby products go!
B00003TL7P I've tried the two other most popular diaper pails and am happiest with this one.  It is easy to change the bag, uses any trash bag, and does a decent job of containing odor.  I really appeciate all of these things after dealing with the other brands.  I would highly suggest using this one from the very beginning.  Let's face it....no diaper pail is perfect, but this one is the best that I've used.
B00003TL7P Ok, so the idea of the Diaper Champ is awesome--it is very easy to use--that's why I gave it 1 star. However...the thing REALLY stinks!! Someone gave me the Neat diaper disposal system for my baby shower & I absolutely loved it. However, the handle broke on it just 2 weeks ago. I thought...\"Maybe I could try the Diaper Champ since I won't have to purchase any liners\"...Well that was a HUGE mistake!! I see why this thing got 4 stars--all of these parents have young children!! My daughter is 14 months old & because she is older, I guess her diapers come with more odor! After literally only a few diapers, her entire room smelled of poop! I couldn't stand it! In one week, I changed the garbage bag at least 4 times. Is that really saving money?? I don't think so! Plus her room really smelled bad. I'm taking it back & getting the Neat again! The Diaper Champ must be great for infants, but you may want to consider something else for older babies!
B00003TL7P I bought this diaper pail when my son was just a few days old and I absolutely LOVE it!  I used to work in a daycare and we had a diaper genie.  It was such a pain to use.  We all hated it.  The diaper champ couldn't be easier to use.  And the biggest plus is that you don't have to buy any expensive refills.  It takes regular trash bags.  I generally put kitchen size bags in it, but you can use just about any size if you are in a pinch.  And it does an excellent job of keeping the odor contained, which the diaper genie never did!  If you are looking for a user-friendly diaper pail that actually does keep the odor contained, than the diaper champ is the one for you!
B00003TL7P This is a great diaper pail.  There is no odor and it is very easy to use.  (You can do it one handed while still hanging on to the baby.)  Also, we like using regular trash bags instead of having to worry about buying refills (like with the Diaper Genie).  And it's the largest diaper pail I've seen without taking up more floor space.
B00003TL7P This is a great pail except for the heavy lid. Be careful when changing the bag so it doesn't come down on your hand. The seal did come out, but it does not affect the odor. This really does keep the smell in.With having twins, we change the bag every couple of days. I wish it was a little bigger.I do recommend this pail!!!
B00003TL7P At first me and my husband didnt know if we really wanted to get diaper pails for our twins. We thought since the babies were going to be at his parents house while we were at work. A garbage can would do just as well. We did reg for the diaper champ to keep at the grandparents house. We ended up getting 1 for their home and 2 for our home. We are SO HAPPY we did. They are so easy to use. You dont have to push the dirty diaper down with your hand you just lay it in the champ and turn the handle over. At 6 months old yes the diapers are starting to get bigger but you just fold them with the velco of the diapers and its so easy. Ive had no problems of getting them stuck. With the diaper champ you can use any kind of bags which is great!!! There really is no oder with the diaper champ. We take the dirty diaper out every 4-5 days depends on how many we go through in a weeks time :), but even when their is a \"dirty\" diaper there is no smell in the room. Sometimes if we have a very \"messy diaper\" we just take it directly to the garage. All around we have  had NO problems and neither has grapa and grama. We wash it out once a month or sooner with bleach and water just help get rid of some germs. We also spray it with cleaner weekly to help with those nasty germs! All around its a great product. It really is hands free, which means less mess, and their is no costly replacement bags that you have to mess around with!
B00003TL7P We got this and the Diaper Decor Plus as gifts and I have to say that the Champ is not my favorite. I like that you can use your own garbage bags with the Champ, but that's the only positive in my opinion. I find it pretty hard to open it without breaking a nail and it does get fill up much more quickly than the Decor. When you're changing the bags on the champ, it can be messy, depending on how long you waited to change the bag, but with the Decor, you just open the front door and knot the bag even if it's full to the brim--so much easier. I also like the Decor because you can dispose of the diaper with your foot, instead of a hand like with the Champ, because now that my son is super squirmy on the changing table, I need of my hands on him!
B00003TL7P We have both a Diaper Champ and a Diaper Genie....and we definitely prefer our Champ!  Not only is it much more cost effective (you can use regular trash bags rather than Refills at $5 a pop), it is easier to use and clean, and has a larger capacity.  Only problem...it can be frustrating and messy when you put that last diaper in before realizing the unit is full.  The pluger gets stuck & you have to manually extract the mess.
B00003TL7P This is the most convenient on the market considering you don't need specific refills!!! I strongly recommend it.
B00003TL7P Let me just say this... After being a nanny for almost 10 years I have tried them all. This one is really great. I actually took a friends word on it and went with this Champ when registering and I am glad I did. I just knew all along what products I would not use, but was undecided on the actual one I wanted. Well the Champ has survived it's first year with our son and it is great!! We just bought another for baby boy number two coming next month. The thought of not having to buy refills and just using regular bags is awesome! We just buy the smaller bags that come like 250 to a roll and are sented and they are like $6.00 and they work great. We just recently had to buy another roll of bags. SO $6.00 for a year of bags- can't beat that!! We lysol the champ every time we change the bag out and have not had any problems. Would reccommend to anyone and everyone!!
B00003TL7P We just couldn't bring ourselves to buy a pail that required us to purchase extra refills.  This pail is great.  I do put really dirty diapers into a plastic shopping bag before putting it in the pail, to reduce the chance of nasty seepage and rub-off onto the chamber as the diaper is moved into the bottom.  It is not difficult to open, and the fact that it has a good clasp offers a sense of security for when our little girl starts pulling herself up on things, which will be soon (she's 8 months old).  We change the bag a couple of times a week, and the nursery smells fine.
B00003TL7P I love the Diaper Champ!  Everyone I knew had the Diaper Genie but had to buy expensive refills and did not like all the twisting involved.  After reading reviews of the Diaper Champ, I put it on my baby registry and I am glad I did.  It is easy to use, keeps odors contained, and uses regular trash bags (much cheaper than diaper pail refills).It was a little tricky to open the first few times because I wasn't sure how the latch worked.  Also, be sure the tabs on soiled diapers are secured to the diaper or they will get stuck up under the cylinder on the way down.
B00003TL7P I would definitely recommend choosing the Diaper Champ over the Diaper Genie, since you can use regular kitchen trash bags instead of expensive Genie refills. Definitely reduces the odor (just be prepared for the awful smell when you open the top to change the bag!!!) and is easy to clean. Love it!!!
B00003TL7P The champ is great because you don't have to waste anymore money buying expensive refills like the diaper genie.  This one uses regular bags (I use 32 gallon bags).  I did have some problems with the odor, but I think anything you put poop in and let sit for days will have odor so that's inevitable!  Here's some tricks for this Champ:1.  Put an Arm & Hammer Baking Soda box at the bottom of the pail to help eliminate orders.  And the obvious, change the bag every couple days to eliminate the smell... don't expect to leave it there for a week and have it smell like roses!2.  The side straps of the diaper will get caught in the shoot so make sure you roll the diaper really tight and use the straps to hold it together, otherwise your diaper shoot will get clogged.3.  If you're like me, you probably have tons of grocery bags laying around.  Keep a few handy in the nursery and use them to bag the poopy diapers.  Double bagging them helps to eliminate the orders.Hope this helps!
B00003TL7P My husband and I love this product. Several friends of ours recommended it, and I'm so happy that we purchased it. It's large enough to hold many diapers, and it really does keep our nursery odor-free.  I really like that we don't need to purchase expensive bags to use with it. We just use regular kitchen garbage bags. My sister had the Diaper Genie, which is tough to use and too small.  This product is much better.
B00003TL7P This diaper pail is a wonderful investment. While other diaper pails require the use of thier own bags this pail uses any bag...including old shopping bags. This save alot of money. When you are a first time mom and on a tight budget every little bit helps. I highly recommend the Diaper Champ.
B00003TL7P We also wanted the diaper champ instead of the Genie because...who wants to buy special bags??  It is a life saver to just throw in a kitchen garbage bag.  We ended up receiving ours as a hand-me-down, and I was worried that it would smell.  Surprisingly enough - it only starts to smell when it's time to change the bag. And sure enough, the lid would start \"sticking\" right about that time, which told me that the bag was full and it was time to change it (instead of struggling to stuff another couple diapers in).  Since we are new parents, we'd sometimes make a mess trying to toss a dirty diaper in, but it's SO easy to clean.  Just keep some Lysol wipes by the changing table, and wipe it down if you get anything anywhere. Piece of cake.
B00003TL7P I registered for this item because of the good reviews it got, however I was not impressed.  For one thing, The diapers always get jammed in it.  The product also leaves a faint smell in the room.  All in all, the Diaper Champ serves its purpose, but it does not live up to its good reviews.
B00003TL7P Love it, love it, love it!  I love that you can use regular plastic bags and don't need to buy refills for it.  Once in a great while it will stink a bit but only when I used too big of a bag and have a LOT of diapers in there.  Wipes up nice and clean with antibacterial wipes.  My daughter is starting potty training and I'm still using it.  Great buy!
B00003TL7P The flip action is so easy to use that even your toddler (or your foot) can do it to make diapers and smell disapper.  (Now that my baby is older and stinkier, I notice a faint smell if I stand right over it, but I just sprinkle some baking soda in the bag, or you could but a couple charcoal brickettes in the bottom, or any other of the 101 odor absorbing remedies out there.)And practically speaking, stratch another item off that long baby shopping list--with this you can forget the diaper pail refills and just use the good old kitchen garbage bags that are sitting under your sink.
B00003TL7P I thought the idea of keeping dirty diapers in the house was just gross, so I decided to make 20 trips a day to the trash.  Boy, was I misguided in my thinking,because this diaper champ is a Godsend!  You really do not smell a thing! I heard the diaper genie was a huge mess, so I did not even attempt to buy it.  Get this and limit those trips out to the trash!
B00003TL7P It does contain most of the odors but not all.  It is however a huge hassle to open so beware if you value your manicures.  It will save you money on refills so that's a plus.
B00003TL7P This product is wonderful!  It is very easy to use, refill, and move around.  My only complaint is that it could be a little bigger to hold a bit more.  It keeps the smell OUT completely!  The fact that I can use a regular trash bag is a definite plus to a mommy with a small budget!I highly recommend this product!
B00003TL7P I was quite pleased with this for the first 6 months. Now as my son's diet is changing, the odor of his bowl movements can no longer be contained. We always tightly wrap our diapers and I even tried washing it frequently but after about 3 or 4 days the stench comes right back and now I'm at a point where it's just taking too much time and effort to maintain. There is one serious design flaw though - the pail is tapered such that the bottom is noticeably larger than the top (probably for balancing purposes). The problem is if the diaper bag gets too full it makes it really hard to pull out the diapers.Pros:- cheaper than alternatives- worked great the first 6 months- was able to use normal garbage bagsCons:- smells after 6 months- bad tapered design makes it hard to remove diapers
B00003TL7P After reading the glowing reviews here and receiving a positive one from a friend, we decided to replace a broken Diaper Genie (lid broke off) with the Champ.  What a disappointment!  Here are the big two complaints:1.  It's unsanitary.  Putting diapers and messy wipes into the slot and dumping them in the bucket leaves the slot a germy mess.  Having to clean the slot each and every time is just unrealistic and too much work!  And I fear our toddler getting anywhere near the thing because of the germs.2.  The smell.  It's probably not as bad with an infant, but let me tell you, opening the lid to empty toddler diapers is one frightening experience!  Yikes, what a smell after just a couple days.  We used the odor prevention garbage bags, but nothing prepared me for that odor when I opened the lid.  Since nothing seals off the individual diapers, it's just a sea of messy diapers in there.  Yuck.On the plus side, it's wonderful to be able to use regular garbage bags, not the expensive ones the Genie requires.  And it's certainly easy to use.  But I'm not sure how this product is any better than just using a garbage can with a lid.When our second child arrives next year, we'll be going back to the Diaper Genie.  It's not perfect, but it's much cleaner and there's less odor involved (the reason to get one of these products in the first place).  And the new version of the Genie is much easier to operate than the earlier model, so we'll just cross our fingers the lid stays attached next time.
B00003TL7P I've been over to friends' houses and fought with their diaper genies. I decided to go with the Diaper Champ instead, because you can use regular trash bags with it (much less expensive than the Genie refills).I had no complaints, until it got really warm in my daughter's room and then the smell appeared.  I've tried Lysol and the dryer sheet at the bottom of the can and various other tricks to mask the odor emanating from the Champ without luck.  Baby is breast-fed too.  I can only imagine how bad the smell will be, once we start her on solids.  Ick.I'm wondering if fighting with the Genie and buying refills is a better option for us, as we don't have air-conditioning and it will get warm in the room this summer!I will say this though, other reviewers have complained that the bag is not completely full when the Champ seems to need a change, but I find this convenient, as I don't have to drag out an extremely heavy bag.
B00003TL7P ......all I can say is the smell is horrible.....1 star..... Please don't buy this one!
B00003TL7P I love this product!  With the enormous numbers of diapers that you go through with a newborn, it was great how easy it was to dispose of the dirty ones.  Plus, the fact that it used regular trash bags is great.  No need to pay for the special refills that the other brands require!
B00003TL7P I registered for this diaper pail as opposed to a Diaper Genie because I didn't want to have to purchase refills.  So far (3 weeks), we've had no problems with the Diaper Champ at all.  It contains the smell from our baby's diapers and we can use just about any kind of bag inside.  I also sprinkled baking soda in the bottom of the Diaper Champ to help absorb odors - every once in awhile I just empty the old baking soda out and replace it.  I don't know if we'll run into trouble down the road with odors, but so far I have no complaints and I'm very happy not to have to buy those refills.
B00003TL7P I thought about getting the diaper genie at first but then did some research. This is the best for your money! Not only was it less expensive than most other diaper pails, it also works the best. The only time smell escapes from it is then you open it to take out the bag. I really love how you don't have to buy bags for it, and that it takes perfectly good trash bags. That will save you a bundle of money alone! It works really great for us and we wouldn't use anything else. I wish it would hold more diapers but I really can't complain. Don't buy anything else!
B00003TL7P I have never bought any other diaper pail, so I am not sure how it stacks up, but the Diaper Champ has proven to be a good product! I use odor-reducing trash bags & the smell is very minimal. One little downfall is that it seems to fill up fast (by 3 days!)which makes it hard to turn the cover. It's a good size & fits nicely next to my baby's changing table. Overall, I am happy with this product & do recommend it.
B00003TL7P This is a MUST HAVE product for all new moms!!!! The one thing that sets this product apart from the diaper genie is that this product can use regular garbage bags...ANY Garbage bags will fit. The Diaper Genie needs it's own refill bags in order to work and that's just more money that you don't have to spend...This is easy to work and easy to dispose of the dirty diapers....FANTASTIC!
B00003TL7P We've used this Diaper Champ for the past 8 months and it's worked great. No problems or odors at all. The best part is you use regular kitchen trash bags, no expensive specialty bags to buy.
B00003TL7P The Diaper Champ is excellent.  I have experienced no issues with odor, in fact I keep this in my baby's closet.  No special bags are needed ... what a savings!  Just a spray of Lysol in between bag changes and everything smells rosy!  Great value for an excellent product.
B00003TL7P When my hand-me-down Diaper Genie broke, I bought a Diaper Champ. I figured I'd save some money not having to buy the Diaper Genie refills. While I was happy about being able to use regular trash bags, that was all that really impressed me with the Diaper Champ.The odor protection of the Diaper Champ really leaves something to be desired. My son's room smelled very badly, even when I changed the pail every day.Changing the Diaper Champ really isn't a pleasant experience. Not only does the odor of multiple nasty diapers spew forth (nothing is sealed) when you open the lid to change the trash bag, but the trash bag is somewhat difficult to position correctly.Well, I'm back to using a Diaper Genie, and my son's room smells just fine. Save your money and buy something other than the Diaper Champ the first time around.
B00003TL7P I decided to get this diaper disposal system instead of all of the others for one simple fact: NO REFILLS NEEDED! You use any type of bag you want, and I love this idea. The refills for all the others are so spendy and they don't hold that many diapers. I'd rather buy cheap 13 gallon garbage bags from wal-mart or use one of the gazillion plastic grocery bags we already have in a cupboard at home. It also keeps the smell away perfectly fine-until you open it of course to take the bag out to the garbage can! It's so easy to pop a bag in or out as well. I think it's great and I highly recommend it to every family that loves to save money.
B00003TL7P Unlike the Diaper Genie, the Diaper Champ can be used for both disposable and cloth diapers. We have two of them since we mostly use cloth, but occasionally need to use a disposable. It's great, and very easy to use, but you do have to empty it a couple of times a week or you will get a little stink from all the rotting diapers. It's so easy to use, my 18 mo old daughter figured out how to flip it and started doing it for fun. She's now 2.5 and still loves to flip her training pants into the pail.
B00003TL7P I'm not sure about this one.  In concept, it's a fabulous idea.  I love that you don't have to purchase expensive refills.  I just go to [the store] and purchase tall kitchen bags and use those for the Diaper Champ.  The cons, at times the diaper wipes get stuck in the disposal area making it hard to turn the handle back and forth.  In addition, I don't believe that it is odorless.  My daughter is only 4 months old and we do notice an odor...I'm concerned that as she gets older the #2 diapers will only get worse.  If I had to do it over again, even with the cost savings of using any type of bag, I would go w/ the Diaper Genie.
B00003TL7P My husband and I hated this diaper pail from the day we first began using it.  The cylinder continually got stuck, and diapers would often get stuck in the cylinder.  It is no fun pulling apart a diaper pail at 2:00 in the morning because the handle won't go down due to a diaper that is stuck in it.  Plus, I think it is unsanitary.  The diapers are placed in a plastic hole at the top of the pail, and then they drop through to the bag.  Well, messy diapers sometimes left a bit of a mess in the opening area, and it was not easy to clean.  Finally, after two months of dealing with this pail, one morning, I flipped the handle, and the cylinder fell right into the bottom of the pail.  (It was not a pleasant task to retrieve it, either!)  I haven't been able to figure out how to fix it, so we are using a Safety 1st Diaper Pail now, and the Diaper Champ will be hauled to the road for the trash pickup next week.  I think that for the price, it should have lasted longer than two months.  I do not recommend this product.
B00003TL7P We have purchased this diaper pail four years ago [I was so disgusted with Diaper Genie we had at the time (not just wasting the money on the refills, but also the smell and having to push & twist was more than I wanted to deal with)].Diaper Champ was so much easier to operate! When my daughter turned one, she started disposing of her diapers herself and she never failed!We used regular grocery bags and changed them twice a week to avoid them getting too full and/or smelly. [We've discovered that regular shopping bags from Target are larger and sturdier than your average grocery bag and we're now using them with daughter #2, replacing them once a week]. We have NEVER had any problems with DiaperChamp, and we're still using the one that we purchased in 2001! It's virtually indestructible, easy to wash and operate, doesn't cost you any more money than you initially pay for it, and it DOES NOT SMELL!I would highly recommend this product to anyone.
B00003TL7P I chose to register for the Diaper Champ for convenience.  You can use a plain ole garbage bag instead of purchasing something separate.  What busy mom has time to run out to get special bags?  In 5 months I've had one instance of a terrible smell and it was just a really bad diaper - we all know those.  :)  It's very easy to clean and so easy to use.
B00003TL7P We purchased the Diaper Champ instead of the Diaper Genie because we didn't want to buy special bags.  We have now used it for a year and it has been great!  We can use our regular garbage bags so the cost is very minimal and we don't have to worry about going out and buying those special bags like for the Diaper Genie.We use cloth diapers and it works really well for that.  We change the bag almost daily, as we have two in diapers and cloth diapers are bulkier.  When it gets hard to turn, it is time to change the bag!The Diaper champ really minimizes the odor and is very easy to clean up, we just wipe it with a soapy cloth and sometimes spray a little disinfectant to help with the smell.This is great and I would recommend it for everyone.
B00003TL7P I like the Diaper Champ because it doesn't use specific bags.  I don't like how easily it gets backed up though.  I have to frequently push down the center to get it to rotate, much before it needs to be changed.
B00003TL7P Love the Diaper Champ.  I had planned to get the Diaper Genie, but after I read the reviews, the Diaper Champ won out!  I love the fact that the Diaper Champ accepts any kind of bag, and you don't have to purchase specific bags.  That's way too much of a headache and expense that I don't need.  It's also super easy to use one-handed which is important with a squirmy infant either in your arms or on the changing table.  It took me a few minutes to learn how to change the bag, but that, too, is easy once you figure it out.  We haven't had a problem at all with the smell, but we do wipe it out with Clorox wipes every so often just to make sure.  This is one of those baby items I wouldn't want to do without.
B00003TL7P I've used the genie in the past and much prefer the Diaper Champ. I'm all about practicality when it comes to baby products and the Diaper Champ is right in line with my views.Very easy to use,(my senior citizen parents figured it out...lol), controls odor well and USES REGULAR TRASH BAGS...woohoo! Who wants to spend money all the time for \"fancy\" trash bags. Buy the diaper champ and save the money for something fun for baby.
B00003TL7P PRO'S1. Doesn't take up too much space2. Very easy to use.3. Very easy to empty.4. Can use regular trash bags (saves money!)CON'S1. There is a slight smell when my son delivers a REALLY stinky muddy diaper. (other than that there is no smell. I just throw the \"bombers\" in the trash outside.FYI1. Don't let it get too full, otherwise it is hard to pull the trash bags out to empty. And once it is open (stinky!!!) you don't want to waste any time getting the full bag out of the house.UPDATE: Our son is now 9.5 months old and it just stinks. No matter if there is a diaper in there or not. We have cleaned it, sprayed it, bleached it, put dryer sheets in it, well you name it and we have tried it. THE THING STINKS!!! We have since tried other bags and such but if you walk in my sons room you smell the diaper champ. It is going out I am sad to say. But we did get several smell free months out of it. Also just a note. My son started eating solid food and went to formula when it started stinking real bad!
B00003TL7P I love this diaper Champ. I got it as a shower gift and hadent heard of it before but when I started using it I had to tell all my friends. This will definatly be my gift of choice from now on to all my pregnant friends. As other reviews say the smell isnt that great when it gets full but its not that bad (I see it as a hint the bag is full and its time to change). I also spray the inside w/ febreeze or lysol disinfectant during each change and that nips the problem in the bud. Overall, Its one of those things that I cant live without but didnt know it until I got it.
B00003TL7P We got this for our newborn, and within the first two weeks of use, the liner (that I assume is supposed to keep odor in) fell out because it got caught on one of the stickies on the diaper. This pail doesn't really keep in odors anymore and we'll probably have to get a new one, but since you can use regular garbage bags (we actually use the bags we get our groceries in because they hang perfectly) its still probably a better deal than the genie.
B00003TL7P No special bags to buy... change at least twice per week (especially in the summer) and you are good to go. Remember this thing contains poop, so if it is not changed often, it will smell.
B00003TL7P The best thing about this product is you don't have to purchase their bags.  It does certainly reduce the odor but the bag still needs to be replaced regularly otherwise the odor will sneak up on you.
B00003TL7P I originally put this item on my baby registry because friends of mine highly recommended the use of a diaper pail. I decided to go with the Diaper Champ rather than the more popular Diaper Genie, because I didn't like the idea of having to buy special bags. Too costly and not efficient if you ask me!THIS PRODUCT IS A LIFESAVER!! I HAVE NEVER HAD AN ODOR PROBLEM!No one has ever come to my house and noticed 'diaper odor.' In fact, people who have been present while I changed my almost 3 month old son's diaper have been amazed at how the very 'potent' smell of the dirty diaper seems to disappear once I dispose of the diaper in the Diaper Champ.For those who are experiencing odor problems, here are some suggestions which should solve the problem:1. CHANGE BAGS FREQUENTLY!! I change mine about 1 or 2 times a week. For those who complain that the pail gets stuck, that is probably a good indication that the BAG IS GETTING TOO FULL!! Also, making sure that the tape on the diapers is secure will prevent that from happening as well.2. YOU STILL HAVE TO CLEAN THE THING!! Hello, it does house dirty diapers!! All I do is wipe it down with some antibacterial wipes (takes about 10 seconds!!) and then maybe spray some Lysol in it and let it air out for a minute or two. SIMPLE AND IT WORKS!Also, for those that complain that the Diaper Champ isn't as effective as time passes, keep the following in mind:AS BABIES GET OLDER, THEIR DIETS CHANGES (aka SOLID FOODS!) AND SO DOES THE SMELL OF THEIR DIAPERS!In talking with other parents, I get the same feedback - as babies get older and become toddlers, ALL DIAPER PAILS become gradually less and less effective until they are just no longer useful. Again, this is because as their diet changes, so does the consistency and odor of their stool, in other words, it gets stinkier!!!All in all, this product is definitely one I would recommend and certainly worth the very reasonable price.
B00003XAKP I love this! I was hesitant to buy too since the \"sheet\" is expensive and hardly a \"sheet\" at all. But once I used it, it made changing the crib in the middle of the night speedy, letting baby and ME get back to sleep quicker.First off, it is soft to lay on, absorbant and waterproof. If baby's diaper leaks it only gets on this sheet. You can take the sheet off easily by just removing the snaps attached around your crib slats. We have our crib matress dressed in an additional regular crib sheet underneath with a cheap matress pad below it. This allows us to make it thru the night without having to make a full crib linen change--- at least until morning.I will certainly buy this as my gift to all my friends baby showers!
B00003XAKP Our son uses the babi italia pinehurst classic crib...bought the ultimate crib sheet for it but it doesn't fit the crib very well. It is good for backup use if my other regular sheets are in the wash though. It just has problems fitting around the big 4 corner crib rails so I am forced to attach the snaps on the regular rails instead which makes the sheet not be able to stretch to look completely flat.Today I just found another use out of it though after feeling that it was a waste to buy this. My son has been pulling up to stand and teething on the top side rails and actually made teeth marks with paint coming off! AH!  So I improvised and used this crib sheet to cover the top rail, it fit perfectly in length and snaps perfectly together to stay on.  It would have cost about the same price to buy an actual[...] rail cover so it works out.  He usually only teethes on 1 side too!
B00003XAKP I bought this based on good reviews in the Baby Bargains book, so I had high expectations. It does make it somewhat easier to change sheets in the middle of the night, but you still have to unsnap it from about 10 places on the crib to do so; I've also found the snaps a little difficult to engage. If you're not using crib bumpers, the look of all the elastic pieces on the crib slats isn't too attractive. I'm glad to have one of these, but it isn't the miracle sheet I hoped for.
B00003XAKP Here's what I like about this product: it's easy to change, and it provides a leak-proof barrier between the baby and the mattress. Here's what I don't like: the snaps are not a great fit for my crib and sometimes come undone; one snap stopped working altogether; and the sheet wrinkles and is difficult to smooth out.All in all, the good outweighs the bad. The sheet is particularly handy for newborns who might leak during the night, requiring sheet changes when you're half asleep. I only use it now when I know he is prone to leaking, such as when he is between diaper sizes. Otherwise, I use regular sheets. Put it on your registry.
B00003XAKP It's kind of weird to be putting a cover over your crib sheet (and never having to change the crib sheet), but these were a lifesaver after my daughter started leaking poop like crazy overnight.  Changing the crib sheet daily was NOT fun.After I got this, it got a bit easier.  It's not super fast to unsnap and snap on, but better than replacing the crib sheet (esp given I have a mobile that gets in the way of taking the mattress out).I have 3 of these so I don't have to immediately wash the dirty one.Only con is that the material seems a little rough.  Not as soft as the crib sheet fabric, unfortunately.
B00003XAKP It's a nice thick pad and seems comfortable enough to use in place of a sheet everyday, but it's too expensive for a sheet and because it has the rubber bottom, you can't really put it in the dryer without harming it. It takes a long time to hang dry. If it were less expensive, I'd get a few more. So I use it as a water proof pad and put a sheet over the top of it, but that takes away from the ease of putting it on the mattress, since It gets tucked in the fitted sheet.
B00003XAKP I have been using these sheets for 6 months.  I have two Ultimate Crib Sheets, and when my 6 month old has diaper leaks or blowouts while sleeping, I can easily switch to the new ultimate sheet.  They are machine washable and dryer safe, which I LOVE, considering I am doing baby laundry multiple times a week.  Putting regular sheets on crib mattresses is a huge hassle, so the Ultimate Crib Sheet is a huge help for middle of the night diaper leaks.  It takes me much less time to switch these out than to change the whole sheet.  I leave baby's cute sheets on the mattress and use this on top.Size: Both of mine shrank a tiny bit in the dryer, but it is not a problem at all.  They fit flat on top of a regular crib-size mattress.Material:  The top side is a breathable, soft cotton layer.  The bottom side has a soft, waterproof plastic feel.
B00003XAKP I found the ultimate crib sheet to be much more trouble than it's worth. Lifting my daughter's mattress takes no effort: it's made of  lightweight foam. As a result, changing her sheets is also super easy. I just have to lift the mattress, and it takes two seconds. On the other hand, snapping all the ties on the ultimate crib sheet takes bending over the crib for five solid minutes (plus, the manufacturer recommends snapping the snaps before every wash, which means snap on crib, unsnap, snap again before wash, unsnap, snap on crib...) So, if you have a foam mattress in a corner of the room, I'd suggest just getting normal sheets and some of those stay-dry liners. If you have a coil mattress and keep the crib in the center of the room, then by all means, try the ultimate crib sheet...
B00003XAKP Was really, really excited to get these, then read what it is made out of, the very bottom layer is PVC. Now why would I want my newborn daughter to sleep on this and breathe it in? Not in a lifetime. Plus, when I opened the package, it smelled of plastic. I will do the laundry when she messes up the bed and deal with it rather risk exposure to PVC fumes.
B00003XAKP works great to keep the mattress and sheets under dry.  It also is good enough to be used without a cover, my daughter doesnt mind it.  Its practical and good for the money paid, recommended.
B00003XAKP My mom said to get enough crib sheets because it was something you had to change constantly.... I now have a drawer full of crib sheets that have never been used!  This is the best thing ever!  we put one on, and have the other one for an emergency.  It is soft, the cotton is excellent quality and the work of crib changing at 3 in the morning it just went from 10 minutes to 1 minute! nothing can bit 9 minutes of extra sleep in the middle of the night
B00003XAKP The baby isn't here yet.  But we've bought a couple of these.  I'm a tad hesitant because they don't fit very well on our convertable crib.  They do give instuctions, saying to just use a slate next to the thickers corner one(for convertable cribs), but I find it fits very awkwardly.  However taking the whole crib apart(with the bumper being a huge deal, also to get on, considering the thick corner posts), it makes me want to cry to think I'd have to do this very often.  So, we'll give these a shot.  I may end up doing the zip on sheet set, which would work with any crib, and seems like a dream.  I've also heard great things about those.  I just didn't want to invest in that, if I could get away with these.  Will let you all know, if these turn out to be a disaster.
B00003XAKP This item was great in the middle of the night when little one had an accident. You just unsnap and you have a clean surface ready to go. HOWEVER...I really hated that after i washed this item only a few times, the surface became very rough to the point that i quit using it all together. It's a pain to change the sheet each time now, but don't want my baby sleeping on a rough sheet.
B00003XAKP These should be in everyone's registry. It's something you don't think about, but will save you when you're totally exhausted and your baby spits up in bed. Just unsnap, throw in the washer and go back to bed!Soft, waterproof, love these.
B00003XAKP Really they should hand these out at the hospital. Ever tried to change a crib sheet in the middle of the night while your kids has either puked or peed on it. No one is happy, everyone is crying. This simplifies all of that and still lets you have and see your adorable sheet set you overpaid for. The snaps are so much easier to deal with and the sheet is super absorbent. We have two so if there is an accident - one gets replaced while the dirty one is washed.
B00003XAKP These sheets have survived numerous washes without fail. We keep one on the crib (or folded over in the pack n play) at all times. They've saved us many nights of wrestling to change sheets, we just change these!
B00003XAKP I really wish that I had this when my son was a newborn and all those midnight crib cya gongs could have been avoided. This is a really great and easy to use product. It is definitely one of the first things that I recommend to parents and I'm glad that we will have it around for our second child. Make sure tha you buy a backup one or teo for those late night changings. This came in very handy when our 18 month old went through potty training and just for any other leakages or accidents that kids sometimes have.My only complaint was that when we washed these in the wash, some of the snaps would break off. also, on a side note, as cheap as these are from Amazon, I have also been able to find the same brand at TJMaxx and Marshalls for half the price.
B00003XAKP When my son was a newborn, I was able to fold it in two and placed a blanket on top to make it a little more comfortable because it is kind of scratchy.  Now at four months it is at is full length and I still put a blanket on top of it.  Whenever he gets it wet I just take the blanket and the cover and wash it easily.  I don't have to mess with the fitted sheet and trying to get it off of the mattress which is so hard since they are so tightly fitted against the crib.  This makes life simple and cleaner.  You can use it anywhere.
B00003XAKP I really like this sheet!  It keeps the rest of my son's crib sheets dry, so easy to take off and clean. I have two so I just wash one and use the other.  Especially great for those nighttime leaks when you just need to change baby and the sheet and get back to bed!
B00003XAKP I thoroughly enjoy this product. It covers the full top surface of the crib, give or take an inch. My daughter has used 3 of these over the last 3 months. The upper material is soft and smooth with adequate middle absorption so that it catches excess moisture. I used one on her crib on top of a decorative sheet, another doubled over in her playpen under a practical sheet (since the playpen pad can't be easily washed), and a third to replace whichever one she soiled most recently. I have not yet had any problems with her getting underneath it. The snaps work well on small crib rails. They may not fit around larger crib posts. I highly recommend this to any new mother with an appropriate crib. At 3am, I love not having to wrestle with the crib mattress.
B00003XAKP I recently attended a baby shower and gave this as a gift.  The mother had requested a couple of these.  Since then she has given birth and this sheet has been working well for her.  Great idea for a baby shower gift.
B00003XAKP UPDATE: After washing them only a few times, the snaps have been falling off so this sheet is not very sturdy. I now call it a \"disposable sheet\" and would rate it only 3 stars if I was allowed to change the rating.My previous review:This sheet is a fantastic idea. Imagine waking up to feed your baby only to have them spit up and/or poop/pee on the bed sheet. Instead of taken apart the bumper to remove the mattress to change the sheet, all that is required is to unsnap the corners that secure sheet in place. Then you put another one on...the whole process will take you less than 5 minutes. I have three, one for the hamper, one on the crib, and one waiting to be used in case of a bed wetting!
B00003XAKP I absolutely love this sheet! Changing my babies sheet is effortless, thanks to this great invention. Just snap one off and snap another one on- so convenient, especially for those middle of the night changes! A couple of my snaps have fallen off over time, but it's no big deal, and the sheet will still work- I highly recommed this sheet to anyone who has a baby!
B00003XAKP The concept of this product is good, but I found the snaps extremely difficult to snap and unsnap (maybe they get easier with a little wear, but I haven't used it enough to see).  Therefore, I found it both quicker and easier just to take the mattress out all together and use fitted sheets (which are also more attractive).  I would only use this product if you have a mattress/crib set that have a fit making it extremely difficult to get the mattress out.  Seems like most crib mattresses slide out pretty easily, making this product pretty unnecessary.
B00003XAKP I registered for the Ultimate Crib Sheet after reading reviews in books and online.  All the praise is accurate!!!  It's better than the standard sheet savers because it covers the entire top of the matress - not just one part.  It snaps securely in place and can be changed in seconds!  I keep the regular crib sheet on the mattress for looks only (matches bumper and skirt) - baby never actually comes in contact with it.  Get two or three Ultimate Crib Sheets for easy changes - SO much easier to change than the regular sheets...removing and replacing the bumper for those sheet changes is a huge pain and time consuming.  This product makes cleaning up so easy!  The only drawback is that it only comes in white, but since it can only be seen looking INTO the crib, it not a big issue for me.
B00003XAKP These are the only sheets I have ever used in my son's crib. I bought one regular sheet to cover the mattress, and I've never taken it off. I just use my Ultimate Crib Sheets. I have three; I would recommend that number. I can't imagine how much of a pain it would be to have to lift the crib mattress up to change sheets...this is just SO EASY snap, snap, snap and you're done!I never dry mine in the dryer. I hang it on a drying rack and it's usually dry after a few hours. I want mine to last, and using the dryer tends to wear them out. I've never not had one on hand, with 3 total.
B00003XAKP I thought this looked wonderful in the store so I registered for a couple.  Afterwards I attempted to put a cute sheet and mattress pad in the crib... such a chore!  I started using these and haven't had to change the cute sheet since.  It's so easy to just snap on and not fuss with anything else.  It's a soft sheet on top, an absorbent layer in the middle, and a waterproof vinyl back so nothing leaks through.  I've changed it in the middle of the night in a couple minutes tops... it washes up great with my baby's normal laundry too!  I highly recommend these sheets.
B00003XAKP The cons?Every time I have to deal with this sheet, I swear that I hate it with every fiber of my being. The first time I tried to put in on the mattress, I was fussing and swearing at it and was sweating my butt off trying to get it hooked on. It is not intuitive at all to snap on:1) The snap bands aren't placed equidistant so you just have to guess at where they should go.2) In order to snap the opposite side you have to lean over and INTO the crib (or you have to pull it away from the wall)...3) All while trying to stick your fingers through the slats to pull the bands through and snap them.4) Once I had the bands hooked where it seemed they should...I got to the opposite end and there was NO WAY the bands were hooking--it was a few inches too short! GRRRRRRR!At that point, sweaty and frustrated, I gave up and threw the damn thing at my husband and told him to do it. Since then, I've had to do it myself, and I still hate it although I am getting better.The pros?It is nicely waterproof. When the boy spits up or his diaper leaks or he sweats a lot, it does not make it through to the mattress. But that said, it's not like there's a lot of liquid to worry about.We haven't had any issue with the snaps not staying snapped or the baby getting underneath the sheet.Overall?We are still using this, although I am not quite sure why. There has to be another solution that doesn't cause me mental anguish trying to put it on (although, honestly, sheets of any kind are a PITA). So I give it three stars, but with a warning that it's a pain to put on.
B00003XAKP at the head and foot of the sheet there are snaps that can come completely off.one elastic strap end snaps to the sheet then wraps around the crib rail and snaps back onto the sheet. if you undo both snaps you are left with a loose elastic band. baby could choke on it if you ask me. i liked the product for its ease of use.. but once i noticed the straps could snap completely off.. i stopped using it.
B00003XAKP We have something similar to this leftover from when my daughter was a baby and I wanted another, I wasn't ablt to find exactly the same pad but this is doing the job.
B00003XAKP When your little one spits up, vomits, or leaks in the middle of the night, this is a LIFESAVER!  Ok, I am exaggerating, but it sure beats getting the mattress out, taking off the fitted sheet, and then putting another on.  Just snap the buttons off, throw it in the washer, and put your little one back in the crib.  I have never had a problem with it shrinking but then I've never thrown it in the wash.
B00003XAKP I love this sheet!  I have 4 of them (2 for each child). It is super absorbent and stays in place! They are great for potty training accidents and for one unfortunate night with the stomach flu.  I used to wrestle with matress when changing the sheets but not anymore.  I have the pretty sheet that matches the bedding on the bottom and the crib sheet on top.  Now if there is a middle-of-the-night accident I just unsnap the cirb sheet, pull it off, and put a clean one in its place.  This is one a the gifts that I give at all baby showers because I think no Mom should be without at least 2 of these (you need a spare!)
B00003XAKP This is such a helpful product that helps keep the baby's sheets protected. I love how it has saved me from changing the entire crib sheets off of the mattress. It's saved me money since it protected the crib sheet so well that I haven't bought any new crib sheet. I'm still using the ones that I received during my baby shower. The elastic snaps definitely serve a purpose for safety so I use them but they are a little tiresome. If there were a better, yet safe, alternative for the snaps I would have given this product 5 stars. Overall, I'd highly recommend this product.
B00003XAKP They are so easy to put on (or change when you're half asleep) and really protect the baby's sheets. I have three of them right now! You need to be careful with them in the washer and dryer (the washer sometimes ripped the backings on them and the dryer sometimes broke off the snaps) but they are so worth it!
B00003XAKP The first time I went to change the crib sheet on my baby's crib I understood the importance of the Ultimate Crib Sheet!  It was given as a gift & I put one more on my registry after realizing I had to take the whole crib ensemble apart to change the sheet!  Now I change the sheet only occasionally & it is more for asthetics.  The Ultimate Cribe sheet snaps off & I put a clean one on - so easy & practical!  Save money on sheets & just get one or two decorative sheets & get at least 2 of these!!!Update at 7 mos (July04): I have survived VERY WELL with 2 of the Ultimate Crib Sheets - and boy when they start slithering around the crib & wetting through diapers & spitting up solids - you will be SO thankful to have this little dandy item!  Don't go without!!!!
B00003XAKP We registered for the Ultimate Crib Sheet because a cousin and a few friends raved about it - they said to get two so that one could be on the crib and one could be in the wash.  I received it at my baby shower, but we have found only limited value in this crib sheet for our 11 month old daughter.  I am glad we only have one of these!The Ultimate Crib Sheet that we have is the style with elastic straps on each corner, one fully-removable elastic strap in the center of the short end, and two straps on each long end.  We have a Pali Wendy 4-in-1 Convertible Crib and the corner posts are quite thick, to the point where the elastic straps are not long enough to easily go around the corners.  Instead on one end of the crib we have to resort to wrapping the straps around the crib slats adjacent to the corner posts and that means there's slightly less than full coverage of the sheet underneath.  Since our daughter is a \"perimeter\" sleeper who likes to be up against the edges of her crib, that is a problem.The majority of parents we know have purchased convertible cribs which have thick corner posts when configured as a crib or toddler bed. It would be easy for Summer Infant to make this sheet more adaptable to current crib styles by making the length of the corner straps longer or using multiple snap sockets to make the strap length adjustable.  This sheet fits better on a standard/traditional crib with thinner diameter corner posts.I also question the real value of this for older babies who move around in their cribs.  We have the crib bumper on now despite not having used it between 1-8 months of age because she is a real mover and likes to stay on the perimeter of her crib to sleep - she was sticking limbs out between crib slats and woke up crying as a result.  On the handful of occasions where she's thrown up in her crib (always when she's come down with an upper respiratory bug), she's inevitably hosed the bumper as well.  In those cases we have to just strip the whole crib anyways so the Ultimate Crib Sheet is of little real utility for us.I could see this being a big time saver for parents with traditional cribs or those with babies/toddlers who often have various \"accidents\" in their cribs and need to frequently change a crib sheet on the fly.  However we have found that a waterproof pad under a normal crib sheet works just fine for our baby.
B00003XAKP I use this on top of my crib sheet when my crib sheet is dirty and I don't have a replacement.  So in that sense it's helpful.  My daughter doesn't pee through her diaper so I haven't used it for liquid leaks.  It can probably hold a lot of pee, but the real question is why does your kid need this kind of protection? (unless you put them to sleep without a diaper on!)  I find all the snaps to be a pain in the butt.  If I could do over I wouldn't buy this VERY EXPENSIVE crib sheet.  I'd just get multiple regular crib sheets.
B00003XAKP The reviews that say this product is soft are all pretty old (2002-2004 isn). Recent reviews all agree that the product is not soft. Somewhere down the line they must have tried to save some money and made this product. I wouldn't sleep on this so will not use it for my son's crib. As far as protecting the sheet it probably does what is says...but I'll never know since I'm returning it.
B00003XAKP This is the BEST crib sheet out there! It can be simply used by itself by just fastening the straps to the sides of the crib or can be used with a more decorative sheet simply placed snugly in place over it.My daughter is now 6 months and has leaked out of her diaper on occassion, the mattress that she sleeps on cost around $120.00, so thanks to this sheet the mattress still looks the same as it did when we brougt it home.
B00003XAKP I absolutely love the idea of this crib sheet. After receiving one as a gift I immediately tried putting it in the crib. To my disappointment, the elastics at the corners will not fit around the wide posts of my crib. For those of you that have Italian made cribs (I have a Baby Italia), this sheet may not work for you either. This should come as no suprise since it is also harder to find crib bumpers that fit correctly too. Needless to say, if you have an Italian made crib, keep the packaging and the receipt. You may find that you'll have to try another brand.
B00003XAKP I bought three of these before my son was born and it was money well spent - we bought one cute sheet that goes with his bedding that we leave on and change the ultimate crib sheet as needed. Believe me, when your little one spits up in the middle of the night and you need to change the sheet, you will be so thankfull you just have to unsnap and put a fresh one on. Changing crib sheets with a bumber in place is a major pain! These are super soft, hold up to repeated washing, stay in place and absorb the mess away from your baby. Return all those cute sheets you bought and invest in a bunch of these - you won't regret it!
B00003XAKP Reality is...you don't have to have this, but it really helps simplify your life if you do.  You don't have to take off the crib bumper and lift the mattress to take off this crib sheet.  Instead, you just unsnap and place a clean one on top of the mattress.  I have a regular crib sheet under the Ultimate Crib Sheet for decorative purposes and in case he needs to be placed on it if my spare is dirty.  I give it 4 stars instead of 5 because it's annoying to have to snap all of the straps prior to washing it and also because there is some shrinking that occurs after it's washed (Make sure you put it on the low setting in your dryer).  Also, they are expensive.  I have two of them and it's worked out just fine.
B00003XAKP My sister recommended this product to me, and I wanted to like it.  It is very waterproof!  But the waterproof barrier makes this not breathable.  My baby would sweat profusely.  We always keep our house at 68-70 and dressed him in a cotton sleeper.  If he was laying on his back, his chest would be cool, but his back would be hot and sticky.  Or if laying on his stomach, his front would be sweaty, but his back cool.  Basically, whatever was touching the mattress pad could not breath and it was uncomfortable no matter what temperature adjustment we made.I will say the design configuration is very practical and a great idea.  Changing a fitted mattress sheet is a giant pain in the butt.  This pad makes it easy to clean up the crib after an accident and speed is critical in the middle of the night.I purchased a felted 100% wool mattress pad instead and couldn't be happier.  It was slightly more expensive, but it was worth it.  Wool is a truly fabulous product: very breathable, helps regulate body temp, naturally water resistant, anti bacterial and NATURAL!!!!  No man-made plastics or vinyl that you have to worry about weird off-gassing chemicals.  My baby stays dry and comfortable.
B00003XAKP Our crib does not have slats at the head and foot, so we can only use 8 of the snap straps ... after only two washings, the sheet is curling up at the ends and will not lay flat.  I am nervous that it could be dangerous once my baby is moving around more in the crib; she is only 3 months, so she stays put right now.  I will probably stop using this once she can roll over.
B00003XAKP It works well enough, but it takes so long to get all 10 of those snaps around the crib rails, ya might as well just change the regular sheet.
B00003XAKP The strings ripped off when I tried to pull it off of the crib. I also didn't like the idea of this being on top of the mattress and crib sheets. So it might be a good idea if you don't have a great baby mattress or aren't into decorating the baby space. At first I thought this product was clever, but once I got it I realized how useless it was. It's so easy to take the crib sheet off of my baby's crib, so I really never needed this.
B00003XAKP I had bought this sheet on the recommendation of others from Babies R Us.  The snaps make it a breeze to change, I'm so glad I don't have to take the mattress out of the crib all the time!  The waterproof backing is great not just for the diaper leaks but also for the spit-ups.  The only reason I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is because the snaps don't fit exactly around my crib rungs so it's a little wrinkled and off center, but my baby doesn't seem to mind.
B00003XAKP So easy to use, it's the only one I ever used!
B00003XAKP My daughter is 5 months old and has never leaked at night so it hasn't been necessary. So not sure if I would spend the money again knowing this. However, we use this when we let her air dry, and it definitely does work.
B00003XAKP Yes i have pretty sheets on the crib......but who wants to wash them every time there is a mess.  Well this is the answer!  So much easier (since they snap around the crib slats) to get on and off!  Waterproof!!  What else should i say!  Perfect gift!!!
B00003XAKP I measured the crib before purchasing this, but it was not a hood fit for our standard Jenny Lind crib. Some of the elastic snaps could not stretch far enough to snap closed, so they just hung thee. It did not make me feel comfortable to have those straps dangling since they could have been a potential choking hazard.
B00003XAKP Seemed like a good idea, but I didn't care for it. I returned it because it wasn't soft. Actual crib sheets are much nicer to look at too.
B00003XAKP This is a great product!  Buy two and put them both in the crib.  When your little one leaks in the night, just unsnap and toss the dirty one aside, and you'll have a clean one underneath.  As far as the snaps falling off, my son had pyloric stenosis (severe vomiting requiring surgery) and I washed these 3 or 4 times a day for weeks.  Never once did I have any of the permanent snaps fall (there are two completely detachable snaps on the ends that I don't even use).  I even washed and dried on the normal cycle (not gentle) in warm water (not cold, as is recommended).
B00003XAKP I bought this, put it on the crib, took one look at it, took it off, and returned it.  I have a standard 28x52 crib and this was too big for it--it bunched and wouldn't lay flat.  Also the snaps didn't match up well w/ my cribs slats and even if they did they were too long to actually be safe and secure.  This mattress pad/sheet creates an unsafe environment.  My daughter slept w/ us or a bassinet until she was 3 months old and by then the diaper leaks and constant spit up were behind us so I don't have to change her ordinary crib sheet that often anyway.
B00003XAKP A must have with babies. Buy at least two of these. Easy to wash and can be used anywhere, not only crib. Remove the elastic tabs and put it on the livingroom floor for baby to play or sleep.
B00003XAKP I thought I would love this to help do quick crib changes for when a child is sick, or has an accident/leak... however it is really annoying for me to weave the elastic around the crib slats to fasten the buttons-- really doesnt save time, and since our mattress cover is waterproof I dont really need another waterproof layer.
B00003XAKP I ordered two pack. One of them was an open item but the sheet looks fine and doesn't seem like have been used. I'm okay with that because i bought them for less than $4!
B00003XAKP My son spit up in his sleep for the first 6 months, so this product was wonderful.  However, by the time that he was 6 months old, all of my ultimate crib sheets had developed holes and cracks in the plastic backs.  The product was such a life saver that I will purchase new ones (maybe a different brand) for future children, but I really expected more than 6 months of use out of these.
B00003XAKP I love this item.  It is much easier for those middle of the night diaper mishaps, to just go in and unsnap the top sheet and put baby back to bed.  I have washed and dried the sheet and had no problems what-so-ever.
B00003XAKP This is supposed to save time instead of changing out the sheet, but I found it took just as long to change this as it does to change the actual sheet.  You have to reach all around the crib to do (or undo) all the snaps, which is aggravating and somewhat difficult depending on the placement of your crib.  Compared to just lifting up the mattress and quickly pulling off the sheet and putting a new one on, I think this might actually take longer.
B00003XAKP Yes, scratchy!  I was quite surprised by the rough texture of the top layer of the sheet.  It feels like very cheap, low thread count material, not nearly as soft as most bedsheets.  When my daugher used this sheet, she had a skin rash and started getting a bold spot on the back of her head.  It's possible, of course, that these were unrelated to the sheet.  However, both problems improved substantially when we removed it and put her on a softer, normal bed sheet.Also, I agree with another poster that this could be a dangerous product, especially if your baby is older and moves around her crib a lot.  There is no way to tuck the sides under, as with a regular sheet, so a baby could find her way under the sheet and suffocate.  Keep in mind, too, that undoing the snaps is very easy--so easy, a baby could do it!  The elastic bands connecting the sheet to the crib also make me nervous.  Could an older baby pinch or strangle herself in these?My daughter is now six months, and rolls around her crib.  I won't be regularly using this sheet anymore.  But, there is an upside.  This product is AMAZINGLY easy to use.  Snap, snap--that's it.  There is no lifting the mattress.  And it is waterproof underneath (unlike a certain zipper sheet, I could name), so in an emergency you don't have to worry about the mattress.  Recently, my daughter had a stomach virus, diarrhea everywhere.  To make matters worse, I caught it and was too light-headed to lift a 20lb crib mattress.  This sheet was perfect.
B00003XAKP I have never changed the sheet on my daughter's crib.  Instead, I have 2 ultimate crib sheets that I alternate between.  I can't tell you how awesome it's been.  In general, they're easier to change than regular crib sheets.  In a pinch (ie, diaper explosion or sick baby in the middle of the night), they make life SO much easier.  Just fold the sheet up to contain the mess, take it to the laundry room, snap the new one on, and you're good to go.I've read reviews that said they didn't like this sheet, but I love it.  You don't need any other mattress pad with it, either.
B00003XAKP I've had 2 of the ultimate crib sheets and been using them for 7 months now and I do not like them. I don't hate them, but I don't like them and will never purchase them again. The idea is wonderful, but parts of the product are too cheaply made. Within the first washing, some of the snaps were pulled off the sheet (with following the directions to re-snap the sheet before washing). That was disappointing. Thankfully, it was only 2 snaps and I was still able to make the sheet function. However, it does take some time to snap the sheet on securely and it isn't very soft or cozy for baby. It has kept accidents from leaking through and it did work well in that area, but as far as adding coziness or comfort or ease of use...it failed miserably. I bought mine through Babies R Us instead of Amazon but wanted to contribute a review regarding the product because I shop through Amazon much more often. I wish I had been better informed, I would have gotten the quick zip sheets instead. The attachments for the snaps are not well made and I would not recommend this product to new moms. Go for a different crib pad that will protect and add some softness/coziness to the crib. This sheet also does not retain warmth well - even after throwing in the dryer and then putting on crib, it cools quickly and remains cool which may be nice in the summer but not during a winter in South Dakota...One more additional note, it does take a very long time for these sheets to dry - an extra dry cycle in the dryer. Not handy or helpful.
B00003XAKP I played the game of frustration everytime I had to change a crib sheet......which became much more often after more blow outs and spitting up began!  I knew I wanted to keep the bumper and searched the internet to find a solution.  This was the first recommendation to pop up with rave reviews!  I tried one out and absolutely loved it! Changing sheets is a breeze!  They stay one very well too.  I liked it so much I ordered another to have as back up.  Highly recommended if you are done lifting that dang mattress up!
B00003XAKP I was able to find the original sheet at a local store, but paid more for it than on Amazon.  I thought I would receive the same sheet - but instead received the new design.  I don't like the new design nearly as much as the original.  It bunches up and doesn't snap at the ends like the original.  Not sure why they went to a poorer design but I wouldn't buy another one unless they added the end snaps.
B00003XAKP These only work if you crib slats are a certain size.  Our slats are too wide and the sheet would not snap around them.  We had to jerryrig the crib by adding plastic hooks that the snaps could fit around.  This won't work for us as baby gets older.  I do like that the sheets are easy to change, clean well and allow you to keep the crib safe without having to add a lot of bedding.  This product works well with the Halo Sleep Sacks.
B00003XAKP Our newborn baby boy has been having a ball spraying us every time we change him. Thank goodness we bought these crib sheets! I can't see the sheets underneath really well, since it covers the entire top of it, but it keeps it clean and dry. The top is soft, while the bottom is lined with plastic.
B00003XAKP Love this. I dont' have to keep washing the crib sheet. This makes it easier to keep my baby's bed clean.
B00003XAKP Try to change those sheets on a heavy crib mattress in the middle of the night after your kid has an accident and then try jus changing this pads. You will never go back!!  So easy to put, so easy to change, maybe not visually appealing but I go for practical not just looks. Best gift for a mom to be, well besides a prenatal massage :)
B00003XAKP The Summer Infant Ultimate Crib Sheet is a very useful product.  It protects the sheet, eliminating the need to change the crib sheet if there is diaper leakage or spitting up.  It goes on and off in seconds - so helpful to a Mom, especially in the middle of the night. It is large enough to cover the whole crib surface.  It seems to be waterproof and yet doesn't make the baby sweaty.My only concern would be that since it attaches to the crib rails, there is an outside chance a baby could loosen/undo a strap.I think it would be handy to have two of these to rotate them out.  I like it and would recommend it.
B00003XAKP Lifesaver for this middle of the might diaper leaks! It's always a pain to change a crib sheet in the middle of the night, but this makes it so much easier. I just put it on top of his regular sheet (which is over a waterproof mattress pad). He occasionally has a diaper leak. When he does, I simply unsnap the ultimate crib sheet (there are roughly 10 snaps to keep it in place) and let him sleep the rest of the night on his regular sheet. The snaps can be a little tricky to remove with one hand (say when you're holding a baby), but I generally start unsnapping while he is still in the crib.
B00003XAKP Did not know about these initially when I registered for my first baby.  Had one during her first year.  Now having a second baby and ordered three more!  They have made nights when the baby got sick so much easier!  Our first one did pill on the cloth side but baby doesn't mind and it still serves it's purpose.
B00003XAKP When my newborn was in her Co-Sleeper, changing wet bedding every morning was no big deal -- but a move to the crib meant a HUGE daily struggle to disassemble the bumper, manhandle the mattress and strip the sheet and mattress pad, then reverse the whole process after washing and drying. The Ultimate Crib Sheet is truly that: just undo a few snaps and toss it in the wash. It's soft and durable, and your expensive bedding and mattress pad stay fresh and dry. In hindsight, wish I'd had several of these on my registry.
B00003XAKP This product was pitched to me as a \"must have\" by all my mommy friends. It has been good for us in terms of middle of the night accidents (so we don't have to put a whole new crib sheet on), but there is one major issue with it. The straps don't line up properly with our crib rails, so it can never be totally attached to the crib. There are always loose straps hanging off or awkward folds in it when we try to strap it down. We tried over and over again to get it right, but to no avail. We do not believe this is an issue with our crib as it is a brand new, high quality one. We finally gave up the idea of strapping the Ultimate Crib Sheet down and now just put it under the regular crib sheet. This is ok, but then when we do have a late night accident and have to pull off the top sheet we always worry about the Ultimate Sheet not being strapped down properly. It's a good idea, but needs to be redesigned to fit current crib railings. I wouldn't purchase this product again or recommend it to a friend.
B00003XAKP I tried this out on my baby's standard size crib, and it fit horribly. The little loops that hold it down, don't seem safe at all!!! And they don't keep the sheet secure to the mattress. I don't know how they're allowed to sell these. They seem like a major safety hazard to me!!! Total waste of money!!!
B00003XAKP Seems to fit just fine except that the corner snaps could be longer.  We have a Sorelle Rosa crib with hidden hardware so the snaps must go around the outside of two bars for each corner.  The straps are just not long enough to effectively go around all 4 corners.  No big deal though as we just do two corners and then go around the first set of bars on the far side.  So the sheet is offset by a couple inches but doesn't appear to have enough slack to become a safety issue.  If our baby does start to try to get under the sheet it doesn't seem like a difficult task to just add our our strap extensions.  We'll probably be buying a few more to allow for more time between laundry runs.
B00003XAKP I bought these because a good friend recommended them.  They are awesome especially when kids have runny noses etc.  It saves me from having to change the crib sheet.  The only downside is you can't see the pretty design on the crib sheet but for me that is really no big deal.
B00003XAKR This pad has worked well for my son. He is 3.5 years old and we are trying to potty train him through the night. It's nice not to have to wash an entire sheet and mattress pad every time he has a small accident. It has never leaked and it's been washed many times and still retains its waterproof quality. The only reason I took off one star is because it's a little stiff and he was resistant to having it on his bed at first. He got used to it and now it is working fine.
B00003XAKR Started potty training and this has been our best purchase. Rarely my crazy sleeper will roll to a part of the bed thats not covered and pee but usually this pad protects the sheets and saves me from having to change all the sheets. Stays put. Washes well
B00003XAKR It does what it is intended to do, protect mattress from wetness. But it makes you sweaty when you sleep on it.
B00003XAKR I like the idea of this product but it wasn't as much of a help as I thought it would be.  It is not comfortable so you have to put it under the sheet which means a lot of changing or bedding during the middle of the night if there is an accident.
B00003XAKR Accidents happen with little kids, this is a really easy way to make sure the bed is kept clean and dry especially if you have a loft or bunk bed you don't want to climb up to, to tear apart.
B00003XAKR The method that I used for potty training had me completely throw away the diapers and didn't allow for pull ups.  (It worked well!)  About a month after we started my daughter had a string of accidents at night out of the blue.  I was constantly changing sheets and was tired of it, that is when I found this.  Turns out my daughter was sick at the time, but once I got two of these it was so easy to just move her and take this pad off to wash it instead of stripping and remaking the bed.  I wish I had known about this when I first started potty training (for nap time and bedtime).  It is also relatively small to pack if you are traveling somewhere and you are afraid of your child wetting the bed this is great for that too.  I now have this off of her bed again, but I can't say enough good stuff about this product.
B00003XAKR For a Training pad these are super easy to use, wash and make acceptable with your kid. Have 5 of them now as we braved no diapers at night early on.
B00003XAKR I use this along with a water proof mattress pad, to minimize the number of times I have to launder EVERYthing, and it is fantastic.  It does exactly what it is supposed to do, without problems of any kind.  And my kids don't really even know it is there.
B00003XAKR This is an excellent mattress pad to use during potty training.  It's also good for the time before that just in case there are leaks.  It's very absorptive and easy to put on and take off.
B00003XAKR I bought this at a discounted price and that is the only reason I am not returning it. It fits across our mattress just fine and we are able to tuck it in. The annoying part is that the top of the pad won't stay put. It continually rolls up and then my son is sleep with a big crease across his chest and tummy....which is not very comfortable. I wish I had waited and purchased the Brolly sheet instead of buying this one...even with the cheap price.
B00003XAKR If your child moves around in the bed and you don't have this positioned exactly where they are they will miss.  And it doesn't secure to the bed that well.  I would look for something bigger and something that fits the entire bed, not just a small section.  I'll probably trash it and get a better one, I don't want to risk ruining my bed if my 3 year old misses the pad.!00% would not recommend it.
B00003XAKR We are in the process of night-time training our 4 year old.  This has saved us a lot of sheet washing.  Considering the disposable pads run about $1 a piece, this quickly paid for itself.  I am considering getting another.
B00003XAKR I absolutely LOVE the Handy's Plus Pad.  I purchased 5 of the full-size pads for my son over a year and a half ago and I think they are GREAT.  My 4-year old has slept in a full-size bed since he turned 2.  These pads really work (no leaks!), are comfortable and wash-up well.  I only have 2 complaints ... 1. the side-flaps aren't quite long enough to fully tuck under if you have a pillow-top mattress (although you can make it work if one side of the bed is against the wall and you pull the opposite side really tight)  AND  2. the top and bottom of the pad tend to \"curl up\" after several washings.  Despite these complaints, I have not been able to find a pad that is even near the quality and comfort of this one.  The reason that I own 5 of these is that, if you truly want \"full\" coverage on the bed for a child that rolls all over while sleeping, you need to use 2 with some slight overlap (so, 2 to use and 2 for back-up).  I also use one (full-size) on the Spinmaster Flip-Open Sofa to keep spills and accidents from staining the sofa.  The full-size fully covers the full-length of the sofa.  I think this is a \"must have\" product for parents of toddlers that don't want to be constantly changing bed sheets or trying to \"wash\" a children's sofa that really isn't meant to be washed.(fyi ... If you like Basic Comfort's Ultimate Crib Sheet, then you'll also like their Handy's Plus Pad.  The Handy's Plus Pad is basically the Ultimate Crib Sheet with side flaps and without the snaps.  In fact, the pad portion of the Handy's Plus Pad - Full size is almost the same size as the Ultimate Crib Sheet.)
B000046S2U I got this because it used regular trash bags and you don't have to worry about a huge long twisted snaky thing unraveling when you take it to the trash.  I've been using it almost a year.  I do use those cheap Bowl Fresh toilet deodorizers instead of ordering the disks.  I clip the hanger off and break it in half (while it's still in the plastic) and add half or both, just depends.  The deodorizers last about 1-2 months and it's cheap! I empty it about every 3 days and spray it down w/ Lysol before adding another bag.  Not had any stinky problems and this is in my hallway right by the familyroom. I do take it outside every month and give it a good cleaning w/ bleach and a garden hose.
B000046S2U This is an OKAY diaper pail for the money. It doesn't TOTALLY eliminate the smell and the bags are hard to change. I don't even try any more to 'twist' the bag, I just take the lid off. It is very easy to open and I wonder about my son getting in it as he gets older. If this is all you can afford, it's not that bad.
B000046S2U Excuse me,...but this product is so far from being odorless.  At first, it was (maybe a little less than a month), odorless then after that,...there was nothing to get rid of the scent.  I even bought some odor discs but they didn't work either.  The only convenient thing about this is that you can put whatever garbage bag you want in it and even then, the bag can hold many diapers.
B000046S2U My husband and I picked out this diaper pail when I was pregnant with my son because friends told us to get one that uses regular garbage bags. That turned out to be the only perk of this diaper pail. The springs have been popping off since about the first month. My son is now 10 months old and recently one of the springs broke, which completely gets rid of the supposed &quot;odor-free&quot; feature (which I found wasn't exactly true either).  Now that we are expecting baby #2 I am going to have to buy another diaper pail to replace this one. My advice: Don't waste your money. It's just as efficient to throw your diapers in a regular trash can.
B000046S2U Yes, my spring broke as well... but looking on the brighter side: when my son is old enough to walk he won't be able to accidently press the spring button to release the pail cover... it's kind of an unexpected safety feature! And yes, you can still open it with one hand... your fingers are not glued to one another. Really, diapers will stink no matter what pail you use.... The covered pail is cheap and doesn't require buying refill bags (especially since we use cloth diapers).
B000046S2U We have used this pail for 3 years, and 2 kids.  The advantage is that this pail doesn't require any special bags. We change out the bag twice a week.  You save a lot of money if you get sheap bags at Dollar Tree or Big Lots (works out to about 10-cents a bag).  It does get stinky sometimes, but all garbage pails do and every child has an extra stinky diaper occasionally.  Roll with it and save money when and where you can.
B000046S2U I've been using this pail for 2 months with my breastfed baby. It contains all of the odor from his moderatly stinky diapers. It doesn't work exactly like it's supposed to, the blue dome is supposed to push the diaper into the pail but the diaper usually gets stuck and I have to push it through but that's no big deal. When I'm changing the garbage bag the lid won't stay open and it falls hitting my hands, it's really annoying.
B000046S2U Initially my husband and I decided not to purchase a diaper pail because we wondered what was the point, diapers stink and no matter how much money one spends on a diaper pail it's going to emit odors and smell bad. Then, when we were changing diapers ten times a day we decided it would probably be easier to have one, especially for the middle of the night diaper changes. Several of my friends disapproved of the Diaper Genie and recommended we purchase an inexpensive diaper pail that uses regular garbage bags. We took that advice and selected the Safety 1st diaper pail and we are pleased with the product. Odor-Less - No. We empty it as needed, usually once a week, and realize it's a diaper pail - just as our garbage pail in the Kitchen needs to be emptied daily someday so will the diaper pail. I place an aroma jell in the little basket which helps with the odor.
B000046S2U Purchased this unit to hold adult size large briefs and have been pleasantly surprised.  Holds approximately 8 soiled briefs with virtually no smell emitted (except when adding more to pail).  I wish it held more but I'm so happy to have something that helps with this &quot;unmentionable&quot; problem that I really am not concerned by the small-ish volume.  I'm having trouble finding replacement deodorizer disks though and may have to use a stick-on unit or something when a new one is required.
B000046S2U I really like this diaper pail.  It helps with odor control, but is certainly not odorless.  As if anything can disguise the odor of a poopy diaper.  I think that a diaper pail is a must in the nursery.  There are just too many diapers to not have one and an open garbage can or even a regular one is just too stinky.  This one has a lid that closes nicely to shut out odors.  It has a nice little compartment for odor disks to help manage odor.  It can be a bit of a hassle to empty and reload, but it only needs changing about every two days and since it fits regular kitchen bags, it is worth the money.  It isn't very expensive to begin with.
B000046S3T What a waste of money and more importantly my time!This thing does not work well at al!! I can't fit a larger cable through it.  PLUS if you have plugs that go sideways like our ROKU does. You can't use it. So i had to buy a power strip but the power strip is too thick and won't work. So this ended up in the garbage.
B000046S3T Bought this to keep my toddler from unplugging some important plugs (ie: tv, chest freezer, etc) It works very well and is extremely secure. I actually have a very tough time getting into this. The narrowness makes this not work for adapters or thick cords. And the two small openings at the bottom of the unit are for thinner or normal sized cords only. I had a hard time getting my thicker cords through (the surge protector and chest freezer cord). I actually broke the bottom section that separates for two cords off so the larger cords would go in more easily. When I did this I was actually only able to put one cord per cover. Recommend this just for thin plugs, no adapters. Good buy for the price.
B000046S3T My little guy is very active and loves to get into trouble. We only have a couple items plugged into an outlet that isn't covered by furniture so I purchased these to make sure he couldn't pull the plug out of the wall and get shocked. They are wonderful and I feel much safer letting my little guy explore the house. Even though I am never too far away our let him out of sight he still manages to get into things. He is so fast and just a little distraction could be fatal. But I don't have to worry about the plugs anymore! One less worry and just the little bit of stress relief that makes this purchase very easy for me to recommend it to all parents.
B000046S3T I bought these to help baby proof my house.  My son gets into everything!!  These covers are fantastic.  They are sort of hard to get open when installing them.  There is no way my son will be able to open them....he's tried! haha.  Only problem is, it doesn't prevent him from pulling on the wires.  So you still need to be vigilant :)
B000046S3T There are two pieces to the outlet cover: back part replaces the outlet cover (and needs to be screwed on) and the front cover, which is released from the back cover by squeezing the two plastic pieces on the sides. The plastic side pieces are part of the back part, made of stiff plastic and extremely difficult to squeeze. This outlet cover also did not fit one of my outlets (it would not stay flush to the wall).
B000046S3T These outlet covers do just what they are supposed to. I'm not at all concerned about my little ones being able to bust into them...they are hard enough for adults to disconnect! I wasn't sure about the quality of a Safety 1st product (seems to be hit or miss with this company), but I was pleasantly surprised by the integrity of these covers. And the price is great for a 2-pack.
B000046S3T Unfortunately you cannot tell from the picture, but this product is not well designed. It projects far out from the wall, and cannot accommodate any plugs larger than a two prong (meaning non grounded) table lamp cord. Anything like a power strip, laptop cord, etc, will not even be able to be plugged in because the casing blocks it. In addition, the slot to feed the cord through to exit the device is also very small and fits almost none of the electronics in my house. It also sits on top of the outlet cover, so there is no way to really secure it tightly and it can rotate a bit.
B000046S3T These are fine for standard, thin power cords.  We have had one in place that the kids have never dislodged despite two years of trying.  But they will not close over the heavy, thick cords like those for microwaves, computers, or power bars.  We finally ended up attaching ours to the wall with duct tape to cover those cords.I am giving this three stars because it does work fairly well for thin cords, and because I have yet to see anything better out there.  My advice?  Invest in duct tape.
B000046S3T This things install quickly and easily if you're running standard cords (for lamps, etc.) though the holes.  If you want to run something thicker (like the wire on one of my power strips) I found I had to do a bit of modification to make it fit.  I ended up trimming the gap so it was larger on the backside plate and that did the trick.I think the ones I got are more than difficult enough to keep my son from opening them.  I'd consider them on the fence for an outlet that I'd want access to all the time, and someone with arthritis would probably want to stay away.
B000046S3T I had a couple major issues with this outlet cover.#1: The screw that probably is in your existing wall outlet covers is not long enough to accommodate this outlet cover. They made it much thicker than the outlet cover it replaces so for me, I need to go purchase a handful of screws.#2: Box is not big enough to accommodate ANYTHING except basic, small, two-prong plugs. So what won't fit? Our laptops, our phone charger (Samsung Galaxy has a small box that plugs into wall), iPod chargers, computer charger, power strip plug, light dimming plug attached to lamp, DSLR charger, baby sound machine, Verizon Fios plugs. Well crap... what appliance plugs DID fit, you ask? A lamp. Just one lamp. Oh, and the electric toothbrushes.Useless, sending them back. The Safety 1st units are square (not pyramid shaped) and hold various plugs.
B000046S3T If you want to keep the plug in there forever, it is the best one. But the first time, you still need to open it to install. After you put it on the wall, it's really hard to remove. Another con is the cover is too small, that I cannot put anything other than a stand lamp in it.
B000046S3T These work great to keep kids out of the plugs and are easy enough to remove by an adult. We use them in our nursery.
B000046S3T The slots for the cords on the bottom of the cover are too small.  I wanted to be able to thread the powerstrip's cord up into that--but this is meant for thin wires like a lamp or something-- not a thick wire.  Also, it wouldn't cover the box of the cell phone charger, either.  This is for very basic wires and plugs.
B000046S3T These are designed to cover plugs you leave plugged in, such as lamps or alarm clocks, so keep kids from pulling on the plugs/cords and damaging them or injuring themselves.  And that's exactly what they do.  We use several in our home and have had no problems.  They're also very easy to install with a simple screwdriver.Many of the negative reviews here complain either it is too hard to open (which is completely the point) or that it only holds \"small\" (aka standard) plugs, which should be obvious from the description and picture, so they're not really being fair.
B000046S3T I bought this thinking it was a great idea but you can't use it with any plugs that have a larger than standard plugs. I feel everything of my children's has an oversize plug that goes in the wall. Have yet found anything to use it for.
B000046S3T This thing works but it's very tricky getting off. If you work it a little you figure out how it will just pop off. Don't get discouraged like I did. Work it gently and It will come off easy with a little presure. Does not fit a bulky box plug in head only standard ones like a lamp.
B000046S3T Great to keep kids away from plugs, but it prevents me from using the plugs as well. If you have something that is plugged in permanently, it may work great but don't use this for an outlet you need to access regularly.
B000046S3T I have 18 month old twins, and an older child with cerebral palsey, she has a hospital bed downstairs where we all get together during the day and evening and the babies are always getting into the cords, pulling them out of the wall, came on amazon (found this) and it goes over even the thick cords for the hospital bed (3 prong) so it is well worth the money as the babies have now completely given up on the cords :)
B000046S3T My 2 year old hasn't been able to figure them out yet, so naturally, we're sold! He pretty much ignores them now. Yay!
B000046S3T These were a complete hassle to pry apart just to install them.  My mom and I each held a side and pulled, but nothing.  I finally had to shove in the latches as far as I could to get them apart.  Since that seems to be the only way to take the cover off, I had to leave the latches pushed in, defeating the purpose of keeping kids from pulling them off.  Definitley something I would use as a permanent fixture.  It's too much of a hassle to take it off every time you need to plug something in.  I plugged in what I needed to and have not intention of switching them up.
B000046S3T I attempted to pop this thing open for about 20 minutes then gave up. It took both my husband and I 10 minutes to finally pry it open. Yes, it's childproof, but also adultproof too which is not convenient at all. It also doesn't fit all outlets. I ended up getting the Safety 1st covers because they don't have the sides that have to go into the wall, instead they protrude out.
B000046S3T This thing is so hard to get off that neither you nor your children will ever get to your outlets again.  This is not a product you should buy if you want to use your outlets once in a while.  It took me 15 minutes to pry it open.
B000046S3T What a pain to to remove the cover and does not fit some plug types.  Only the smallest plugs will work like lamp plugs not not thick cords like computer plugs.  Xbox, ps4, etc are out of of the question. You can replace computer cables with thinner, lower grade cables to get around this.
B000046S3W I gave this product 4/5 stars for a couple reasons:Pros - mostly keeps fingers away from the plugs and sockets but only because they can't reach the sockets with little fingers, durable, hard for a child to take apart, completely kept our first son away.Cons - harder for an adult to quickly put together and take apart, doesn't keep little extremely curious fingers out of the top hole area (though they can't reach the part that would shock them), and doesn't stop our son from unplugging the cord since there is space for the cord to be pulled upward so that the plug comes out of the socket.  The plug won't come out of the box easily, but it can still be unplugged, and since it's harder for an adult to get fingers in the top part to plug it back in, it has to be taken apart to be plugged back in.Overall, it's done the job very well, but it is big and isn't perfect (though I doubt anything is).
B000046S3W I love this item. I got two for my apt. My kids are no longer turning the lights out or pulling cords. I absolutely love this item.
B000046S3W I love this thing. It fit our large power strip easily. Also very easy to use. I would highly recommend.
B000046S3W The only other cover I could find wouldn't fit my power strip so I ordered this one. It seems sturdy and does fit fine, but the opening is way too big. My 8 month old could definatly fit at least a few fingers all the way in and touch the plug in no problem because I could. I decided to keep it and put clear packing tape around the opening.
B000046S3W 
B000046S3W They are as shown, and work great so that kids can't pull out the many cords that we all use easily!  I would recommend it to anyone with young tots!
B000046S3W I returned this product due to the several reasons:-  It is too bulky- I ended up pinching my finger while installing it ( do not want my child to do it since he will be trying to figure out how to open it)
B000046S3W I tried to use this power strip cover for about 2 months when our twin daughters were 8-10 months old. It was frustrating for my husband & I -- hard to get the power strip inside, hard to keep things plugged in, and too big to hide out of the babies view (not to mention that it's bulky and a bit ugly). For the babies, it became yet another interesting thing around the house that we had to wrestle from their hands. They were able to unplug the cords easily and were starting to reach their fingers into the top hole when I finally gave up on using it. Yes, the cover did keep the babies from actually touching the outlets in the power strip, but I could have accomplished the same thing with a couple of normal outlet covers.In the end, I rearranged our cords making the power strip & this cover unnecessary. It was just too annoying to keep using the cover.
B000046S3W I love this product it keeps my son safe. I enjoy how I can reach my skinny fingers into it unplug one thing and still leave it in the power strip cover but my son can still not get into it at all. It has been great to have especially now for all the Christmas lights we have going on.
B000046S3W this helps from letting my daughter play with the actual outlet and plug in, but she can still pull the cord out of the plug in the inside.  so it does protect her from being electified, but she can still unplug the tv lol
B000046S3W This cover was alright, the hole does seem a bit large and it wasn't quite long enough for our biggest power strip, but I have yet to find a cover that is, so I can't dock any stars for that
B000046S3W This power strip cover is meant to be a baby-safe product, but even though I do like it and it leaves enough space for even thick cords and wide plugs, my daughter can stick her hand right down in there.  That fact pretty much defeats the purpose of even having the cover.  But it does at least make the whole thing look less appealing to her, so she doesn't bother it too much.  But the slot really should be narrower.
B000046S3W I ordered this some time ago. I finally started using it last week. It was very difficult to figure out how to use. But, once I ready the instructions a few times I got it.  My 8 month old loves all electric cords. I needed something to protect her. For the past week this has been working.Only one side of it can I get a big 3 prong plug into it. I only need 2 openings to get in and out of so it hasn't presented itself as a major problem yet. I would purchase another one of these.
B000046S3W This is a perfect baby proofing tool.  The strip cover will cover most standard sized power strips.  There is a hole on the side for the power strip to plug into the outlet and a wide opening on top for it to connect to the devices plugged into it.  It is really easy to put together- just snap shut in 3 places.  It is also easy to adjust as there is a button on the side that allows you to slide it between different sizes.  Overall, best power strip cover I've seen.
B000046S3W We have several surge protectors throughout the house and these covers fit them well and protect the plugs and open outlets.  They do their job well.I have not tried to wall mount.
B000046S3W So far, my 2 year old has been able to pull the cords out, but hasn't been able to get his little fingers down near the outlet, which is really the important part. One nice plus is it actually neatens the look of the power strip, instead of making it look tackier.
B000046S3W Really? How could this possibly be useful? I saw somebody else post that the baby's hand can fit inside and I thought they were exaggerating. Really, I can reach my fingers in easily or poke a metal object through even easier. The baby's whole hand fits through the giant gap. Plus the thing is huge. Like almost as big as a shoe box. And really ugly. I don't know what we'll replace it with since the others don't sound better, but I know there is no point in decorating my living room with baby proofing for show. There's no way I could leave baby in there with this while I was out of the room, so I might as well just leave the cords as is.
B000046S3W What a great idea, to protect your power strip.  Wish i had one of these growing up and could have prevented a lot of nights being sent to my room without dinner.
B000046S3W I bought this power strip cover to protect my toddler from the power strip we have under a chest in our living room. The design is sturdy and fits our power strip perfectly, it is also easy to put  together. But it has two big minuses:1. Its height. The wires can bend but this is about 1 inch higher than the plugs, so if you want this to go under a piece of furniture you may want to consider whether it fits under or not. It barely fits under our chest.2. THE REAL ISSUE: The width of the slot through which the cables come out. MY TODDLER's HAND AND A PORTION OF HIS ARM fit through the slot perfectly, so he can reach the outlets AND the switch of the power cord. What is the point of this item? We just hope, at this point, that it will be a further discouragement--and since the piece is all but wedged under the chest, we will get to him before he can pull the thing close enough to stick his little hand in. Hopefully we'll find something better soon.You can presumably use it by covering every unused outlet in the cord with outlet covers. Although the toddler will be able to reach in, he will probably not have the strength or dexterity to pull out the outlet covers while his hand movements are limited by this shell. This, of course, would not stop him/her from turning the switch off--in our case, this means resetting the clock and being without a phone for however long it takes us to notice the deed, among other bothers.In summary: buy it only if you mean to attach it to the wall. And if you are planning to do the wall, keep in mind that this is pretty big--like attaching a 1L bottle of soda to your wall, only it is a solid, ugly off-white contraption with wires spewing off it.
B000046S3W We used this behind the tv for all the connects and cords. It works well and keeps all the cords from being pulled.
B000046S3W Does the job! It's huge. But, it has to be to fit everything in there. I'm just grateful someone made something like this to keep our kids safe from electrocution. :)
B000046S3W This is the best power strip cover I have found.  We tried the Mommy's Helper cover but it doesn't shut very securely and doesn't fit some larger plugs.
B000046S3W Doesn't fit the strip we have our computer/tv plugs in. Its too small. We intended it to use there, but are using it in our bedroom instead.
B000046S3W My 2 year old never cared about the power cord under my computer (that powers the router), but once she discovered the entire family's reaction to pressing that red button, she sure loved sneaking down there.  This stopped that instantly.
B000046S3W Nothing special...it does the job of covering what it is suppose to. Unfortunately it still draws the attention of a 9 month old baby....but nothing gets past them anyway!It is safer to just have no wires/plugs anywhere that babies can see them but if you cant this at least makes it impossible to get to outlets.
B000046S3W This has been a life saver! It has kept my now 18 month old son out of the plugs and safe and I could not be happier with this product!
B000046S3W It's funny how many people have positively reviewed this. Yes, it's very convenient, easy to use, and fits well. What it doesn't actually do is effectively COVER the plugs! It's trivial for a small child to fit their entire hand in the rather large opening. In fact, I just plugged something in without having to remove the cover. If I can fit my hand in there, so can a child. And it doesn't even begin to protect against a child sticking a metal object in there. This product is, in a word, worthless.I recommend getting one of the power strips that has sliding covers on each of the individual outlets, or simply placing standard child-proof covers on the outlets of your existing power strip. But please don't use this product and think you are adequately protecting your child from shocks.
B000046S3W Product is HUGE covering.  The product was very bulky, I can't imagine using it as it takes up so much room.  The vendor was not a problem.
B000046S3W This cover was enormous and I have an extra long power strip so it didn't completely cover it.  I just ended up getting a power strip with a longer cord and moving it behind a bookcase.
B000046S3W It's a pain to get on and off and the opening for the cords is pretty wide so that my kids can still get their fingers in there to where the outlets are. This is really more like a &#34;slow them down&#34; as opposed to preventing them from getting in.
B000046S3W I bought and returned the other popular brand of power strip cover because it doesn't fit iPhone/iMac chargers.  This one does.  And it adjusts lengthwise so you can make it pretty long if you need it to.  Some other reviews mention the size of the opening on the top - it's true, it's surprisingly wide, I can usually reach in enough to pull out a plug when I need to, rather than opening the whole thing.  So could your kid conceivably pull one of your plugs out when you don't want him/her to?  Sure, but the cover is also tall enough that it would be pretty darn hard for them to stick their fingers down into the open sockets.  Bottom line: treat this as a deterrent and not a substitute for knowing when your kid's playing with power cords.
B000046S3W This fits a very specific style of power strip. Fully straight, single row.
B000046S3W We have a in floor outlet under our love seat that we have a power strip attached to.  We didn't want to get rid of the power stripe because it runs my husbands laptop and the table lamp.  This is was the perfect solution.  It was easy to install and so far my 7 month old can not get into it!
B000046S3W Easy to use!
B000046S3W I got this for my son's room and it would be fine except that most kid stuff has larger plugs that do not fit inside (for example for the wipes warmer).  If you are plugging in standard sizes only, it should work great.  We ended up not using it.
B000046S3W Great option for covering your outlets from little fingers. Easy to use and store away. Adjust to different lengths by pressing the buttons.
B000046S3W Seriously, I just got this, and this product is not worth a single penny. It is too bulky and gets in the way. Even when it is on its smallest setting! Not just that, but there is a large opening at the top for the cords to fit through, but the gap is so big, my kids can still unplug the cords and play with them.
B000046S3W I have two very busy almost two year old twins who were fascinated with the power strip in their playroom. This cover isn't the most attractive thing, but works. They cannot reach into it or access anything, (not sure what hole people are talking about), and have left it alone.  It's about the size of a one liter soda bottle, and slides together/apart to extend the length. It is tall enough, but not quite long enough to secure together firmly on our extra long power strip. It still works however, and is the best solution I've found. Would recommend.
B000046S3W This power strip easily keeps my breast-pump plug secure. It also covered as well as the other plugs :) Easy to use and sturdy.
B000046S3W This fits over various charger cords though it is bigger than I expected. I think the slot is a little bigger than it needs to be as I can get my fingers in there. The biggest plug I have in there right now is a usb phone/tablet charger. I haven't tried anything with the heavy blocky plugs.
B000046S3W I bought this \"neutral\" color (off-white) cover (UPC 5218110409, model 10409A - I don't know how that differs from model 10409) andMommy's Helper Power Strip Safety Coverto compare the two.  Unlike that item, this cover is expandable from 9\" to 13.5\" in length.  The roughly-cylindrical compartment is about 3.5\" wide and 4\" high. The slot where the cords for the equipment come out is 5/8\"-1\" wide and a maximum of 10-3/4\" long.  When closed, the hole for the power strip cord is 1-3/8\" by 1/2\".  Holes are provided in the base for wall mounting, but no accessories are provided.To open the thing, you press two tabs on the inner lower cover, then slide off the outer cover, then lift the inner top cover.  Place the power strip into the inner lower cover, then replace the inner top cover, then slide the inner cover into the outer cover.The plastic is stiffer compared with the Mommy's Helper model, but it also seems more brittle.  I don't like the fact that there is no way to flick the power strip switch without half-disassembling the thing. It can hold a wider and higher strip and transformers than the Mommy's Helper model by about 3/4\" in either direction, which is nice. Buy this from Amazon.com!
B000046S3W I believe that this product would prevent a child from tampering with a power strip, but the plastic is quite thin and I was worried as I used it that it would break. As I was installing it I tried to be very careful as it seemed as though the plastic was quite thin.
B000046S3W Fits all of my cords (even my Apple cords) perfectly.  Works exactly as advertised.
B000046S3W This works pretty well to keep little hands from grabbing power strips. It also has the option of hanging it on the wall which I really like. The things I was not happy about was the quality of the plastic seems flimsy and also if you have to hook it on the last hole due to the size of your power strip it barely stays together. For our longest strip we had to duct tape around the entire device to make sure it stays together. Other than that it's a decent little contraption that does its job.
B000046S3W its a great product especially if you have mobile kids, babies or toddlers. keep in mind its kind of bulky i didnt think of that when ii purchased this but still a good buy for what i needed it for!
B000046S3W So far this has worked well for us. It's not pretty but it is effective. Will update this is my son figures out how to take it apart.
B000046S3W Although unfortunately for only medium sized power strips? I couldn't get this to cover my living room power strip for my electronics because it wasn't quite long enough. Great for a smaller/medium sized power strip though.
B000046S3W This cover works well for my power strips -- all the ones in my house fit. Also, I like that it doesn't matter how big the plugs are that you have in the power strip, it holds them (those large converter plugs that won't fit is so many child proof products fit fine in this one.My child is 10 months and hasn't messed with these yet, so I can't say how they will hold up with a larger toddler. However, I was concerned she'd try to put her hand in the slot that cords come out of and that hasn't happened yet. You still have to manage how the cords coming out of this cover are child-proofed. There is some space to roll up excess slack and stuff it into the cover.
B000046S3W To bulky, not what I expected or needed. Needless to say I gave it to a family member that could use it in a different area. Would not buy again.
B000046S3W Essential if you are in the process of baby-proofing the living daylights out of your apartment/house, as I am. This product not only makes the powerstip safe for kids, but it also allow your chords to be in a neat casing and not all over the floor.
B000046S3W This powerstrip cover is pointless.  Any child can get their hand in it and get shocked.
B000046S3W This is a little bigger than I thought it was gonna be, but it does the trick. It's big enough to hold my my chargers for phone, bluetooth, ect. I did knock off one star due to the hole where the cords come out of is juts a little too big. My son who is 18 months can fit his hand in this gap and  can almost reach the outlet.
B000046S3W My little one looooves plug ins.  This product prevents her from unplugging my electronic devices, from trying to plug things into the power strip, and from flipping the power strip into the off position.  It keeps my child and my electronics safe!My only critique of this item is that it seems a bit flimsy when fully extended.  The power strip for my entertainment center is a pretty standard length and size and fits in this strip cover with the cover extended fully.  When extended, the cover can wiggle, and if wiggled enough, little hands could possibly figure out how to separate the two pieces, thus gaining access to the power strip.  In an effort to avoid this scenario, I have placed the product placed far enough under my entertainment center that my child would really have to reach to get to it, so the level of concentration that it would take her to both reach for the power strip and open the cover is beyond what she is capable of doing.I am still satsified with this product despite its weakness when fully extended, however, because when I placed the bare power strip in the exact same location, my daughter had no problem both reaching for the power strip and flicking it into the off position.  Furthermore, seeing all those cords, outlets, and plugs motivated her to move the power strip to where she could reach it better and within a matter of moments, she would happily turning it on and off, unplugging things, and trying to \"plug\" foreign objects into it.  So another thing this product succeeds in doing is making the power strip less attractive for her by covering up all the things she likes most about them- buttons, plug ins, and outlets.If this device were more readily accessible (ie: out in the open) I think my daughter would have no problem figuring out how to open it and thus rendering it useless.  It might not have the same problem with a smaller power strip because the product wouldn't need to be fully extended.
B0000482F9 These are a great idea but didn't work for me.  Our cords are thick and long and wouldn't fit inside the box.
B0000482F9 Functional and easy to use.  They do the job.  They aren't the prettiest thing, but they work to keep my son safe, which is the most important.
B0000482F9 Many kids have been able to remove safety devices in less than 30 seconds.  It takes less than 5 minutes for a parent to leave the room to get something and return to find their child hanging from the cords...DEAD!!!  It is safer to spend the money and go CORDLESS!!!  But if you must keep your corded blinds, get the Fashion Wand (approved by PFWBS).  Go to Parents for Window Blind Safety (PFWBS) website and read all the testimonials of kids who died or were severely injured by blind cords.  Watch the videos they have of kids bypassing or breaking safety devices on cords in less than 30 seconds.  And then decide if you want to install a safety kit or remove the danger altogether.
B0000482F9 There is no perfect solution to window blind cords, but I think these do well. I actually used this kind years ago for pets. I do usually have to open and close them to unwind, but that is okay. What is important is that they put the cord high above a child's reach. I just ordered many more for the rest of the windows. However, for the kid's room we have the kind that is screwed into to the wall and wraps the cord around, so there is no chance of these plastic parts falling.
B0000482F9 We have busy almost-two year old twins who are fascinated with the many window blinds in our house. I didn't want to spend a fortune, but needed a quick fix. These did the trick, easy to install, and keep the cords just out of their reach. They do pop off from time to time, but are easily replaced. I've purchased several different brands, and they are all about the same. I wouldn't spend extra money on ones that claim to do better than this type.
B0000482F9 Although the design of these is to wind the cord shorter, when a window is open and blinds are drawn the cord does get longer. I left a room for 30 seconds and came back to see that my son had pulled the cord down and had it wrapped around his neck. Terrifying. Although these do pop open easily, they most definitely did not pop open from the pressure of a child's neck which I find to be a SERIOUS design flaw. From a company named Safety 1st - back to the drawing board on these!
B0000482FN This product is useless. After installed, I could still open the oven door with my pinky finger. The directions were also unclear and the picture doesn't match the product.
B0000482FN This device keeps the oven shut despite my toddler hanging off the oven handle (fortunately, phew!).  I tried a different lock prior to this one, which I returned as the lock kept flopping down inside the oven whenever open.  This one does NOT have that problem.  It is easy to install, and works in areas with tight clearance too.
B0000482FN I was kinda exceptional when I saw it and the the adhesive pad idea wasn't  that appealing to me for your oven door, but I gotta tell, it works and it works surprisingly good ..
B0000482FN This item won't attach to a regular stove because the adhesive won't stick to the sides.  Also, it comes unlocked too easily if you can manage to get it to stick to the oven.
B0000482FN It's pretty hard to find a great oven lock.  This one had terrible reviews, but was the kind we needed for our new oven (a side lock).  We've been using it for 9 months, and my toddler (who is now almost 2) seems quite safe.  She's pulled on the handle of the oven a few times (and we've told her \"no\", which she seems to accept most of the time) and the lock has stayed put.  She's tried to operate the lock a few times, and has not been successful at that either.  I can see a toddler who is very interested in the lock being able to figure it out, but she has been easily diverted from it.It's held up great, and I don't find it too cumbersome to lock/unlock it whenever I use the oven (which is pretty often - I cook a lot). I have no complaints.
B0000482FN We love this oven lock. It does what it is supposed to and the adhesive seems to be working extremely well. It was hard to attach at first because there are three pieces and with only two hands it's hard to hold all the pieces where they need to go. It doesn't get too hot to touch when the oven is on, which is great so that I can have it locked while I'm cooking and then unlock it without getting burned to take the food out.
B0000482FN Does what it is supposed to.  Basic and easy too use and little ones can't figure it out.
B0000482FN My 15 month old daughter was able to pull this thing apart with little effort. I would not recommend it.
B0000482FN My husband yanked hard enough on the oven door to pop this off. I don't think a baby or toddler could have managed it, though.
B0000482FN I do not reccomend this product at all! It did not stick well, and my 11 mo old daughter popped it off the first time she pulled on the oven door!
B0000488W1 These locks took some time to install, however when you follow the instructions it goes very smoothly.  The time now was well worth the ease in the future.  Plus, after my daughter has outgrown the need for cabinet locks I can put them in their inactive mode.  This is great because when we have future company we can reactivate them and the home is childproof again.  Just be careful on cheap cabinets because you can drill through the entire door!  Definitely a wonderful investment.
B0000488W1 I LOVE these things! They work great and I love that you can't see them or my child can not get his fingers stuck in anything! They took about 30 minutes to install and they are amazing!
B0000488W1 These locks just cannot be beat.  They were featured on HGTV to baby-proof your house which is how I found out about them in the first place.  They cannot be opened at ALL by the child, unlike many of the other items out there.  You have to not only have the key to open the door, you have to know how to manipulate it to open.  If you have chemicals that you have store within a child's reach, there is no other better way than this lock to make SURE that child is safe.  I feel very blessed that I found out these locks exist because my little one is extremely curious and figures out EVERYTHING! Trust me, you won't be disappointed.  Regarding the installation, my husband is not a handyman - he's a musician and if he can figure it out, so can just about anyone else.  Buy them!
B0000488W1 Love these. Not the easiest to install and they may take a little getting used to, but so worth it! They are really secure and do not interfere with the appearance of your cabinets. Would recommend in a heartbeat!
B0000488W1 The instructions to put the item together are small and hard to understand. It's been sitting on my kitchen counter for about a month, and god knows when I will get to it. Buy this item only if you have the patience to deal with many small parts and instructions that are hard to understand.
B0000488W1 I read the directions twice then installed taking less than 15 minutes and I am pretty clueless with putting things together. One thing that should be changed is it says on the outside that a drill should be used but the directions says not to use a drill. The screws are small so a drill would be pointless. I like that it comes with paper guides so you only screww once and it is where it needs to be the first time instead of trial and error making many holes in cabinet.
B0000488W1 Even though the Tot Lok is a bit pricey, it's well worth the money.My daughter's room has a cabinet that has 2 doors with an open shelf space between them.  We didn't want her to have access to the cabinets, as we store her nicer books in the cabinets.  We tried several different methods of keeping her out of the cabinet doors.  I could spend several minutes rigging up what I thought would be a kid-proof barrier, only to have my daughter get into the cabinets within minutes.I found the Tot Loks one day when we were looking at child proof products, and boy, do I wish we had found them sooner.  These things are great.  After a lengthy install process - my hubby is a do-it-yourself handyman type and it still took awhile to install - our daughter can no longer get into the cabinets.I would highly recommend these to anyone who needs to keep kiddos (or even pets) out of cabinets.  Just don't lose the \"key\" or lock it inside the cabinet!
B0000488W1 We have these locks installed on our cabinets in our home. I've tried other brands without success.. my kids always figure a way to get in. With this system, they can try all they want but they cannot get in. Sometimes the doors require pressing to open, but after I figured it out.. I never have an issue opening the doors. This will be the system of choice in any additional homes we buy later on... I don't think I'd ever want to change after having such a positive experience. I would definitely recommend this to a friend or family member, without hesitation!
B0000488W1 The locks are great. The only tricky part was installing them b/c if you don't drill far enough, the magents won't line up when you use the key on the other side and it won't work. I also could not flip the red bar to disengage it. I would recommend these b/c they work and with the key...they're almost even adult proof.
B0000488W1 As with everything about being a parent, locks are more complicated than you'd have thought (or would like!):SCREW-MOUNTED MAGNETIC LOCKS:  The Safety 1st Tot-Lok Locks can be difficult to install, especially on drawers, but have more flexibility about where you can install the lock than the adhesive locks and seem very secure.  Still, most people may want to try the adhesive locks (see below) first, to make it easier to get some child proofing done quickly.Pros:+ Very nice & secure once installed, especially since the fit can be adjusted to give a tight lock when closed.+ Works vertically or horizontally ... that is, on the side of a door or the top.+ Can easily be switched to hold the lock open, for when no children are aroundCons:- Complicated to install, especially in some situations.  So you might not get around to installing them, given all the other demands on your time.- Requires drilling a hole partway through the cabinet door from the inside for the magnetic part, plus some small holes to attach- May require some new tools - a collar lock, to keep from drilling through the door; and a right angle chuck for tight spacesIf you plan to be in your home for a while, and want a finished, secure set of locks, the Tot Loks may be a good choice.One note, if you use them often the magnetic key will wear the finish where it rubs.ADHESIVE MOUNT MAGNETIC LOCKS: The KidCo Adhesive Mount Magnet Locks will only work in some spots, but it's still a good lock to try first, for a lot of people, because it works well (in the right situations) and is easy to install.  Buy some and see how they work on your cabinets.  Once you've tried a few, it's a lot easier to see where'll they'll work or won't work.Pros:+ Quick to install, after a few minutes of figuring it out+ No drilling required, so less work and no damage to furniture or cabinetsCons:- Only installs horizontally (along the top edge of a door or drawer), given the way they use gravity to lock.We just use the adhesive mount, no additional screws, for some furniture we didn't want to drill holes into.  They seem to be strong enough so far, especially since our kids seem to give up trying a door after a while - if it won't open, they lose interest.  I don't know how the adhesive would stand up to long term use or really heavy pulling.HOOK LOCKS:  The advantage that either of the magnetic locks has over the old fashioned hook type (like theMommy's Helper Safe-Lok Cabinet Door and Drawer Lock) is that the hooks have a lot more play (they have to open a little bit to give you access to the lock). So a child can bang them back and forth - they might not open the door or drawer, but they will make a racket.  Maybe OK in some situations, but not a great solution for easily accessible drawers or doors.SLIDE LOCKS:  Slide locks (such as theAmerican Red Cross Cabinet Safety Slide Lock) are very quick and easy to install, if they fit.  But they can also be pretty easy for some kids to unlock, so if they are within reach they aren't much of a barrier to older kids.  And even younger kids can sometimes open them by pulling or pushing on the doors.  However, they are a good temporary solution and can be useful to carry when you travel.FLEX LOCKS:  Flex locks (like the Safety First Cabinet Flex-Lock (see reviews) orCabinet Flex-Lock 2-Pack) are strong and easy to install, and you can see by looking at them whether the lock is secure (unlike the magnetic locks, which are designed to be out of sight).  So you might want to use them for critical spots such as under the sink; or use them when you travel.  And as a bonus, they are so secure that even some adults can't open them! ;-)  (They do take two hands to open.)  Not attractive, but they do the job if you keep them tightened.
B0000488W1 We used other types of latches, such as the ones that you push down and the ones that you squeeze and pull apart. Not toddler proof! We bought these magnet latches to put on our drawers in the kitchen and what a dream!! Another reviewer suggested two keys. Definitely. We only have one and are going to purchase another. Small price to pay for security. The thing I like about these is that if your little one is out of the house for the day, or they outgrow them, meaning they are old enough to be safe around knives and such, you can fix them where they don't require the key!  One drawback: If you have a double-wide or single-wide mobile home, you will have to do some modifications to your drawers to get them to work. My husband spent an entire evening working on three drawers due to the modifications needing to be made for them to work correctly for our drawers. After it was all done, it works perfectly. Also, a small price to pay for the security of my little angel. Do yourself a favor and invest a little money and get these latches!!!!
B0000488W2 This product is great.  It's not super easy to install (each lock requires 6 screws plus one hole in the door).  If you take your time, ready the instructions, plan it out, and execute; it works great.  You have to be patient.  Each door took me 5 to 10 minutes.  In less than 1 hour I was able to unpack, read instructions, plan, get my tools, and have it done in 4 doors.  I think it won't work with hollow doors or maybe doors that are too thick but mine were pretty standard.I love how it's hidden and pretty sturdy due to having a bunch of screws holding it.  The adhesive ones are easy to install but I bet my son would open them in no time.
B0000488W2 I feel bad that some people have had such a poor experience with this lock.  We on the other hand love these locks.  We bought our first set 7 years ago to use with our first child.  One set of Grandparents use them and an aunt too.  I am just about to get a second set because we have a new crawler and I want to put them on the bathroom cabinets.  They are a bit expensive but you will never need to buy locks again.  We prefer to leave our on at all times (even when our children don't need the cabinets locked anymore) because they are easy to turn off (just a flip of the red tab inside the cabinet) that way they are there whenever you have little ones visiting your home.  We have never split a cabinet and we don't think it takes that much longer to install then any other cabinet locks.  You will have to drill in you cupboard doors but your little one(s) will be protected.  It leaves no room for fingers to get pinched either.  If you do happen to lose your lock you can buy a strong magnet from your home improvement store and still get it open.  We like to keep our lock on the metal frame by the kitchen window above the sink.  Good luck whatever you decide.
B0000488W2 After many years of fighting traditional cheap plastic child safety locks (we have a cat that likes to get into things too) and seeing our son still manage to pinch his fingers in doors (better than getting at chemicals or whatever, but still!), our pediatrician recommended these to us.  They were easy to install, and he can't get the doors open at all, so no pinched fingers or getting at something he shouldn't.  They also have a mechanism to keep the lock in the open position, like if you need to get in a cabinet a lot, or the kids are older and you don't need them anymore.  I would however recommend keeping an extra key around in case one gets lost, or locked in a cabinet by accident.
B0000488W2 This is simply a great product.  It is installed inside the cabinet so there is nothing to see from the front.  The newer models work even easier than the original ones we purchased years ago.  They open easily when the magnet is put near (don't even need to touch the cabinet door).  We use these in several places over the house and love the convenience, but piece of mind it gives.  They are also pretty strong - our 3 1/2 year old pulls and tries to open sometimes and has not broken or pulled open any drawer.NOTE - The old version needed a drill to make a small hole on the lock which sits inside the door, but the newer ones like this no longer require that hole to be made. These work better and are easier to install - just need a screwdriver and a few minutes.
B0000488W2 When they work, they are awesome. When they don't work, it really stinks. There was no rhyme or reason to it. We attached them in several locations and half the time the product worked perfectly and I am very satisfied but for no clear reason in some cases they would not work (or would only work on one of two cabinet doors on the same item!) So kind of unreliable.
B0000488W2 These locks are fantastic, but wow, what a pain to install.  The directions are all but useless, so it was kind of trial and error.  My husband had to drill and redrill a couple of times to get the lock in the right place so that it would work.I would recommend these locks only for cabinets/drawers where there are dangerous/harmful goods inside.  It's worth it for those.
B0000488W2 This was a product that I used when I worked in child care and I always liked the fact that it is &#34;invisible&#34; and is not an obvious eye-sore on your cabinets. But when I tried to install on my sink cabinet, one side worked like a charm and the other side just won't work. I can find no discernible reason for this and it is very frustrating. The two parts line up fine, but they won't latch. And the two cabinet sides were installed what seems like identically to me, but apparently not. In my opinion, it shouldn't be this difficult to make accurate measurements to ensure that the product will work. It might just be my cabinets, but they are not anything crazy or out of the ordinary. I am frustrated that I will have to drill more holes into my cabinet and there is no guarantee that it will work!
B0000488W2 This product is a great concept, BUT it has a critical flaw for me.  The whole idea that I need to drill a big hole inside each cabinet door or drawer is a non starter.  I mean, why would you spend money on a nice kitchen only to drill holes inside doors and drawers?  Hello?  Baby will grow up eventually so the locks are not needed.  What about those holes?  It is cute that the manual says \"do not drill through the door,\" hugh?  Why would I want to even have a drill near my cabinet doors?  Also, what happens if say the door cracks while I drill?  Who pays for that?  I know the answer to that one -> ME!  Soooo....product is going back.  Non-starter
B0000488W2 We installed these to keep the kids out of the knife drawers.  They worked well at first but had a learning curve.  Visitors to the house found it impossible to work, because we had to have the magnet positioned just so.  That is actually a good safety feature, because the kids know the magnet opens the drawers and would attempt to open the drawers when they get their hands on the magnet.As far as keeping the kids out, it worked well.  I'd say it's been in our drawer for about six years.  We no longer use it and it hasn't worked well for about a year or so.  The magnet no longer unlatches the lock and we can't get into the drawer.This is a good lock, but require the willingness to drill into the woodwork of your cabinets.  It takes work for people to learn.  I think it should have lasted longer than five years, but maybe that's all most people need.  4 stars for the fact that it does what it's designed to do but not 5 stars, because it has issues.
B0000488W2 This sounded good in theory, but didn't work at all.  They were correctly installed by my husband, but the magnet is just not strong enough to get it to open.  It was a waste of money for our cabinets.  It may work if you have the thinner particle board cabinets, but it definitely didn't work through our solid wood cabinets.
B0000488W2 I am opening a home daycare and these are some of the only locks that are approved by the state of Washington. I really like the fact that they can be unlocked for long periods of time, so when I am working in the kitchen I can leave them unlocked and then quickly lock them again. They are really not hard to install, I watched a video on You Tube that showed how to install them and then went and did it.I am going to recommend these to people I know. I really think they would be great for grandparents or anyone who has young kids visiting often because you can turn them off when the kids are not there, most other child locks do not have that feature.
B0000488W2 Love these, my son can not open anything now. Everything is totally safe in our home now because of these
B00004C8S8 I am sure we will use these in the future, but I wanted to post saying that our doctor recommended an emery board to avoid the risk of cutting the skin of a newborn because their nails are so close to it. Just wanted to let new moms know what I have learned.
B00004C8S8 I really love this set of clippers. After trying many different brands and styles - this is the one that we love. The blades are dull enough that they do not clip skin but sharp enough to cut sharp little nails. My baby's grow quickly so these clippers are used often. I like that the grip it small enough to fit in my hand easily but not too big to make me clumsy.I love the grip, that it moves with me and keeps me stable so that I only clip nails. It will not work for big people nails, which is nice - it means I can always find it when I need!I highly recommend these clippers to caregivers of infants and toddlers. Hands down my favorite clippers - perfect on the pocketbook too!
B00004C8S8 On the first use of this item a sliver of metal fell off.  If I was not in a well lit room and paying close attention, my 7 week old could have gotten seriously hurt.  To add salt to the wound,  I tried to return the item and I got two separate emails from the seller.  The first email asked me to describe the defect.  I responded to the email. After which, I received a second email asking me to send a picture of the item; SERIOUSLY!  1. Do you think I am storing the sliver of metal to take a picture of it?  2.  If I described the defect as a sliver of metal, the product would look the same as in the original picture of the item, as a sliver denotes a very small piece, so the seller already has a picture of what the product looks like.  3.  If the seller needed a picture, this should have been requested in the first email, not in a second email.  I shop online because I have limited time.  I do not have time to respond to an email trail for a $3 nail clip.  However, I am so irritated with the product and the seller's response that I decided to write this review.  In addition, my request to return the item was closed before the return approval process was completed!
B00004C8S8 Ordered before baby was born. Now started to cut the nails already. Nice clippers, easy to hold in the hand.
B00004C8S8 No brainer, makes it easy to cut my children's nails.Doesn't get lost easily. Easy to clean. Great grip .
B00004C8S8 These aren't bad. A little awkward to use the clipper lever - it is very small even for my small hands and tends to slip. But I'm guessing this is just the case with all baby clippers. It's fairly easy to see what you're about to clip and you don't need to press very hard to cut the nail. My handle was green, unlike the white in the photo.
B00004C8S8 Easy to hold and easy to use, we love it and it helps stop our son from scratching his face up at night.
B00004C8S8 I have used these clippers just once, they did a good job. I dont love them( not really comfortable to use) but they get the job done.
B00004C8S8 Very nice it's was exactly what I expected. I will defiantly recommend it. I will be buying more in the future.
B00004C8S8 The extra add-on is awesome for long-fingered parents! My whole family have ten mile long limbs, which includes incredibly long fingers so having that extra knobby thing attached to the nail clippers to hold onto makes it much less scary to bring a sharp object to your babies fingers.I suggest you ALWAYS cut their nails when they're sleeping, though. Haha
B00004C8S8 So the baby nail clippers are TINY! and hard to hold, but this is great, it fits into the palm of my hand and I get my newborn son's nails clipped much easier. If I could, I would change the material on the grip to a rubbery texture so it wouldn't slide around in my hand at all. My hands are always very dry and it slides around a bit, but nothing like how those tiny ones fall out of my hand. I would recommend this product.
B00004C8S8 I received a different nail clipper as a baby shower gift. It had a plastic cover over the top of the cutting end of the clipper, similar to this one, but with a plain white handle instead of the cute bumble bee:Sassy: Bumble Bee Nail Clippers. It was terrible. I couldn't see my baby's finger nails at all and it wasn't sharp enough.Then I used this Safety 1st Nail Clipper at my mother's house. It was so much easier to use than the other one. The size is perfect for her little fingers. I could easily see my baby's nails and clip them without fear of cutting her. The handle fits nicely in my hand. And the blade is sharp enough to cut the nail off in one clip. I bought one for myself and it's the only one I'll use now.
B00004C8S8 I know they make these with a huge bulb on them now, but I still use the pairs of these I had from 10.5 years ago when my son was born.  I clip my 10 and 4 year olds' nails with these and they are steady and perfect and still clip fine.  Just bought a pair for a new mom-to-be friend, and have gifted them in the past.  These are all you need! And maybe some reading glasses and good light!
B00004C8S8 I'm FTM and just used on my 5 days old baby-works perfectly. Not bulky, sharp and great quality. Highly recommended.
B00004C8S8 These are comfortable to hold and make it easy to cut my baby's nails without cutting them too short or struggling to hold onto the tiny clippers.
B00004C8S8 We had the Summer Infant clippers first.  They came in a two-pack, with a smaller clipper and a larger clipper.  Neither one worked well.  The larger of the two didn't work at all.  These Safety First clippers cut every time.  For those of you who know how difficult it can be to clip a baby's nails, you also know how frustrating it can be to finally get the clipper positioned right and then have it not cut.  AAAAARRRRGGGHHHH!These work every time.
B00004C8S8 I bought this pair of clippers because of the rave reviews on Amazon.com.  However, I'm disappointed with them.  I have a hard time grasping them and keeping them in place in my hand.  By the time they're in a firm, steady grip, my baby has wiggled away, and I have to start over.
B00004C8S8 Honestly, I don't just use these for babies.  In fact, it's the nail clipper of choice in the house for all 9 of my kids.  They won't touch the metal ones, but these work really easy even for them to clip their own nails.  The only thing I would add to them is some type of metal file to clean under the nails... but you can't beat the ease of clipping with these things!
B00004C8S8 Safety 1st makes several nail clippers for babies, including model 49523 (Safety 1st Hospital's Choice Steady Grip Nail Clippers); model 49539 (Safety 1st Complete Nail Care Set) which includes what seems to be clippers similar to model 49523 but with a holder at the back for emery boards; and model 10435 (this one). All three of these nail trimmers are in the \"Hospital's Choice\" series.Overall, I prefer the 49523/49539 model (see Customer Images) because it is more comfortable to hold for the following reasons.  First, instead of a small white plastic bulb, the 49523/49539 has a larger white-and-orange or white-and-blue handle that allows you to hold the clippers like a \"gun\" with your index finger under the blades and your thumb on the lever.  Second, the orange or blue part of the 49523/49539 handle is soft and less slippery than the white plastic of this model.  Third, the lever has the same soft orange or blue non-skid rubbery material at the end, thus providing a cushion for your thumb.In terms of cutting nails, the very good performance of this model and the 49523/49539 are the same. (They both leave the nail edges a little sharp, so some filing is necessary.) So I recommend purchasing the 49523/49539 instead.
B00004C8S8 Clipping baby nails is one of the most stressful things. This nail clipper is small, but handles very well and the thicker handles make it an easier process. Well-made... we have been using ours for over 2 years without problems.
B00004C8S8 This is baby nail clipper #4 that we've tried, and our search is finally over.  It's sharp enough to cut nails on the first try and the white bulb is pretty comfortable to hold.  What more do you need in a pair of baby nail clippers?The losers:- Safety 1st model 49539 (has the holder for emery boards) - the grip is comfortable but the clippers are blunt and therefore useless.  The emery board is useful.- Dubon baby nail clipper (the kind that you wear on your finger like a ring) - has the safety guard so you don't catch the baby's skin in the clippers, but that makes it almost impossible to clip the actual nail.  Plus, it's not sharp and therefore worthless.- Nuby infant nail clipper - not bad in terms of sharpness, but something about the way it's designed makes it really difficult to get at the baby's nails.Search ends here, thank goodness!
B00004C8S8 These nail clippers are dangerous and I threw them out a long time ago.  I tried to trim my 3 month old son's nails, granted he is the fidgeting type.  Just as I was about to clip one of his nails, he jerked his hand and I accidentally cut off the tip of his finger.  His finger bled, my son cried and I panicked.  Thankfully it was a shallow wound which healed quickly and did not do any serious damage.  But if I knew how dangerous these clippers were I would never have used them in the first place.Instead I use baby nail scissors by same company.  They are VERY safe.  I have used them for over a year and have never had any accidents.  I shudder to think of using nail clippers again, especially now that I have to chase my son around the room to cut his nails.
B00004C8S9 I know that every doctor says an oral temperature doesn't count, you have to take a rectal one.  But seriously, I hate taking my sons rectal temperature.  It is gross, he is squirming around.  Yuck.  This is so much easier. You pop it in their mouth, couple of seconds later, you have your temperature.  I have found it to be really accurate, unlike the ear one, which reads completely different on each ear.  Plus it is so small I bought a second one for our diaper bag.  Super convenient!
B00004C8S9 It is always difficult getting a reading from a thermometer for a sick infant. With this product, given that the infant would be used to a pacifer, works wonders. For all of my friends expecting a little one, this is a must.
B00004C8S9 this thermometer is pretty consistent, but the nipple is too large for young babies. after my 2 month old gagged on this twice he started refusing his other pacifiers!
B00004C8S9 When I bought this item, I thought this was a really clever way to take a baby's temperature.  I use this thermometer only on occasion.  It's convenient, but it requires about 3 minutes before a final temperature is reached.  It requires that your baby keep it in his mouth for that long.  It's getting harder for my baby to accept this \"pacifier\", now that she is on the larger, 6-month-plus sized pacifiers.  Also, check with your doctor about how to take accurate readings: our pediatrician said that a rectal thermometer was the most accurate for the early weeks of her life.
B00004C8S9 i bought this pacifier when my son was 3 months old, wiggly and had his first temp. i was having a hard time getting frequent readings with the under-arm thermometer and i decided to give this a shot. it's a great concept. when my son was sick i replaced his regular pacifier with this one, and simply pressed the button when i (nervous first time mom that i am) needed reassurance. it helped sooth my nerves.it wasn't, however, very accurate. when he first put it in his mouth, i would get different readings back-to-back. i found it worked better if the baby used it as a pacifier for awhile before i took his temp, i would get more consistant readings during naptime, and i double checked it with the under-arm when i needed an accurate temp.unfortunately my dog decided it made a good chew toy, so i'm on here today to buy another one. i think i am going to try another brand to see if i can find one with better accuracyhope i helped!**update**i ended up getting the temporal scanner instead, and have found it very accurate and time efficient. a much better solution for the money http://www.amazon.com/Exergen-Temporal-Scanner-Infrared-Thermometer/dp/B0015TIZGQ/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid;=1299867344&sr;=8-2
B00004C8S9 The nipple on this thing is HUGE and pretty hard so I don't think it would work for most babies because it would gag them and they probably just wouldn't like it. I've tried this in my mouth, it isn't comfortable like regular pacifiers at all and it took so long to reach a temperature I took it out of my mouth before it was done, this was over 2 minutes so I don't even know if this thing is accurate at all.My girls were preemies and this was WAY too big for them. I've tried to use this thing many different times and my girls always spit it right out, even if I tried to hold it there they would push it out with their tongue, they HATE it. My girls are currently 14 months old and love their Binky pacifiers but I've tried to get them to use this to take their temps several times and they make a face & push it right out.My girls HATE & have always hated having their temperature taken under the arm pit but they do not mind it taken rectally, it IS very easy and the most accurate. I use an Exergen Temperal for when they are sleeping because it is accurate enough to let me know if they have a temp and if it is a high temp. If it shows they have a higher temp then I get them up and take their temp rectally to make sure I get the most accurate temperature. I recommend the Vicks Rectal Thermometer for that.I think companies make products like the pacifier thermometer because as new parents it sounds like a good idea but in reality, they just don't work and I'm sure your Dr will tell you the same thing.
B00004C8S9 My baby is two years old now and he loves his pacifiers. I bought this when I was pregnant because I thought it would be a brilliant way to measure a babys temperature but I was wrong... As a new mom I was wrong about a number of things... this was one of them. No baby is going to keep a pacifier in his mouth long enough to actually get the temperature measured if it is not his (her) pacifier that he (she) loves and always uses. Any baby will identify this as a strange object and spit it out immediately, its too heavy. Especially if the baby is not feeling well. Don't buy this. Get a real thermometer.
B00004D3ES I never wanted a tub because I was not impressed with anything I found but my sister got me this as a shower gift. I just don't think baby is comfortable in it. His leg was all scrunched up, his head fell to one side (unpadded, by the way), and it was hard to fit it over my bathroom sink because it's a small round thing. Anyway, before I had the baby, I bought my husband a bath head cushion (the kind you blow up) from Target which he never used (too girly I guess). Turns out it is the perfect cushion (it has suction cups) to attach inside our sink and put baby in for baths. It has grooves so baby's head doesn't flop everywhere. I bath baby in no time and I have the water running because he loves the feel of water streaming down onto his body. The cushion also allows me to flip baby over so I can wash his back. He just lies on the soft terry cloth. It's perfect.
B00004D3ES My Grandmother got this tub for my 3 month old son to use while visiting. It isn't as spacious as the tub we use at home, which is a little smaller than most tubs, but it folds up nicely, and it feels very safe and sturdy-not flimsy at all. I use both tubs in the big bathtub, so leaking isn't a problem for me. My son seems comfortable, but he prefers to have more water to splash in than this one holds. This tub is great for grandma's house, or if space is tight.
B00004D3ES I am sorry I bought this tub.  It is very uncomfortable for my daughter.  Used it since she was about 3 weeks old.  I have to place a towel behind her head b/c the hard plastic is at such a sharp angle it's uncomfortable.  Also, there is a part where she got her foot stuck and she screamed with pain!  It's way too small.  She's now 4.5 mos and I'm throwing it away b/c she is practically flipping out of it.  And the plug is waaaaay too hard to plug -  it's an enormous effort to plug it each time.I've switched to the First Years infant to toddler tub and it is way bigger, nicer, more comfortable, and it has no areas to pinch fingers or toes.
B00004D3ES This tub has proven very handy.  My son got his first bath in it at only 3 days old.  I admit, that was a little tricky.  However, in no time we had it down and I was able to bathe him easily anywhere.  Usually we take the bath on his bedroom floor.  I like the portability and the fact that it can fold up and fit under the bathroom counter, since his bathroom is also the guest bathroom.  I also like the little section in the front.  That's where I put the soapy water.  It's easy to rinse him off with a little watering can.  The tub has been great, but now that my son is 17 lbs. it's getting small.  I will be looking for another bath aid soon, but I'll miss this handy tub.
B00004D3ES This is OK for the short time that I am actually going to use it because it does get the job done.  However:-it does not hold a lot of water, so the water gets cool fast-the cusion is not that soft so I still have to put my hand under my babies headThe good news is:-it folds for easy storage-it has a little area for you to put the bathing items that you use such as some soap, wash cloth, or toys
B00004D3ES I bought this tub before my son was born, thinking it looked great and I could use it in the kitchen sink.  I do like that I can use it in the sink, but he's not a super long baby and his little feet always get stuck in the grooves where the tub folds!  It doesn't hold much water, either.  I wish I had read reviews before I bought it, because now, after only 2 months, I'm just going to replace it and throw it away.  What a waste!
B00004D3ES I like this tub, it fits in my sink well, it folds up nicely. My daughter is 4 months old and still fits in it.
B00004D3ES We first saw this fold-up infant tub in the NICU unit where our baby stayed for her first 4 weeks.  Its ability to be easily stored was a big plus in the hospital, as well as at home.  The NICU nurse recommended that we line any infant tub with one of those baby bath sponges (ours is yellow and in the shape of a bear).  We use our tub in the kitchen sink.  Leaks, pinches and mildew have never been a problem.  Oddly enough, we have found that our baby likes to sit in the tub backwards (once she could hold up her head).  This positon is more upright and also makes it easier to wash her hair.  We use the kitchen sprayer on low and place a washcloth over our baby's torso which we frequently re-wet with warm water to keep her from getting cold.  Our baby is still a bit small for 4 months, but we anticipate that this tub will work for several more months.  Our baby loves bath time!- Our baby is now 8 months old and about 16 pounds.  We have used this infant tub up until this point and are just now graduating to the big tub.  This fold-up tub was a great purchase for us!
B00004D3ES I chose this tub because it folds up. However, since we use it every night, I haven't folded it up since Week 1. I do like the tub but find it cumbersome to use. It does leak through one of the fold-up hinge/gaps if there's too much water in the tub. Also, Baby is now nearly 8 weeks old, and already, her feet spill over the end of the seat area. She's very nearly too big for it and measured 22\" at her 6-wk checkup. I can't see her fitting in the tub much longer. Her feet do get stuck in the gaps between the seat and the side of the tub. More importantly, for some reason, there are hard plastic corners along either side of the pad where her head is. She's knocked her head on them several times, and any other time, we spend the whole bath on guard, hoping she doesn't knock it. I'm also bothered when draining the tub. The plug has a little rim around it that sits up. I'm sure this helps prevent leaks, but it also prevents all water from adequately draining out. I have to turn the tub completely upside-down to ensure that all water has drained. The more I think about it, the more I think I'd like to try a different tub. I'd recommend this tub only to those who are seriously crunched for space or who travel often and need a fold-up tub.
B00004D3ES I bought another tub initially - a friend told me about this one.  I will stick with this until my daughter outgrows it.  A must have.
B00004D3ES I have been using this tub since my sons very first bath. At first he hated to take a bath and now he loves it. I love the fact that it folds up very easily and will fit into a closet when folded. I have never had a problem with it growing mold or smelling musty. After the bath I wipe it dry with a towel fold it up and put it in the closet. I also have a newborn to toddler tub, which is very large and I have nowhere to store it.I have never had a problem with it leaking. As long as you don't overfill it, it works just fine. I find this tub to be better than the more expensive ones. The only problem I have is that my six month old son is too big for this tub, but at $12.99, is that really such a big deal? I feel I got my moneys worth out of it. If you are looking for a tub that is safe and easy to store I recommend this one.
B00004D3ES MY HUSBAND AND I LIKED THIS TUB BECAUSE WE COULD FOLD IT UP AND PUT IT AWAY IN THE LINEN CLOSET.  IT DOES TEND TO LEAK AT THE HINGES THOUGH CAUSING THE WATER TO GET COOL VERY QUICK.  WE USED TO KEEP THE WATER RUNNING INTO THE TUB THE ENTIRE TIME WE WERE BATHING OUR SON AND THIS WORKED OUT GREAT.  THE WATER WAS ALWAYS THE RIGHT TEMPERATURE AND OUR SON LOVED THE SPLASHING FROM THE FAUCET.  I RECOMMEND THIS TO ANYONE WITH LIMITED SPACE FOR AN INFANT TUB.
B00004D3ES This tub is incredible for a newborn. It's non-skid surface really helps hold baby in place, and it's size makes it very easy to bathe your baby. It folds up nicely & we stored it under the bathroom sink. However, after a couple of months, we moved our daughter into a bigger tub so that she could kick her feet & move around more. I will definitely use this tub again for our next newborn!
B00004D3ES If you are really, really, REALLY hard pressed for space, then maybe this tub is for you... except that you'll only use it for 3 months  because it is so small and then it will sit in storage wasting that valuable space.  As with most tubs, this holds maybe a quart of water, which means, only babies bum is wet, how fun is that.  And as soon as baby can sit, that is if she hasn't outgrown this small tub by then, she will not want to lay down at the angle this tub puts her at.  Save space by getting a little bigger tub that will spend more time holding your splashing baby than sitting under your sink: I have the Newborn to Toddler Tub by The First Years--my baby is a year old and I still use it (she is petite, but I'm sure anyone can get at least 6-9 months out of it.)
B00004D3ES I used this tub after borrowing from a friend because our Four Stage Bath System was so bad it was cutting up my baby's legs.  This was okay - soft all over, no problems like we had with the four stage, however because it folds the hinges tend to leak.  Also, you can't fill it to the level you would want because of the way its reclined.  The back is still very slippery despite the nonslip matt.  We only used for a few weeks before just bringing her in the tub with Mom and washing her that way.
B00004D3ES We have limited storage so this works great & fits in the sink perfectly.  Never have a problem with leaking either.
B00004D3ES My mom got this tub for my daughter right after she was born.  We have used it since she was able to take a bath, and she's 4 months old.  I liked that it could be folded, but I never actually put it away unless we have company since I use it daily.  It does leak at the hinges.  My daughter is very comfortable in it.  Since she was born in the winter, I gave her a bath in the bathroom so that I could get it really warm.  It does fit in the kitchen sink though.  I still give her her bath in the bathroom, and just sit her tub in the big tub.  It uses less water, her head is elevated, and she's a little higher.  She hasn't outgrown it yet, and has plenty of room. It is a great tub, and a great price!
B00004D3ES I used this tub with my son and boy do I miss it! We have the newborn-to-toddler tub with daughter and it's bulky, takes up tons of room and is no different than this one other than it doesn't fold up. I would much rather have the fold-up than the one we have now. They both work and get the job done but for space reasons being able to fold it and put out of the way is much nicer IMO...
B00004D3ES I got this as a shower gift. The first time I used the tub my baby kept slipping around in the tub. She wound up sideways in it during the entire bath and I never used it again. I would just as soon put her into the bathtub and put a couple of inches of water into the tub and bathe my baby that way rather than put her into this contraption. I am a RN and quite used to giving baths in different settings so it is not inexperience talking here. I currently put her on the safer bather (read my review) or put her in the tub alone. Baby loves bathtime and is 6 months old.Lets just say that this tub is downstairs with the rest of the lawnsale stuff for this year.....
B00004D3ES I used this tub with my 1st son almost 4 years ago and now I bought a new one for my 2nd son born this year.  Living in an apartment, this tub is great for small spaces.  I use it in the big tub and when I am done, I just rinse it and leave it to dry.  When dried, I fold it and put it in the cabinet.  The only reason I am giving it 4 stars is because I had to buy a sponge to use on top of this in order to keep my son from slipping.  But considering it folds for storage, that was not a big issue.  It's a great tub otherwise.
B00004D3EU I bought this tub without doing any research on it. I bought it because I liked the idea of it growing with my baby. Well, I got it together all right but it is WAY too big for the bathroom and/or kitchen sink so I had to put it in the big tub from the very beginning. Also, I have yet to get it to shrink, so I have this huge tub in the bathroom all the time. The sling seemed to work all right when my son was smaller, but now he is 4 months and he loves to kick. However, that causes him to slide down the sling and it's quite hard where the sling ends, so he ends up with this red mark on his lower back. Also, it just doesn't seem to hold water. I have read the directions and everything but the water just leaks out. All in all, I will give this tub another chance once my son gets older and can sit up but if it still leaks, I am getting another one.
B00004D3EU I had ordered a different tub for my shower but never received it.  I had my baby so I picked up this tub last week.  However I could not figure out how to use the sling alone for my 1 week old infant.  It appears that you have to hold her head up while in the sling which leaves you with only 1 hand to bathe her with.  But anyone with an infant knows that they kick and squirm and I found it very hard to use.  I tried to snap it into the tub for the 2nd stage (thinking better support) and I could not get it to fit!Much easier to sponge bathe a new baby on a contoured changing pad.  I'm thinking of returning and going for the EuroTub.
B00004D3EU I'm shocked by all of the other reviews on this particular product.  Many complain that it's too small for their sink...hello!!!  It wasn't made for a SINK.  Anyway,...I love this tub.  I wouldn't want any other one.  It was the most convenient when my son needed to be on the sling =perfect=, and now that he's sitting up,... it's even more convenient.  Please ignore the negative reviews and I highly consider buying this product.  It may be the only tub you will buy in you child' early stages.
B00004D3EU I haven't had problems with this tub.... I used another tub for my son for the first 3 months, and that tub became too small, so I purchased this one.  I'm so glad I did.At 3 months, my son was large for his age, but unable to sit up yet, so this tub was perfect.I've given it 4 stars instead of 5 because I agree with the other comments that it is not easily collapsible to store, and it is bulky, but we simply let it dry in the bathroom overnight and store it under his crib during the day - so space turned out to not be so much of a problem.I have had no issues with the tub leaking though.  Once it is completely extended, there is a good seal and it does not leak.I have and will continue to recommend this tub to all my friends.It's accomodating for longer than any tub out there.well worth the money.
B00004D3EU I looked everywhere for a tub without all the grooves for baby's body - I wanted something that would submerge nicely from the neck down and this looked like it would do the trick. Unfortunately, it doesn't hold any water to submerge anything than perhaps the feet. Leaks horribly, bulky - we gave up, returned it, and now we just bath with baby. Nothing works better than you own hands on your slippery baby anyway, and you can avoid sore knees from bathroom tile and stiff back from bending over the tub.
B00004D3EU We've only used this tub a handful of times because our son is only 3 weeks old. I have not had any problems with the tub leaking. But like I said, we've only used it a handful of times. I definately don't think this tub is appropriate for small babies. The tub has absolutely no support for his head OR his body. It takes my husband AND I to bathe him b/c the tub offers no help. It would be just as easy to put him in our full size bath tub. I wouldn't recommend this tub for small babies.
B00004D3EU I hate this tub!!! It leaks everywhere. I do not recommend buying this item
B00004D3EU We love this tub.  We have been using it since our daughter's first bath.  It was tough to pop the tub into the expanded version, but that tight fit means it won't leak.  If you don't pop it together right it will leak.  We leave it set up in the tub when not in use so it's not really taking up any vital space.  Our daughter seems to like the sling.  She's four months old now and didn't cry even during her first bath.3/06 - We're now using this tub on child #2.  Still no problems.  This child likes it too.  Between the two girls we've been using this tub for 22 mo.  It has never leaked, not once.
B00004D3EU Being the excited new mom I opened this to get a feel for it and see how it would fit in our home and almost cut my finger sliding it open! I was shocked and then thought if I have not even used it and it does this I do not want! Plus if it did this to me then what about when I am washing my child. And I read all the instructions before attempting to play with it so I could do it correctly. Right back in the box and I drove back to the store the same day....got another brand....
B00004D3EU I wrote a review a few months ago but I have to edit it. I followed all the directions, I was very careful and patient with this tub, I washed it and dried it after each use and still I find things growing in the crevices and between the top and bottom. The design idea was good but it just isn't practical for a baby tub that will need to be used regularly. The sling slips out of place all the time and the bath ring isn't worth the extra work it takes to clean it and the little ridges that hold it into the tub. No matter how hard I work it's impossible to keep this tub clean.
B00004D3EU This was terrible. It leaked all over the place. Finally my husband put silicone all around it which helped. Save your money & buy the cheap $10 one that's one piece.
B00004D3EU I registered for this tub because I thought it is very cool and so multi-functional.After the baby was born and passed his stage of dry bath, I found this tub is not very easy to use.  My husband and I coudln't solve the leaking issue.  It also difficult for me to expand or close the tub.The sling is not very good, either.I tried to use this tub for 3 times and returned it.  I got Sure Comfort Deluxe instead.  I think Sure Comfort Deluxe is a much better choice for new born.  It is very easy to put over my sink.  The green net comes with the tub is easy to use.
B00004D3EU Unfortunately, I am not able to find this bathtub anywhere (( My son used to have it 6-7 years ago). It is great! It is the only one bathtub where a baby does not slip forward and doesn't go under water. This blue gear is awesome. I do not understand why it is discontinued. I do not care if it is leaking. I did not notice that because it was used in adult bathtub. IF SOMEBODY HAS IT, PLEASE, I WILL BUY FROM YOU.
B00004D3EU It's been 5 months aleady and we've had no troubles at all.  It leaked the first time we used it because I didn't snap the locks into place all the way. My boys are quite big for their age, and they love to kick their legs and splash around. There is plenty of room for that.  In the beginning I put the tub on my bathroom counter, but when they started splashing water all over the place, I put this tub in our regular bath. I don't use the sling anymore, but it wasn't a problem when we did.
B00004D3EU I've used this tub since my baby was born 6 months ago. There are far more things I dislike about it than like.I liked the sling. I used it alone in the kitchen sink.I disliked the sling in the tub. I felt it did not fasten securely to the tub and there wasn't enough cushioning for his head and bottom. My son now sits up on his own but I feel he can slip too easily in this tub.
B00004D3EU I registered for this bath tub and recieved it as a shower gift. Everything on the tub works well. My son does slide down the sling and I do have to put him back. But I don't think it's possible for that not to happen because he's so actively moving the whole time. I've never had a problem with it leaking. The suction cups do get stuck on very hard and I really have to pull to get it up so much that I pulled one suction cup off last time(It went back on very easily). But theres a reason they stick so much to keep my son safe. So I am glad to have this tub and would recommend it over all the others.
B00004D3EU 70% of the time, the tub doesn't leak. The 30% that it does leak, however, is a fiasco. Here's how it happens: Once the tub is full expanded and the clips under the side are \"clicked\" into place (and yes, we did read the instructions) we fill the tub. Once we finish bathing her, we slide the entire unit forward just enough so that the drain hangs over the edge of the sink and let the water drain. It is at this point that by moving the tub, the suction cups stick to the counter and while moving the tub, it unhooks the clips and out come the waterworks....all over the hardwood floors. And let me tell you, it isn't easy to remedy this while holding a wet, squirmy baby. Mothers (and fathers) have far better things to do with their time than fiddle with the damn clips and mop up a huge mess. My husband, an MD and engineer says it is obviously incapable of maintaining a reliable seal. Look at it! Meanwhile, we're shopping for a different type of tub. We cuss too much using this one.
B00004D3EU I pressed and clicked the correct spot like it said in the directions and yet it still leaks. This was a problem because i used it on the kitchen counters for the first week. I had to put towels under it to absorb all the water. So i moved it upstairs to the bathtub and this way i don't have to worry about all the leaks. Really, who wants a tub that leaks???? My daughter is not yet sitting up on her own and yet she is too long to be reclined comfortably in this tub....so we are in an awkward transition phase. a phase that this tub doesn't suitably deal with. I wouldn't buy this tub.
B00004D3EU I registered for this and got it home and put it together. It didnt seem to fit together right. I took it back and bought a basic tub and a foam bear pad to lay her on. Much better. less $$ and easy to use.
B00004D3EU I like the fact that it's a convertible tub, and I seem to have escaped any kind of leaking problem, but the sling is a pain in the rear.  Baby gets playful, kicks his legs, and Mom spends half the time repositioning him on the sling (which operates more like a slide), so that he won't slip all the way into the water. I regret not getting the kind which sling stretches across and keeps baby buoyant. Oh well.
B00004D3EU It leaks every time I use it. It's impossible to snap back together if by some miracle you can change the size.  I have to put towels underneath the tub to collect all the water that leaks out of it.  I love the sling, but I am tempted to beat the tub with a hammer just to take out my frustrations with it.  If I could get down on the floor and bathe my son in the big tub with this tub inside, it would probably be easier (but I don't think my knees would appreciate it.  I received this as a gift and didn't check the reviews before using, I should have.  I am currently looking for another solution to this piece of junk.  Buy at your own risk.
B00004D3EU this tub leaks - i had to put it in my bath tub to use it, which really hurt my back and made me nervous when taking my daughter out of the tub and trying to stand up.  couldnt use it on a kitchen counter unless i wanted everything to get wet.doesnt open and close very easily -  i gave myself more than one bruise (due to pinched skin) when trying to open and close it.  also, by the time your child can sit up in this might as well put them in the big tub..my daughter slipped and slid all over when we tried to sit her up.too short - by the time she was 4 months, she was too long for this tub and would kick the sides.i had regisered for the eurotub, but rec'd this.  preferred the euortub by far!
B00004D3EU Enough said.
B00004D3EU My son is now 11 months old and I have been using this tub since he was 5 weeks old.  In the beginning, we used the infant sling, but my baby would constantly slip down into the water.  We had to put a large bear-shaped foam bath sponge between him and the sling to minimize the slipping, but we still had to readjust him quite frequently.  When he learned to sit on his own, we tried using the bath seat feature.  He would arch his back and slip forward into the bath ring, thus painfully squishing his private parts.  We decided to try it without the ring and it was a little challenging holding him in place while washing him, but we managed.  Now he twists and turns and won't stay put in the tub.  I have thought about buying a better tub, but since we are so close to graduating him to the big tub, I don't want to spend the money.  Please consider buying something different for your baby.  I will not be using this tub for my next child.
B00004D3EU My mom bought this for us after she decided that the bath chair we already owned was not good enough.  This has been the best bathtub we could have ever wanted!  The newborn sling is nice, and lets baby have contact with the water without feeling overwhelmed.  Our baby didn't really like bath time until he could sit up by himself, and at that point this bath tub became a necessity.  Baby loves to explore the tub, and the secure bath ring helps keep him safely and securely in one place.  He is now almost 20 mos and we still use it with the bath ring in place because he likes it better that way, too!  I especially like it because I don't have to worry about him slipping under the water accidentally if I look away for a second to get his towel ready or something.  We had a problem with leaking at first, too, but once we read the instructions and pushed the bottom down securely, we haven't had a problem since.
B00004D3EU I was never fond of this even with the first use.  The baby sling never stayed in place and i was constantly adjusting the sling and baby.  When i moved to the bath ring it's plastic edges are sharp and usually scratched him while he moved around.  It doesn't colapse or open easily leaving a large tub.  The only time i was happy with it was once he was old enough to sit in the full tub which is when this isn't needed.
B00004D3EU Great product for our little one.  We put the baby tub in the big bath tub and our little one loves to take baths.  The first time we used it I had a hard time locking it but once I got it locked there were no problems.  I like the whole set up especially teh suction cups so it doesnt slide around, the sling to keep the baby laying on an incline is great too the perfect height to keep the baby happy.  It also has a removable bath ring, that she will be using when she can sit on her own.
B00004D3EU Not sure why this got bad reviews.  There is a slight issue with locking the tub in the expanded position, if you don't snap it in right, it will leak.  But once we figured that out we had no problems.  We used the product starting at about 8 weeks when our son outgrew the sink but was too tiny for the tub and we stuck this tub right on our countertop for months with no problem.  Now we use it in our regular tub and it saves us from having to waste a tubful of water for one tiny person to bathe.  Our son is now almost one and he still loves this tub, great value!
B00004D3EU I was so excited when I recieved this tub thinking it would last for years. Well, first you can NOT use it in your home bathtub, because the suction cups will not adhere to a non-slip surface. Most tubs are non-slip, that's what the little bumps are for in your tub. This was fine though, I planned to use it on our kitchen counter. No matter how hard I pressed on the middle \"locking\" device water always leaked out onto the counter and floor. This tub is more trouble than it's worth!
B00004D3EU I received this tub as a gift at my baby shower.  I looked at it and thought what a great idea for a tub.  Wrong!!  First of all, the tub leaks.  You cannot let go of the baby for one second beacause they will slide.  My son absolutely hated bath time until I bought the seat that sits in the bath tub and now he is happy.  The sides of the ramp are hard and if they move there head to quickly they could hurt themselves.  I wouldn't recommend this to anyone.
B00004D3EU I found it easy to use and it sticks to the bathtub great, BUT my two month old is constantly slipping down and I have to keep pulling him back up onto the hammock.  I would buy one that is built with a slanted back and a short basin so baby doesn't have far to slide down.  Maybe it will be more helpful as he is older and we don't need the hammock.
B00004D3EU This tub was the worst! Talk about making your job harder than it already is! It leaks, the sling hardly stays in place, it takes up so much space, and you have to use it in the tub anyways. It is more trouble than it is worth.
B00004D3EU i was surprised to read all those negative reviews regarding this tub.  i had two different tubs before, and i got this one when my daughter was 5 months old, she's now one year old and still uses it.  granted, i never tried to fold it since those few inches don't seem to make much of a difference storagewise, so i don't know if its difficult to do.  i've had absolutetly no leaks with this tub, and the suction cups still work great.  the bathring works great, and can be moved out of the way when baby is old enough to sit alone.  although i still use the bathring so my daughter cant stand up all the time.  it's been 7  months with this tub, and nothing ever broke, or got worn.  i think this tub is great!!!
B00004D3EU DO NOT WASTER YOUR MONEY ON THIS TUB. IT IS A PIECE OF JUNK.MY BABY WAS VERY UNCOMFORTABLE IN THIS TUB, YOU ALSO ONLY HAVE ONE FREE HAND TO WASH THE BABY . IT ALSO LEAKS FROM THE BOTTOM
B00004D3EU I bought this tub without reading any reviews (I research everything before I buy) and this has been the best tub by far! So far, in my 7 months of motherhood I have been through four tubs (this being the 5th). I had a little sponge bath when he was first born...I knew it would not work for any extend about of time but it did the trick when we were waiting for his belly buttons stump to fall off. When he out grew that I bought the Safer Bather by leachco based on reviews and I was not all that impressed... My little guy got to cold and it just was not that great. We received the four stage bath system and it was horrible the baby just did not fit in it right. Therefore, I upgraded to the leachco bath ring...once again nothing but disappointment. I was resolved to washing the baby in the sink, but at 7 months that was just too hard for me to do alone; he was slippery and squirmy just wanting to play! I happened to be out at Toy's r us and they were having a sale so I picked up the tub thinking what the heck lets see if this works. So far, it has been great. No leaks, he is very secure (obviously, you stay with them) and it is so simple clean. My only issue is the tub is large and we have a small bathroom. I am 5 months pregnant with my second and cannot wait to use the sling with the next baby. By far this is one of the best baby items I own! Five stars from me!
B00004D3EU Well, I loved it when we first had our daughter. She never cried during her baths. LOVED IT!Then she began to grow & by 5 months of age, she still couldn't sit up, but the tub was way too small. I wish it was somewhat larger.
B00004D3EU We registered for this tub, before doing any research.  Big mistake.  As a newborn, I used the sling to bathe my son.  As he got bigger, I put the sling into the tub (2nd way of the 4-1 system).  Bath time became a pain.  My son kept sliding down, even with one hand on him at all times.  He didn't really seem to enjoy it either.  Finally, after reading great online reviews I bought the Eurobath.  LOVE IT!!!!!  From day one my son had a great time in his new (huge) tub.  He fits securely into the reclined side of the tub, with no slipping.  He is comfortable and there is enough water around him to keep him warm and for him to splash.  We've had it over a month, I highly recommend the Eurobath over this bath tub.
B00004D3EU This is the most poorly made baby bath I have ever used. It is impossible to get folded and unfolded. When you do get that figured out then you get to deal with the stupid sling. My baby kept slipping down and her ears would get under water. She is now to big for the sling, but to small to sit up in the ring. I gave it a fair try, but I had to go out and buy another bath. It seems like a great concept, but it is really just a waste of [money].
B00004D3EU I used this bath for the first 3 months and it was great when using the sling, but when my son got too big for the sling and was sitting up, we tried the sitting position. But my son would just slip down and would cry because it was uncomfortable for him. I would not recommend this bath tub. There are other tubs with slings that are much better.
B00004D3EU this is the worst bath tub i've bought. i returned this item right away. it leaks. once i pulled it out to be longer but, no matter how much i struggled to put the extension back together, it just wouldn't click. when i pressed it to lock the extension, i couldn't tell whether it locked or not, so then i put water to test the lock system. the result was that my kitchen counter and floor were a mess.now, i bought the Euro bath. it does a good job.
B00004D3EU This tub is okay, but not the best there is.  Our son is 3 months old and fairly long, 25 inches.  He can't sit on is own yet, so has to lay on the sling.  He loves to kick and splash and doesn't have the room he needs.  He also slips down the sling frequently.  There's got to be something better...
B00004RA66 We bought 2 of these, and used them to block off the computer desk from the rest of the family room, and to block off the 7' wide archway between the kitchen and the rest of the house. We soon found that while these are very sturdy and adaptable, they are tall enough that they are a hassle to step over. At least once a week, my husband or I will catch a toe or scrape a shin stepping over. So if you intend to use this fence as a corral, either indoors or out, this is a Great Buy. If you are planning to use it as a fence to block off a wide opening, pay the extra money for the metal version with the gate. you (and your toes) will be much happier.
B00004RA66 When our son started rolling into chairs, we knew we needed something to keep him safe.  This play yard fits great in our living room, yet there's plenty of room for him to roll around in all directions.  Also, I like that it's see-thru.  You can see  your baby (and he can see you) from across the room.  I don't care that it's not the most attractive thing.  It was affordable and it does the job.  And when our son starts crawling, we can completely close it and know that he won't be able to sneak off.  One suggestion I would make to the manufacturer though would be to pad or provide padding around the bottom, about six inches high.  My son falls asleep with his head on the edge all the time (NOT very comfortable), and when I move him away from it, he wakes up.  It'd be nice to not have to move him.
B00004RA66 We bought this play area to keep our 15 month old daughter safe while we worked outside.  She loves it and plays well.  It is easy to set up and tear down and takes a matter of seconds.  Best of all, is that it is very light and easy to carry, as well as having an excellent carry strap.
B00004RA66 Superyard XT is an excellent product for child containment, providing exactly the protection a parent desires for outdoor play. It isn't a very large gate- even when fully extended, it covers an area only about the size of a medium to large playpen. But it offers enough space to keep one or two kids (and their toys) safely occupied.Superyard XT holds up well and I have left it outside during harsh weather conditions with no problems. It is very easy to clean and to transport. The panels fold together and the carrying strap makes the job even easier still. The panels do not fold completely flat- they do have some thickness, so don't expect this gate to fit into a tiny space. It needs at least enough space to accommodate the thickness when all six panels are folded together.The panels on Superyard XT are not very tall and because of this, the gate is good only for toddlers and other kids up to about two years of age. As children get older, they will be able to climb over the walls of the gate or possibly knock it down, making it impractical as a containment device. But the shorter height has one clear advantage: It makes it easy for parents because it can be stepped over. There is no need to dissemble the panels or open the gate to get inside.Superyard XT is solid and sturdy but consumers must be careful to position it properly. The gates cannot be placed in a straight line because the design of the gate diminishes its effectiveness when used in this manner. Each one of the joints has to be bent in order to become sturdy. Placed in a straight line, the gate cannot resist pressure and it will fall over with the slightest push.The only complaint I have with Superyard XT is the small space it covers. With the limited space, some people may have difficulty fitting even two kids inside the closed walls of the gate. Depending on the number of toys your kids have, one child might be all that will fit. This is why I strongly recommend purchasing an extension kit. This kit consists of two additional panels and while this doesn't sound like much, it increases the area substantially and it makes the gate capable of handling two kids with no problems.Overall, Superyard XT is a very good gate for child or pet containment. I brushed it off when I first saw it because it seemed like another useless product with limited use, marketed solely to take our hard earned money. But now that I own the Superyard, I cannot imagine life without this containment device. It offers kids a place to play where they are well- protected, giving parents some much needed peace of mind.
B00004RA66 This product is a godsend!  I use it on a carpeted area for our 7 month old infant, so she can crawl around to her hearts content and be safe from wall outlets, small objects, etc.  I am also planning on getting an extension, to make her play area even bigger.  The 'Superyard XT' is also great for puppies, and more humane than crating them for hours.  My only complaint, and it is minor, is that the gate that opens (so you can get in the 'Superyard') is awkward and somewhat difficult to work.  There should be an easier swing open type gate on this thing, so that mommy or daddy can quickly enter and leave the play area.
B00004RA66 This has system has given me peace or mind. I know my grand daughter is safe while she is entertaining herself. Great product, very study.
B00004RA66 I recently purchased this yard when my twins ((now nearly 8 months old)) started to become mobile.I have yet to baby-gate my entire house, but I have super-yard'ed the family room! I have it shaped as a square, and have those alphabet puzzle peice foam squares inside, to protect my carpet. The boys enjoy being able to actually see through the holes, and be able to play with many of their toys ((rather than being confined in a pack n play)). It is pretty sturdy if used properly, I mean if I or any other adult were to fall on it, obviously it would collapse. It DOES fold, but not at all compactly, and I would say that it would most-likely take up my entire mini-van trunk if I were to travel with it... so if you are looking for a compact on-the-go type of play-yard, look else-where. I do like that you can configure it to fit an oddly-shaped play area, or even remove/add panels ((sold separately which we did not buy)) to make it larger or smaller. Also, due to it being plastic ((very well rounded I may add, no sharp edges!)) we will be able to start bringing it outdoors as well now that the weather is improving!I also am planning on purchasing another one to use to \"gate off\" 2 over-sized entrance ways to my family room. My husband believes if we screw 3 hooks ((with the full hole, not the 1/2 hole) to either side of each door frame, and then attatch those strong zip-ties to the hooks and the holes in the gate, that it will work. Of course, this will do damage to our walls, but it is the only solution I see fit with such a large doorway ((please note that these are NOT meant for stairs, or doorways. They are NOT baby gates... this is just a creative suggestion I thought I would mention)). And, one of my friends owns one, and used it to surround her christmas tree last year, which I thought was an AMAZING idea!I think that once our boys master crawling, and eventually walking that the super-yard will prove even more valuable than it is now!
B00004RA66 We purchased this the moment i saw my son fell and landed flat on the floor hitting the bottom corners of our entertainment center & computer table.  It gave him a bad bruise on his forehead, and worst of all a very traumatic cry of his life at 8 months.  Now that we enclosed our entertainment center along with our computer table with this gate, we not only protected him from some more bad falls, but also kept him away from other stuffs (cds/dvds, remote controls, powersurge outlet and so on) we don't want him to play with.  Definitely, a very sturdy gate that won't just fall apart when pulled or tagged by my son, now 14 months.  It doesn't even encourage him to climb up on its diagonal shaped railings, no matter how much he tries to.  I say, its much cheaper too to invest on gates rather than on childproofing device with adhesives that don't actually work, and other devices that are not only childproof but adult proof as well.  A great investment for a lifelong use.
B00004RA66 This is one of only a few products my husband and I would buy again with no hesitation.  We bought it over a year ago (with the extension) and have used it every day since.  When my daughter outgrew the octoganal arrangement, we just opened it up and have used it to block her from the kitchen and other dangerous areas.  She is not a climber yet, so I do NOT recommend using it in this fashion if your child is.  It will tip over, the circular formation is the sturdiest.  We haven't had any problems with pieces breaking off or the plastic being brittle and we adjust it almost daily.  Highly recommended.
B00004RA66 We now own two of these gates/yards. We originally purchased the yard to wrap around our stone wall/fireplace. The wall was too \"freeform\" to use regular 90-degree and straight-edge padding, so we figured by snaking this yard around the fireplace and entertainment center we'd pretty well babyproof the whole living room. Currently we are using one gate to block off the bottom of the stairs and one at the top (we're in a rental home and cannot bolt the sturdier ones to the wall). We use them as a deterant and NOT as a \"babysitter.\" Our daughter is always supervised, but it's nice to have a \"split second accident preventer.\" In other words, it would take her some time to move the gate and go around it, by which time we would have caught her red-handed. Our first gate made it through a cross-country move with \"Break and Dent Van Lines\" with no issues...if only all our items would have been so durable. Anyway, well worth the cost for a variety of uses!
B00004RA66 We bought 3 sets... family is buying them also.  Great idea for when you have to keep the little ones in a safe space, our twins love being and playing in it
B00004RA66 This is a stay-at-home mom's lifesaver!As my little boy (now 9 months) has become moremobile, this product has helped tremendously.It has broadened his world but in an enclosed space.We keep his play yard in a corner within the superyard, in the children's playroom.He never gets tired of it. He can play with his toys,while I check my email, do the laundry and watch him at the same time. He loves it!He can crawl or cruise within his area and can see me whilehe plays. It's great that you can adjust the individual pieces.I recommend buying the extra parts to have a larger space for baby to roam in. It never hurts to have extra, in case one breaks. Great product! We have great fun playing in it together!
B00004RA66 We got the superyard (or, as I call it, the &quot;Steel Cage Death Match&quot; yard) to contain our child in the living room and den while we are working. This is our experience. Your mileage may vary.Plus side: The fence itself is robust and basically indestructable. In it's four or five sided form, it's very stable, even against toddler rage! (&quot;Attica, Attica!&quot;) The sides can be taken apart, to make smaller areas.Minus side: the folding and locking mechanism is very stiff, and I was afraid I was breaking it at first when I was opening it up. So far it's not too much of a problem. The whole system is pretty heavy, and not nearly as portable as they try to tell you. Also, it's pretty clunky and large, so once it's up, we keep it up. The major downside is the price. Ack.
B00004RA66 I got this from a friend whose son had outgrown it. It has been wonderful. We use it both indoors and out. Outdoors it's good for keeping and busy infant or toddler in one place so you can do yard work or relax without having to chase them around. It is especially handy in the backyard since we have a pool. I just put a few toys inside it with my son and he's happy for a while. We don't have a playpen so we use this inside as well when we need to make sure he stays out of harms way for a few minutes. We even use it for the dog when she sleeps inside at night because otherwise she chews on everything in the house while we're sleeping. It folds easily and stores great under the bed.
B00004RA66 We love this thing.  I read the reviews before I bought it and thought it would be tough to &quot;unravel&quot; but it wasn't bad at all.  I expect a new product not to just pop right into position, but it formed a hexagon rather easily.  That's the key---no assembly required!  My daughter is 7 months old and when she pushes herself up on her front arms and tips over onto her back, she occasionally bonks her head on the &quot;wall&quot; of the pen.  She gave herself a nice red spot on her head when she hit the &quot;hinge joint&quot; part of the pen that concerned me, but it wouldn't be very effective if it wasn't sturdy.  The mesh lattice walls seem to have a little give in them.  To remedy it as best as I could, I have placed stuffed animals or larger toys in front of the corners.  I still think that her rare head bonks are a good trade off for other huge catastrophies that would be occuring daily in or house.  She doesn't protest to being put in it because she has a sense of freedom and scoots all around and is still be able to see us.  And we can keep an eye her as well.  It is the perfect size as not to intrude on living room space but big enough to hold her ever-growing little body and a ton of her toys.  We bought a second one for upstairs and we're going to try to connect them together for outdoor occasions.
B00004RA66 I was initially given this product as a gift for my 9 pound chihuahua. It's great in the sense that it contains him very well. He is very active and likes to jump very high, but he can not jump over the gate. He tries to push the gate in attempt to escape but the gate does not move. The gate is high enough so that he can not jump over. It contains his crate, wee-wee pad and food bowl with plenty of room for him to play around in. I bought a second one to use as a gate to keep him from going up our stairs. Very sturdy product and we plan on using this also when we have kids. One drawback is the gate is a little difficult to open at times in case you want to just walk in. But I guess that is the good thing also so who ever you have inside can't get out.
B00004RA66 It did exactly what I purchased it for.  My baby never actually stayed in the enclosed area (absolutely hated it!) but I was able to use it for other purposes which was great, such as enclosing the fireplace.  The floor stickers, or whatever they're called, to keep it in place left sticky residue on my hardwood floors which took some effort to remove though.
B00004RA66 I recommend getting the extension that goes with this gate to make it big enough.  Our baby never liked to be penned in anywhere, but we use it to gate off the \"band area\" of the basement.  It doesn't need to be connected to itself to function well.  If you do plan to connect it in an enclosable shape, it takes a little getting used to the connection mechanism.  My husband has no problem with it at all.  It's very versatile, and I recommend it.
B00004RA66 My son is getting around pretty good now and I wanted to be able to contain him a little.  I put this with the extension kit around his Laugh and Learning Home by Fisher Price and he is able to play while I get a few chores done.  It is open enough that he does not feel too confined and seems quite content to play in it for a while.  A good purchase that can be used in multiple ways.
B00004RA66 It holds position nicely.  I feel comfortable that my 10 month old isnt going to tip the whole thing over due to it being substantial in weight.But when it comes down to it, I dont know if I would buy it again for more than 35$.
B00004RA66 Welcome to the toddling/scootching/crawling years, where you can't ever get a break unless you have some way of keeping junior from getting away.The SuperYard is a foldable rigid-plastic fencing system for creating what we called back in the day a play pen. It's designed to be reconfigurable for a given area, so that the enclosure can be made to fit odd spaces. It works for indoor and outdoor areas, and the optional extensions can be used to make rather large enclosures quite easily.We bought this as a replacement for the Pack-N-Play type portable play yard. Our son, at 10 months or so, had clearly outgrown this smaller type yard, and was quite unhappy at the limiting horizons of its opaque blue walls. The SuperYard has been a very good, albeit not completely perfect, solution for providing some portable play space that requires somewhat lighter supervision than a freeplay in an open room. Our son's now closing in on 14 months and this has been useful for that purpose.It's not 100% easy to set up and reconfigure, and there's a reason for that. The extra difficulty with piecing the \"end\" sections together means it's nearly impossible for a tot to open or close this by their lonesomes. It takes some strength and adult wile to open the sections and bend the connectors at various angles to thus reconfigure 
B00004RA66 This was great for helping me keep an eye on my little one while I worked. I was working from home, and most days I was upstairs and on the computer. Once she could crawl, she started crawling toward everything dangerous. The litter box, the stairs, plugs, you name it, she found a way to get to it. I bought this and it was great! We even purchased the extension kit, so she basically had the whole room, yet was contained. My oldest son even liked to get in with her to play so she was never &quot;lonely&quot;.I also used this outdoors a lot during summer months. My family is big on campfires and cookouts and this was a great way to ensure her safety, yet not have her confined to a play pen!
B00004RA66 We bought this play yard when our son was 2 months old and we LOVE it!  It keeps his toys, books, blankets, etc. in a clean space away from our curious doggies.  It's a great, roomy size and not too hard to put together or take down.  It can be configured into different shapes and easily moved.
B00004RA66 We bought this instead of the Playzone because it was cheaper. We bought the Superyard XT to use as a playpen area for our son. The Superyard is fantastic when it comes to size and it very sturdy if you mount it to the wall or bolt it into the floors but we prefer not to put holes all over the walls or into our concrete slab. So we did not get to enjoy the gates fullest potential.The Good:1. Very tall2. Has options available to make it sturdy and permanent in placement.3. Able to see though the gates, great for both parent and child.4. Easy to fold up (with some elbow grease)5. Very Very easy to store away.6. White color, very nice can match just about anything.7. Somewhat easy to wash (not like the plastic walls on the Playzone - you just wipe clean), we had to take the gate into the yard and rinse it off with the water hose.8. If it is not bolted into the walls it is quick and easy to take down for more space verses other products such as the Playzone are pretty permantent once in place (they are just too big and bulky)All in all I gave the Superyard XT 4 stars because it has options to make it as sturdy as the more expensive ones out there, but the more expensive ones do not require screws, or holes to your home to complete the job. If you want to use the Superyard as an extensive gate to block entranceways this gate is fantastic in every way. If you are buying to use as a Playyard, then buy the Playzone if you have an extra fifty bucks.
B00004RA66 I recieved this as a shower gift and began using it when my daughter began to crawl.  It was better than any play yard because there is much more room for toys and for baby.  As she grew (and the number of toys as well), I purchased an extension to make the area bigger.  It was great for both indoor and outdoor use.  We also used it to block the large open area between our kitchen and family room that no other gate would be large enough to cover.  Now that winter is here and she is running about, we are using it to block our wood(pellet) stove to prevent any accidents.  We also plan on using it around our Christmas tree again this year. Other reviews have complained that it is not sturdy or difficult to set up.  I have never had a problem and it folds up and stores easily.  Well worth it for it's versatility.
B00004RA66 I began using this when my first daughter began to crawl.  I liked that it was bigger than any playpen or playyard and could accommodate my growing daughter as well as her toys.  It is easy to put together and I purchased an additional section to make it even larger.  We have used it at home, at the beach, in the yard and as a barrier for both the Christmas tree and pellet (wood) stove to keep our little ones safe.
B00004RA66 This gate is an indispensable thing in our household. We have twins and it seems to keep our kiddos as well as all their stuff in one place. They can't stay in here for too long, but it's great for when we need to cook and can't have them by our side. This is the best gate!!
B00004RA66 it will NOT make a regular octagon, even if you have 8 panelsthe problem is, it  only opens to certain angles, and 135 degrees is not one of themit only does 90, 120, and 150(but 120 degrees is good for a hexagon, just don;t think if you have to have any old number of panels, you can make any polygon you want, you can;t.. additionally the SQUARE, which you can make with the 90 degree angles, are not very strong and not recommended by the instructions, especially if you are thinking, i can have use 8 panels to make a square, it will be very flimsy in the middle of the straight junction.. they specifically say DO NOT do that, have 2 sides joined at a 0 degree angle.. basically a hexagon is about all it really works for.. though a 4 sided square works, it isn;t weak, it is just tiny..)so you can HAVE an 8-sided fencebut the angles will have to be half 120 and half 150 degreeswhich is more of a square, just with bent sidesnot a real regular stop-sign type octagon!@#$plus it;s a little flimsyand (no matter what the shape is) there is no way to have an easy open/close gate, you have to either step over it or take a side apart every time [very hard]when i bought it, the store guy said ''oh what kind of dogs do you have..?''hmALSOwhen your kids get to about 18 months or so, they can either move the sides, by walking while pushing on a side, which changes the angle  you had it set to, or just lifting it and crawling undergood for babiestoddlers, not so mucheither fix it to the floor somehow, or accept that they will escapedogs might do that tooespecially just dig under or root it up with their nose and go underwle
B00004TFLB Initially, I thought this was a great toy. My 5 month old didn't seem to love it, but would sort of press the buttons and screw around with it. Unfortunately, at 6 months, she can now sit up, but has little control over her body. Today, she flailed herself towards the cube and banged her eye socket against one of the corners. She has no injury to her actual eye, but she has a bruise below her eye now, and has been crying all night.I am done with hard plastic. I think I am switching to all soft toys and cubes until she is 1.
B00004TFLB My baby seems to really like this cube. He loves watching the flashing lights and hearing the music. The reason I did not give it five stars is because the instruments do all sound very similar and a bit electronic sounding, but other than that not that annoying of electronic toy.
B00004TFLB I wish there was a volume adjuster because it is a little louder than I imagined and that the music would last a little longer.
B00004TFLB We bought this when our baby was sitting with support and initially she was into the soft edges to chew on and later on she found interest in hitting the cube for playing music. It's been many months since we bought this and baby is still interested in it. This is probably the only toy she reaches for over and over, and she never seems to get tired of it. Worth the $$.
B00004TFLB We got our twin boys this Mozart Magic Cube for Christmas, when they were 6 months old.  We liked everything about it...except that it was TOO LOUD!  I've actually been amazed at the number of baby toys that are annoyingly loud.  Some to the point that they made our babies cry (like this one).  I've actually had to place duct tape over speaker holes on numerous things such as mobiles, play gyms, and an activity table because otherwise those products are great, just loud.  But therein lies the problem with this toy - there is no obvious speaker hole on it.  It's as if the annoyingly loud music emanates from every crevice.  Which is why it has been put away since Christmas.  Now that the boys are 9.5 months I may try to bring it out again and see if they will tolerate it.  If not I'll just sell this overpriced piece of plastic at my MOMs Resale next month.
B00004TFLB Our 11 month old really loves this toy, he loves swatting the sides to make the music turn off/on. Its very sturdy and well made, but the one we received stopped working for no apparent reason after about 2 weeks. Amazon quickly replaced it and so far all is well with the second toy, though we've only had it a few days.
B00004TFLB Both of my twins LOVE this toy! I really like how you can add/subtract the different instruments as the song plays. I did find it interesting that they enjoy one of the songs more than others and will keep pressing the orchestra button until they find the song the like. I think it's a good way to start to introduce them to music.
B00004TFLB Who is very chatty and outgoing. He's five months old now. It startles him and made him cry a few times. Decided it was a bit too 'manic' for him. Maybe when he's a bit older.
B00004TFLB I was so excited to get this for my 1yo, and it is a great toy...  My 1yo & 3yo love it.  BUT it has an issue with batteries!  When it arrived (with included batteries in a \"try me\" box), the batteries were dead.  It's not being played with at a rate that warrants having to change the batteries once or twice a week.  When it begins getting low on power, the music sounds warped, like an old warped record, which is dreadful!  Perhaps we got a defective one.  I don't know.  I hope this isn't happening to others.
B00004TFLB My daughter isn't quite a year old, and she can control this toy.  It's easy to press the buttons, and she loves the music.  I think this is a great buy!
B00004TFLB This thing as so loud and piercing. My son doesn't really care for it. It's heavy for a baby to hold and doesn't really do much.
B00004TFLB I didn't buy this for my son because some reviews said the sounds weren't true to the instrument.  I'm a very musical person, so I'm picky about these things.  I am SO GLAD someone bought this for my son.My son is 5 months old.  He is entertained by this toy (so am I).  He doesn't get the concept of the different instruments, and adding/subtracting the instruments.  But, he does press the buttons himself.  The lights just add to the experience.I don't think the sounds are that far off.  It's a baby toy remember.  I like the choices of instruments - violin, piano, harp, flute & French horn - partly because I play three of those.It cycles through 8 songs (not all Mozart as implied by the name).  Unfortunately, it will only cycle through the songs by pressing the Orchestra button multiple times.  It would be nice to cycle through them only using one instrument.
B00004TFLB My 15 month old still enjoys this toy after getting it for Christmas when she was near 9 months. She didn't quite get it at first since she was so young, but through the months she's enjoyed pushing the buttons, watching the lights go on and off, hearing the music, and now at 15 months knowing that the different buttons do different things. My only complain is that there are a couple of songs that get old quickly, but I guess that comes with every music making toy! I like that it's colorful and the education it provides with the instruments (mommy and daddy are crazy music lovers) as well as the simplicity of the toy. Hopefully she'll enjoy it for a few more months!
B00004TFLB great item, my baby loves the music, i love it as well pressing all the buttons, i would def. recommend this item.
B00004TFLB It's a bit on the loud side, yes, but my baby loves this toy.  She smacks it, turns it around, bites the corners.  It has kept her entertained for several minutes at a time, which is a lot for my very squirmy, active little one.  Very happy with it!
B00004TFLB Seriously, we have a top 5 list of must bring/have with us when we go anywhere, and this is one. My MIL freaked out when it ran out of batteries. It's that good. I'm not even sure why, but the baby becomes obsessed with the different instruments and the sounds. And it plays a lot of tunes-excellent purchase.
B00004TFLB This toy seemed very well liked and is recommended on many toy homepages in the Top Ten Toys. I had high hopes but my little boy just doesn't seem interested. We received it early on and I think he liked the sounds of it somewhat. He is now almost 14 months and doesn't really play with it unless he is prompted by  me. Even then he'll only shortly press some buttons and then usually starts picking it up and throwing it. This thing is heavy for a little person and I'm afraid that it could hit his foot or smash through our french doors. I thought it might just take him a little while and that he would be interested as he grows older but so far we could have done without it.
B00004TFLB I bought this for my 4-month old son. He is very fussy baby but when I played the music on this cube, he loved it. The best sounds he liked were the flute, piano and the Orchestra. The Best thing about this Music cube is that you can play one instrument at a time and then the final orchestra one to kind of show the music-mix.I believe it will help develop my baby's musical skills.Cons: The battery didn't last long. We used it for 30 days, for about 10 min each day and the battery died down!
B00004TFLB We ordered this toy from Drugstore.com, which showed a picture of an older model, not the new \"upgraded\" toy. The idea of this toy is intriguing but the actual execution of the idea is less than stellar. The \"music\" is tinny and unattractive. Apparently, the older model had better sound quality, which is why I went with this vendor. However, communicating with Drugstore.com and the whole return process is a significant hassle. The also blamed the deceptive picture they used on a glitch with the manufacturer.  I would actually recommend either getting a used model with all purple corners (the older model) or buying  it at a brick and mortar location so you can actually listen to it. If you are going to purchase on Amazon, consider another vendor. Very disappointed. I will not do business with this vendor again.
B00004TFLB My 6 month old LOVES this toy!I was thrilled when he went for it immediately in his playpen and was tap, tap, tapping the buttons - he knew the music should come from this tapping, but I had turned it off!  I do think the on-off switch is a blessing for the parents.  But the music is really pleasant, unlike so many toys.Of course the music is electronic, and I think that would be my only complaint.  I'm a very amateur violinist and would like the violin button to truly sound like strings but instead it's very electronic.However, the piano and French horn are quite good facsimiles.Research tells us that early introduction of classical music to children aids in their developing cognitive abilities.  This is a great way to make music fun for kids and I think all would enjoy this toy.
B00004TFLB Bought this as a gift because we love the one we own! By far the least annoying music making baby toy. We received a used one as gift when my daughter was 9 months and it has held up great over the years. Both of my kids love it too.
B00004TFLB My 10 month old daughter loves this toy and we also like the music it plays. The music is soothing and not annoying like many other toys. Also, it is a great size to travel with for road trips. Definitely a toy we recommend. We have also given it as a gift and the one year old loves it.
B00004TFLB I worked in the church nursery for over 4 years with this toy in one of the toyboxes available to the children.  I never saw any of them properly engage with it.  They'd pull it out, bang it a couple of times (starting up 2 different sounds) and then get bored and crawl away.  It was the one toy I knew I'd never buy for my children.
B00004TFLB We got this as a baby shower gift and my son has loved it since he was about 3 months old.  At first, he was fascinated with looking at the lights and hearing the music.  But as he got older, he learned how to play with it more.  He is now almost 18 months and he knows which songs he likes over other ones.  He will hit the blue button multiple times till he gets to the song he wants to hear.  I love that he loves this toy!
B00004TFLB This toy is great.  Not annoying and definitely a plus that there is an on/off switch.  My 7 month old figured it out pretty quickly and loves to bang, roll and chew on the thing.  She even gets excited when the music picks up and wiggles around.  Well worth the money.
B00004TFLB We like this toy.  The corners are very soft and it is very easy for a baby to turn on and off. He loves moving it around the room.  A few of the sounds could be improved. But I would buy this for a friend.
B00004TFLB My daughter played with this a lot for a few weeks. Now at 15 months, she periodically touches it when passing by.
B00004TFLB my daughter likes it okay especially if I play it for her, but it is too loud. I guess it is educational ....
B00004TFLB My 9 month old loves this musical cube. It has a nice selection of music. It does not have a volume switch so it can be rather loud.  Overall, I'd recommend it for your little one.
B00004TFLB My twin babies, now 9 months, liked this one right away.  I was surprised the music sound quality was better than any of all the other toys and mobiles and everything we have for them that plays music.  And the Mozart pieces using different instruments makes the cube not tiring at all as I would have expected.The cube is a bit heavy, but they roll it around without difficulty at all.  They can't throw it and it has rounded edges, so it's safe for them.  It lights up and eventually we'll all associate those different colors with the different musical scores.I think for the price it is worth it without a doubt.  Probably the price has come down and this used to be much more expensive because I notice in the earlier reviews mention about the high price.  I am surprised there aren't more toys for children at this age, so the really good ones like this one do not involve much thinking before buying on my part.Forget replacing the battery as it's not simple.
B00004TFLB Has 8 recognizable tunes and easy enough for our 9 month old to figure out. Nice silicone-esque edging makes it easy to grip and keeps from sliding.
B00004TFLB This is just the biggest hit with the grandchildren and their parents probably thanks to Mozart.  The children love it and it is so simple and unobtrusive.  The music is pleasant.  The on and off switch is easy. It stack and stores!
B00004TFLB I love this toy, and so does my 13 month old son.  He got it for his birthday, and he plays with it every day.  So far, we have had no trouble with it, and the batteries haven't even needed to be changed yet!  At first, he would just roll it to the orchestra side and hit that until it started playing.  Then he  learned that if he hit it again, the song would change.  So now he plays one song after another.  Lately, he has also started experimenting with the different instruments, both alone and together.  He plays with it for hours.  I don't get tired of hearing it either, because there are several different songs, and the sound quality is not irritating.  It's electronic, but much more pleasant than many of his other music toys.  Also, the tones of the instruments fluctuate a little bit, which makes it sound more like real instruments than electronic tones.Long story short, this has stood up to ALOT of play already, and we like it just as much now as we did when we first got it.
B00004TFLB I got this for my granddaughter's first birthday and we both love it! We both keep pushing the instruments to hear more music. I see why it is one of the most popular infant and toddler toys. Grandmas loves to play with it too!
B00004TFLB I don't know what the \"old\" magic cube is that some reviews have mentioned, and yes it's true that the instrument sounds are electronic-sounding reproductions not actual instrument sounds.  I hesitated to purchase this after watching a video review on here showing the violin sound.  I have played piano for 26 years and violin for 23 so I might be pickier than some as  far as the sound.  I'm so glad I got it despite the negative reviews and it doesn't bother me that the sounds aren't completely authentic.  (I'd also like to note that the violin is the worst sounding one, the other instruments sound more like the real thing in my opinion.)  I love that you can hear each instrument's part separately and choose which instruments you would like to play together.  My 1 year old likes to push the buttons to listen to the music while he plays with other toys, and often as soon as the song is over he will stop what he's doing to start another song then go back to playing.  As he gets older it will be neat to show him that while each instrument plays similar but different parts, they all go together to make a pretty song.The toy seems very sturdy, although after several months of play the 'harp' button has to be pushed a little harder than the others for some reason.
B00004TFLB The product is very fun for my daughter of 12 months, but the sound is so electronic that all of the selective instruments sound kind of the same.  How hard would it have been to have actual recordings of instruments?  I guess they don't have actual instruments in China.
B00004TFLB Buy it! Buttons are nice and soft enough that baby can activate them. She carries this around everywhere. Just watch the toes as it is a bit heavy.
B00004TFLB I bought this for my 3-year old daughter as one of her Christmas present from Santa Claus, she is not that into it, I think this is best for kids age 6 months to 2 years. I was going to buy it on Amazon, happened to find it elsewhere for just a little over $20.
B00004TFLB My daughter LOVES this toy.We first gave it to her at 6 months for Christmas, which was too early. She wasn't strong enough to push the button herself, so she didn't really like it. Around 8 months or so, she started liking it. The more she figures out how it works, the more the likes it. At 11 months, she plays with it all the time. Now she's strong enough to lift it, so she hands it to us to play.
B00004TFLB Hands-down one of the best purchases we made.  My son fell in love with this around age 6 months and still plays with it at 1 1/2.  The music is lovely and it teaches kids cause and effect, and then how to combine melodies.  A really fantastic gift.
B00004TFLB I know it says that this is for older babies but my daughter loves looking at the blinking lights and listening to the music. A piece of advice: it took me a little while to figure out that you had to press the orchestra button a few times to change the song. Before I figured this out, the same song was driving me crazy! The only reason why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because it does not have a volume control button. It is quite loud and I sometimes wish I can make it lower.
B00004TFLB My 9 month old son LOVES this toy!  It's not too loud and lights up with pretty colors.  He goes back to it time and time again but never gets tired of it.  I highly recommend it!
B00004TFLB The buttons are easy for the baby to find and the music isn't super annoying for the parents.  Definitely a good toy.
B00004TFLB The Mozart magic cube is an AWESOME toy for my busy little 15 month old boy.  It's one of the VERY few toys he will stop and play with.  He has always loved music from a young age.  He like to hit the various buttons and it is small enough for him to carry around.  It also can take lots of abuse.  My 4 year old daughter will play with it as well.  Really a classic must have for babies and toddlers.
B00004TFLB My 4-5 month old baby loves this toy.  It is very easy to press the buttons and activate the sounds, so even very young, uncoordinated babies can get this toy to make noise.  As she gets older, she can use the cube to learn about different kinds of sounds and about colors.  For now, though, she just likes to chew on the corners and is delighted whenever the music starts playing.I am giving this four stars instead of five because the cube is secured to its packaging with wire-like pieces of plastic that protrude from the toy.  It is actually very difficult (and maybe impossible) to remove these pieces entirely from the toy, and that presents a danger of poked eyes and scratches.  Eventually, we had to cut the plastic ties very close to the toy and then push the raw ends into the toy, where they still are (and we hope they stay there).  There seems to be no way to remove them entirely.
B00004TFLB The itself is well built and is exactly what you read about above.  I was hoping that it would engage my boy a little more but the buttons are a little hard to press for a 1 year old and so he lost interest very rapidly.He seemed to be interested when I pressed the buttons for him but beyond that, not worth the money in my opinion. At least not for a small baby.
B00004TFLB Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube.Nice music, interesting concept (one instrument per side). Baby (7 months old ) loves it. Good quality.
B00004TFLB This is a great transitional toy. We've had it since my son was tiny - as an infant, he liked to look at the lights and colors. At 18 months, he dances to the music and loves pressing the buttons. I don't think he fully gets the concept of adding and removing instruments to the orchestra yet, so once he figures that out, we'll have many more months of fun with the music cube. The music is pleasant - my only complaint is that it only has one volume setting.One word of caution, if you have a climber - this toy makes a great stepping stool for toddlers who like to climb out of their cribs. :)We love the music cube - highly recommend it!
B00004TFLB This toy inspires me. I messed with it constantly when my son was an infant and too young to understand how to add and subtract instruments from the full orchestra sound. Now he gets the full functionality of the toy. It lasts for years, offering various entertainments to various ages of kids. Classical music is awesome for babies and little ones, so we love this. Warning, it's very heavy. Don't put it in your backpack when traveling to grandma's (we learned this lesson). The rubberized bumpers on the corners are fantastic for safety. We're never giving away this adorable musical toy.
B00004TFLB My husband, son and I all LOVE this toy. My niece had it before, so I knew it was a must-have with my little guy already. I love that he (1 year old) can be exposed to fun classical music with a toy that engages him. He loves that it all lights up (when the buttons on any side are pressed) and he has fun pressing the buttons on the different sides and seeing and hearing the difference it makes (pressing one side engages or unengages the instrument during the song).  An added BIG PLUS for parents - it does have an \"off\" switch. :)  SO key, even for those of us who appreciate the value and fun of noisy kiddo toys... there is still a time/place for quiet.Great, fun toy. :)
B00004TFLB The fabulous Munhkin Mozart Magic Cube was given to our friend's daughter when she was an infant. From a very early age, we watched in amazement as she responded to the sounds of the music, obviously recognizing changes. We could see the pleasure on her face. As time went on, she played with the toy herself and was constantly drawn to it.There was always a limited assortment of toys for her to explore on the living room floor. She loved to play with some more than others. However, she was always constantly drawn back to this -- the sounds of the music from different instruments was a great source of fascination.As she gets older, the way that she handles Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube becomes more selective and sophisticated. This is one of the best toys we have ever seen to develop delight in music!She is beginning to talk now, and I feel certain that her first words will be, \"GET ME A HARPSICHORD NOW!!\"Love it!
B00004TFLB My one year old son has played with this toy since he was 6 months old and it still entertains him.  While the instruments do sound a bit synthetic, the toy still provides an introduction to different instruments and how multiple instruments can create a complex music piece.
B00004TFLB This item has been a life saver for me!  Not only does my child love it but it's the only thing I can distract him with while dressing him (he apparently HATES putting sweaters on). I can hit one of the sides and instantly get flashing lights and music while I try to squeeze a sweater over my child's head. My child loves it because it's easy for him to hit and acheive the same flashing lights and music.  The music is good and there are a lot of different choices.
B00004TFLB My son loves to dance to music now. He received this for his 1st birthday and it was an instant hit. He quickly learn how to work it and he still loves to play with it at 20 months old.
B00004TFLB I bought this product as I was looking for some alternative toys for my 7.5 mo son, so he cld play/hear music when he wakes up in the morning in crib, instead of trying to stand up all the times.I love the product after reading reviews, love the rounded corner, love the design that baby has to play all by HIMSELF!  My boy totally enjoyed it for the first couple days and could sat and played for 20 to 30 min, it totally amazed me.  Until one day I found him, after playing the cube for 15 min, covering his ears and trying to escape.  I turned the cube off and he's happy again, then I realized the cube could TOO loud/noisy for infant.Different from most of other musical toys that have volume options, this one does NOT and its volume was definitely on the higher side, which might not be too good for infant, especially when it was designed for &#34;all ages&#34; - 0 month +.Anyhow, I'm still using it to buy myself a little bit time in the morning, but I don't let him to play for more than 5 min, that would be my temporary solution for now.
B00004TFLB Our 8 month old loves to &#34;bang&#34; things so this is perfect. He moves it around, bangs on it and lights it up with music. Great buy!
B00004TFLB My niece absolutely loved this product and its not at all annoying! She loves playing with the lights and mom and dad don't have to listen to annoying music!
B00004TFLB Love, love, love this cube. My 8 month young daughter loves it too. It never gets old and it's so much fun to hit all the different instruments, then listen to them all play in sync. Great buy!!
B00004TFLB My daughter got this when she was 3 months old and it was one of her favorite toys. She'd kick her legs to turn the music on and off. At 3.5 she still loves it and she sits and plays with it along with her 9 month old brother now.
B00004TFLB I must say I'm guilty of purchasing anything that has &#34;Mozart&#34; in the name, since I love classical music and Mozart is my favorite composer. But this is the best toy ever. When I bought it my baby was a newborn, so mostly I played with it. But now my baby is seven months old and absolutely adores it. Whenever he is fussy, I just give him the cube and he forgets his fussiness at once. Best toy ever!
B00004TFLB I bought it for my love, it's very nice as the description, my girl loves that a lot. it's a good toy.
B00004TFLB There are really mixed reviews for this product, and I think this is for two reasons: 1) the fact that different people are looking to this product with very different ideas of what they think their kids will get out of it and 2) the fact that the product quality really did go downhill when Munchkin took over from Embryonics.  Let me try to help you sort out both points.Before I do, I should mention that I originally got the Munchkin version, didn't like it, and ended up replacing it with the original Embryonics version, which I like much better.  My 19-month-old seemed to enjoy both versions.Before you get this product, ask yourself, \"What value do I think it will have for my child?\"  Here are a few possibilities:1) You just want some kind of musical toy with which the child can interact to change the song that's playing.  If this is your thought, you will probably be happy with either version of this toy.  (Then again, if that's ALL you want, you'd probably be just as happy with theBaby Einstein Take Along Tunestoy, which my son enjoys, and which is both cheaper and more portable.)2) You want a musical toy that's a bit more interactive, where the child can change the sound of the song that's on.  In this case, you'd also probably be happy with either version of this toy.  My 19-month-old son loves to press the buttons to turn on and off different instruments, change the song playing, and just listen to the music and dance and clap to it.  He does seem to enjoy this more than the Baby Einstein player mentioned above, perhaps because he can change things up in a greater variety of ways.3) You hope that your child will start to recognize the sound of different instruments from this toy.  If you have any thought like this in your head, banish the thought of getting this toy - you will likely be disappointed with either version of it. You will certainly be disappointed on this count if you get the Munchkin version.  On the better, original Embryonics version of this toy, the piano and harp sound reasonably true to their real sound and the flute is recognizable on the higher notes, at least.  The french horn, however, is barely recognizable as a brass instrument, and doesn't have any of the beauty and timbre of sound that a real French horn does.  And the violin - forget it!  It doesn't even sound like a string instrument, and I doubt a child hearing the violin part on this cube and then hearing a real violin would hear any similarity.  On the newer Munchkin version, only the piano sounds like the same family of instrument - kind of like a harpsichord, as one musically-trained reviewer has noted.  The rest of the instruments sound like synthesized crap.  (I suspect that none of this will matter to you in the least if you just want a musical toy your child can interact with in some way, and despite this shortcoming, I think most toddlers would enjoy either version of the toy just because it is plays music and does so in an interactive way. Nonetheless, in this day of tiny, inexpensive high-quality music players, I don't get why they couldn't make this to sound more like real instruments, and to have better sound qual
B00004TFLB This is a great musical toy.  I think it's very well made and should last a long time.  It's been dropped dozens of times and it keeps on playing like new :o)
B00004TFLB I am so glad I read the reviews and purchased the original Embryonics one instead of the one made by Munchkin. The sound difference is amazing. I've heard the Munchkin one play in person and it sounds like it is dying and about to run out of batteries. Seriously save yourself some money and buy an original one (even if it's used). I got mine on ebay.
B00004TFLB What a GREAT musical toy! I highly recommend it. Our kid loves it, plays with it all of the time.
B00004TFLB My 13 month old son loves playing with this. He enjoys switching up songs.2 complaints, 1)its pretty heavy 2)all the instruments sound very electronic
B00004TFLB Fine toy, nice sound.  Much better than most other musical toys.  But I can't give it to my son yet as I can't seem to get these damned wires from the packaging out of the toy.  They are threaded through these tiny holes in the product and I haven't yet gone out to get pliers as someone else suggested.  You shouldn't need pliers to free a toy from its packaging.  Obviously the manufacturer didn't receive the memo that we are pushing for frustration free packaging. I even took out the screws that access the battery pack (which I am quite impressed with as well), hoping to access where the wires are stuck.  No luck.  If they just used regular string, it would easily come out, but these plastic coated wires are too stiff to pull through in the manner that they have put them.
B00004TFLB This is a great toy.  My 7 month old daughter loves it and so do many of my musician friends.  There is one significant flaw in its design; this is that the volume is not adjustable and it is too loud.  If it were 1/2 this loud, I'd let me daughter play with it all the time.  As it is, I usually limit her to playing with it with me, so I can hold it away from her head/ears.Due to the too loud volume, I'm giving it a 4 star review, instead of 5.  Otherwise, it is a great, great product.
B00004TFLB My children (an infant and a preschooler) like this toy--but it is WAY too loud. I wish there was a way to turn the volume down. I'd return this if I purchased it at a store, but it's too much of a hassle to return this to amazon. So sad.
B00004TFLB I love the music on this but my little guy does not seem to interested in this. He has had it since he was 6 months and has only shown a passing interest in it.
B00004TFLB I love this toy for babies. They have so much fun rolling it and hitting the big buttons to make beautiful music. I love the bouncy ball style corners to keep baby from injuring himself. I love the classical music that does not sound like your typical synthetic baby music. However, I not only have a baby, but two toddlers. This is a heavy toy. It hurts (a lot) when thrown by toddlers. (It does stand up to the beating, so that is a plus.) It also seems to attract use as a step stool since it is a cube & has resulted in quite a few falls. Take this toy away when they are toddlers! And if you have both a baby and a toddler, don't let either play with this toy! It just doesn't make for a very good combination.
B00004TFLB After looking for a musical toy that was not annoying, off-key or obnoxious, we discovered this.  Plays several songs by Mozart; baby can play a song with all instruments at once by pressing \"orchestra\" or one at a time.  Baby can also turn off instruments one at a time. The instruments are clearly synthesized, but still, the quality is not bad and I could listen to it for long periods of time.  I have yet to be annoyed by this toy.  In fact, I may have to buy two - my twins fight over it constantly!  My only reason for not giving it 5 stars is that it's a little bit loud.  I wish there was a volume control.
B00004TFLB My little one loves this toy (and my nephew loved his many years ago too).  It's easy to turn instruments on and off herself, and she loves hearing the different instruments (and combination of instruments) play the same tune.
B00004TFLB I bought this but my little one is definitely not old enough yet to grasp the concept...but she is getting there and lives to play with it, and so do I! Not annoying but very good tones. Love it, bought one for my nephew and cousin too!
B00004TFLB I bought this for my 19 month old son based upon the reviews of others. Well, the reviews were right -- this is a great toy. The music is great, the sound quality is surprisingly good, and the ability to add/remove instruments from each piece being played is very clever. In addition, it seems to be well made, with rubber bumpers on the corners. My son loves this thing, and becomes very involved when playing with it every time he uses it. Highly recommended.
B00004TFLB The musical sounds don't sound like the real instruments, they just sound like a cheap toy. Also, I thought each instrument would play its own melody, how it would in a real orchestra. For example, the horn would play the background, the flute a lighter melody, then all the instruments would combine to create the true melody when the orchestra button is pressed. But really, each button plays exactly the same notes except with a different instrument.  I was really disappointed, and my daughter prefers the music buttons from her Tiny Love Activity Center. The ones on that toy are really neat.
B00004TFLB Why can't manufacturers put a volume control on all toys or at least err on the side of being too quiet?  this toy is a great concept and plays great music, looks great, but is too loud.  espeically when my baby is playing with it right next to their ear.Unfortunately many other toys are too loud too, so this one is probably worth recommending to friends/family.  but it could be better.
B00004TFLB All the grand kids loved it and do the parents. It's a great gift for years. Durable and practice, a must.
B00004TFLB My 6 month-old enjoys staring at the toy and listening to the music if I turn it on for him, so I probably enjoy this toy more than my child at the moment, but I'm sure that will change.  The problem for a young baby is that this toy is very dense, and the buttons require a significant amount of force to push.  If he kicks one of the buttons, that will be enough, but he doesn't really have enough force just from swatting at it (he'd probably have to lean onto it).  It's also too heavy for him to pick up.The music quality is very nice and I don't find it to be at all annoying (like many other electronic baby toys); the flute is probably the nicest sounding of the instruments.  The corners are also rubbery, so you don't need to worry about sharp edges.  I'm still giving it 5 stars because I think it will be a toy he'll enjoy more and more as he grows and becomes more able to interact with it on its own, but for a younger baby, you might want to look atBaby Einstein Baby Neptune Ocean Orchestra Musical Toy, which has a similar conceit.
B00004TFLB So, first when I opened it I tried to remove the packaging strings and there was no way to remove them so I ended up cutting them (but a small piece was left inside the cube at 4 corners) ... The music choices are pretty annoying and I am not someone who gets annoyed by baby tunes. To change the tune you have to press twice on the orchestra side rather than only once, which I find annoying. Overall my LO doesn't seem too interested in it just yet.
B00004TFLB Santa gave this to our 6 month son for Christmas.  Both he and my 2 year old LOVE it.  It is wonderfully sturdy, and has many music functions.  My 2 yr old will announce each instrument as she adds them into the melody.  My husband is a music educator, and he gives this a big thumbs up!  Thank you Santa!  Would buy again and again.
B00004TFLB I love that there is an off switch, and it would be very difficult for a baby to turn it on.  My baby received this as a Christmas gift, and she likes it quite a bit, hence the second star.  But why, oh why, didn't they put a volume switch on this thing though?!My older children like to turn this on to play with their little sister, and it is ok for the first few minutes, but it is so darned LOUD, I'm practically loosing my mind.  I have to take it away, so what is the point of having a toy that gets forgotten about in a cupboard somewhere?As for good points, there are lots of colors obviously, and baby can choose just one instrument or the whole orchestra sha-bang.  The individual instruments don't REALLY sound authentic, but it was a nice try. The musical arrangement was a nice choice, too.  But please MUNCHKIN, for the sanity of future parents receiving this as a gift, put a volume control on it!!!If you are looking for a great gift for a parent, seriously considerPlayskool Busy Poppin' Pals (Colors May Vary), it's lasted through 3 kids, six years, and still going strong.  It's nice and quiet, too.
B00004TFLB I have read through some of the ridiculous low-star reviews and can't believe how anal people are.  This is a baby's toy for $20.  It's not a minature version of the New York Symphony stuffed into a $600 Bose music player, like some people are expecting.Since this is a child's toy, I think it's serves it's purpose well.  The music is clear.  The lights flash when the music plays.  I think it's neat that you can add or subtract musical instruments during the song that's playing so your baby can hear what each individual instrument sounds like.My daughter loves the toy.  It keeps her occupied for long periods of time and she's learning the names of each instrument and how they each sound both together in an orchestra and individually.The people who are expecting this to be something more than it is need to understand that the toy wasn't designed for their enjoyment.  The toy was designed for children.  And, in my opinion, it's an exceptional toy that will keep most children entertained which, in and of itself, is a blessing.
B00004TFLB Too loud. Too hard. Buttons don't depress easily or distinctly. My 6 month old has fallen headfirst onto the cube and has cut her forehead and chin and jaw on the hard(!) unpadded edges. The corners have sufficient covers but why not the edges between corners??? Buttons require too much strength to push for a 6 month old. She can sometimes manage it her feet if cube is braced against other object. Definitely NOT for under 1 year olds. Battery replacement requires screwdriver.Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube
B00004TFLB sound is good, the way the music evolves with diff instruments if you push them is nice, but is waaayy toooo heavy for baby to carry and to push!!
B00004TFLB This is the best purchase I have made thus far for my new grandchild.  She has loved it from the very beginning and her interaction with it as she grows is ever changing and stimulating. She has gone from just looking and listening to it, to pressing the buttons herself and chewing on the ends as a teether and has begun to select the music and instruments on her own. It is an incredibly well designed item and very sturdy as well.This is an excellent choice for a baby gift.
B00004TFLB Sturdy toy, fun to push all the buttons. Sings 8 diff Mozart tunes and lights up. No assembly required just open the box and turn it on.
B00004TFLB This music cube is a great idea, but unfortunately the sound quality is terrible. The violin doesn't sound at all like a violin. Overall it's very tinny and hard to listen to.
B00004TFLB I was a little skeptical at first.  But this cube is a lot of fun! There are instruments on each side that can be turned on and off while contributing to the main song.  You can have a piano solo, and then add other instruments on top.  Well built cube, should last a long time!
B00004TFLB This toy keeps my 4-month old's attention for a while - she really seems to like the flashing lights as the music plays.I only wish there was a volume button on it - it seems a bit loud to me (and if it seems loud to me wouldn't it seem loud to the baby as well?), and I wish it weren't quite so heavy.  It will be a long time before my baby will be able to turn the cube or pick it up, for now it just sits on the floor between her legs and she's able to hit the buttons that are facing up/out.
B00004TFLB Cute product. Bought it based upon favorable reviews. It's ok. My 9 months old daughter doesn't seem to like it much at all, but the product is really well made and plays cute music. Maybe she'll grow into it?
B00004TFLB My daughter loves this toy. She'll sit with her books and press the on the box for the pleasant tunes. My husband and I really enjoy the music. It's ten times better than the average music played by other baby toys.
B00004TFLB my son has special needs. he is blind and cognitive delays. this isn't nearly as annoying as most toys.  it only gets annoying bc he bangs on it for hours on end. he loves it
B00004TFLB I think a lot of kids these days have this toy. It's quite popular. All my friends with babies have it.It's a toy providing light entertainment.I'm a trained musician and I disagree with some reviews saying that the quality of the sound is poor. Trust me, for a toy it's totally fine. You can still tell the instruments apart. You can't expect your baby to become a little Mozart just by listening to this cube 5 minutes a day anyway.Everything seems to function well. It's safe. I'm not scared to turn away for 30 seconds. I know that there are no sharp edges and my baby won't hurt herself.I'm not sure this toy carries a lot of educational / developmental value but it's nice.
B00004TFLB Plays nice music that isnt to loud.  Item is smaller than I expected, but that is not a bad thing as it makes it easier for little ones to hold/carry.
B00004TFLB This toy definitely keeps my 7 month old entertained. The flashing lights are very attractive. Though I have to say, the sound quality is just so-so, but at least there is enough sounds/songs on there that it does not repeat very often and becomes annoying, so that's all that matters. I have to say the toy itself is a bit heavy. My son likes to grab hold of it while rolling around and sometimes he drops it on himself and cry...
B00004TFLB This is such a great toy.  I have to knock one star off for volume control, it is entirely too loud and as I can see this has been a complaint before I can't believe they haven't adjusted it.  There is no way to put tape over any place to quiet it down due to it's construction so we use it during loud times as opposed to &#34;quiet&#34; times.
B00004TFLB My 4 year old son spotted this toy while we were out shopping for my 4 month old daughter. He couldn't help but play with this in the store and I thought that since my baby loves music so much she would probably enjoy this. I was a little put off by the price. (I paid a bit more than it is here) but it was worth it! My daughter was totally fascinated by the flashing lights and music and I even found myself and my son playing with it together! I'm sure as she gets older, she will really enjoy how interactive it is. Such a cool toy. And the best part? Unlike many other toys that make noise, this one is not annoying at all! The instruments sound so realistic that it's enjoyable to listen to. I would recommend this and will probably give as a baby gift in the future.
B00004TFLB I hesitated to buy this after reading some of the reviews comparing it to the old Embryonics version. You see, I bought that version at a secondhand store back when my three-year-old was a baby. It was a great toy, but the battery compartment was hard to take off and put on without breaking it. One day we brought it to a friend's house, and someone else's kid somehow broke the battery cover in such a way that my attempts to fix it with super glue were futile. I went back to the secondhand store to find the other one I had seen on my initial visit, but I didn't find it. I was bummed because I had really liked it! I came to Amazon to discover that Munchkin now made the music box, but the reviews comparing the old one to the new one kept me from buying it.A little while ago, I decided I still really missed the toy, and I now had another baby who might enjoy it. Thus I bought it because I figured we could return it if it was really that bad.I honestly think that it is better than the old one! It has nicer colors, an improved battery compartment cover, and better synchronization of the instruments.The Embryonics version was purple and yellow and, in my opinion, kind of ugly. As you can see in the pictures, the Munchkin version is all different colors and visually appealing.The sound quality is just as good, and the batteries get used up a little more slowly in the Munchkin version. The battery compartment cover now has two screws (rather than a screw and a tab that put stress on the cover every time you had to put it back on) plus a pull-out box that contains the three batteries.On the Embryonics version, sometimes the instruments were out of sync. We had this problem from the start. It just seemed that one or two instruments were slightly behind the others. We've used our Munchkin version plenty but haven't yet run into this problem.I'm not sure why some other reviewers are knocking the sound quality (whether or not it's compared to the Embryonics version). This isn't an orchestra; it's a child's toy. It introduces them to some new music plus some musical instruments they might not encounter otherwise. Do the individual instruments sound like the real thing? Kind of. But again, it's a child's toy. The sound quality does tend to suffer as the batteries start to die, but that's to be expected. It gets quieter and flatter, like the instruments are slightly out of tune.I'm generally not a big fan of noise-making toys, especially ones that play music because the music tends to be very annoying. I don't find the music from this box annoying; in fact, it bothered me so little that I sought out this particular toy two years after throwing out the original, broken one.My only complaint is that I wish the box had a lower volume setting. The music can be a little loud, especially when it's got new batteries. That would probably help retain some battery life, too.Overall, my baby loves this toy, and my 3-year-old, who loved it as a baby, still loves it. They actually play with it together, which is rare. The older one recognizes the instruments and likes to show his younger brother what they are.Oh, and if you're like me and hesitated to buy this because it's supposedly crappy compared to the Embryonics version, fret not and just order it. You'll be glad you did, and if you disagree, pack it back up and return it.
B00004TFLB seems simple, but both my 6 month old and 3 year old enjoy playing with this toy. the sounds are also pleasant and not as annoying as most musical kids toys.
B00004TFLB My ten month old loves this toy. She is just learning to turn it over and press the different buttons to get the different sounds. It is quite heavy for her little arms though, so she does get frustrated at times. I find the music to be a little but too high-pitched for me, but it is better than many other musical toys we have had. Overall a great purchase.
B00004TFLB My daughter loves it and I love it too.Its a fun fun fun musical toy!!!Well built toy!!! The edges are carefully covered with smooth soft plastic. awesome buy!
B00004TFLB This seems like a great toy for the musically inclined baby, my 5 month old likes looking at the flashing lights and trying to eat it the music doesn't seem too loud to me or out of tune,  perhaps that is a defect for the previous reviewer?  My son seems to love looking at it and pushing the buttons, I think once he is a bit older he might appreciate it more.  However I do agree it is a great book shelf toy too.  IT looks fantastic!
B00004TFLB I got it for my 1 year old son.  He likes to push the buttons and listen to the music.  It's sturdy.  He's thrown it a few times already, and it bounced off the hardwood and still works fine.My only qualm with it is that it sounds like the batteries are dying.  Some of the music just isn't the greatest sounding.  Now, he doesn't care, but as a parent who gets to listen to this for seemingly hours when it's his toy of interest, it becomes grating.  I changed out the batteries and it sounded the same.  :-/Given that I know this, I also know that he loves playing with it, and that outweighs my feelings.  I'd get it again in a heartbeat if we ever lost this!
B00004TFLB This is one of my son's favorite toys. He's been watching/listening to it since he was born. Now that he's 5 months old, he's still very interested in it. Currently likes to kick the buttons with his feet and loves the music (as do I). This is a toy that will provide entertainment for months to come!
B00004TFLB Got this early on but the baby appreciates it more now that she is six months. Music is more pleasant to adult ears than most other musical toys. At least I think so.
B00004TFLB I purchased this toy for Christmas for my daughter who was 10 months old at the time and she loved it right away. She happily tapped on the large buttons to hear each instrument and stayed engaged for at least half an hour each time she played with it. Now at almost 16 months old, she has figured out how to play with it more, understanding that she can change the melody to each song and is just starting to realize with true understanding that she can add/remove an instrument to change the song to her liking. I find myself playing with this toy, as do many of my daughter's young playmates and their parents too! Some of her older cousins, who are 7-9yrs old also find enjoyment playing with this toy as well and this just proves the endless possibilities this toy provides as well as many years of extended play. So far, this toy has been dropped quite a bit and it still looks/functions as new as the day I purchased it.I'm also aware that this toy is what many have called a cheaper reproduction of the original that was out many years ago, but the product I received is pretty good too. The Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube is very engaging and while others have said the music sounds &#34;tinny&#34;, I didn't find that to be the case at all. I'm no music expert, but to my ears, each of the instrumental sounds is clear and pretty to me! I'm sure the original was really great but this one is pretty nice too. I suspect that maybe I received a newer model and the quality has been improved and if that's the case, I HIGHLY recommend the purchase of this toy. The instruments sound lovely, the songs are pleasant and will not annoy you as other toys do, and most of all, this toy is educational because it engages children to think and can be enjoyed for many, many years to come!

B00004TFLB My 9 month old has loved this toy for several months. He always grabs it first in a pile of toys and loves the music. It's great for adults too because it's classic tunes, not annoying like some of our other toys. This is in the top 3 toys of all time in our house and that's saying something.
B00004TFLB My son has this cube; i bought this as a gift for my sister's son...it is great. 6 decent songs and you can listen to individual instruments (and they only play their parts) or you can listen to the whole orchestra. Great for little ones that are learning \"cause and effect.\"
B00004TFLB Got this as a gift when baby was 5 months. He liked mouthing the somewhat soft corners and I played it for him. He now plays it himself (13 months). I do not think he gets he can turn off and on each instrument but I suppose that will come. The quality of music is very good, not mechanically computerized like some toys. It has five or so songs and you can turn off and on each instrument. That is pretty neat. Baby likes it. The only problem is that there is no volume control. Batteries last a pretty long time in it. The songs are nice too, jazzy and complex enough to be interesting. It seems really tough. It has withstood some hard knocks. It has a very solid feel, which worried me at first because I was afraid baby would hurt himself face-planting into it, but no injuries. The corners are rounded and slightly rubbery. It's kind of heavy so just now has baby really been able to haul it around.
B00004TFLB I bought this for my 9 mo. old daughter for christmas.I love this toy.  There is an orchestra button on one side that starts a song or switches to another song.  Each song is a classical music track.  When a song is in play you can push the other sides of the cube to add or subtract instruments.  I think this is a fantastic toy that will get toddlers thinking about music.The best part of this toy is quality of the toy.  It is clear that the programmers put a lot of thought into creating it.  The instruments definitely sound true to what they should be.  You can very clearly tell the difference between the sound of the french horn, flute, piano, harp, and violin.  Each of the instruments plays a different part of a song and each instrument is playing a part \"true\" to what the instrument does in a real orchestra.  What I mean by this is that in an orchestra, a tuba doesn't just sound different than a flute, they perform different musical functions.  I love that this cube respects this concept.  The result is that the music is worth listening to and I am always happy when my daughter plays with this toy over other toys with less-pleasing music.I highly recommend this toy.
B00004TFLB I bought this when my baby was less than a year old. He loved it. While it is not the highest quality music, this is a toy that was meant for children and they seem to really enjoy using it. It is easy for their uncoordinated hands to use and interesting enough that they continue to explore it. It has bright lights and different musical instruments to select from or to blend together.
B00004TFLB The coolest thing about this cube is that you can push the different sides to have that specific instrument play in the song. It's great for your kids learning to hear different songs. It also lights up and plays very nice classic type melodies vs the standard children's songs.
B00004TFLB baby got this at 3 monhs and still loves it after a year, so many ways to play with it and the sound is really fine! great buy, andone which travels with baby easily
B00004TFLB My six month old grandchild loves this even though she is still somewhat young to fully appreciate it. This is a great toy for infants and toddlers. Here is why:1. This cube stimulates touch, sight, and sound in a creative way. Each side of the cube has a different instrument and a different color: violin--yellow; harp--pink; french horn--orange; flute--purple; piano--green; orchestra--blue.2. When your child touches a side of the cube, it lights up and the instrument starts playing. Touch a second side, and the second instrument plays in sync with the first one (which is still playing), etc. If you want to hear everything at once, just hit the orchestra button.3. There are no sharp corners. Instead each corner is rounded and has yellow, purple, green and red colors.4. There is an easy on/off switch to conserve battery power when the cube is not in use.5. As the name indicates, the cube plays music from Mozart. I have read the most negative review complaining about the sound and that this cube is not as good as the original Embryonics cube. While I have not heard that cube, I have played Mozart pieces on the piano and also have CDs of various of his works, so I am familiar with his music. For a toddler the quality of the music on this cube is just fine, so don't let that negative review discourage you from buying this product.Bottom line: This is a well made quality toy.Update May 20, 2012: My now 16 month old granddaughter still loves to play with this.
B00004TFLB I really like this magic cube. Our toddler plays and dances to it a lot. The sounds it produces are really sharp and the music is great. We enjoy it.
B00004TFLB I bought this magic cube about 2-3 months ago and at that time my baby wasn't really able to play with it. But now he's 6 months and he plays with the cube longer and longer. This is one of my baby's favorite toys now!
B00004TFLB I had high hopes for this item based on other reviews, but it was a huge letdown.  It plays one tune with different instruments, and it is too loud for a baby.  With a music background, I really want to expose my son to beautiful, classical music.  This is not the item to do that with.  I will keep looking for other musical toys with more variety and sophistication.Update:  This is still my least favorite toy, mainly due to the volume.  I wish I could turn it down.  Thanks to a helpful comment, I did manage to play all the tunes and felt fairly silly not reading the directions beforehand.  I sill stick with my original rating, though.  There are just so many better toys out there.
B00004TFLB Our little one loves this toy and plays with it over and over again, starting at 4 months and still now (6.5 months).  I'm sure he doesn't grasp the concept of it yet, but the lights and music hold his interest.
B00004TFLB I only wish it had the real drum-snare sounds also added to it. This is a good buy. Recommend buying
B00004TFLB My five month old loves this product. She uses it to support herself while sitting up and explores the buttons with complete concentration. Considering most toys only hold her interest for 5-10 minutes, the 15-20 she gets out of this speaks for itself. The sounds of the instruments is artificial and tinny, but not so much so that I can't stand to hear it. My only complaint is that it is quite loud, I wish it came with the ability to adjust the volume. Recommended.
B00004TFLB Borning toy and my son was over it the minute he opened it up. Music is nice but the buttons are hard to press for a child so be ready to sit there doing it for them. Given the age that a kid outgrows this, you won't have much use for this very long.
B00004TFLB I always read reviews on this website and the Babies R Us site before buying a product. This product got great reviews so I bought it - I was not disappointed.I bought this for my son when he was about 4 months old. The music and flashing lights immediately captured his attention and, as he grew, he played with it more and more. I keep it in his playpen and it's easily his favorite toy (besides his exersaucer and jumperoo). It keeps him entertained longer than other toys.I like that it's easily washable and has soft rubber-like corners (so, if baby falls on it, no sharp or hard corners to scratch himself on).I also think the music is nice - nothing too annoying like a lot of toys out there. And, with the click of the \"Orchestra\" side, the song changes.So glad I bought this!Update 6/10: My son will be 12 months old this weekend and he STILL loves his Mozart Cube!
B00004TFLB Based on the myriad of reviews here, I purchased this toy when my triplets were several months old.  To be honest, they did not care for or notice it until they were closer to 8 or 9 months.  At that point, they realized they could start and stop the music by hitting at it.  All of a sudden, they took great interest in it.  It was also excellent when they were just learning to sit unassisted.  They could lean forward and balance on the cube while playing at the same time.Now that they have \"figured\" it out, the toy is a little less appealing.  I am waiting for the next enjoyment phase to kick in when they start noticing and playing with the different instruments.My only complaint, and it is a minor one, is that battery life is shorter than I would have expected.  While not bad, it seems to slow down more quickly than our other battery operated toys.
B00004TFLB I bought this for our grandson for his 1st  birthday. He loves music and he loves his magic cube. It is easy for him to push and he figured out that each side makes a different sound really quick. It is very sturdy and the music quality is good for a toy. I would recommend it.
B00004TFLB My 8 month old isn't too impressed with it.  It is nice and well made but just not for my kiddo.Personally I like the different instruments that play the songs.  Hopefully when he gets older he will appreciate it more.
B00004TFLB My kids enjoy this toy, however it's a little heavy and not easy to turn because the corners are mad of rubber and are a bit sticky on our wooden floor.  I do enjoy that the music is Mozart.
B00004TIHX I like this seat mostly because Elmo seems to have magical powers over little ones!  If your kid is like mine, however, and likes to sit on the potty \"unproductively\" you might want to consider something a little more comfortable.  The plastic frame that the cushion sits on has a rim around the inside.  While your child is sitting, the fairly cheaply made cushion settles down and your child's butt is now resting on the edge of the hard plastic.  Our daughter would always get up and complain about her butt hurting.  Depending on what kind of toilet seat you have, it also has a tendency to slip around.  I had to put some non-skid pads on the bottom so that it wouldn't fall into the toilet with a toddler's wiggling around.  You could end up with pinched fingers or a soaked tot.
B00004TIHX bought this as a replacement for my son's first potty seat, this one is much better. not as padded, which means it won't rip open and harbor a bunch of bacteria. my son's old one used to collect urine underneat of it in the plastic part, this one doesn't at all, it's perfect
B00004TIHX I really like this potty seat, but it doesn't quite fit well on our elongated toilet. It works well enough, and the colors aren't as bright as they appear in photo nor is the design exactly the same. It's o.k. for the price. My daughter really wanted a red potty seat, but if I could do it again I would buy her a different brand.
B00004TIHX We have an elongated toilet and I don't know of anyway to hold this seat in place. My daughter has trouble sitting back far enough because when she tries to scoot back, the whole seat goes with her. So when she pees, it gets in between the potty ring and the toilet seat and makes a big mess.
B00004TIHX Seat comes off the plastic handle-and-holder. Colors are nice and seat is soft and easy to clean. It is light and my 18-month-old can lift and place it (albeit not always with the right fit) on the toilet seat. Guard is useless in my mind since my LO can't climb over it, but otherwise a steal and saved me the trouble of getting a potty.
B00004TIHX I like the squishiness of the seat, but after my son has been sitting there a while (10 min.), the rigid plastic base still cuts a ridge into his legs (the seat squishes all the way down).  I think once he gets more efficient at using the seat this will improve.  The urine guard at the front is also a separate piece just tucked in between the seat and the base, so when my son climbs on, he sometimes knocks it out of place (doesn't guard well then).  I do like that it's a bendable rubber type material so it has some give when he scooches his behind over it.  My dad had to fashion a filler block out of styrofoam attached with packing tape to the back of the seat because our toilet is oval so this potty seat slides back when my son sits down.  The description said it works with round and oval seats.  This is true - it does fit - but slides to the back of the toilet opening so my son's feet don't reach the stool and he gets scared.  With the seat braced to the front it's fine.  Great, colorful graphics!
B00004TIHX We bought this potty seat to leave at her grandma's house,  and she loves it. She wouldnt go potty on the training potty for the longest time and as soon as we put this one on the big potty, she went #1 & #2 and is well on her way to being potty trained. I would put 6 stars if i could!
B00004TIHX It fits the toilet seat very well. It doesn't slide from side to side. Easy to use,it's light. Made in USA.
B00004TIHX This does fit on an elongated toilet seat, but it slides around. It wouldn't dump my kid in or anything, but the slipping might startle a child. I may see if I can find some sort of anti-slip stickers. I did not bother with the splash guard, I just threw it out. It looked flimsy and unnecessary. My daughter loves the SpongeBob theme. I'm not so fond of the vinyl seat, as my daughter's hiney sticks to it and is a little uncomfortable when she gets up. But, it's cheap enough and serves its purpose - allowing my daughter to sit on the big potty without falling in.
B00004TIHX We haven't officially started potty training yet, just slowly introducing it. My son loved the seat... until I put him on it. He walked around the house with it when we first got it, but as soon as I put it on the toilet and tried to sit him down on it, it was over. He hates it now. I have 2 complaints: 1.) I like that the cushion is removable, but it's a little TOO removable- they need to put velcro on the bottom or something (which I plan on doing if my son ever uses it), and 2.) I don't know if all our toilet seats are weird shaped or it's a design flaw, but I think there's way too much movement of the seat when it's on the toilet. Part of the problem with my son may be that he's scared of the potty seat's wiggle when it's on the toilet. Nonetheless, I ended up buying a Fisher Price potty seat that goes on the floor as well.
B00004TIHX I transitioned my daughter from the potty to the regular toilet.  I wanted something that would draw her attention to make her want to sit on it and this seat did it.  Day1 I thought she would be scared but she said &#34;Dora&#34;!  And sat on it with no fight.  Great seat!
B00004TIHX We have 3 of these (1st was a gift; subsequent others purchased from Amazon after successful use). It is comfy padding (I presume comfy - the padding is quite thick and has some squish to it). The handles are great for keeping my daughter's hands busy instead of touching other things. While it does slide around on some larger toilets, I'd say it fits well to about 75% of toilets we've used it on.
B00004TIHX I bought this from the wish list of a homeless shelter where I live. They have a number of children living there and I imagine many of them potty train while they are staying there. I know how much my nieces and nephews love Dora so I thought this would get used more than a plain potty seat.
B00004TIHX this is a good toilet ring, but ONLY if you have the smallest, round toilet seats.  the package blatantly lies in saying that it fits elongated seats - it will fit, but it'll also slide around and leave large gaps.  my home has a mix of elongated/round seats, and i found that the baby bjorn rung is the best for the larger bowls.  we use that for our elongated seats, and this ring for the tiny toilet that's in the hallway.  otherwise this ring - which can not be adjusted to fit - will slide around a lot and feel very unstable when you're trying to toilet train.
B00004TIHX The toilet set is nice.  Other reviewers had complained that it did not fit on their toilet seats but I have three different toilets and it works on all three.  It is a nice design and my son love that Thomas, Percy, & James are all on his potty seat.  The one problem is that it does not have a splash guard.  The packaging says it was supposed to have a splash guard and handle to hang on the toilet handle.  It did not come with either of these and when I contacted the seller she claimed they were not supposed to come with the seat.  According to the packaging and description they were!  My son was attached as soon as it saw it so I couldn't return it.  Check when you buy one of these.  If you have a boy you may not want to buy this unless it has the splash guard.
B00004TIHX My daughter liked the seat she had (Primo Ducka) but really wanted a seat with handles for pooping. This little seat seemed to fit the bill and was cheap enough that I didn't mind buying another seat.Yes, it \"fits\" elongated toilets. But there is nothing to keep it from sliding around on the longer toilet seat underneath it - no clamps, no pegs, no rubber feet, nothing! Every time my daughter tried to sit down, the seat would slide 4 inches backwards - landing her on the pee guard. If I start with the little seat as far back as possible, it's too far for her to get on without help (she's nearly 3!) and once on, her feet don't touch her fairly tall step stool. It needs to be at the front of the toilet seat but it won't stay there. So I have to be with her to hold it in place so she can climb on. Not a problem if you are starting out - you need to be with your child - but this is a problem if your child knows how to use the potty and wants to express her independence and \"do it herself\".Once she is sitting with the seat in the proper place, the biggest complaint starts. This thing collects pee. The little pee guard is pointless. From what I've seen pee guards are needed by some kids, not by others - regardless of sex. My daughter needs one - a decent one. This one just deflects her pee all over the seat, the floor, her pants, her shoes. In short, a drippy, nasty mess that has to be cleaned every time it is used with extra laundry. I shudder to think of the muck that is accumulating in the foam under the vinyl.She wanted one with handles. Fine. I've added two simple drawer pull knobs to our Primo Ducka potty seat. She's pleased. This piece of junk went in the trash.
B00004TIHX This potty seat fits the toilet fine, and seems comfortable to sit on. I think that the splash guard makes it a bit of a tight squeeze for my son to sit on the potty--we need to put him on carefully so as not to pinch anything. MIght be better suited for girls. We have a baby bjorn brand one for our downstairs toilet and it does not have the same issue.
B00004TIHX My son is almost 2.5 years old, and has been potty training for about a month.  We have two potty seats---one for upstairs, one for downstairs.  This one is decent--we have no problems with it fitting on our elongated toilet.However, be prepared to clean up pee if you use this with a boy!  He has to sit just right in order to aim down and not get pee on the seat--I don't think the pee guard is high enough for use with boys.  Also--if he 'aims' just right, pee gets under the seat, causing a mess on the regular toilet seat.  I have to clean both seats every time I take this one off for adult use.  It's easier for him to use it when he isn't wearing anything below the waist--he's better able to get his legs spread further apart for better support and aim.I think this would be better for girls--but someone has to get it right for boys!
B00004TIHX I bought this seat because I (bad mommy) forgot my 2 year old daughter's potty in a hotel while we were on vacation. She absolutely loves this potty seat! She loves that she can take it off and put it on another toilet if need be. She uses her little step stool to get up on the big potty and she feels like a big girl. The fact that is Dora is a huge bonus for her. She uses this every day.
B00004TIHX Really, how hard can it be to design one of these things? This fails for two basic reasons:1) It slides backwards on the toilet seat making it unstable and hard for my daughters to sit down. This is an enormous design flaw.2) The pee guard is basically flush with the seat, so what is its purpose other than to decrease the actual potty-business real estate? It takes away room for daughters' pee to go down. And it's not high enough to save my baby boy from getting soaked when my daughter didn't clamp her knees shut tightly enough to prevent her pee from shooting cleanly over the guard and onto baby's head. He was not pleased. Neither was I.I also have a two mini-potties, the Fisher Price froggy and singing ducky. The pee guard on the froggy potty is great. I love this low-tech seat as it's easy to clean and hands down my twin daughters' favorite. The singing duck potty was more expensive, is much harder to clean, is annoyingly loud and wakes up the baby, and there are a lot more spills due to the lack of pee guard. Highly recommend the froggy potty if you are in the market.
B00004TIHX Not good quality and didn't fit my toilet. I suppose its ok as a travel one if you need that.
B00004TIHX Another child to potty train and anything they are into to get them to go is where I head and this seems to do the trick. It holds up well and she seems to enjoy seeing Dora.
B00004TIHX I have a boy, so the little guard cup was useful until my son learned to pull it out. After sitting on the toilets for chunks of time (waiting :) he got bored so he would pull this out &#8212;not very helpful! I wish it was permanently attached to the seat. Other than that it's fantastic, soft, stable, easy to sit on and clean.
B00004TIHX I just started potty training my two year old son and I found the Thomas potty seat to be a great incentive. The seat is cushioned so it's nice and comfortable and it fits nicely on most seats. It's also compact enough to fit in the diaper bag if you want to take it on the go. For boys, it does come with a splash guard. The padded part of the seat lifts up and it gets inserted between the plastic and padding. It stays in place most of the time, but it is easy to misplace. I would have preferred it to be permanently attached, but aside from that I am happy with this purchase.
B00004TIHX These potty seats sit securely on the toilet.  They are soft and padded for little tushies.  My only gripe with them are the crevices underneath where crude stuff collects.  Hard as I try, the grime is still there.  I just can't get in there the clean them.  Were it not for this problem, this is a terrific seat and my kids both loved them.
B00004TIHX We had a seat SORT OF like this when my son was training - and lost it.  Not sure if it was the same manufacturer or not.  It had no handles then, and the pee guard stood up high and was removable.  We never used the pee guard, it made it harder to get on the seat and it just wasn't needed - we just taught my son to point it down.Now I am training twin girls and thinking Elmo might get one of them on the potty more (one shows way more interest than the other - it's the reluctant one I want to bribe)  We have little potties with inserts that come off but most parents know the power of Elmo - I'm willing to try anything at this point, within reason.  (ie the all-out free standing elmo potty is too much, LOL, and I want to take advantage of the fact that both are willing to use the big potty with an insert)The reviews about the pee guard on this were so puzzling I had to see it in person before buying it - and it looks TERRIBLE.  It's a very low pee guard.  Basically too low to serve any purpose for a boy, but it's there, and it's high enough that boy or girl I can see them peeing on it and making more of a mess than if it wasn't there.  (One of my girls likes to look down and kind of shift her stuff forward as she pees - not normally a problem, but with this in the way, it would be)  And it does not come off.  I actually stood there in the store contemplating if we could cut it out somehow, maybe with a dremmel, but you shouldn't have to make modifications to a potty ring.  It's one of the worst designs I can imagine.  It's like I can kind of see what they were thinking but they should have thought harder.  So I decided to skip this.  Even if we were to have marginal success with it, I am pregnant with another boy now, and I refuse to buy something I know he won't be able to use.I am really kicking myself for not replacing my son's potty ring when we lost it, but he was doing well enough without it and I never saw it becoming a hard to find item.  No handles made it easier to travel with.  We kept it in our diaper bag.  Now I am in the market for a used potty ring!
B00004TIHX A sticker on the packaging clearly stated that the potty material includes a known cancer causing agent. I sent it back to Amazon immediately. My daughter was very disappointed because she loves Dora!
B00004TIHX Purchased this for my Grandson to use at my house. Works very well and he really liked the Spiderman all over the potty. He used it and all is working well - I also bought the step stool (Thomas the Train logo on step stool).
B00004TIHX What can I say about a potty seat. It fits, his butt fits it, he likes the characters on it, it's easy to clean. Buy it.
B00004TIHX My daughter is having some hard time with potty training, especially number 2. The doctor recommended that she sits twice a day for ten minutes in a row in the potty, and we decided to buy this toilet seat.Well, two weeks using it and we are finally making progress!! She LOVES her Dora, super pink, flowery potty, so sitting on it is a delight. We were using the potty before, but I thought if we were going to train her for good, it was better to train her in the toilet. And it is very difficult without a toilet seat, because she is not stable.The handles are great, toddlers use them all the time. And the size is just right. Very sturdy and easy to clean (you can separate the cushion from the plastic, to clean separately). My toilet is not exactly the same shape (the potty seat is somewhat rounder), but it is sturdy enough so it is not a problem.We love it and I highly recommend it. There are other designs for boys as well, but the pink Dora one is great for girls this age.
B00004TIHX We got two of these for relatively cheap. In concept, it's great. We have one at our house and it fits all of the toilets (we have 2 toto toilets, one Kohler and one other brand (not sure which) and it fits fine). My in laws have one at their house that we leave there and their toilets are round seats (Kohler and American Standard). We've never had any fit problems.The problem is the design. Pee trickles between the plastic and the cushion and pools there. Even if you clean it regularly, it smells NASTY. If you forget to clean it, next time you pick it up, the nasty pee drips everywhere.I am in the process of ordering a different one so that I can get rid of this one. Gross.
B00004TIHX My nearly 2 year old son wants to use the potty, but has trouble with the splash guard/cup on this model.  He loves Elmo and wants to carry this seat around but will not use it.  We also bought the Primo Ducka.  He will sit on that seat all day if you let him.  This might be a good choice for parents of girls.
B00004TIHX Purchased this at Walmart for $12.  I was under the impression that it fit more securely such as clipped on at the handles.  It just rests in the hole of the toilet seat and slides around a bit.  When lifting my daughter off of the seat, her legs stick to it, it goes up with her and then falls back onto the toilet.  She isn't scared too much by that since it is lightweight, but I would think that to be terrifying for a 23 month old just starting to use a big, scary toilet.It seems comfortable enough and my daughter was willing to sit on it for about 5 minutes straight on the first try.  Since she loves Dora so much, she really liked this potty seat, however, I can see that being a problem:  I may find the potty seat in random places throughout the house since she'll want to play with it!  Something I hadn't thought of!Being as lightweight as it is, it's easy for myself or even my daughter (once she learns how) to put it on the toilet very easily.I really do not want a separate potty seat to have to clean so was looking for something like this.Overall, serves its purpose for the low price I paid for it.In hindsight, I would have just payed double this price for the BabyBjorn Toilet Trainer (29.99 with free shipping here on amazon.com!) that adjusts to fit ALL toilet seats snugly.  The reviews were raving on that one!Good luck fellow potty trainers!
B00004TIHX I ordered this product because it was advertised to have a built-in splash shield, which many don't. I specifically researched and looked for one with that for my little girl. It says it has one and the picture shows it. However, the actual product does not have one. I opened the package, thinking it might be inside the wrapping,but no, it wasn't. Now, I'm out $15 and still have to look for another one.Two days later: I am adding this note on and raising my rating from one star to four stars. After I wrote the above review, amazon contacted me within 24 hours and offered me a refund, even if I wanted to keep the item. I was so surprised by the generosity of that offer. Amazon once again has proved itself excellent in customer satisfaction and really checked the reviews to see if they could make the situation better. I really appreciate that and love amazon all the more for it. Thank you, amazon.
B00004W1UB This is colorful, soft, and makes lots of fun sounds babies love.  I would recommend it to anyone for their baby.
B00004W1UB I know the dimensions are listed, but for some reason I was surprised at how big/long the caterpillar is.  Because it is not like a big stuffed animal (long and thin) it was very easy for my 4 month old to hug and hold.  He can easily pull it to his mouth to bite on it.  He's almost 6 months now and can focus on one area or another...it is still big for him.  So I can see how for the next few months, he'll still be interested because it is big and he can do more and more with it.  my 2 year old niece visited and latched onto it and began imagination play.
B00004W1UB I think there was so much written about this that my head probably over rated it and now I'm discontent. My kids doesn't even look at it unless I'm on all fours like a dog and carrying it in my mouth. But, really, I don't think he's looking at the worm at all but thinking, &#34;Mommy has gone bow wow wow crazy.&#34; It's soft and not even cute. Just, it is. That's it. No magic, just what you see people. If what you see on the screen isn't making you scream and yell, it'll probably get the same reaction. You want more, prepare to crawl and bark.
B00004W1UB This little worm has been great for my little one. She loves that that head and tail rattle while she can squeeze the red and blue to get crinkle noises. The squeakers are two different pitches which is also fun. I just washed mine for the first time and aired it dry. Still works great. We are very happy with our purchase
B00004W1UB My child loves this toy so if it is good for them it is definitely worth 5 stars. On amazon the price is right as well.
B00004W1UB We received this product and our little one really likes all the colors and the squeaking noise but I'm not sure where the &#34;crinkle&#34; part comes from because our product must be defective.  There isn't any crinkle but we can live without.
B00004YMZE This gate was a replacement for the crappy Swing 'N Lock.  This gate is so easy to install.  The only problem was we have baseboards and couldn't use the template.  SO I simply measure 3 inches off the floor and then marked the holes to drill and folded the template to get the upper holes marked.  We did however have a lot of wall damage due to the fact that this was installed on the metal corner protectors under the drywall and a lot of the joint compound fell off due to disturbing it.  I will not fix it now since I'm sure I'll have more to fix later.  I like this gate because it has two point of contact in the locked and closed position.  Both rails the upper and lower fit about 1 1/2 inch into a metal seat.  This makes it so secure.  I don't agree w/ the other reviewers that said the lower rail pops out, I'm sure if it was installed WRONG.  Just make sure to measure properly and make sure things are even, level and line up and there is NO way the rail is going to pop out!  I did pinch myself a few times opening this the first few times.  You have to slide the rail in a bit to swing it and there's a metal piece on the top rail that supports the two gates, ouch.  Will remember not to do that!
B00004YMZE We purchased this gate almost 2 years ago when my daughter started crawling.  She's now 2 1/2 years old.  I've been meaning to write a review on this gate since it is one of the best gates for the stairs.  We have mounted it at the top of the stair.  My husband used small pieces of 2x4's for extra security to mount it on the side of the stairs that has plaster (as opposed to a wooden post).  This gate is very strong and is holding up very well (minus the fingerprints :).  A few times, I have caught my daughter standing at it shaking it or trying to stand on it, which I make her stop. Fortunately, there are no vertical bars, just horizontal, so climbing it would be a little difficult.  I'd done quite a bit of research on baby gates before purchasing this one at Babies R Us, but in trying to save a few dollars, I first went to Wal-Mart and bought a metal top-of-the-stairs gate, but I decided to take it back since it had a raised \"platform\" (for lack of a better word) piece at the bottom.  I think that platform was meant for extra sturdiness, but I saw it as an accident waiting to happen.  I returned that gate before we even installed it.  This gate doesn't have that \"platform\" and it is still very sturdy.  Another nice feature about this is that you can just slip the gate out of its brackets to remove it if you are having a party or have to run up and down the stairs without needing to swing the gate out of your way.  And when you are ready to put it back, just line the gate up with the brackets and slide it in place.  Really nice feature for us when we were moving our daughter's furniture from one room to the other and downstairs, we didn't have the gate in our way since we removed the swing arm.  Overall, we are very pleased and would buy this gate again if we had to.
B00004YMZE This gate could have easily been 5 stars, but there are a few points that need mention, where the gate needs some improvement.  If 'Evenflo' addresses these, this gate will easily merit a top score.  Let me start with the positives.  The gate itself is made of sturdy and aesthetically appealing wood.  It works well and looks great, IF the install goes well, and as EXACTLY specified (included paper template is great).  The mechanical 'lock latch' inspires confidence in that you can actually feel and hear it 'click into place', which gives one peace of mind.  Of course, one hopes that 'Evenflo' has determined this type of latch to be one that is not 'easily defeated' by the age group that it was manufactured/intended for (6 months to 2 years)!  Thankfully, it does seem like it is up to the task.  I also like the fact that the bottom latch receptacle allows for the gate to slide into, thus adding reinforcement to BOTH the top and bottom portions of this gate.  Way to go 'Evenflo'!  The negatives about the gate are as follows. In many typical installations, there will be baseboard molding/trim that may get in the way of installing the bottom-most latch receptacle. It did in my case, even after carefully measuring the proper clearance from the floor, as specified in the assembly directions.  Thus, I wasn't able to get the latch receptacle to clear the molding in order to screw in the bottom screw.  I had to thus cut (with a hacksaw) that portion of the latch receptacle, and 'modify' it for my installation.  I then was only able to use 1 screw (although a larger and longer one than provided), instead of 2, to install the bottom latch receptacle.  Thankfully, even just the modified 1 screw installation was very tight and secure going into the door jam wood.  'Evenflo' should provide the consumer with at least another type of bottom latch receptacle that allows for better clearance of molding near the floor.  Besides, MOST typical homes DO have some kind of baseboard molding, and mine was only 1/1/2\" high, hardly anything large.  Lastly, the assembly directions did not make clear which latch receptacle to use on the top, and which on the bottom.  They are NOT the same dimensions, as one is thicker than the other (top latch receptacle is thinner than the thicker bottom one).  Of course, the aforementioned 'latch receptacle' install challenge may not even apply to you for your installation, especially if you don't have floor baseboard molding.  In summation, this gate is STURDY and EXCELLENT, and a good value.  PLEASE, just make sure you do install it correctly (as per the instructions), and NEVER leave your baby alone unsupervised.  These gates are meant to be used WITH proper supervision, and never as a replacement for.
B00004YMZE My 18 month old cannot break this no matter how hard she tries. And she has broken pretty much everything else that she can get her hands on. It was very easy to install.  I drilled mine to the door posts because I didn't want to take any chances with my little one. My 7 year old niece couldn't figure out how to open this gate, much less the baby. Peace of mind without breaking the bank is what this provides you.
B00004YMZE We have this gate at the entry to the hallway, which is at an angle.  It keeps our 100 lb dog out of the cat litter, and it will keep our 6 mo old boy out, too, once he can crawl and walk.  It was easy to install, and it serves it's purpose perfectly!
B00004YMZE We have two of these gates and we couldn't be more pleased with them.  They took a little time to install (it was a snap the second time around), and they are as sturdy and secure as you can get.  We don't feel the slightest twinge of concern when our 1 year old leans against this gate at the top of the steps.  We know it's not going anywhere.  The gate is so simple to open and close.  A small child would not be able to do it on his or her own though.  The gate's design ensures that little climbers will not be able to get a lift.  We've tried lots of gates and this one is our favorite.
B00004YMZE I have four different gates in my house, and this, by far, is the most secure and stable. Therefore, it's at the top of my stairs... the most important place. I feel like I could even sit on that gate, and it's no going to budge.When we have guests over, they have trouble opening it, because you have to squeeze really hard, but I like that I have to squeeze really hard... it keeps my child who is now a clever 3.5 year old from being able to open it do this day.
B00004YMZE I hate this gate and quality is typical of evenflo. If I had noticed it was evenflo, I wouuld not have wasted my time. It was a pain to install. Total PAIN. Then, when it's unlocked, it slides for adjustment. The thing is, there is no way to stop it so baby sticks his arm through slates as you open and then you have a broken or badly bruised arm. We put a screw into the wood so it would slide just a little to help prevent that. IF we had known about the second risk, we would have just taken it down then. THe next morning, it was kid tested. Yeah, all the kid has to do is push the bottom and it comes out of the bracket causing the gate bend foreward. So far, I have seen my kids push it more than a foot out of position. MAJOR STRANGLATION HAZARD. Not to mention broken bones. The wood is so flimsy it just twist every which way.As far as function goes, when you go to unlock it, sometimes it will not unhook out of the slot. I have had to pratically hang on it to get it open. Also, the gate now leans. When opened, it leans to where a ball would roll for the from to the end of the gate. Not sure how that came about. We have had this gate for a couple of months. My son has been able to push it out since he started crawling. My 2 yrold can almost squeeze out by pushing on it which has lead to her getting stuck when I made a bathroom break. Not a good gate at all. Evenflo just needs to stop. Every product I have had has been crap. I am afraid to buy their carseats. If they can't make a good simple baby gate, I wouldn't trust my child's life to their carseats. We plan to replace within the next couple of paychecks.
B00004YMZE I actually love having this gate at the BOTTOM of our stairs!  My 15 month old daughter rarely climbs the stairs now, but we often have other children over that do.  With hard tile at the bottom of the stairs, a tumble would be bad.  I wanted a gate at the bottom of the stairs, but not an eyesore that was in the way all the time when not in use.We tried the soft and wide gate and another pressure-mounted gate, but those are a pain...  it takes a lot of time to get them in place securely (kids are rough and can knock or pull them down easily) and then if you want to go up the stairs once you have it in place, you have to climb over it all the time!  Not practical...What I love about this gate is that it slides right off of the hinges and stores away in the closet when not in use!  The wall-mounted parts are very small and hardly noticeable when the gate is stored away.  Then, when I need the gate, it takes less than a minute to get it out and slide it back into place.This gate is a life-saver for play group days!  I highly recommend this gate.
B00004YMZE We recently moved into a new house and bought and installed 3 of these gates. Within one week, our 13 month old broke two of the gates. Once by holding onto the rungs and shaking the gate the other time by grabbing one of the rungs when he tripped.Both times the rung popped right out breaking at the top and bottom. This left a gap in the rungs wide enough for our son to stick his head through which means he could get past the gate if we kept it up (which of course we didn't.)
B00004YMZE The Walk-Through Stair Gate is one of the less expensive gates I found when searching for a stair gate. I have been satisfied with the results, but it isn't the greatest quality. Installation was quite simple, and once the gate locks in it is quite secure. However, the unlatching mechanism for the gate can be tricky at times. My whole family has had problems opening the gate at one point or the other. Sometimes when it unlatches, it can pinch your fingers, and you have to get both the top and bottom of the gate in the correct angle, or else it won't open. The same problem arises when closing. You have to make sure the two openings are aligned, or else the gate won't lock properly. I find myself double checking constantly to make sure the top and bottom have both \"clicked\" into their respective spot because it doesn't always on first try. We purchased the First Years Hands Free gate for a different room (not a stairway) and it works GREAT. So simple, easy to install, and very secure. I have found that the metal gates work much better than the wood ones, not only from experience at my house, but at other friends as well. It is worth the money to invest in a better quality gate if you can afford it.
B00004YMZE We love this gate!  We purchased two, one for the top of the stairs and one for downstairs.  Let me tell you a few reasons why this will be the only baby gate we will buy.1.  You can take the gate part off when not needed, yet it is safe enough for the top of the stairs.2.  Even 5 year olds still cannot open it.  All other baby gates become useless as soon as the kids figure out how it works.3.  You can buy extra sets of hardware to move the gate around depending on the circumstances.4.  It's so cheap!These are just the top few reasons why we love this gate.  Give it a try.
B00004YMZE We currently live in housing on base in Germany and the stairs are very wide and unusual. I got this gate since it is made for the top of the stairs and was wide enough for our staircase. It works great! I love that it slides to the side as well as opens. Was a breeze to install and I feel really safe with the fact that it is a really great hardware mount. No complaints here my son is 10 months and pulls up on everything so it is nice to know he is safe! The one hand open is really simple and I like it more than any gate I have seen at friends houses.
B00004YMZE Update: 6-months later - the sliding mechanism has loosened up considerably with use.  It now slides smoothly without pinching our hands.  I've found the gate to be strong and secure - it has never weakened or popped out when my son tries to stand on it.  So, if you buy it, try rubbing some wax, or something, on it to help in the beginning, because it was pretty dangerous at first.  And also be aware that little hands can still get pinched in between the actual rungs when you're opening it. That will happen with any slotted, sliding gate.  Some further negatives I found is that the latch is loud, and it's also difficult for grandma to open and close because she has arthritis in her hands.  And with it being difficult for her to do, she tries repeatedly and the noise is very loud and annoying.  I'm always afraid she's going to wake the kids.  So, if you have your mom at your house a lot, get something easier.  It will save a lot of frustration - for both of you!-----I've had this installed for a little over a week and have seriously pinched my skin twice on it.  What happens is when you unlatch it, you first have to slide the gate in, then swing it out.  There are metal brackets that hold the two halves of the gate together, and in which the horizontal wooden bars slide along to extend and contract (look at the photo - you'll see what I mean).  The sliding movement is quite stiff and hard to do.  I'm sure with use it will loosen, or perhaps I can put some wax on there.  But when you're opening the gate in a rush, as I did today when we were hit with a sudden downpour and I needed to run upstairs to shut the windows, I put too much muscle into getting the darn thing to slide, and the outside of my hand got pinched beneath the metal bracket.  The first time I did this last week my older son woke up yelling for me and I wanted to get upstairs quickly before he woke the baby.  My hand got pinched under that metal part and I thought to myself that I need to be more careful. But busy parents like us don't have the time to stop and think about being careful when opening a gate.  When we've got screaming kids and rain coming through the windows, the last thing we should have to worry about is hurting ourselves on a SAFETY gate!! I dont' mean to beat a dead horse, but seriously, that's not good.  The pinch I got today was major painful - I've got a blood blister that's almost half an inch long!
B00004YMZE Our house is a front to back split. We have a lot of stairs. 5 openings to stairs! These gates have been great for my sanity. At first we bought a big playard gate that we opened up to cover two sets of stairs. I had to climb over that at least 100 times a day! Now we have these walk-through stair gates which are easy to use when holding the baby. Before we also had a gate that just expanded to fit the door way and was attached to walls. I was always concerned my daughter would fall down the steps if the gate gave way because she would pull herself up on it. These gates I know they are locked and they are much sturdier. I like that they slide back and forth; it's easier to get through entries.We used wood that matched our stair case so that we didn't have to drill into the post of our railing. I highly recommend this gate.
B00004YT3U I got this set for my 4 year old and he loves it. The dinosaurs are colorful and there are a lot of them to arrange on the little background. I am happy with the number and look of the dionos, trees and volcanoes. However I give it only 3 stars because the background is small and very flimsy, and the set really smells bad. Every time we open the box there is a very strong unpleasant plastic smell coming from inside the box. Not sure if it's the box it's-self or the contents.  I thought I would air it out a bit so I left the lid off over night, but when I entered the room in the morning the whole room smelled terrible from it. I really don't like the idea of my kid inhaling the fumes of some unknown plastic chemicals each time he opens the set so it now stays open and stored in the garage.  We play with them outside and they work fine for that.
B00004YT3U I bought this set for my almost 3-year old son.  He likes them okay, I'm thinking we'll get more play out of them later.  The mat is pretty small, but cute (it's just a plastic sheet), and the assortment of dinosaurs is adequate.  I like having a storage container for the set so I don't step on dinosaurs!
B00004YT3U I bought these for my 2 yr old for Easter, and he loves this set!  It's a great deal and comes with a ton of dinosaurs (and love that the name of the dinosaur is printed on the belly!).  The &#34;mat&#34; that it comes with is a cheesy piece of plastic and not to scale, and we rarely use it, but a great value just for all the dinos and the storage bin.
B00004YT3U Round about December 22nd, my three year old daughter started telling everyone she was asking Santa for a dinosaur for Christmas.  This was a surprise because A- she's the most feminine child ever, and B- I had long since finished my Christmas shopping and wasn't planning on buying another thing.  However, I didn't want her to lose faith in Santa and ended up searching Amazon to see what I could come up with.  This toy got my attention because it was a whole host of dinosaurs with a mat for them to &#34;play&#34; on.  My daughter loved it!  For weeks she would get it out on a daily basis to arrange the dinosaurs on their &#34;terrain.&#34;  From a girl's perspective, it's really cute in that there are small versions of the big dinosaurs included, so kids can group &#34;mommy&#34; dinosaurs with &#34;baby&#34; dinosaurs.  She doesn't get it out quite as often now that it's been a few months, but when she does she's every bit as delighted.  And the dinosaurs are such high quality, I know my ten month old son will be enjoying it in no time.
B00004YT3U So the container they come in is a little hard to open and close for small children but no less the fact that it comes in it's own organizational container is very pleasing.  The bottom of each of the dinosaurs states what dinosaur it is a model of. I use a set of flash cards with information about the dinosaurs in combination with these dinosaurs to teach my son while we play. These are nothing more than dinosaur figures but they are very accurate with no odd color combinations like purple with pink spots or something silly like that. They are made of hard durable plastic. I think they are slightly expensive for what they are you can buy similar products at the dollar store but those products like the educational value of these ones.  Overall, I would recommend these my son finds them fun to play with and they stimulate his imagination.  I only give them 4 stars because they are slightly expensive.
B00004YT3U Purchased for our 2 year old grandson and he loves the dinosaurs. He doesn't have much use for the plastic play mat or the rocks, but plays a lot with the dinos and trees!
B00004YT3U My son loves to play \"dino world\" just about every day!! The tub is great for storing the set & theres plenty of room for more things.  We keep a bunch of blocks and small cars in there to add tothe scene and creative play.  The mat it comes with is kind of a joke , lasting maybe one day.  But that's no reason to not buy this.Like others, we purchased thise elsewhere for MUCH less than the 60-something Amazon is currently selling it.
B00004YT3U 2 stars for bad marketing & items missing. We received as a gift, so our annoyance is probably moderated. This review is for product misrepresentation.-- Only received 1 out of 2 volcanoes.-- Image provided with the expressive boy in red shirt is completely misleading. There is no \"play mat,\" but rather a thin piece of rectangular plastic that is more like an over-size disposable place-mat. Only large enough for half the pieces. The scene is completely different from that image. The real image has none of the detail.-- \"Rocks\" are completely useless three-sided thin pieces of grey sides, thus no bottoms and sometimes missing a side altogether. Only received 10 out of 12, but not really missing them.Half the dinosaurs are very small (1-2 inches) and the other half are more medium range (3-6 inches). Some people commented of the usefulness of the names printed on the undersides, but we have encountered 2 other brands that provide the same labeling, so that appears to be a given with a variety pack.The use of the big names \"Animal Planet\" and \"Toy R Us\" should be a tip-off. Over-priced small dinosaurs, 6 trees, and a small plastic bin.
B00004YT3U Comes with 20 dinosaurs, 12 small rocks, a large volcano, a medium sized volcano, 6 trees, and a play mat. This set is great. I would prefer more dinosaurs and less rocks, but oh well. It is still great. My three and a half year old loves playing with this set. The play mat is actually pretty cheap, but my son doesn't seem to care. It is made of really thin plastic and doesn't stay open all the way since it has been folded. Once you put all the dinosaurs on it, though, it stays down just fine. All the rest of the stuff is high quality and the tub is great for keeping everything together. Just for size reference, the brachiosaurus is 6 1/2 inches tall, and this is the biggest dinosaur in the set. I'm really happy with the size of all the dinosaurs. I was worried that they were going to be kind of small, but they are a perfect size.
B00004YT3U The tub of dinosaurs and trees are pretty cool and abundant.  For some reason i thought the floor lay out jungle would be something more than cheap plastic similar to a disposable childs bib.
B00004YT3U As I am wtitng this review my 5 year old son just re-discovered this set, since I had it at the top of the closet. He can play hours with this great quality dinosaurs he got for his b-day. He had a few more, big and small ones that he just added to this set, so it is pretty amazing what he does when he's playing with all of them. The quality of the mat is awful, but you really don't need the mat for this set.
B00005610Y My daughter is now 7 months old and loves this. She started going in it about 3-4 months.  She is all over the house, and pushing the buttons. I would reccomend this to everyone with young children.  This is a lifesaver for me, I put her in it when I hop in the shower in the mornings and she stays in the bathroom rolling around in it, or just sitting there playing with all the buttons.. I love this walker!!!!
B00005610Y No complaints about this one.  Baby loves it.  We love it!
B00005610Y My son has used this walker sense he was 4 months old. We love it. Yes it is a little loud, but we taped some of thoughse cotton wipes from the hospital over the speaker and now it is perfect.
B00005610Y My daughter likes the sounds and interaction with the toy, but gets frustrated that she is \"trapped\" and can't roll easily on carpet.
B00005610Y as soon as my son was able to sit up this was his favorite thing to be in. he could spend HOURS in this. i could give him snacks by removing the activity piece and he could run around the entire house snacking.there are rubber stoppers on the bottom of this so that if you have stairs they cant go down them even if they tried. this was great for when he was outside with it. we have a concrete steps walkway and he couldnt go down it and hurt himself, something i was not expecting but very useful! my son learned to walk @ 1 so this did not delay him developely. also when he used this in the house he couldnt get into a lot of trouble with it(like touching outlets, opening cupboards) because he couldn't reach. this never frustrated him and i could get a lot done because i didnt have to watch him like a hawk.my son played with this till he was a little over 2 so we got a TON of miles out of it. he still found it fun at such an older age because he would get a running start in it, then lift his legs for fast back and fourth travel around the house. GREAT GREAT BUY! i dont know what i wouldve done without it!
B00005610Y This walker is great for tall babies like my son and the toys are enough to keep him busy.  The only issue I have with it is that the legs don't have a very strong system for holding the walker up on it's different levels.  It is made like an exersaucer rather than having \"x\" bars to go up and down, and one of the back legs won't stay in position.  While it could be an isolated issue, the plastic seems more flimsy than it should be.  Also, only the front wheels swivel which I didn't think was a big deal, but it does seem to hinder my son from going in any direction he wants at a given time.
B00005610Y My daughter is 12 months today. We have had this walker for 2-3 months. She still loves it. She has snack time in front of the TV in it and I am able to speed clean. OF COURSE, I wouldn't leave her alone in it. She is pretty active - not walking yet - but she loves to climb. I don't think she could ever climb out of it, but I'm not going to chance it.We haven't had any problems with it... safety or otherwise... I started to buy the mini mastreo walker but was turned off by some of the reviews. The main reason I bought this one is, reviews on that one were mostly displeased with how hard it was to turn. This one is very easy to turn. My girl spins in circles, even on the carpet and on our wood deck!Yes, it is bulky, but have you seen a walker that's not? They have to be so that they can't be tipped over! The only problem I have with it is... there is not a volume switch. It is not too loud, but when you've had a rough day and have a nice headache to prove it - keep them away from this toy!
B00005610Y The Tot Wheels Activity Center is a good walker for the money.  The price we found to be very comparable to other walkers.  We really didn't notice any pros or cons to this particular walker over others.The main problem that we've run into with both of our daughters is the fact that that they really enjoyed the toys for about 1 month at the maximum.  After that they got bored and soon started fussing to get out and roll around on the floor.Our first daughter used the walker part of it for almost a week before again getting tired of it as the fact is, something along these lines is just too tough for a little one to control by themselves.  If you can imagine pushing a shopping cart that wants to go it's own way that's the way it is with the walker.  It's too big and bulky for them to easily steer not to mention the fact that little ones often don't realize what steering is.  The only know walk forward and crawl away when they can't move forward anymore.  With that said, understand that you'll have to walk with them to help them steer.Overall I remain convinced that a walker is good for kids to have so they have something other than their parent to hold onto to learn to walk but be prepared to help them walk in it because of the above mentioned bulkiness of the walker and the fact that I've never come across any walker from any company that's been easy enough for a little one to steer and push at the same time.5 stars for the idea and the toys but I had to take 1 star away for the difficulty to steer and another star for the limited time that my daughters used it.
B00005610Y I did my research on a walker and decided on this one thankfully. The wheels move great. Very loose. If you get one and the wheels are tight, call Graco and have them replace it. It rolls well on carpet tile and pavement.I love the fact that it has the removeable noise making device with an ON/OFF switch. It takes 3 \"AA\" batteries. It can get dirty on the tray under the noise device too.My 4 mo. old son loves it. I love it. When I go to the gym, I throw it in the back of the truck. Then just take it out of the truck, put the boy in, and roll him right into the gym. He lets me run on the treadmill for an hour when he's in it. Very handy.
B00005610Y I recieved a similar model to this walker, one without the electronic tray, for my daughter.  My only complaint is the rear wheels are difficult to roll.  Unlike the front wheels, the rear wheels are fixed and therefore can only roll straight forward or backward, not side to side.  This sometimes made for difficult maneuvering for my daughter. Overall, it is not a bad walker and I do plan on using it for my next baby due in January only because I do not want to purchase another one.  I would not recommend it though.  There are better walkers out there.
B000056C86 As the mother of six grown children, I realize the importance of a playpen when babies start to explore their environment...we can't watch them every moment. I am now a grandmother who babysits for my daughter. I ordered this to use at my own home, and have had such a good experience with it that I ordered a second one for her to use at her house. The color is vibrant for lots of visual stimulation. The playpen is also a good size. Take it from this grandmother that this is definitely the best. 5 stars*****
B000056C86 Completely amazing play pen. Eazy to pack up and great for playing! We love the toys on the sides and the cool colors. It is a great size too.The only improvement I could even imagine would be more padding on the pad.
B000056C86 Good size (36 x 36), durable, sturdy.  Colorful and the little bugs on the mesh wall are a great interactive addition; that's a plus plus for me and the over riding reason why we got this specific playpen.
B000056C86 How FUN and AWESOME!!! Got this for my grandson and still can't get over how bright and playful this is. Even I want to get in it and play! The built in activities on the side are the best. The squeaker is a bit hard to press and sure you will have to do for baby...but the other toys are super! It was so so so simple to put up!!! Love the bigger size, while not being overwhelming...those smaller play yards just are too small to be used when you need them most...
B000056C86 I am so happy with this play yard.  When  I put my four month old down inside it he looked around then looked up at me and smiled, I kid you not.  The only complaint I have is that the description here on Amazon says that the play yard is 38x38.  However when the box arrived it indicated that it is only 36X36, still plenty of space though.  I only paid $49.00 because I have the Amazon credit card and get reward certificates to use towards products, so between that and the free shipping I got a GREAT BUY for a GREAT PRODUCT.  Thank you Amazon and Graco!
B000056C86 I bought it for my 4 month old son and he loves it. I had doubts regarding the big size but it has turned out the best of this because I feel I have him free but secure at the same time. Colors and decoration are fun and keeps my baby busy and happy.
B000056C86 I bought one for my God child who is 6mths old and she loves it.  I couldn't be happier;
B000056C86 I bought this playpen to use at my house when I babysit the grandkids. My 10 mo old grandson seems to like to play in it. It will keep him entertained for about 30 mins, which is enough to get dinner started or take care of his older brother. It's really colorful and large and I like the toys on the netting. He sleeps well in it too. Just a great playpen.
B000056C86 I came across this pack n play in Amazon after searching everywhere for a Pack N Play that would last my baby for at least the first year.Everything I saw at Babies R Us was too small, so I decided to take a chance on this one. I was extremely pleased when I received it.It came already assembled, looks beautiful and is big and very durable. Can't beat that.I hightly recommend it.
B000056C86 I did some research before buying this playard and I am very happy i did.  It is the most colorful out there, easy to assemble and travel with. My baby is very particular, but she loves this playard.  It may to be obvious at first, but each of the walls has a bug with some functions.  for instance, the butterfly has wings that have foil inside to make squishing sound when you touch the,m.  The other bug, when squeezed, makes a sound, the third one, has rattles in its wings, and finally, the sun is a mirror (not a great one though). Given its price and the fact that it is being discontinued, I highly recommend getting one before they are off the market.
B000056C86 I finally had to break down and replace my 9yr old playpen (that has been used by 4 children).  I was happy to find that Graco made a square playpen, not only the smaller rectangular Pack N Play.  It arrived today and my daughter loves the bugs and the soft playmat.  I'm happy that it folds up for travel and storage.  Amazon had the best price as well.
B000056C86 I give this a 5 start plus.My 6 month old Grandbaby  was put in this playpen yesterday for his first time.  It was obvious he really liked it by the big smiles and how his mind was preoccupied with the play items on the sides and bottom. It was a difficult first baby shots day and he was hurting on both legs. The graphics and sides toys kept him more focused on fun & he was able to get some temporary relief.  I know as he feels better he is going to enjoy his new & safe play space even more.Thank you Amazon for this colorful playpen choice at the lowest price and your excellent service. I'll positively be back.
B000056C86 I had a rectangular GRACO before, with all the bells and whistles, which I returned because the changing table couldn't hold the baby's weight. I bought this one and I am very happy. Baby is safe, has a lot of room to rollover and she loves to look at th bugs. It is just harder to find sheets but you can find them here at amazon. Easy to set up. I just wish it had wheels to move around the house.
B000056C86 I have a standard Graco pack and play that does not have much room. I bought this pack in play several months ago because of the bright colors. I love how much room it has compared to the standard size pack and plays.Like the other pack and plays this is easy to fold up and store against the wall. I hav to do so every night since I live in a smaller house and have a cat that might like to jump in it while we are sleeping and make it his new nap spot.The colors are vibrant and have kept my now 13 month old interested and intrigued. She loves to play with the butterfly wings and hit the squeaky toy. It is a generous size without taking up too much room on the floor. I like that there is more space for kids and their toys. She has fallen asleep in it many times.Not recommended but I have sat in it with her and it is very sturdy, It is very level.  I have had this for about 9 months now and it still looks like new. I think for the size it is highly recommended. I trust the Graco name too.
B000056C86 I have this playpen for about a month now but is still never used by my 6 month old baby. He cries whenever I put him in. I like it because it is huge and cute. What I do not like is that it lacks cushion. It is hard, not soft that I'm afraid when my baby rolls over, e would hurt himself. I am waiting for my baby to grow up a little more, may be he'll like it when he is already able to stand. I hope he would.
B000056C86 I love this nice, big playpen.  Lots of room to practice/learn crawling.  Lots of things to look at: primary colors and geometric shapes and things on the side to play with.  Mat wipes clean and doesn't absorb fluids (pee, drool, drinks; you just wipe them up, don't need to wait for mat to dry or anything).  It's very sturdy and easy to put together AND the latches latch very easily.  I think it's rated up to 30lbs (or when the child can climb out, of course).Potential drawbacks:-Takes up lots of floor space (worth it to me for the extra crawling room).-It has built in noise-making toys on walls: a crinkle wing butterfly & a rattle bumblebee. Neither are very loud, but still, they aren't detachable & might bother some people.  It also has a louder squeaky toy built into the ladybug on one side but I don't think a child could squeak it on their own; in fact my preschooler knows how and isn't strong enough to compress it enough to produce a squeak.  It has to be squeezed from both sides--so maybe if the ladybug was up against a wall the child could press the ladybug into the wall and squeak it, but that's easily solved by putting the ladybug facing out.-Mirror is up too high to be seen by a baby until the child can sit up on their own.-Once it's assembled it's not simple to move.  Apart from the four corner feet, there are four support feet (for a total of 8 feet) and no wheels on any of them. (But many of the wheeled playpens are so difficult to navigate that you don't move them much either.)-It's surprising how MUCH it stands out in a regular room--so big and so brightly colorful, it is not going to blend in to most adult decor AT ALL.  I think it also comes in black, though.  The black one may not have the noise-making built-ins, I'm not sure.None of the potential drawbacks bothered me much, but they were a bit of a surprise.  I'm still very happy--it's easy to assemble and is one of the bigger portable playpens available.  As a bonus it comes in a large box AKA \"toy\" for other youngsters. ;-)UPDATE:  We've been using it for 6 months now and LOVE IT!  We have an always moving one year old baby.  The high walls keep him from climbing out, the extra supporting legs handle it when he jumps, falls or flops down with all his might.  The built in toys on the walls are still in great shape (I'm still the only one who can make the ladybug squeak).  It is just so nice to have a play pen big enough for him to actually PLAY in.
B000056C86 I love this pack n' play.  I bought my son the pack n' play in rise n' shine with a bassinet.  What a waste.  This is the best pack n' play.  My mom bought one for her house and after I saw how much my son liked it I immediately went out and bought one for myself.  He loves the stuff on the sides and stares at the bright colors.  Also, it is a lot bigger than most of the other pack n' plays and will come in really handy for holding toys when my son gets a little older.  I definitely recommend this.
B000056C86 I'm a grandma and this is the shape of playpen that was in use when my children were babies except that they were a bit larger (about 42\" square play area vs the current 36\" square play area). I find this shape to be less confining than the usual playpens now available that are basically the same thing as putting the baby in a bed.Playpens weren't this cute back then, but every bit as handy. It is not only a perfectly safe and controlled area in which babies can learn to play and quietly make sense of their world, but it provides great peace of mind for parents and grandparents to be able to put the baby down in a safe place while talking on the phone or doing something that does not allow for hands-on and undivided supervision. This unit is well built, stable, portable, and easy to fold (once you get the hang of it, it's not exactly intuitive).How could it be better? I would like the padding to be a little bit thicker, I would like the play area to be a little bit larger (so two babies could play there comfortably, like in the \"old\" days), and I would like a removable and washable cover to the pad instead of having to make my own.But, this review is based on it being the best that is available now and it living up fully to the product description.
B000056C86 I ordered this for our 4 month old son and when it arrived I opened it up myself and didnt read the directions at first I got frustrated since I couldnt get it together then read them and voila it took me and a freind about 3 minutes to set it up! Our son is past the stage where he will stay put in a floor bouncy chair so he loves the freedom of lying in this stretching out,and kicking. We loved it so much we ordered one for my mother in law so she can have in her house when he comes to visit. He also takes naps in it, we are hoping to travel with a smaller version of this pack and play soon...will let you know how that works out.
B000056C86 I recently bought this for my 8 month old daughter after researching a lot of playpens online and talking to several of my mommy friends.  This exceeded my expectations for a travel crib.This is the perfect balance between being spacious enough for an active tot without taking up your entire living room.  I like that it is self contained (i.e. has a base that sits above the floor) and that it has some built-in toys.  It also is very easy to fold and unfold.  We bought a Graco Travel Lite portacrib for my daughter when she was three months old for traveling with and while it was great when we could use it as a bassinet, as soon as we put her down in the crib section she HATED it (tough \"mattress\", very small - but exceptionally light &lt;20 lbs).We usually stay somewhere that has a crib, but if we took a car trip I would definitely bring this with both for sleeping and playing.I agree with the other reviewers that I wish this came with a sheet (or that Graco even made a sheet for this).  That being said, it only took me about 10 minutes to make a fitted sheet for this on my sewing machine (it looks something like a large European pillow case).
B000056C86 I researched what I wanted in the way of a fun playpen for when my grandchildren visit. This is the one I chose, easy up and easy down and easy to put away, plus being fun for them is an added bonus. Thanks!
B000056C86 Just got this playpen a few days ago. It is awesome! Set it up without instructions in under 2 minutes, and I'm 6 months pregnant which makes some things a challenge. It's a very nice size and fits a good deal of toys, though if the room is small it does take up a lot of space. Baby loves the bug toys on the sides. She's just learning to sit on her own and I was very pleased to see when she fell back she did not cry - the floor pad is thick and soft so it cushioned her head. I like that because she did fall backwards once in her gym (placed on the carpet) and was very upset. With this I know if she falls back she won't get hurt. It's very colorful and she really seems to enjoy her time in it. Great purchase!
B000056C86 let me state at the onset that this pack n play was a little above my price range.  I was hoping to pay for something around $75 at the most.  I had a pack n play from graco with the changing table attached.  I basically have it solely for that purpose - the changing table. With the holidays coming and some overnight stays expected, I wanted one that was easy to put together and fold up and go QUICKLY.  I read numerous reviews on Amazon on several pack n plays.  I kept coming back to this one mostly b/c of the bright colors. I was basically sold when I read one review that stated a 14 year old put this together in less than a minute.  NOW THAT'S WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT!  I'm a single mom and have absolutely no patience for something that is complicated.  My mom and I put the graco pack n play with the changing table together and it was very difficult. I think it took over an hour to put together with another person.  The review I read was dead on.  I took the totbloc pack n play out of the box and had it together within 2 minutes.  My 9 month old baby loves it.  it is VERY ROOMY inside.  She has not slept in it yet since I only got it today.  The bottom is fairly quilted and I don't think she will have a problem with napping in it.  She loves the bugs on the 4 sides too.  The bright colors are great.  I'm sure we will be using this for a long time.
B000056C86 Love it!  Baby gets plenty of entertainment and the product is big enough for him to really move around.
B000056C86 Perfect, i love the fact it is bigger then the pack and plays but folds up just like a pack and play. Awesome toys!!!
B000056C86 Set up takes less than a minute and great as a portable playard. The toys on the sides are a lot of fun for baby. The colors are bright and cheerful. My 6 month old loves it. A little heavy to carry (I'm 5'2\") but still highly, highly recommended!
B000056C86 Still using this... its big and he doesn't mind going in it for me to shower. We also have used it to help him calm down, if he throws a fit we just sit him in with a toy and tell him when he is ready we will get out. Works well, just walk away and he calms down without an audience. Then we get back out, also when I tell him I want him to go in so I can take a shower he goes to it and waits to be put in. So he definately doesn't mind. He likes the toys in it too, wheres the baby (the mirror) was a favorite.
B000056C86 This blanket is wonderful.  I got it for my husband who is a Penn State grad and there is more than an attachment to his alma mater with this one.  The blanket is one of the thickest ones you can get, very durable, super soft, and extraordinarily warm.  I highly recommend it over the other Penn State blankets.  Basically look for the ones in the \"stripes series\" by Raschel.
B000056C86 We have used it only once to travel, it was easy to asemble, the parts seem to be of really good quality, the colors and decoration are nice. Our baby slept and played in it during our 3 day trip, I was able to move it around the house were we stayed with no problem. The mat seems to be a little thin but a couple of blankets wrapped around it made it seem much more comfortable to sleep in it. Because is larger than the average our baby was very comfortable and had plenty of room to move around, the downside is that it makes it a little heavy, not a big deal unless you're planning to hike mount Everest with it. Fits well in any SUV trunk leaving plenty of space for luggage. Disassembling it was a breeze and packing it was pretty straight forward. I'll recommend this product.
B000056C86 We love this playpen. The colors are great and the attached toys are engaging. It folds up and unfolds easily and the case that comes with it is really going to come in handy when we go on vacation. =)
B000056C86 When I was first looking for Playards I was becoming pretty dissapointed because all of them made it clear you could only use it with 1 baby. I was asking my Sister in law about it and she said both her kids still play in theirs and they were 2 & 5 years at the time. She said they are really rough in it at the same time and nothing is wrong with it at all. I think they just put the guidelines to be OVER safe.Anyhow, this was the biggest one and had so many good reviews I decided to get it. I actually bought mine used and it was like new. I took Clorox Spray anywhere and cleaned the mat, the bugs & the top rails. It wiped right off & the fabric wasn't even wet, it is sort of water resistant.I started putting both my twins in here before they could sit up on their own. I also always put extra toys in there for them which they love. I used to keep this set up in our living room but now we keep it in our van to use when we visit people. It is so easy to set up and tear down and my girls love playing in it. I think we'll be able to use this for a long time. Both my girls are 11 months old right now and can pull themselves up just enough to chew on the top rails.So if you're looking for something to use with twins, definately buy this. It is perfectly safe to use. I would not recomment the \"twin\" playard. It has the double on top but your babies will outgrow it pretty fast and then you're stuck with a pretty small playard for twins.
B000056C86 If I ever have to contain a potential bio-hazard, this is what I use.  Quick to set up and easy to put away or take with you, this little baby has enough room to give your baby some play space in the middle of the most hazardous locations.
B000056C86 I think this playpen is great; it's spacious, sturdy, and colorful. My 10 month old thinks it's a prison. She will tolerate it for about 10-15 minutes at a time, which is fine because it buys me some time where I don't have to worry about her safety. I first introduced her to the playpen when she was about 7 months old. I think she found all of the characters at the bottom to be frightening, but she was fine after I put the sheet on. I'd hoped she'd grow to spend more time in the playpen, but tolerates it less and less as she becomes more mobile.
B000056C86 This is a great for play.  I really like the built-in toys and bright colors.However, I bought it for our vacation as a place to play and sleep.  Unfortunately, the pad is somewhat uncomfortable and the sheets (must be purchased from company other than Graco) cause the pad to be a little lumpy.  My daughter would also wake up and want to play with the toys in the middle of the night and then had a hard time going back to sleep.Although I love the size of it, it is quite awkward to move around when open since it is heavy and large.Still worthy of 4 stars since it does what is says it will do.  I am happy with it.
B000056C86 We were quite excited to find this product - thought it was like the  type of playpen from 20 years ago to use for a child. There was no weight limit and the only height limit on the website was when the child was big enough to climb out - from both Amazon and from Graco, so it was perfect for our larger baby.Lots of disappointment when the package was opened and we discovered that is has the same limits (in the owner's manual) as the regular pack-n-play. Between when I ordered in and when it was delivered, the words PACK 'N PLAY were actually added to the title of it.Luckily, Amazon seems to be pretty good about taking it back, but we are quite disappointed.
B000056C86 We had to return this item because it was so big when opened.  There simply isn't enough space in an NYC apartment to fit such a large pack and play.Otherwise, it is a nice play yard with appealing colors that our daughter seemed to like.
B000056C86 It gives my 2 girls (1 & 2 years old) enough room to play when I need to keep them somewhere safe while I shower or cook. I use their other Graco Pack and Play as storage for their toys since it seems a little too small for 2 kids.Although the bright colors are fun for kids, I'd like to see more neutral versions of this so it doesn't stick out so much in my living room.
B000056C86 Fantastic product. Our child loves playing in this pack 'n play. Even if we don't put toys inside the walls are moderately entertaining for our child. The sun has a mirror (plastic kind that sort of warps images), the butterfly has crinkly wings (fabric with plastic inside for noise), another side has a bug with wings inside and the final side has a squeaker (which is really hard to use).It's all one piece so no &#34;assembly&#34; ever required. The sides are collapsible with the push of a button on each side. The ground mat that the child sits on servers as the exterior of the case that holds the pole-assembly together when folded up. And there's a light-plastic zipper bag with handle that serves as a carrying case. It packs up into a long rectangle, probably 1x1x8 feet.Pros:- Pack up or unpack in under a minute, no &#34;assembly&#34; required just set it and lock it into place like a collapsible baby stroller.- Sturdy build, child won't be able to tip it over and it would never fold on itself.- Soft but strong mesh walls that child can see through but can't stick fingers or small objects through mesh.Cons:- This is a minor complaint: the squeaker on one of the walls is impossible for a child to squeak - you have to press it from both sides of the wall because it's sewn so tightly- As a side-effect of the sturdiness it's very heavy. On the plus side of that, it is made of sturdy materials.
B000056C86 My husband and I like to just try to figure things out and read instructions only after we are dumbfounded. It was kind of funny for about 90 seconds, then we had to read the instructions, which, it turns out, work. The only tricky part is the release button being hidden inside the four top bars under the fabric. I kept trying to squeeze it but there is a button on the underside that has to be pushed up into the handle. This pack n' play feels plenty sturdy to me. It's nice that it has a carrying case with strap. We used this as a place to stash twin babies at home when they were too small for bouncy chairs and swings and such. They got their tummy time and social time in it, although the pad is a bit slick for them to try to push with their feet to turn over, so a towel helps. We also use it as a pack n' play when traveling for them to sleep in. I wish it was just a bit smaller when folded, as I thought it would fit on the floor of the passenger seat, but it has to go in the trunk.
B000056C86 Really the best product for the kid . Soft and hard enough at the same time. WOnderful colors, great toys ...Love it till every little bit of it.
B000056C86 I have been looking for the play yard that I had for my children. The other pack and plays are too small. I don't understand why they don't sell these in stores all the time. I live in Hawaii and have been trying to buy one of these for three years. No one would ship to Hawaii. When, I saw it on Amazon. I was amazed and decided to try to order it. I was really shocked as I was going through checkout. And, amazingly they were letting me order it. The shipping was really cheap. And, I ordered it on Sunday and received it on Wednesday. How, wonderful. My grandson was put in there immediately to see his reaction. He is only 6 months old and loved it. Thank You Amazon for having this wonderful product. And, of course shipping it to me. I am going to order one more. Just totally LOVE it.
B000056C86 I was able to pull this out of the box and put it together and less than a minute. It is very colorful and the toys are very cute. I have a 3 month old that is a little to small to play with them, but she like to lay in there and look around at the toys and the colors. The bottom pad is cushioned but not very much. I think it is soft enough for naps and play time though. My 8 month old played in there last night and scooted his bottom around in there and played with the toys for about an hour. This is a larger playpen that would be hard to move from room to room. IT is 3 feet by 3 feet w/ no wheels on the bottom. I have it set up in the corner of the living room where I will keep it. There is noting about this that I do not like. My only change would be to have a cover that was washable for the bottom, but luckily I do not have a baby that spits up.
B000056C86 I like this pack n play. The only problem I have is that the middle kind of sinks in so unless your baby is a highly experienced sitter, it is tough for them to balance b/c it's slanted in towards the center. But the colors are pleasing and I didn't know this but the animals/sun embroidered on all 4 sides have little attachements that the baby can play with when their in the pack n play. That was a nice little surprise. My daugter loves the little wings on the bee b/c they have little rattles in them and they make noise when she hits them.
B000056C86 My grandson thoroughly enjoys it, even though he is still very young.  He is fascinated with the decor, even the butterflies on the bottom.  My son and daughter-in-law are very pleased with its functionality and ease of set up.  A great place for my grandson to learn to exercise his limbs safely.
B000056C86 My baby loves to stay inside to play with bee and lady bug when she was small like 6 months old.Now she is 17 months old, sometimes I need to get things done so I put her in and give her some toys she still can play by herself, of course she sometimes complaints by yelling since she wants my attention, but I love this piece it helps me to get things done while she is in my sight, since I can fit this pc in my kitchen
B000056C86 I love, love, love this play pen, its money will spent, it roomy and colourful, would defin. recommend. it makes noises as well.
B000056C86 So babies love colorful things, no big surprise that she will love this play yard. But I've noticed that she does get a bit overstimulated with all the pictures on the bottom and her toys actually get lost on the mat because they blend in with it.Pros: it's easy to put together and take apart, it's relatively light, it's colorful, has built in toys, and is stable.Cons: the base of the play yard slopes inward, makes it hard for my baby to crawl and flip over and all her toys roll right into the center. I sort of fixed that by putting something under the center leg. The other negatives are that it's too colorful on the bottom and has too many pictures so the toys blend in. Also, it's not PVC, phthalate free. I emailed the company and asked them about chemical fire retardants. I don't know if anyone cares, but the foam mattress IS treated with chemicals - chlorinated tris. It was banned in baby clothes by the FDA, and is banned in Europe because it's cancerous. Since the cover of it is porous and is not waterproof, I feel like the chemical can easily get in my daughter's lungs, especially since she loves to suck on fabric. So I sent the yard back. I'll be buying a Joovy, they don't use chemical fire retardants. That was actually the biggest drawback for me.
B000056C86 Although this isn't the lightest thing to carry, it is very serviceable! Ever since I purchased this play pen for my grandson, it has been used every weekday. It goes up about 8 a.m. and down about 4:30 p.m. It still looks as new as the first time we used it. I like the netting one the sides and the padding on the floor and rail. Also, you don't have to be a rocket scientist to set it up or take it down. And, it is bigger than the beds that turn into play pens in the Graco line.
B000056C86 why do I love this play pan?  Very simple:1. Great quality material; sturdy and safe2. Large with lots of space (my grandson crawls around).  Can fit two kids!3. Very easy to assemble!3. Very colorful!  Bright beautiful colors.  My grandson looks at it and want to jump from my arms inside of the pan.4. The colorful patches around it are toys!The toys are:a) A beautiful butterfly with wings that when squeezed it make a dried plastic sound (he loves it)b) A lady bug that makes sounds alsoc) A sun with a mirror (safe for babies)d) A bee with playful wings, which also makes soundsI strongly recommend this play pan!  My daughter has another one, not Graco, that is half of the size.  It is nice but not eye catching like this one.It is worth every single penny!
B000056C86 As soon as I opened the box, I could tell by the VOC's that this playard was treated with chemicals.  I called Graco to confirm that it is indeed treated with fire retardants.  In addition, some of the characters on the side panels contain vinyl...like the entire face of the sun is PVC.  Why would you let your child play, let alone sleep in this toxic chemical stew.  I called Joovy about their Room2 Playard.  It's the same size but quite a bit more expensive. The representative told me it was not treated with fire retardants.  Definitely worth it to pay the extra $, knowing my children won't be exposed to harmful chemicals.
B000056C86 I bought this last summer for my two year old when traveling. He had outgrown his regular pack and play. I was looking for something larger but still had the sides. I found this on Amazon and decided to give it a try. I love this bed. It does take up some room but it was amazing when we were traveling. I did put down dome padding because the mat isn't that comfortable however I would definitely recommend.
B000056C86 Graco Tot Block with Bugs is a pack and play that features figures of bugs on each of the sides for added fun. Kids enjoy playing with the bugs and each offers something slightly different. The bee has its two wings extended inside of the playpen and the wings make a rattling noise when moved. The butterfly's wings are also extended inside the playpen and they offer the sound of paper being crinkled. The ladybug has a squeak toy inside its body to create its own unique sound and the sun has a mirror for a child's enjoyment. Each offers its own type of stimulation and since they are built in, they are always there. There is no need to worry that the toys will be lost.Besides the toys, the other reason kid's love the Graco Tot Block with Bugs is for its bright colors. Most playpens are dark blue or dark green in color and offer nothing that is visually appealing. This pack and play, however, offers combinations of bright yellow, green, red, and blue. Babies seem more entranced with this playpen than with the plain colored playpens. They like looking at the bright colors and playing with the interactive, built- in toys on the sides of the playpen.Like other pack and plays, Graco Tot Block folds up for easy storage. You need to remove the pad from the inside before you fold the unit because the pad acts as a cover for the rest of the playpen. Once you have the playpen folded, it slips inside of the pad using Velcro straps to secure it in place. Once the pad has been wrapped, the entire unit then slips into a plastic bag with a zipper to keep it shut. This is simple enough, but I have noticed that this pack and play weighs a little more than others and it is also a little more awkward to remove and set up. It helps to have a second person to open it up and prepare it for use. But this is only a minor inconvenience because it can still be set up with little effort.With all of the stimulation offered with this playpen, there is one possible disadvantage: It could keep your child from falling asleep. If your goal for buying this playpen is strictly to have a place for your youngster to play, then the added stimulation will be an asset. But if you want to place your child in the playpen for a quick nap, you might have some difficulty due to the attention- grabbing colors and interactive toys. These toys cannot be removed from the walls of the playpen so they could definitely create a distraction that could prevent some kids from falling asleep.Graco recommends this playpen for smaller kids up to approximately two years of age. If your child is older, then you should not use this playpen because he/she might be able to climb out. Most kids age two or under, however, will be small enough to use this playpen. Also, even though there is no defined limit for the number of kids who can play inside this device, I think it should be limited to two. Any more than two and the kids will begin to get frustrated with the constant bumping into each other.Overall, this is a very good pack and play from Graco and it ranks among my child's favorite playpens. The colors and interactive, built in toys make it a favorite among all kids and while it does weigh a little more than other pack and plays and does require more effort to unpack and set up, it still makes a good choice for parents of small children. The interactive toys can't get lost and the unit's bright colors make it appealing to children and adults alike.
B000056C86 I have three kids. The first two didn't need a playpen, but my 8 month old baby is the most adventurous yet. Everything goes into his mouth - dust bunnies, little scraps of paper my other two kids overlooked when they cleaned up after playing with paper, anything. I'm worried he will eventually find a little toy like a Squinkie, or something will fall off of a counter, and he will get it. He also pulls the kitchen chairs over on him, so we have them bungie corded to the table legs. Of course we will still give him supervised time to roam, but we needed him to have a safe place to go other than his excersaucer. Now that he crawls and cruises he is not content in his excersaucer for more than a couple of minutes. He would much rather play UNDER the excersaucer. We let him check out the playpen from the outside before we put him inside so he would be intrigued. So far he likes it. He is able to cruise in the playpen and gum the top rail. I purchased some new toys to put in it too so he will have something new to play with in there.Each of the sides has a toy on the mesh. I've checked out two of the sides. One crinkles when it is touched and another is a mirror. They seem to each have elements that are popular in baby toys.I also got another of the same playpen for my parents house. They have a dog that chews his toys (and the baby's) to bits. And their floor is not clean enough for a baby to crawl on.The playpen sets up and folds down just like the smaller Pack and Plays. It is essentially the same thing. It is a square as wide as the longest side of the Pack and Play.
B000056C86 Buy this Pack N Play!!  All pros and no cons on this.  It was so simple to assemble, it took only about 3 minutes from box to being put up, and some of that time was to remove the tags. Only three parts, just the frame, the folding padded floor, and the carrying bag.  It is roomy, has plenty of padding, and has 9 legs for a strong and even base.  It is great for sleeping away from home, and great for playtime, because there is enough room for baby to crawl around and sptill have plenty of room for toys in with him.  You can purchase sheets for sleeping, but you won't need extra padding or an extra mattress, it's soft enough. It's easily moved from room to room.I put a different pack N play together a few months ago from the same company and it was a nightmare!  In my opinion, this is the best on the market.
B000056C86 Be very careful using this play pen. My baby loves playing without shoes or socks on. He was plaing in the play pen wiggling his legs against the walls of the play pen. Apparently the walls in the play pen are made from a very rough netting and scrubbed the skin off my babies toes. At first I couldn't understand why he had blood on his toes but then we noticed blood lines on the white netting. From now on he is only allowed to play inside when his shoes are on.
B000056C86 The playpen is large and spacious,perfect for babies to roll around and play in. My only gripe is if the baby were to puke on the mat there's no way to wash the entire thing, just spot clean.  To solve this problem one has to buy a covering/sheet to cover the playpen surface.  Sheets are hard to find, and expensive to purchase and ship. But on a positive note the playpen is sturdy and easy to assemble.
B000056C86 Our family loves this product! We used it from infancy to over age one year. It was very easy to set up and assemble the first time. Directions very easy to follow and took only minutes to assemble. It has very easy to clean fabric. Just wipe it down. Baby loved the toys on each side of the play pen and also the colorful block pattern on the mat. The size and height of this product is just perfect. Large play area inside. This product has held up to alot of use for over a year and still looks new! It came with a reusable bag to store it in and make for easy carry in car. Also, we found no safety issues w/this product. I did alot of research before choosing this product and this one meets our high standards. I highly recommend it.
B000056C86 Overall I adore this playpen. It is bright, well made and sturdy but the reason I gave it 3 stars is that it has a terrible slope toward the center. Our baby tries to roll over and always rolls back into the center where it is low.  One time she rolled to the center placing her head lower than her feet.  This scared me so I feel we can only use it when we are sitting right beside the playpen watching her. January 2013.  We are still using this playpen and it has held up well.  Our daughter who is 16 months now still loves this and it has no damage after a full year of daily use.
B000056C86 it is a wonderful play pen. bright, safe, sturdy and soft at the same time. my son loves touching/looking at the pictures and shapes of the sun with mirror, butterfly with wings that make sounds when you touch them, the ladybug with rattle wings and a squicky ladybug. my son loves playing there and enjoys looking at the images even if he is out of the play pen. thank you, it is a great item!
B000056C86 LOVE this pack n play!! It is very large compared to standard pack n plays and the bright colors are refreshing rather than the normal drab colors.  There are toys built into the mesh walls which provide easy entertainment.  It's very easy to put up and take down.
B000056C86 I fancy myself a &#34;stylish&#34; mom; expensive nursery set, shopping at Restoration Hardware and Pottery Barn Baby. We got the black and grey pack 'n' play that goes well with our home decor, then my parents picked up this pack 'n' play for their home. Our daughter hated the pack 'n' play we had and loved theirs so we ended up getting one too. She loves the colors, and playing with the items on the sides. I love it because it is a square and much larger than the plain one we had. We HIGHLY recommend.
B000056C86 We love it. Great for the patio or when baby needs to be confined so gma can powder her nose. Keeps the dog and baby apart.
B000056C86 I can't express how much I love this play yard. My son has been using and playing in this since he was 5 months old and he is 15 months old now. The bright colors, designs, and toys caught his attention right away. When I put him in other play yards we have, he won't stay in it long and wants to come out right away, but when we put him in this play yard he is completely distracted and has fun playing in it with his other toys. There is a lot of space for him to move around and it is very sturdy. I also love how easy it is to set up and take down plus the carry bag makes it easier to bring when traveling back and forth to his grandma's house. I would definitely recommend this to anyone!
B000056C86 Just like so many other reviews, I highly recommend this Playard.  It is easy to set up and take down.  The bright colors are exciting for little ones.  It is a decent size and the quality seems fine, so it should last awhile.  I bought a sheet made to fit the square playard, so we can use it for resting too.  The bright colors can be a distraction if you intend to use it for napping.  For play time, it's great.
B000056C86 I love this product in all respects, except for the four paneled padded flooring.The design of it tends to not lay flat, once you put a sheet or a cover on it.This is a real flaw in the design.  AND, it is super important that you follow thedirections for putting this up, and be sure to use the velcro straps to securethe flooring pad in place.  Just get the help of another person to secure thevelcro straps, and you will be all set.  Otherwise, I do like the sturdiness of theside rails, and the bright primary colors.  Not the best for napping, as thebaby will continuously play with the built in side toys.  Some of the toysrattle and crinkle, and once baby finds the party, they will not want to laydown to nap.  But I still love this playyard so much, I bought two of them!
B000056C86 I am very thankful I chose this particular pack-n-play. I've seen the ones my friends have for their babies and I definitely got the best one!!! It also folds up easily and stores nicely. It is a little heavy, but they all are to me. It is sturdy and I think it will last. Sheets that fit this particular model are pricey, though, as it's not the average rectangular shape. Other than that, it is perfect! My daughter loves it and so do I!
B000056C86 I read all the reviews on the pack and plays and found that the reviews on this one were all great. I do not have a child but I watch my nephew very frequently (every other weekend). I wanted something that could be both a place to sleep and a place to play. With its bright colors and toys built in my nephews face turned to smiles. He is so comfortable that when he is done playing and tired he will put his head down to sleep. He loves the rattle butterfly and the crinkle butterfly. He plays with the toys on the pack n play more then the toys in the pack in play. Set up was a breeze. Before buying this pack n play we borrowed my brothers. What a pain to put together and take apart. Sometimes all the sides did not lock and you had to start all over. And take down, you prayed before you start that all the pieces snap apart and it will take you less then 20 minutes. With this pack n play it takes a minute, parts snap and unsnap quickly it is the true pack n play. The bag is a little cheaply made then other bags I've seen but fits perfectly. The padding on the bottom of the pack n play is thicker then others I have seen. It is larger then other pack n plays so you will have a hard time finding bedding and sheets that fit it properly.
B000056C86 This is large enough for a bigger baby which is why I bought it.  My daughter is long so it was perfect. I haven't had her in here during the day but I'm sure she'll love the cartoons printed.  I bought it as a second bed for when she's at her grandma's knowing that she'll be able to fit in it for a while.
B000056C86 I love this one..... it's bright ,comfortable, adorable ,easy to use. love the size and i use it all the time...my baby boy loves it too.Anyway I'm going to purchase it again for my newborn niece
B000056C86 This play pen is great in that it is so much more roomy then my childs standard size one. it has the great colors and added toys on it to keep him happy and busy.
B000056C86 If you're like me you may have gone back and forth between this Graco and the Delta (Novel) playard. I ended up buying them both for my twins and here is the comparison.Ease of setup--they both take about a minute to put up. The graco was slightly easier to push the middle down that pops it all I to place.Weight & sturdiness--the graco feels lighter than the Delta (a good 5 lbs+), but the Delta feels a bit sturdier when set up, and seems slightly more durable.Shape--the graco is very squared off, and the Delta is square on bottom but curves inward as it goes up so the top railings are in a more round shape. This feels like its saving some space even though the dimensions are the same.Mattress--the graco has a very bright, colorful mattress pad with squares and bugs on it. It has a decent thickness in terms of padding for the baby to be comfortable. The pad also lays flat, but you do get a slight dip in the middle after a baby has been in there for a while. The Delta has a colorful mattress pad but with 'gentler' tones of color featuring the animals on the mesh sides. The padding is not as thick feeling as the graco, but the pad itself is more water and stain proof of a material than the graco. Even though it's not as padded feeling it feels sturdier. No dip in the middle, and I would feel a bit more comfortable with more weight in the Delta.Mesh---they both seem to have equally durable mesh. The graco has built in toys on each side of the mesh; whereas the Delta has the animals printed on the mesh.Price--the graco is more expensive than the Delta.All in all they are both nice. I think the better one depends on what you are planning on using it for. If it's going to be up all the time at your house or daycare, etc. I think the Delta is built sturdier and will be more durable with continued daily use. If you are using it to bring around with you places (hotel, camping, on the back deck, grandma's, etc). then I would go for the Graco because it is much lighter to lug around, and has built in toys so if you forget to bring some there is still toys for baby to play with. The graco also seems sturdy and durable; the Delta just seems a bit better in those departments; that's all.The 3ft by 3ft size is amazing!!  Wish I had bought one sooner!  We have twins and they both can play in one together without them feeling like they are on top of each other.
B000056C86 This Play Yard is brightly colored which my son loves, it takes a bit of getting use to for breaking it down and putting it up. And i love how the mat in it is easy to clean. When my son spits up its very easy to wipe up off the mat it doesn't soak in. And we love how it has more room than most that are from the stores where we live.
B000056C86 I actually called up Graco to ask if the hard surface on the bottom was safe for a toddler to bump his head against as he's trying to walk & move around.  They seemed to think it was perfectly fine, but I don't feel good about leaving him unattended.  They should either have a more cushioned mat that comes with the pack & play or at least sell one that's optional.
B000056C86 My son comes to work with me and I keep him in here when he's active - sleepy. I've had it now for almost a year. What a great buy.
B000056C86 I purchased this square playpen for an 8 month and 18 month old (not at the same time of course).  I have purchased a few pack n plays rectangular and a few of these square playpens.  You would think they are the same, but they are not.  The pack n plays are great for naps, (I would say 18 months and younger), and easy to transport and some come with a bassinet for babies.  I have used those strictly for naps, as they are not that stable or large enough for play.  This square playpen is ideal!!!  It is so sturdy.  Easy to set up, take down.  Perfect for when you need to get something done.  It keeps those walking and crawling confined, but still gives plenty of space for them and a few of their toys.  The 18 month child seems perfectly content playing and falling asleep in it, whereas the pack n play, he hated it.  Couldn't stand up without falling down.Gives you the much needed break so you can get things done.  Since this is for short terms during the day and I give him some toys, he doesn't mind it.  Then I put him in a portable crib for sleeping.  In my honest opinion, the square playpen is much better for him and safer than the portable crib, but foster services states you have to have a crib, not playard for sleeping.  I feel much more comfortable having the child in the playpen than the crib.He also likes the bright colors.  It is a little heavier than the pack n plays rectangular.  It is not something I would take along where I had to carry it very far.  But it does pack up the same as the pack n plays, and you could transport it to a grandparents house, or babysitter, or the park.  Just a little heavier and larger than the pack n plays.  This has been a lifesaver!!  In my opinion, works better than using those portable plastic pens.  I tried that, didn't last long.  Wouldn't go back to that, and have no problems recommending these square playpens.The ones I purchased came with a thick padded mat.  It is very substantial and seems to work fine.  However, I guess you could add padding underneath if you needed to.This is perfect if you wanted something for a grandparents house, it could be used for play or sleeping and then easily stored away taking little room.  These square ones do not have wheels, so if you needed something really portable, you might want the rectangular.  If you are using for both play and sleep, I would suggest limiting the time the child is in the pen, so they see that as more of a rest area than confinement.
B000056C86 Highly recommend this to all parents with Infant and Toddlers. This is such a great playpen to have in your home as an alternative to the crib. My son loves to play in it and also sleep in his playpen which we put in the living room. We bought this together with some fitted pack n play (Graco Square Play Yard) from SheetWorld on Amazon (if anyone is interested) and the sheets totally fit the square pad that comes with the playpen. We also made an extra padding cushion so it would be comfortable for our son to sleep in. You can also fold this up nicely and make it compacted for traveling if need to. This is a great purchase! :) You will not dissapoint.
B000056C86 I saw this playpen and thought it was adorable, bright colored, and fun. But I already have another pack and play and I read it was big and cost 100 dollars so I placed it on my private wish list. Well, to my lovely surprise, my mother had also independently seen this playpen on Amazon and bought it for my little baby boy. It is truly awesome and my son loves it! What I love about it? Well.......it's so nicely colored, screams cuteness all over, and it's very easy to set up and take down. I also love how spacious it is and I have fun playing peek-a-boo with my little one too! They say mothers know best..... and in my case.... that was true! Buy it, you won't regret it.
B000056C86 Once my little one started crawling and the little snugabunny gym was no longer safe, my husband reminded me we got this at our baby shower. Baby likes the colors and all the noises, he has plenty of room to move around and he is safe in it. I love that it's made well and expect to use it for a while.
B000056C86 this playpen is just way too adorable!  its colorful there lots of stuff to look at and touch, it has a mirror, crinkly, squeaker and a rattle on the inside my daughter loves this great buy!
B000056C86 I love the size and sturdiness of it! Gives kids more play room than the average playpen. It also holds up well to our large baby playing wildly in it. She loves the various objects on the sides and the different noises and such they have to offer. We haven't traveled with it so can't comment on the transportability. The pad that comes with is not waterproof and even with a thick quilted cover under the sheet tinkle still leaks through to the pad so I suggest getting a plastic cover for under the sheet. Overall a great buy!
B000056C86 I LOVE these because they are really convenient and easy to use. We have it by our pool (baby gated) under the overhang so we can enjoy the pool and sun and yet have LO out there playing or asleep at the same time. It is very convenient. I do not like the cleaning issues. It is hard to clean and though it is billed &#34;PACK N PLAY&#34; like it is the &#34;umbrella stroller&#34; of play yards, it is hardly that easy to just fold and run.
B000056C86 I bought this for my granddaughter and another one for second child  well made hours of fun easy to use and love primary colors and designs on it  entertaining
B000056C86 I registered for this pack n play solely on the wonderful amazon reviews that I read. I wanted something larger for my baby to play in, and the Graco TotBloc definitely delivers.  That being said, this pack n play stinks as a napping or travel crib.  It's large, bulky, the foam bottom is thin and not very comfy for baby to sleep on, and there is no mattress option for a pack n play this size!  I took this on a trip last weekend and put the baby in there with a blanket on the bottom so she wasn't uncomfortable. Every time she rolled around, it would make the rattle toy attached to the walls of the pack n play move. It actually woke her up, and it was a long night. I wouldn't recommend this for anyone wanting this to double as a napping crib.If I had to do it all over again, I would have gone with the Joovy like I originally planned.
B000056C86 I'm an older mom (40+) who did a lot of babysitting as a teen and remembers what big, square playpens used to be like...not the cramped, rectangular things everyone has now. This spacious pack and play is wonderful! Our 10-month-old daughter loves it - we have it in our kitchen so we can set her in it for a few minutes while we use the stove or chop up food (cases where, for obvious reasons, we wouldn't want her underfoot). She can see us, we can talk with her, and she has plenty of room to practice pulling herself up and walking along the edges (and falling on her bum on the padded floor). When she was younger, she loved playing with the attached toys (especially the butterfly with the crinkly wings).It's sturdy, easy to set up and take down, and packs away neatly into its carrying case. An all-around great product!
B000056C86 This playyard is amazing! It's such a good deal for the money. It makes the other playyards look like a joke! Most other playyards are dark and the mesh is dark so your baby can't see out and therefore wants to get out asap. This playyard is really bright and gorgeous, and the mesh is clear so baby can see out. It looks inviting and fun to be in there! Also, other playyards are uncomfortable- no wonder your baby screams to get out- the floors aren't thick enough and the support bars can be felt through the floor. This playyard has a really thick, high-quality floor that is comfortable and baby could sleep on. Also, this playyard is really big- huge!- which makes it way nicer for baby. I am so glad I found this playyard online!
B000056C86 Amazing, adorable, colorful, safe, and giant!  Folds up easily and not too heavy to carry around if you want to take it.  The ideal playpen.
B000056C86 LOVE this pack n play. nice bright colors, great roomy size for bubs and an absolute breeze to set up and take down. takes literally 30 seconds! great value for money too. we were intitally given a second-hand one (used at our home business) and loved it so much we bought a second one for home.reason for only 4 stars - i just wish the floor had a little more padding. but after researching, this is the best play yard i could find.
B000056C86 Love this playpen. We put toys in there and our son love being in there. The toys that are attached to the playpen are great and our babie always tries to touch them. It's pretty spacious compared to typical other playpen
B000056C86 I have had this pack n' play for a few weeks now and my son seems to enjoy it.  We use it for quick corralling, not prolonged play time.  He likes the toys on the sides, and I like that it is larger than most of the play yards I've seen, granting that my experience is limited.-It goes up and down VERY easily and quickly.-It is not very heavy for the size and sturdiness.  My parents have a Cosco playyard that they borrowed from a friend for when we visit.  Theirs is about half the size and seems almost as heavy.-The square shape on the TotBloc is nice, too because he can move around a bit in there and actually get somewhere instead of just rolling over once and hitting the end.-There is no listed weight limit on this, only a height limit.  That was a major deciding factor for my big boy!Overall I think it's a great product for the price.
B000056C86 We got this for my baby when she was about 7 months and getting mobile so we needed somewhere to put her if we needed to do something without holding her.  It is the standard length of a traditional playpen, but the width is the same as well which gives babies much more space to crawl around in and play than the typical playard.  It is very simple to put up and take down.  My baby has only slept in it one night and it was fine for her.  It is very sturdy and the bottom mat has tabs that snap into the base of the frame for extra stability. The colors are bright which is good for the baby but doesn't exactly fit into my home decor. The sides each have a toy- a mirror, two rattle butterflies and one squeek lady bug.  The squeek is really hard to press so I often hold my hand on one side of the pen for stability and press on the other side but that is only an extra feature so I'm not really disappointed.  This is the most affordable by far of the larger size playpens and I'm very happy with my choice.
B000056C86 I bought this play yard to put my 8 month old in when I need to keep her contained and safe while I am cooking. It is perfect. The size is ideal as she is able to roll and move around it and play with her toys but does not take up all of the room in our small living area. The pad seems comfy and she will be able to nap in it. The toys on the sides are great, she loves to play with the butterfly. I am very happy with this product.
B000056C86 Hard to find a pack & play this large anymore and with the twins coming it will be great to have.
B000056C86 OMG....this play pen is a life saver. My son crawls around like crazy. When I'm in the kitchen cleaning up or fixing dinner I can't always be watching him so this is perfect. He hangs out and plays or stands up and (tries) to talk to me. I don't keep him in here for a long period of time because I feel that he needs to be a kid and crawl around too.  It's easy to pack up too. I took it to the park with me. I shoved it in the bottom of our UppaBaby Vista stroller. #NYCMom**KEY NOTE*** the middle part has to be up for the sides to bend down.
B000056C86 Superb!  It's a \"must have\".  She is able to play independently and you don't have to worry.
B000056C86 Very big and roomy. Folds and sets up with ease. My only complaint is that although you can remove the bottom pad, the cover on it is not removeable or water proof, so there is no way to wash it and feel like it's \"clean\". There are sheets for this square play yard to purchase separately, but they aren't all that cheap and sheets themselves are not waterproof. So if your baby soils through his diaper onto the mattress, or your toddler has a barf-fest, good luck trying to get that smell out. You can \"spot clean\" with a warm rag, but lets face it. Poop and puke requires the washer. And you're not able to do that with this pad.
B000056C86 Needed a safe fun place near my home office and this was perfect. Also plan to take it when we travel.Some features our 8 month old granddaughter find entertaining. Easy set up and seems sturdy, well constructed.Love Graco.
B000056C86 We bought it last week and it was so easy to set up - I only looked at the help on the back of the mat once when I could not figure out why the fourth rail would not lock - turned out they do not lock if the floor is all the way back. Pulling the center up just an inch allowed to lock it and the babe went in. He instantly loved it - he can see everyone through the mesh, he loves playing with wings of two butterflies (rattle and crinkle) and  tries to pick the smiley faces from the mat or kiss them. At 7,5 months old, he enjoys up to an hour  in it playing there on his own (he is not really crawling yet but learned to sit up on his own and can roll around it to reach toys and wings on the side panels. I read some reviews that the floor is not too even, but I did not notice it with mine.
B000056C86 I like it for the size and all the colors. Bugs on the sides are somewhat entertaining with rattles and squeaks.
B000056C86 I bought this for my nine month granddaughter when she comes to visit.  She loves it!  It's practical, sturdy and so easy to set up and take down.  The colors are bright and cheerful and the attached &#34;toys&#34; are so cute&#34;.
B000056C86 This is a great play space for our son! We have a sizable great room, which is child-proofed and gated off from the rest of the house. But once our son started crawling, we needed a safe place to put him while working in the kitchen. We had a regular pack-n-play, but it seemed cramped. This is perfect! It's roomy enough for him to spread out with a few books or toys, and entertain himself for long enough that we can put away groceries, cook a meal, or do a load of dishes. Everyone's happy!
B000056C86 I totally recommend this especially for big babies as well.  We took this  whenever we go on a trip and my son just loved staying here. Its mesh walls give nice breeze while my little one was sleeping. Totally recommend it!!!
B000056C86 Fantastic piece of baby gear!  Our 7-month-old loves the toys on the mesh walls, and he has plenty of space to scoot around.  We've found that the Carters jersey knit crib sheets can stretch to fit over the floor in this Pack 'N Play, which gives us the option of having a washable surface.  The bright colors don't exactly blend with our household decor, but we'll live.  So happy we made this purchase, and what a great price from Amazon!
B000056C86 Very cute and bright gender neutral play yard. Easy to put up and take down. Nice and roomy, she doesn't mind going in to play. Very sturdy. Will be handing down to my sister for her new baby. It is very durable and well made to last. Which is nice when something lasts and you can use for more then one baby.
B000056C86 I recently bought this for 7 month old daughter who is just starting to crawl. It the perfect thing to keep her amused for anywhere from 20minutes to an hour! It means I can go to the bathroom in peace and get some chores done knowing she is safe and amused.It is super easy to put together - it literally takes less than a minute - take out of the box - unfold it and it clicks into place. The pictures on the side are of good quality and my daughter likes to pull and play with them.We also have a weekend home - so bought two of these. I would guess this could also double as a crib for the weekend house - ie - for a night or two at a time.Highly recommend for the 7 - 10 month phase of baby's development.
B000056C86 Let me start by saying that this is very colorful and attractive to baby.  The base is also attractive with lots of colors for baby to 'discover'.There is a play thing on each side - crinkly butterfly, mirror, squeezy sound making ladybug, and rattly bee.  It's large - about 38in square so you'll need some room to place it.  The flipside is that baby has plenty of room to play.  You can store baby's toys in there and still they space to play.It has mesh sides for airflow and so that parents can see in and babies can see out.  It's relatively quick to fold away for travel due to a button on each top arm which 'folds' that side.  A very neat idea.  However, that's where the good stuff ends because there are two major flaws with this product.Why do manufactuers insist on producing fabric based items for a baby that cannot be WASHED ???  Why oh why do they not make the fabric removable - do they not know that kids make a MESS ???  Duh !!!  How is one supposed to remove spit-up and drool (and possibly worse!)?It's perhaps the most important thing in any piece of baby equipment; be it a chair, car seat, pushchair, crib, or playpen.  THE FABRIC SHOULD BE REMOVABLE FOR WASHING.The second issue is that the base pad is only about 3/4 in thick.  That in itself is not so much of an issue as the fact that when it's placed inside the playpen, it 'dips' in the middle - by about 1/2in.  The centre strut /leg that holds the pad sems to be lower than the other legs  causing a dip in the middle (and yes it's on a flat surface).  Although baby hasn't yet 'rolled' into the center, it's not very comforting knowing that the center is not flat.  Perhaps the pad should have been thicker - better yet the center leg should have been the same size as the others.For what we paid, I don't think it's worth the money - especially considering that the pad can't be cleaned without using chmical cleaners (which we don't intend to use around baby).
B000056C86 extra space, entertaining and fun! little over priced but it's safe and durable so we enjoyed it while it was needed.
B000056C86 I like that this has more room than the standard rectangular Graco Pack 'N Plays. It's easy to set up and works well.
B000056C86 I love this pack n play!  The other ones that are rectangular and fancier did not work for us (and they were twice the price).... It was the one with a changing table and bassinet.  I finally relented one day and bought this one because it was bigger, boxier and roomier. My son hates restraints and being boxed in, but he is much more okay with this larger pack n play, and is willing to stay in it for 20-30 minutes at a time (a record!).  And he is 2.5 now, so it will definitely last longer than the rectangular ones you see everywhere....
B000056C86 This was perfect for traveling when my child was under 2. She loved the decorations on it and she was able to play with them. It is larger than an average pack n play, which was nice when she slept.
B000056C86 This is a nice, large playpen with bright colors and activity items on the sides to entertain baby. The corners are perfect for a baby to learn to pull up to stand, and the sides are tall enough to keep the child safe inside.  (Apparently, the sides are also fun for teething babies to chew on, but what isn't?)  I have no tested the portability of the playpen since we use it daily in our living room when baby has quiet playtime before bed.
B000056C86 Bought this play-yard to be both a place for my 7-month old grandson to sleep during his visit as well as a temporary 'holding pen' for putting him down for a moment. He slept comfortably at night, and was fascinated by the butterfly and other adornments on the mesh walls of the play-yard when awake. I recommend this product. Its made well, easy enough to open and close, and definitely worked out well for me.
B000056C86 When my daughter started rolling, it was time for a little containment -- but Grandma bemoaned the fact that none of the standard play yards had as much space as the playpens of my childhood. (You remember, the massive wooden ones Moms would schlep from house to beach to park?) So looking for roomy containment plus the convenience of a portable play yard, there was only one viable candidate: the Graco PackNPlay Bugs. There's room enough for my 7-month-old and a hundred toys, it folds easily into its shoulder bag, cleans up in a snap and the price is great. Best of all, and unlike most play yards, it's FUN; my girl could spend an hour just batting at the colorful bugs on the walls (all make sounds) and floor or giggling at herself in the built-in mirror. And as a play space, it's a happy medium between a tiny play yard and a huge Superyard.
B000056C86 I was looking for something for my 7 month old daughter to keep her safe when I need to leave the room.  I wanted something large and that I could travel with for her to sleep in. I think for the price this is well made. The pad it comes with is good and the colors and extra toys on the side are fun for her.
B000056C86 We have this one and love it. My son typically doesn't like a pack and play or even to be in the crib too long. But, it is great for those days when they are small and you want to be outside at an outing and don't want to have to sit and hold your child all day. When my son was a little baby, we pulled out the mat and hooked up the toy dangler and he was amazed for hours. My son is now 14 months old and we recently took a 3 day vacation and took it along. We set it up in the hotel room and it worked perfectly. It also saved us the money of having to rent a crib at the hotel. He likes all the animals on the sides. Not to mention, what a dream to put up and take down. We have an older model pack and play and it is very hard to get the sides up and down. This one is so easy! Highly recommend.
B000056C86 After our son discovered yet another non-child-friendly item on the floor of our home and hoarded it in his mouth for hours (unbeknownst to us), my wife and I decided we wanted another prison--I mean \"play yard\"--for our son to roam around in because apparently we're terrible at the whole concept of baby-proofing.So I found this item on Amazon and, through my sleeplessness, thought the dimensions were 9' x 9'--sounded like a steal for $90.  We ordered this one and I was a bit dismayed when the box showed up and it turned out to be another pack n' play.  Like probably most other parents, we already have the obligatory pack n' play.  It's small and cozy and our son likes it fine.  I told my wife and she was more than a bit dismayed: another pack n' play she did not want.  (She also wondered how I thought the dimensions were 9' by 9', but that's another story.)Well, we could have returned it with the free returns, but after we got it set up and plopped our son it in, we were hooked and so was he.  Here's why it's ten times better than your average pack n' play:1.  The colors are so vibrant--reds, blue, green, yellow--as opposed to the muted colors you often see on a pack n' play.2.  Each wall of the pack n' play has a different feature: for instance, one wall has a ladybug that squeaks; another has a butterfly that moves and rustles; another has a bee that also moves and rustles; and another has a sun with a mirror on it.  Although the mirror is not the fanciest mirror I've ever seen, it keeps our budding narcissist fascinated for minutes at a time.3.  It's sturdier than any pack n' play I've seen, and the walls don't budge when he stands up in it, but it's also squishy enough to withstand falls.  I've seen my son fall plenty of times inside of it, and he hasn't seemed bothered.  Perhaps he caught his reflection on the way down.4.  Though not 9' x 9', it's bigger than any pack n' play I've ever seen.  (Note: I've heard this can cause problems if you're using it for sleep, because it can be harder to find sheets that fit, though apparently you can find people who make special square sheets instead of the standard rectangular sheets.)5.  Our son actually likes going in there, unlike his other pack n' play (or--god forbid--his North States Superyard play yard--you'd think we'd sent him to Guantanamo Bay).Overall, it really just looks like a fun, happy, and bright place to be in, and it's well made and looks like it will last for a while, and perhaps most importantly, our son doesn't fuss when we put him in there, and, to state the obvious, putting him in there keeps him away from the unmentionable hazards on the floors of our home.  So although I don't think you need TWO pack n' plays, I'm not too sad that I made the reading error and ordered this one by mistake, because this particular pack n' play is awesome.To sum it up, if you're going to buy one pack 'n play, buy this one, because it's the clear winner.
B000056HM5 This is a great product for both Non-breastfed and breastfed (suggest use after about a month so baby is used to nursing and milk supply is established) babies. This unique system works best for eliminating excessive air from the bottle therefore preventing excessive gas! The nipples are a little larger than some babies may prefer but are closer to the breast than most other bottles. Without a doubt my favorite bottle for our son and we will be sure to use it with our next child!
B000056HM5 I'm gonna start by saying I really love these bottles. They work great for me and my baby. She doesn't get all that gas she used to get with other bottles anymore and she seems very comfortable with the nipples. Plus the disposable liners make cleaning so much easier and faster. I love the way the cap compresses the nipple so you can be sure there will be no accidents while mixing formula, except for the orthodontic nipple which has the little hole on one side, but we don't really use that one, so it doesn't matter to us.That being said, I must warn you IT DOES NOT COME WITH THE EASY-FEED BOTTLE like the description says and that's the main reason I got this set, otherwise I would've gotten the prettier ones. Apparently they don't make the easy feed anymore.I still gave this bottles five stars cuz they're the best we've tried. Helped a lot with our little colicky baby and they are a blessing when it comes to cleaning. We have a zillion nipples and just a few bottles so we only replace the nipples on the nursers and we're good to go.
B000056HM5 These are one of only a few brands of bottles out there that has a variety of nipples so if your baby doesn't like one nipple, you can try the others.  Most other bottles only offer one nipple and if your baby doesn't like it, you have to buy a completely different set of bottles.These bottles are also interchangeable with the Playtex Premium bottles, so you can have a variety of colors and designs.Get an extra box of liners for each size.These are easy to clean, just toss the liner and wash the bottle in warm, soapy water.  Not scrubbing with a bottle brush to get the lump of formula out of the bottom.  :c)
B000056HM5 I like these bottles better than the Premium Nursers. Here's why:1. They don't break as easily when dropped (or thrown!)2. The caps are more streamlined and work for all different types of nipples. The clear domed caps on the Premiums don't work with the orthodontic nipple, and that's all I use.I would have rather received 2 of these sets instead of one of the Premium sets I got.
B000056HM5 Ok, my 3 yr. old shouldn't be drinking out of a bottle anymore BUT, I have really put these bottles to good use! I have a 1 1/2 yr. old and 3 yr. old still drinking out of these....they have a few quirks but you deal with them and get used to it and LOVE, LOVE , LOVE the ease of use! I do,however, wash the liners sometimes to re-use or I'd be in bankruptcy...Publix and Walmart and other stores have liners you can use when the Playtex gets to be too expensive!
B000056HM5 We used Playtex drop-in bottles and my son loved them. He was able to hold them by himself when he was three months old. We started with the slow flow nipple very early and he had nipple confusion. Later we moved on the Y-cut nipple which is great because it doesn't spill like the medium and fast flow.
B000056HM5 The drop in system is all we use for our daughter and I just love it. I will keep on using it and recommending it highly. So far we have not used the 8-oz bottles but maybe in the future. These nipples are far superior in my opinion because they're such a natural shape.
B000056HM5 I rated this 3 stars because while it has many good parts, I was highly disappointed to \"realize\" when my baby was 4 months old that this set does *not* include any medium flow nipples. We used the slow flow for several months, so those were useful, but the Fast flow were way too fast and we needed something in-between.  Low & behold I walk down the aisle in Target looking for an entirely new bottle system and I see medium nipples that work perfectly for my daughter.  For trying to offer a variety of nipple options, Playtex missed the mark in omitting the medium flow nipple.
B000056HM5 since my 1st child to my new grandson, I do not remember ever having a bottle be more easy on the stomach and prevent colic.Even my colicky babydid the very best when I used these. Nothing else has ever done better and these are less hassle in the cleaning area and while you have to keep buying the inserts,they are affordable,I bought the others but they are just ideasMD's helped develop, doesn't mean they work as well, 'cuz they don't!!!I'd go with Playtex every time.
B000056HM5 I like these smartly-designed bottles a lot.  They have reduced my son's colic and gas discomforts dramatically by reducing the amount of air he takes in while feeding.  My son is primarily breastfed, but my wife and I supplement his breastfeedings with pumped breastmilk and with formula.  The Original Nursers are made from polypropylene, which is a BPA-free plastic.  The liners are also BPA-free although I'm not sure what kind of plastic they are manufactured from.  Unlike some other corporations in the baby products industry, Playtex Baby is serious about customer support.  I have called the customer service number several times now and have gotten to talk to a knowledgeable person in every instance.  If you want to experiment with these bottles to see if they will work for you, I would suggest that you stop in at Target or Walmart.  They sell trial bottles for under $4 that come with either a latex or silicone nipple and 5 drop-in liners.  Unfortunately, the trial bottles that come with silicone nipples are the premium nursers, which are made from polycarbonate, a non-BPA-free plastic (this isn't necessarily a deal breaker for me because the milk never comes into contact with the polycarbonate).
B000056HM5 My 6 week old hated bottles until these came in. He had his choice of 5 nipples and likes the latex slow flow the best. Even my husband is able to feed him with ease (breastfed babies are picky!). I love how easily I can store unfinished breast milk. I recommend this to everyone. It would make a great Baby Shower present!
B000056HM5 I used these with my first daughter almost 7 years ago (although they were not BPA free back then...that was before it became a big deal I guess!)... and exclusively breastfed. I pumped my milk so dad could feed her when I was at work or college.  NEVER had any problem between bottlefeeding and breastfeeding - no nipple confusion, etc.  Gas wasn't a big problem either. They are so easy to clean - no scrubbing the bottle just drop in liners. Just have to clean the base/nipple/ring, but super easy and used to throw in the dishwasher.  Easy to store breastmilk in liners or bags and just pop them in the bottle after thawing. After 7 years could have still used my same bottles but opted to buy new ones because they were not BPA free.I also bought some AVENT bottles this time around - because that is the brand of pump I bought - and they are pretty good too. But these Playtex bottles are my go to bottle as they are SOOOO easy to clean and that is very important when you have a young, hungry, crying baby to take care of! :)
B000056HM5 Baby has had less gas and fussiness since we have been using these bottles.  Quick cleanup, quick fill up.  Love the nipple variety too.Because of the liners, it is easy to keep two of these bottles in use and not clutter up the kitchen with bottle pieces, etc.Would highly recommend.
B000056HM5 I was mistaken when I registered for these bottles... I thought I could use everything in the box for my baby when she was born.  However, I did not realize (being a new mom) that this was a sample kit with various nipples (one of each) for older and newer babies, teething babies, nipples that helped encourage latching of the breast and nipples that just plain resembled the breast.I actually would recommend that if you're a first time mom, register for this box and also pick out (seperately) two 4 oz bottles with 'slow-flow silicone' nipples for younger babies and two 4 oz bottles with 'slow-flow rubber' nipples for younger babies.First test the silicone on your little one and if your baby does not like it, does not latch on well or has a problem with silicone, try her on the rubber nipples.  After that, you'll know which nipples your baby will need and can purchase more *nipples* to go with the rest of the bottles in your kit.I would suggest you do not use the nipples that come with the kit at all... new babies should either be on silicone or rubber slow-flow nipples for younger babies.  Once you've found the typle of material he/she prefers - stick with it.  And around the age of 4-6 months, switch them to older baby nipples in that same material.Hope this review helps you!  Good luck with your little one.  :)
B000056HM5 My breastfed baby took very easily to these bottles. They're sturdy and durable. The only times I've had difficulties with leaking is when I've failed to properly use thePlaytex Drop-Ins Disposable Bottle Liners, 8 oz, 50 Liners. I wish Playtex wasn't phasing out these bottles because they feel much sturdier than their Premium counterparts.
B000056HM5 I've used these bottles since my sons were born.-I love the fact that they are extremely easy to clean and the liners are very convenient. (but are getting expensive.) I would use these bottles up until you need to make 8oz of formula. *If you use powder formula - the drop-in liners DO NOT hold 8oz of water and the formula you add to it!! I had a mess of formula everywhere!!!
B000056HM5 I'm so glad I chose the Playtex drop-ins system. It is so easy to use. I pump directly into the liners using the playtex storage set and freeze. Then I can just thaw and pop the liner onto the bottle holder and screw on the nipple. The selection of nipples was nice to have, though my guys would take any of them-he isn't picky. I haven't used the tall liners yet though, maybe that is more useful if you are formula feeding? For breastfeeding I recommend the pump and store set and you will be all ready to go!
B000056HM5 These are the only bottles I can get my son to take.  He hates the silicone nipples, so these are great alternative.
B000056HM5 Before I had my baby, I was thoroughly confused by all of the bottle options available. I started doing research & this one came highly recommended. Now I know why!!!! Hardly any cleaning!!!!! If you're not a complete germ phobe & not super messy while making the bottle, you rarely have to wash the bottles or rings. Just change out the drop in, wash the nipple & you're set. I've only had to wash the bottles or rings when I've accidentally gotten the formula on them. My only complaint is the \"leak proof\" lid. I only tried it once. Put the lid on the bottle & put the bottle in the outside side pocket of the diaper bag. Bag wasn't jostled or knocked around or anything & the bottle totally leaked. So, the \"leak proof\" tops are not leak proof. Still, I wouldn't use any other bottle.
B000056HM5 Great set, but you'll need more nipples. At least 2 out of the 5 are Fast Flow, which I didn't use until my baby was 8-9 months old. The nipples are like $4 for a 2pk, so add that to the cost when comparison shopping.Other than that, I love these bottles! I don't have a single complaint about them. I do not use a bottle warmer. They do leak in the diaper bag when not kept upright, but I store mine upright, so that's a non-issue.
B000056HM5 When I bought this system, I was concerned if it would be compatible with the pump I chose (Ameda Purely Yours Ultra).  The answer is - only if you also buy the Playtex Breast Milk Storage Kit.  The kit comes with the adapters that you need.With respect to the nipples that come with this set, our baby eventually got used to them, but it took a few days.
B000056HM5 I got these as a gift at my baby shower, so I haven't had a chance to use them until now. Since I'm breastfeeding, I don't use them on a regular basis, just for outings. You can't pump into these, which is a bit of a hassle, but it's not too bad. My problem with the bottle is that the bags don't stay in. The ring doesn't hold the bag in, so when I went to feed the baby, he ended up soaked. Needless to say, bottle feeding that day was a disaster. If the bag would stay in, I'd say I really liked these. Unfortunately, I haven't had one bag stay in yet...
B000056HM5 My daughter wasn't drinking out of the bottle. The laytex nipple was the only one shes takes. Its soft and is the most like a breast. But  I  didn't know why she wouldn't drink the bottle until I smelled the milk.  It had gone bad. So I learned that if you heat the milk ( not boil it) right after you pump then store it in good bags the milk stays fresh, and baby eats while i'm at work.  There is no better feeling for you (and grandma whos watching her)  when you know that shes happy while you are at work.
B000056HM5 I knew from the beginning that I would be using these bottles.  What I love is the convenience.  No bottle washing, just toss out the liner and wash the nipple.  It's especially nice when you're out and about or a long trip and cannot necessarily wash a bottle after use.  What's nice about this starter kit is that it comes with 5 different nipples of varying flows and types (latex and silicone) that I was able to try without having to purchase separately (this is good because of my complaint below).I also like the Playtex one step storage system that you can use with these bottles (refer to my review on Playtex one step storage kits: http://www.amazon.com/review/R1NSCK6EN7AYRA/ref=cm_cr_rdp_perm).  With the pump adapter that comes in the storage kits, you can pump directly into the liners.I do have a few complaints about these bottles, though:!) As I mentioned, it's nice that it came with all the different nipples because finding the best one to use with my baby was a chore and a half (refer to my reviews on the Playtex NaturaLatch slow flow latex, Playtex NaturaLatch slow flow silicone, and Playtex NaturaLatch Orthodontic Medium Flow).2) The clear liners make it difficult to see the exact amount that is in the liner if you are pumping directly into the liner, but you learn to estimate more or less.  When you're breastfeeding you have no clue the exact amount the baby is getting anyways.  If you're really anal, just pump into a regular bottle and transfer to drop-in liner.3) Although convenient, the disposable liners do create a lot of waste.  This would be my biggest complaint.Overall, happy with product because of the convenience.
B000056HM5 Not a bad price for all of the items included.  I wish they gave more nipples though.  They give several drop-in liners, 4 oz and 8 oz.  But for the price, its worth it.
B000056HM5 With all the rave reviews and my love for Playtex VentAir bottles, I was very excited about this bottle. Yet, both me and my baby hated it. First off, the bottle itself is huge, which makes it uncomfortable in many ways. Second, even the slow flow nipple somehow seems too fast and makes my baby choke on his milk. In any case, we used it a couple of times and went right back to VentAir. I would not recommend it.
B000056HM5 Last year, in preparation to our son's arrival, we bought several leading, what I will call \"bottle feeding systems\" (You are not buying just bottles, but also committing yourself to the accessories specific to that brand, so they are systems).  The ones we chose to try were:-Dr. Brown's BPA Free Polypropylene Natural Flow Wide Neck Bottle-Philips AVENT BPA Free Classic Bottles- ThesePlaytex, although in concept very appealing, we did not like because due to their design/material it is hard to get out all of the milk and so some of it always gets wasted.  Also, it is very challenging to measure out exact amounts as the numbers and gradations on the dropins is hard to see.  We stopped using these very quickly.  Although, if you are using formula that is less viscous than milk, these might be work much better.  Plus, Target sells a store version of dropins which a lot of people like, so that helps a lot with the price.Avent bottles are generally very good, and we ended up using them a lot.  Also, we purchased the ridiculesly overpricedPhilips AVENT BPA Free Standard Breast Pump Conversion Kitto be able to use the bottles withMedela Pump in Style Advanced Breast Pump.  The setup works great.  The main problem with the Avent bottles is that if you forget to put in the little ring, the milk will leak all over your child. With the ring in, we never had a leak. We have used both the larger and smaller bottles and nipples N-4, and the above comments apply to all variations.Dr. Brown's bottles are probably the best out of the three.  Like the Avent, we have used both the larger and smaller bottles and nipples 1-4.  With its design, it is harder to assemble the bottle without all the necessary pieces.  We have never had these bottles leak.  The complaints that they are hard to wash are unfounded.  We never had an issue with just throwing them in the dishwasher.  After about nine months of use, some of the markings are slightly coming off, not a big deal.  Also, the number of parts (6 vs Avent's 5 counting the lid) is not as overwhelming as some people on here claim.There seem to be no difference in any of the above bottles when it came to reducing gas.  All of them reduced some, but not all.  Likewise, our son had no preference in the nipples from one bottle to the next among these, although he absolutely hatedThe First Years 3 Pack Breastflow Bottle, so we only tried it once.If I had to pick only one of the above brands, it would be Dr. Brown's.
B000056HM5 We got this set at our shower and haven't needed any other bottles. My son started using them at about four weeks old and quickly outgrew the smaller bottles, but the set includes three larger ones, which is great. The only reason I give it four stars instead of five is that they don't include the medium flow nipples, just fast and slow. My baby was impatient with the slow flow and overwhelmed by the fast, so we had to purchase the medium ones separately. It's also a little irritating to have to keep buying the drop-in inserts, but it does cut down on the dishes.
B000056HM5 I have wasted so much milk using this drop-ins system.  I bought a box of the 4 ounce and a box of the 8 ounce liners, and in both boxes there have been multiple liners with holes in them and my milk has ended up all over my counter.  Any pumping mother knows that it is perfectly reasonable to cry over spilled breast milk, and believe me, I've done that many times.  I've tried to be good about pouring in just a little bit of milk so that if there is a hole, I'll only waste a little bit.  But, come on, I'm sleep deprived, and stressed and sometimes I forget, and I end up with 6 ounces of milk on my kitchen counter, and I shouldn't have to check like that for a product I've paid for.  No good.Out of a box of 100 liners, I would say about 1/4-1/3 have holes in them or leak.  That's quite a lot; we're not talking one or two here.  Unfortunately, I've invested in Playtex bottles and Playtex nipples, so now I have to spend even more money buying a whole new bottle feeding system because I cannot afford to spill breast milk every fourth time I go to fill up a bottle.  I'm extremely disappointed at having wasted so much money on this system and so much time pumping milk just to pour it on the kitchen counter.  I would NOT recommend.
B000056HM5 This particular starter set of Playtex Drop-Ins is a great place to start if you're looking for an economical way to sample a wide variety of nipple types and the Drop-Ins system as a whole. We did not need to purchase additional Drop-In bottles because of the quick and easy clean-up, although we did purchase extra nipples of the type our daughter preferred. We have used both the Playtex VentAire and Playtex Drop-In bottles for the past year as we switched between breastfeeding and bottle feeding with my daughter, who has just reached her first birthday. Of the two, Playtex VentAire has been my favorite bottle for transitioning between breastfeeding and bottle feeding, although neither has caused the dreaded \"nipple confusion.\" In both cases, we use the slow flow variety of nipple for each bottle type. This is how the two compare:1. The Drop-Ins win hands-down for convenient clean-up and are thus our favorite to travel with. Throw out the old liner, pop in a new one, fill it up, and you're ready to go - easy to do even in the backseat of a car with a crying baby. No bottle brush or hot, soapy water needed.2. The VentAire slow flow nipples are much slower than the Drop-In slow flow nipples, which we have found is preferable for a baby that is accustomed to breastfeeding (more control over the milk flow, and thus less gagging and spitting up).3. Once a baby learns how to hold the bottle themselves, we have discovered that the VentAire bottle with a slow flow nipple can be flung wildly around and does not leak. However, the Drop-Ins bottle with a slow flow nipple leaks everywhere when it is turned upside-down (and baby WILL turn it upside-down). This is less of an issue if there will be parental supervision.4. Our daughter can feed herself from both the VentAire and Drop-In bottles, but it is a bit easier for her to handle the VentAire. She can feed herself one-handed while sleep-eating with the VentAire by grasping the recessed bottle bottom and holding it straight up in the air. The Drop-In bottle requires her to use two hands due to the fact it is wider, and if she falls asleep, the bottle is dropped and leaks wherever it lands.Both the Playtex Drop-In and Playtex VentAire bottles are nice sets, and we have appreciated having both types to choose from to enjoy the perks of both. For convenience and fast clean-up, the Playtex Drop-In system wins. For fewer leaks and more baby autonomy, the Playtex VentAire bottles get our vote.
B000056HM5 Several weeks ago I left a 2 star review for these bottles due to the cost of always having to buy liners with twins...as you can see I have since changed my mind and deleted that review. Why? To avoid buying more liners and since my girls are now 13 months old, we bought some other bottles that don't use a liner. After having used ONLY Playtex Drop Ins for the 1st year and then using other types of bottles for around a month I am realizing how much not only myself but my girls LOVED the Playtex Drop Ins.The Playtex Nipples are definately what my girls prefer and are much easier for them. They normally finish their night time bottles but have not been finishing them since switching to different bottles. Also the new bottles have tons of air bubbles where the Playtex did NOT.The nipple size is also good for Preemie babies. When my girls were born they were too small to suckle on the breast and most bottles were too big for their tiny mouths. I do remember when my girls were under a month old we had some Advent bottles w/ silicone nipples someone had given us and I tried giving them to my girls once(the more bottles the merrier) but my girls HATED the nipples and they just seemed to big for their small mouths. I had to empty the Advent and pour them into the Playtex.And when I first wrote my 2 star review of these bottles because I hated the repeated cost of buying liners, that was also before I realized just how FANTASTICALLY WONDERFUL it is to be able to throw away the liner. Since we've bought these new bottles it seems all I ever do is wash bottles...and there have been MANY times when I forget I leave a bottle that had milk in the diaper bag or some other place and GROSS, what a stinky mess. Then I actually have to soak the bottles in bleach water to make sure they are clean. With the Playtex you simply throw away the stinky liner.So I am sorry Playtex Drop Ins that I ever doubted you & gave you a 2 star review. I guess this past month of Never-Ending Bottle washing & bleaching bottles has been my lesson learned. NEVER AGAIN will I use any other bottle besides Playtex Drop Ins. Except for water or juice, cheap bottles are fine for that.So save yourself time & money and just buy the Playtex Drop Ins ESPECIALLY if you have twins. It might cost more in liners but you'll be Thankful in the long run. My girls like the Playtex Latex nipples the best.You can buy store brand liners, we've used Walmart store brand and they work fine but Playtex are definately the best liner. Keep an eye out because the Playtex liners DO go on sale and then you can stock up. Make sure you have plenty on hand so you don't get stuck in the middle of the night w/out any liners. I also liked the bags but we only used them at first when I was pumping breast milk for my girls. You can use different brands of bags for these as well.
B000056HM5 I only used these with my first child, now 7 years old.  I am pregnant with my 2nd and with certainty, will use these again.  Why they are amazing:1.  The liners are so convenient.  You use them then throw them away.  No bottles to clean (build up of disgusting old milk, especially on those long trips outside in the spring/summer), and you don't need a lot of bottles, I had two of each (2 x 4 oz and 2 x 8 oz bottles).2.  After mixing the formula or using expressed breast milk, simply squeeze the liner from the bottom of the open-ended bottle and all the air is out!  This lessens the gas and projectile vomiting.3.  Many options of nipples and they are the only thing you need to wash/rinse/sterilize.A lot of my friends use Dr. Brown and they rave about it, but after I talk about the Platex system, they are sold.
B000056HM5 Let me start by saying this is a great concept. I purchased these bottles before my son, who is now 10 weeks old, was born. I planned to breastfeed exclusively. I planned to pump into these bottles. I even took a reviewers advice and got extra large bottles and short liners (which I wouldn't advise to anyone). I liked the idea of not needing to wash a million bottles. I didn't have a dishwasher at the time. (We now do... and maybe I would have stuck with these had that not been the case). I also have a psychotic cat that continually custom selected baby items from the dish drying rack. Drove me nuts.Nothing went to plan. I ended up supplementing my breast milk with formula after one month. My son eats a ton and these bottles don't really do well with formula.POWDERED FORMULAPowdered formula (which I can't stand) doesn't mix well in this bottle. Also, despite the wonderful design for keeping air out... you have to shake powdered formula. Thus, there's air in there and your baby will be gassy.LIQUID (RTF) FORMULAFormula is expensive. Pushing the air out of the bag is a GREAT concept. But when the bag exploded on me twice... I was upset. And reading reviews, I have to say I thought people were just pushing to quickly and clearly that would never happen to me. But it did. Twice. And with a screaming baby... it's really better to have bottles that are ready to go. (Even if prepared, you need to push air out of the bottle... and that takes time).BREASTMILKI don't pump enough to fill these bottles. Pumping takes a lot of time. So.. After I pump my four ounces, I don't want it to explode. And I don't want it to go bad from having so much exposure to air... And if I'm pumping, I'm not feeding my child right away. He eats all the time. Thus, I stopped \"expressing\" because it seemed to be a waste of time. Why pump into a bottle just to feed it to him right away? (I'm empty after I finish pumping). Now... in the first few weeks, my son killed my nipples. So, pumping into the bottle came in handy. The pump was much kinder. I didn't care if he destroyed silicone. (He didn't... but I'm just sayin'!).I had no problem with the lids on these bottles. I actually prefer these caps to the \"newer\" ones I found at Babies R Us (for a much higher price). The plastic is sturdy. I liked the silicone nipples because I could boil them (and now I can put them in the dishwasher). This brand is kind of wonderful because they make a variety of bottles and the nipples can be used with different bottles.I didn't hate the bottle enough to say you shouldn't try it. But I didn't like it enough to continue using it. You do not need \"extra\" exterior bottles. The set comes with enough. The comparison would be like buying a bunch of vaccuums for your vaccuum bags. Since you don't need to wash the exterior anyway... what you have is plenty.
B000056HM5 These bottles always worked out for my daughter. Easy cleanup with the bags, and less gas. She's down to just her night time bottle now.
B000056HM5 I bought these thinking they would be great.I was wrong. I give my baby breast milk and its just a hassle. I figured I would be saving time because I wouldn't have to clean a ton of bottles everyday. Well, you aren't able to heat the bottles with the liners in them so you have to get a container dirty anyway to warm the milk and then dump them back into the bottle. Plus you have to keep buying the drop-ins. If I'm going to have to clean bottles anyway I'd rather use a bottle that I can store milk in AND heat the milk in.These bottles dont keep air out. Even when I would squish all of the air out of the bag and put the lid on, by the time I went and got my baby and put a bib on her all of the air was back into the bottle. Also they are not good for on the go. There is nothing to protect the liner on the bottom so anything could puncture it making all of the milk leak out.I also dont think they are close to being like breast feeding at all
B000056HM5 Okay - I was one of those new moms who had no clue about which bottles of the many types to use for my baby.  I read all of the online reviews and decided I would get a couple of each type and try them all.  I have the Avent bottles, Dr. Brown's, Gerber, you name it, I have a ton of them.I exclusively breatfeed my baby and everyday he gets a bottle with his medicine in it along with the bottles I pump for when we will be somewhere that's difficult to breastfeed.  In my opinion, this system is HANDS-DOWN THE BEST.Here's what I like:The liners are sterile so you can always be sure your baby is drinking out of a clean bottle.Nothing to wash but the nipple and ring.  Its so quick and easy, especially when you are in a hurry or in the middle of the night when its harder to think straight.  When he's done, just toss the drop in and wash the nipple and you are ready for your next bottle.My baby didn't struggle with swallowing air using this bottle like the others I tried because you push the air out.  It worked much better for him than the Dr. Brown's bottles.  Using these, he didn't struggle with gas pains afterwards.He switched with no problems from a very early age between the breast and this bottle type.  It comes with various nipples to try and the breastfeeding nipple works great for him.Here is the only downside:You cannot pump directly into the liners - but that is not a big deal to me.  I pump into the Medela CSF bags and store those.  When I am ready to make a bottle, I pour it out of the CSF bag and into the liner.  It became routine and its not a problem for me to take that extra step.Good luck in making your choices about bottles for your baby but from a new mom whose tried them all, these really are the best all around.
B000056HM5 It's super convenient. Everything's light so they are easy to carry around as well. It's even better because the liner is recyclable.
B000056HM5 These bottles are fantastic in reducing gas.  My 5 week old has been using them since he was 1 week old and he has much less gas and spitting up when we use them as opposed to some other brands that we have tried.  I know these bottles have been around for a long time and now I understand why..they work.  I have found most of the new modern bottles to be all gimic and no substance.  The down side to these bottles is that you have to continually buy the bags which can get pricy.  It is also a little harder to travel with them because you have to bring the bottle, the bag, the water, and the formula all separate.  Futhermore, they don't come with caps for the nipples so you have to put your finger on the nipple to shake the formula and bag the nipple to travel with it.  I would tell anyone if they have been using Dr. Brown's, Avent, or any of the other super fancy feeding systems and their kids are still having problems with gas and spitting up, they should try these.
B000056HM5 This is a great set. The Playtex breast milk storage system is a VERY easy way to store breastmilk in the freezer, and works well with Medela pumps. I've pumped at work for about 2 months and it's gone pretty smoothly. I use a mix of these and Medela storage bottles.I especially like that the liners are BPA free.
B000056HM5 I love these bottles and I reccomend them to everyone I know. First off you drop in a liner and that means there is less to clean up, no scrubbing the inside of the bottle. Second after I put the cap on I pinch the nipple open and gently push up on the liner and all the air comes out. That means the bottle won't give the baby gas! I also used the natural action nipple which the baby loved. I was also able to wash the nipple, the bottle and the ring in the top rack of the disheasher in a speacial  nipple rack I bought at walmart for $5. No fuss and minimal clean up.
B000056HM5 My strictly bottle fed 11 month old has used these bottles from day one and has done fine with them. I saved money by buying them at thrift stores - about half of them I bought still in the boxes and the other half barely used. I ended up switching out the older nipple design (square top) with the newer nipples because I liked the design better. It seemed to me that the newer design is more correct for suckling. I also bought a lot of new boxes of liners at the thrift store too! My daughter suffered from mild gas, but nothing major. I liked these bottles because of the liner idea and my best friend had used them.I wish the nipples would have come in more than two stages though because when my daughter hit about 4 months, the slow flow were too slow and the fast flow were too fast. I ended up putting straight pins in the slow flow and boiling them with the pins in to open the holes a little more. It worked fine! The only time the bottle ever leaked was when I used the drop-in liners and that's because it wasn't seated right on the rim of the bottle. Many reviewers complained that the drop-ins don't hold a full 8 ozs. and they are correct. To solve this problem, I simply stuck with the standard liners and I don't buy the Playtex brand. I buy the Parent's Choice (PC) brand at Walmart. Another thing to be careful of is the measurements aren't always correct. I bought the Target brand 4 oz. liners and realized (after several bottles) that the 4 oz. mark on the liner was only 3 ozs. The PC liners are correct!All-in-all, I like these bottles but am getting tired of the liners. I am currently reading reviews of other bottles and considering switching with our next child. I'm really liking what I'm reading about the Dr. Brown's, but will possibly try a couple other brands as well. I'm realizing that saving tons of money isn't always what's best for my daughter. We'll see!
B000056HM8 These cloth diapers are reasonably priced and include a padded middle.  They should do the trick for those using cloth diapers.  They also work as burp cloths for those using disposable diapers.
B000056HM8 I bought these as burp cloths for my two boys.As burp cloths they are great - nothing fancy, just good at absorbing the spit up.  The fancy burp cloths are usually too flimsy (won't lay flat on your shoulder) and too thin to be helpful.  These stay in place without having to touch/fix it.I have tried them for cloth diapering but it seems they don't hold very well and leak more than the other diaper inserts I've used. I usually don't cloth diaper so I can't say too much on this - this is just from the few times I have used it.
B000056HM8 These burp clothes are extremely thin.  They are so gauzy that you can see through them, so they won't even work for a game of \"peek-a-boo\"!  These were not thick enough for me to use as a burp cloth, let alone the \"premium\" diaper it is touted to be.  These would not work in our house even as a dish cloth, let alone absorbing any type of baby mess!The only reason I didn't give only a single star is because Gerber was very nice about giving me a refund on these - they guarantee all their products.  I just don't think they described accurately what you are getting.  They are definitely not the diaper service quality, however, if you don't have 3 different levels of diapers to choose from at your local store, how would you even know that there were different grades of diapers when it says \"premium\" on the package?  They need to be more descriptive in their product packaging.  For burp cloths, I prefered the Kooshie baby brand which are very absorbant, very soft and durable as well.
B000056HM8 The cute, fancy little burp cloths on the market are no match for babies that spit up like mine do. These wash well, are absorbent, USUALLY cover enough of the shoulder/arm to prevent clothing from becoming a mess, and are very soft. We could not make it without these!
B000056HM8 I had these exact same burp clothes when I gave birth in 08 to my son so I figured with my second pregnancy I would buy them again big mistake they are made cheaper NOW you can see right through them I am going to have to fold them in half just so it will not go through on to my clothes I do not even think they will make it through a wash load what a disappointment they are worth maybe a dime each at best It is kinda hard to tell how thin they are unless you open the package I would suggest passing these up
B000056HM8 This is a great value pack and so soft and thick in the center panel which also makes them great burp cloths instead of using more expensive and also narrower and thinner cloths actually marketed for the burp cloths.
B000056HM8 Good diaper cloths! Been using it with my first born and now with my 1 month old baby.Will help you prevent diaper rash. Tiring to change everytime the baby wets the cloth though and time consuming to wash but worth it than having problems with diaper rash. It is really hard to use cloth diapers for the whole day so use cloth during day time and then disposable at night for longer sleep.
B000056HM8 Don't buy these if your looking for a pre-fold that will hold all of your childs waste in,and if you have a heavy wetter don't weven think about it without a doublerDiaper Doubler - Absorbency Booster - 2 Piece Set(these are nice) they are no wear near as absorbent as chinese prefolds, these make great claning clothgs and burp rags though. that's about all they are good for please spend the extra money on diaper service quality prefolds it will be worth it in the end.
B000056HM8 These are by far the BEST burp cloths around.  I got several different kinds at my baby shower.  I ordered these after reading the reviews because the ones I received at the shower were paper thin.  These are fabulous.  I buy them for every baby shower I go to now.  The middle panel is very thick and helps with a newborn that spits up a lot and those breastfeeding blunders that happen to a new mom.  I highly recommend them.  They are worth the money.
B000056HM8 I purchased these to make burp cloths. I washed them, then sewed fabric to the center piece to customize them. We used the burp cloths for months!
B000056HM8 I love these cloth diapers. I use them everyday to care for my newborn. I mostly use them as burp cloths and as extra protection for the changing pad during diaper changes. They wash up great. I would highly recommend these cloth diapers.
B000056HMB I used to work as a nanny while I was going to college and I am buying lot of baby products for my best friend (she was my &#34;student loan&#34; - and that's how I am paying her back... buying the baby products, anyway)... she know I had over 7+y of experience taking care of babies and the items I'm buying for her are things I used during my sitter years and I know they're practical and they work great.
B000056HMB I got 2 of these at my baby shower (one for upstairs and one for downstairs) and I absolutely love them! They steam pretty quick and I like how you can keep pre-measured water on it. When baby's hungry I just grab the bottle from the fridge, grab the little flask of water that's attached, pour it in, and press the button. I've had to warm bottles twice sometimes but it's still faster than warming water on the stove or running the bottle under the faucet. Oh, I only do 2 oz. bottles for now.
B000056HMB I have to say I have not been disappointed with this warmer, other than it should not be used with the Playtex inserts bottles (which is why it gets 4 stars) as it cannot sense the heat properly and makes them way too hot and doesn't shut off. My best advice? Read the directions! I was shocked at how little water it uses and thought I was reading it wrong. Do not use more water than the directions say for your bottle size! It is correct, and when followed it heats the bottle perfectly every time. All of the water disappeared and the light turns off when it's done. I honestly cannot understand how people could say they read the directions and it still didn't work, but hey that's just me. Definitely recommend! If you have the inserts, you can always use a plastic bottle and pour it in. A must have for when baby is home with daddy, grandma, or anyone else that doesn't have a ton of experience with properly heating a bottle (esp. breastmilk).
B000056HMB I have been using this product for almost 7 months and yes, its true the little cups DO NOT WORK for warming bottles, I tried them for 1 week until I started using my own cup and I just pour the water in and now I know about how long it will take to warm, works great for me. I never had a problem with scalding my baby's mouth because I always check the milk temperature on my hand BEFORE giving it to the baby. Overall, I live in a two-story house and this warmer is a lifesaver for those early am feedings, I definitely don't want to go downstairs to warm a bottle, the product works consistently if you figure out how much water you need.
B000056HMB My wife love this botles.Is for a better way of feeding our new born.I cant wait to use them.
B000056HMB I think this product was a waste of money our daughter will not wait for bottle to heat  up in this and its just easier and faster to make a fresh bottle.
B000056HMB Our nursery is on a different floor as the kitchen, so having this has been great for night feeding of twins. The little ice bottle is kind of lame, it really should be Blue Ice which stays frozen longer. Otherwise great product, easy to use, easy to clean.
B000056HMB I kept thinking I must be doing something wrong.  I'd read the directions again and try again.  Another, stinking, melted bottle!  And the milk would be scalding hot.  If it didn't melt the bottle, the milk would still be cold.  I also had a problem with my playtex ventaire bottles leaking from the bottom into the warmer.  Then I had the smell of burned formula in the kitchen.  Oh!  And it melted that bottle too!I'm going back to the old fashioned way.  I'm going to heat water in the microwave and let the bottle soak in it.  It is faster, less messy, and lots cheaper.  Don't waste your time and money.
B000056HMB This is an awesome product!  Once you get used to using this product, it is a huge timesaver.  It took us three tries to get the amount of water right so the bottle would be the right temperature (not too hot, not too cold).  Before going to bed every night, we put two bottles and the ice pack in the cooler section.  When the baby woke up, we transferred one bottle to the warmer.  It was usually done warming before we finished changing a diaper!  You may want to order an additional ice pack so you'll always have one ready in the freezer.  This bottle cooler/warmer makes it easier at night when you want to get back to sleep as soon as possible!
B000056HMB A dedicated steam warmer is definitely better than any other option such as a pan of water on the stove (takes too long) or the microwave (danger of uneven heating;  robs contents of nutrients).We have ours in a second-story nursery and have been pleased with it.  The only problem is that the results can be unpredictable - sometimes one capful of water will do the trick just fine, sometimes the bottle feels hot but the milk inside still cold, and sometimes it just goes to town and overheats the contents.  Nonetheless, I figure any heating process will be unpredictable, so I can't fault this model.The unit comes with adapters to hold any standard 4- or 9-oz. bottle;  we've used Avent with no problems.
B000056HMB I can't speak highly enough about this chiller/warmer.  Every night I know I will not have to go downstairs to get a bottle, warm it, and bring it back up while baby is crying.Now, all I do is take the bottle from the chill compartment (complete with ice pack), and place it, with a capful of premeasured water, in the warming compartment and hit a button.While I change baby's diaper, the bottle is warming, and I am ready to go.  This equipment has been a godsend.  Actually, I can't think of any equipment that I could live without less.No complaints whatsoever about this great bottle warmer.
B000056HMB We have tried many bottle warmers and this is the one we currently use. I liked it because it had a section to keep bottles cold as well. This feature sounds good, but in real life, doesn't work as well as it sounds.The bottle warmer works ok but the heating action is inconsistent even if you get the water level on the meniscus the same everytime. This isn't good for breast milk. Also the heating plate accumulates gunk from time to time.It includes a jar food holder to heat food, but we have never tried it.All in all a decent bottle warmer, but you have have to compensate with a re-heat or cold water sometimes.
B000056HMB This is a lifesaver for late night feelings. We just pop a bottle or two in the cooler before bed, and within 5 minutes of baby waking in the middle of the night bottle is ready to go. We keep in it in the bedroom so we don't have to even leave our room for late night feelings.
B000056HMB This is one of my favorite products I have purchased as a new mommy.  I love it.  It warms the Avent bottles great.  It took some trials to determine how much water to add but now I have it down great.  You can over heat and then you will burn yourself if your not careful.  It is not like the negative reviews if you pay attention and use the right amount of water. It DOES NOT warm the Playtex Ventair bottles.  I guess because of the vent but I preferred the Avent bottles anyway.  The cooler DOES keep bottles cold for up to 8 hours if you remember to freeze the freezer pack each day.  We have a 2 story house and this helped us so much.  I have the other First year single warmer also and it is in my kitchen and it is great as well.  This is definitly worth the money!
B000056HMB We have two of these - one for upstairs and downstairs. We've been using this for a month and it works ok. The warmer is a bit of a crap shoot as far as the bottle temperatures... but it's never under-heated a bottle. At worst some bottles come out too hot. That's easily  remedied by running the bottles under cool water for a minute or two. Also - when I first got the bottles I would heat my plastic bottles in there. They seemed fine and didn't melt but I quickly switched to using only glass bottles in the warmer. It just doesn't seem right to be heating plastic on a heat source!Now the only down side to this is the cooler. It does keep things cool - but it's not impressive. It will keep things cool for up to 8 hours - but don't mistake this for being refrigerated cool. My medela breast pump tote came with a better ice pack - and that's what we're using to keep the bottles cold at night. One other trick... keep the cooler portion away from the heating portion if you want things to stay cool all night. If you keep it on the unit your bottles will warm up.All in all - this is definitely a good purchase and I'm not sorry I bought this.
B000056HMB We are using this every night since we bought it. It takes some trial and error to figure out the water requirement but that's OK. It's easy to use, look good and works great! I use to warm breastmilk. Cleaning/descaling is the only issue.
B000056HMB We love it. Once we figured out how to use it for bottles and bottles of baby food. Very convenient.
B000056HMB Ehh, I bought this product to avoid my MIL using the microwave to heat bottles. The thing is that it really depends on the amount of milk and size of bottle. The warmer starts right away and creates a lot of steam. What i found is that a cold bottle from fridge would heat up a lot on the outside but a couple shakes and it would still be cold. I didnt find it evenly heated it through.Its still best to just sit it in hot water for a couple mins. :)But we will use this to keep cool bottles in the freezer pack in the back (remember to freeze the ice pack)-Overall, save your money and use the traditional method.
B000056HMB I use this everyday to heat up bottles.. I like how you can keep the frozen ice pack in with bottles to store and keep cool then just pour a little water into the front part to boil the water.  The directions are a little confusing with how much water to use, so i just have kind of learned how much water we need to use and just keep the bottle in there for 4-5 minutes.. you learn by trial and error.  Or if you want to save your money you can always just boil/microwave water and put the bottle in that.  I got this as a gift at my babyshower and I'm happy with it.
B000056HMB If you are pumping breast milk or formula feeding this thing is a lifesaver.  We've used this warmer for 2 of our babies and love it.  It's super convenient to have 2 bottles nice and chilled.  If you read the instructions the warming is pretty much fool-proof but on occasion I've been sleepy and overwarmed a bottle.  As I rule I always test the temperature anyway so it's never been a real problem.  Make sure your lids are off or loosened when you warm the bottles (especially Dr. Brown's) or the milk will come out of the top and make breast milk caramel all over the heating element.  :)
B000056HMB When we first got it I thought it was complicated...but it really isn't. You freeze the ice pack and when you're ready to head to bed, you just bring the ice pack and two bottles, place them in the cooler and fill the two measuring water holders and slide them on the side. When your baby wakes up take the water holder off the side and pour into the warmer, place the bottle and then press the button in front to warm. While you're changing your baby the bottle will warm up and be ready by the time you're done.It takes practice, at first you'll probably either overfill the water holder or not fill it enough. For a 4oz warm  Dr Browns bottle we usually filled it to the 6 line, 2 months later we're filling it to the 7 line. 5oz bottles vary between the 7-8 line.  It seems this warmer gets weaker with use and requires more water. You also have to be careful not to spill formula/bm on the warmer or it will get sticky and won't warm the bottle as well. Oh and if you move the bottle more towards the front of the warmer it will warm up quicker.If you put too much water, the bottle will be too hot so if you're not sure start out with the 5-6 line and go from there.There is no nightlight and they shouldn't list it as a feature, the 'nightlight' is the button that glows orange when you press it to warm a bottle. It shuts off after a couple of minutes when the bottle is done.I love this thing because it makes night time feedings almost a breeze but it does have it's quirks. If you have two floors definitely get a bottle warmer, and if you're on a budget this is the best.
B000056HMB I purchased this bottle warmer for my second baby because it was a life saver for my daughter.  It stores 2 bottles in the compartment and comes with a small ice pack.  Do not store milk with this ice pack for more than eight hours.  The pack is fairly small and does not cool the milk for long.  I use a freezer pack and store one bottle at a time.  I would add a time chart just to know approximately how much time it takes to heat up a bottle.
B000056HMB I've heard some say this is the best warmer available.  If so, parents are S.O.L. Heating is SO inconsistent. Same amount of water with the same amount of milk will produce a different temperature every single time.  Sometimes way too cold and sometimes way too hot. When the heating indicator light turns off you must be right there to pull the bottle out or it will continue to significantly warm the bottle without any water medium.  Be sure to loosen your bottles cap during heating and check to see that the travel disc is not in place.  Otherwise, the bottles (esp. Brown's) will overflow.  If that happens cleaning the inside of the warmer is a major hassle because the milk will have burned onto the heating plate. The carrier is too short for Mr. Brown 8oz. bottles or any other of similar height. The tubes provided to premeasure water are a joke. The caps are so hard to close and open you need two really strong hands and maybe multiple tools to shut or flip the tops open.  Of course, you will likely be holding your crying and squirming baby in one arm while trying to do open the cap and not spill all the water. They tried to get fancy with the shape of the tubes and cap they forgot to make them easy to use.I just can't believe that someone can't design a better \"mouse trap\".To add insult to injury, the taps on the handle that are supposed to hold the top of the bottle storage compartment just broke off...(picture provided by Amazon is not the current model.  refer to the pictures posted by other shoppers)
B000056HMB The design is convenient, except for the water holding tubes which can be annoying to clip to the sides.  Otherwise, having a cooler right there is nice.  Note that it keeps the bottle COOL, and NOT COLD.  You can order replacement/extra ice pack on Tomy website - we keep 2 extras in the freezer as we constantly were forgetting to refreeze the one we had in preparation for a new night (they were $2 each).  Heating is a bit inconsistent and seems to be slower than the quick pro model by the first years.  Overall, good purchase and the price is great on amazon (you'll pay $30 at BRU)
B000056HMB I've never used the bottle cooler part, so I can't comment on that.  I think if you kept this unit in your bedroom or the babies room where you'd want to store some bottles in the cooler instead of having to go to the refridgerator to get them, it would serve a good purpose.  But I always go out to the kitchen to use this, so it's easier to just grab a bottle from the fridge.The little test-tube-looking water containers that you fill up and then pour into the unit to steam the bottles are a bit of a pain.  The little caps that go on them are difficult to snap on and off with one hand when you have a screaming, hungry baby in the other arm! And it's hard to fill them up to the accurate measurement line under the faucet....basically, you constantly have to pour a little water out--Oh, wait, that was too much---fill it back up under the faucet--Oh, wait, that was too much...you see where I'm going with this. So, the water test-tube things aren't very user friendly.The other thing is that the little basket and the container itself that the bottle goes into gets grungy pretty quickly.  It leaves a brownish film on the basket and inside the hole where the basket goes into, so you have to clean it out frequently.  And I've definately found that the amount of water they say to put in the steamer according to the size and temp. of the bottle isn't quite right.  You really have to play with the amount of water it takes to appropriately warm the bottle up.  Scrap the instructions!!  Thankfully, my baby isn't very temperature-sensitive when it comes to taking her bottle.On the positive side, I think using this thing is probably easier than running the bottle under warm tap water or putting it in a pan of boiling water because it does heat the bottle up rather quickly.
B000056HMB Great product.  I use it at nights. It is a lifesaver when my son wakes up and needs his expressed milk instantly. Having the chiller compartment saves me the trip to the refrigerator. Sometimes I forget the ice-pack and will use a ziploc bag with crushed ice as an alternate.  As soon as I pop it in the chamber, by the time I am done changing him - it is ready to go.  I agree the measuring water is confusing so I just check it periodically to ensure the bottle doesn't overheat.  One thing to note is that it heats up glass bottles SUPER fast vs. the plastic bottles.  So if you need speedy turnaround use the Evenflo glass bottles - they heat up in under 3 minutes!
B000056HMB I can honestly say I love this bottle warmer because it is very convenient for those in a 2-story house.  We loved being able to keep the bottle cool and save the trip downstairs in the middle of the night.  Even when my son was sleeping through the night we still kept his morning bottle in his room and used this warmer to keep it cool.  But...I was very disappointed that my Dr. Brown's bottles were too wide for the warmer.  The taller Dr. Brown's bottle fit in the warmer but were too tall to fit in the cooler.  I ended up still using the cooler but storing the Dr. Brown's bottles in there without the nipple and cap on so they would fit.  My only suggestion would be to make the warmer wider so all bottles can fit.
B000056HMB I really did not like this.  We had a warmer that submerses the bottle in water, and we found this worked faster and better.  We got this as a second hoping to use it upstairs at night.  Decided to just buy a second warmer that uses water, and to use a cooler for the bottles (our baby needed 4 anyway to get through the night)
B000056HMB the measuring of the water is not comfortable it take more time to actually put the water at its correct measure than just boiling water in micro and using that to warm the milk
B000056HMB I loved this product from the moment I got it. It works wonders with drop ins, And Avent bottles fit into and heat up nicely.... Sometimes that is. We have been using this with ourDr. Brown's Formula Mixing Pitcherand it was a life saver for awhile. Now All i can smell on our bottles is burnt milk from the heating plate.... Now I am not quite sure how the milk could possibly be getting onto it but it does apparently. We have been using it for about 3 months now almost every day, four- five times a day a most and it has considerably started to take longer and longer to heat up.. Before it was done and cooled off by the time the diaper change was over. Now we find ourselves sitting and waiting another minute or two for it to finish. The instructions are basically nonexistent. All in all it still works but I can slowly start to see it go down hill in its heating capabilities.
B000056HMB This was nice to have when I was pumping. I'd wake up in the middle of the night and heat up my daughter's bottle. Now that I'm formula feeding, it's not necessary.
B000056HMB I purchased this to use on the nightstand or for keeping breast milk out.  Unfortunately I ended up having to feel formula, so I used this as a bedside bottle keeper at night.  Two bottle fit in a cooler compartment and one fits in the warmer.  I had absolutely no issues with this item, did what it said.
B000056HMB We bought this because I work 2nd shift at a hospital so on the days I work, I don't get home until midnight and my husband has to get up with the baby. We exclusively breastfeed, so it's not like we can just put warm water in a bottle and mix it with formula. Living in a two story house, it's not exactly fun to get up in the middle of the night, go downstairs, warm up the water, then the bottle and go back upstairs to the baby. This system alleviates all of that!! We just put it in our upstairs bathroom with a bottle of breastmilk in the cooler part and when the baby gets hungry, just put water in the wamer and warm the bottle. It's quick and easy, which is always good in the middle of the night!!Some people said they had problems with temperature, but we didn't have any problems. Just read the instructions for the type of bottle system we use and it worked fine!!!
B000056HMB The idea behind this design is well intentioned but I find the design aggravating. Subconsciously I always go for the handle to move this thing, but the handle is connected to the removable bottle storage piece. There's no other way to pick this thing up unless you grab it by the warmer cup. It may seem trivial but I like to keep this thing out of the way (it's an eye sore) and I would have rather just the bottle warmer with no bottle storage chamber.Plus, the heating is inconsistent. No matter whether you put extra water or not, the bottles still don't get warm like they should. When we first got it (4 months ago) the milk would actually be too hot. That hasn't happened in a while.
B000056HMB I purchsed this product because of the cooling capabilities as it was perfect for night feedings instead of running downstairs to make a bottle in the middle of the night.  We loved it for the first month we had it.  BUT, after just about a month of use (warming 3 or 4 bottles per day) the warmer started over heating the bottles and sent milk pouring out of the top.  I use a variety of types of bottles and specifically the Dr. Browns and the First Years Breastflow bottles were overheated and thus overflowed in this warmer.  (The Advent bottles did not overflow but were so hot to the touch I couldn't take them out with my bare hands and thus was NOT going to put the bottle near my infant until it cooled down which tool 5 or more minutes.) We played with the amount of water we were using, thinking we were putting too much in (even though we were following the recommended water usage in the instructions).  That didn't help.  After having the product for less than 2 months we are returning it to the vendor where it was purchsed.  I would not recommend gettin this product.  First Years needs to go back to the drawing board on this one and come out with a product that actually works.
B000056HMB So glad I bought his bottle warmer.  Late night feedings have never been easier.  Easy to use.  No complaints yet.
B000056HMB This thing stinks. The on off switch never worked so we always had to plug and unplug it. Plus you can easily over heat your bottles in this. We did like the cooler on the back for travel 
B000056HMB Easy to use, cooler works well to store 2 bottles. I've been using it for 5 oz medela bottles so I pump at night, cap it and store it in the cooler and warm as I use it. Works great!
B000056HMB Our bed rooms are upstairs and I needed to have a second warmer and one which had a cooler.This is the best buy for the same reason.I simply love it and couldnt live without it.I have used it every single day so far .My son is now 5months and it works great I never timed how much time the bottle is in the warmer not I measured the water. I used to do it when I intially bought it but with a screaming infant in hands during night I stopped bothering about the measurements . even with such a rough use it still works great .never had a little problem with itBut I do make sure that I clean it throughly every week.The cooler part is awesome,saved me trips downstairs in the middle of the night.Being a working mom I am all about making things easy for me.This is what I recommend highly
B000056HMB I bought this bottle warmer, because the previous model from the same company broke. When I got the new version of \"The First Years Night and Day Warmer System\", I was shocked on how short the electric cord was. I was also displeased with having to unplug it, in order, to turn it off. I am not happy with the new model. I would try a different brand, if you need a bottle warmer.
B000056HMB We had this warmer with our first child, but had parted ways with it by the time we had another child. We got the Tommee Tippee bottle warmer with our second child (because we used the tommee tipped bottles with her). After only a few months, I have gone back to this warmer. I love that it has the auto-off feature (which the TT one did not have). heats the bottles very quickly and you don't have to stand over it checking the temp every minute like with the TT warmer. Overall, I love this warmer.
B000056HMB Do not buy for glass bottles. Says nothing about this on the website but on the box. Very dangerous because gets so hot
B000056HMB This product is a major piece of garbage. You will NEVER get your milk to the right temperature no matter how hard you try. It will either be cold or it will be scalding hot. Also it creates a smell that smells like burnt hair which is worrisome considering others who reviewed this product (at least 4 people) said that it catches on fire. We were using dr. browns 2 and 4 oz bottles and sometimes the 2 oz would be cold while the 4 oz would  be way too hot. We always ended up using the tap to correct the temperature and it took forever. We just bought the dr browns delux bottle warmer and its AMAZING! It remembers how long it takes to warm any particular amount and you dont have to fill it up with water every time the way you do with this. Remove from your registry, return, or throw away if you have bought this product and go with the dr browns instead.
B000056HMB ahora la familia descansa mas gracias a este calentador de biberones ya que el tetero se mantiene caliente toda la noches o hasta que el bebe la necesite, no hay necesidad de prender la cocina, solo meterlo en la boca del bebe y a comerrr....
B000056HMV Couldn't ask for a better pump! Does everything I need! For my daughters first month of life, she couldn't latch on correctly so I pumped and fed her via bottle. No problems with this pump. I love it.
B000056HMV I only used this pump for the first month as I did not produced much milk but it was great when I used it. As a first time mom, I found it very comfortable and easy to use. I also sterilized the pieces after a day of use and each piece came out fine. I did find that I had to bend forward to get maximum output but it was not uncomfortable. If you plan to do a lot of pumping then getting the double pump might be worth the extra money as it is quite time consuming with only one pump. Overall, an efficient pump, no complaints.
B000056HMV This pump says it's rated for only occasional use, but I used it every day for six months.  The main thing I like about this pump is the ability to use it in any situation.  My husband and I traveled quite a bit with our son and I was able to pump in the car with the battery pack.  I use it so much that I doubt it will make it to our next child, but it's much better to buy this one twice for $80 than to buy one for $350!
B000056HMV I nurse my baby exclusively and am a stay at home mom, but this is really handy for when we go out and can't schedule around his feeding times. I didn't have any problems with let down. It does make noise, but it's not noisy. I only pump at home so it doesn't bother me. I only used this after my baby was 6 weeks and had no problems whatsoever.
B000056HMV I purchased this pump for occasional use since I am a sahm.  As recommended by our lactation consultants, I pump once a day.  I sit in bed with my daughter nursing on one side and me pumping the other.  I am able to get 6-8oz in one sitting.  When I pump w/o nursing at the same time, I am still able to get 4oz in 15-20 mins. Being a sahm, I cannot justify spending the $200 for a double pump when I just don't need that much help.I highly recommend this if you are a sahm and can pump whenever for however long.  I pump once a day and after a week of that I have 2 weeks worth of feedings(if giving once a day).
B000056HMV This little electrical pump works well. It's only problem is that it's really noisy. I have twins and this pump works just fine.
B000056HMV It does the job, but does it make the loudest noise doing it.  My husband said it sounded like I was milking a cow.  I would have opted using a double breast pump, but it was much more pricier.  After two months I found that it was harder to express breast milk using the same suction as before.  I don't know why.  The pump was fine and working the same, even at the highest level, my breast would not fully be expressed.  I had to just ditch this item in the end.
B000056HMV I had this pump on my registry but then was also given a double electric pump (Medela Pump in Style) all I can say is GOOD THING I HAD THE DOUBLE PUMP! This single electric one just cannot get enough pressure/suction/whatever. plus even if it DID work, a single pump means double the pumping time. I know double electric pumps are expensive, but beg, borrow, get your family to go in it as a gift - you NEED it and this single pump is NOT an adequate substitute for a real pump! You can even rent a double pump from the hospital or a lactation consultant. Just don't bother trying this one.
B000056HMV I agonized over whether to buy this cheaper pump or go straight to one of the high-end ($250+) models. In an effort to save money I started with this one. But I quickly realized I'd made a mistake -- it took *forever* to even get one ounce of milk. I ended up getting the Medela Pump In Style and loved it. I just wish I'd gone straight to that one and saved my money on this one.For those of you who are trying to decide between this or a more expensive model, here are my two cents:TRY THIS ONE IF...- You have a very abundant milk supply- You only plan to pump one or twice a month- You wouldn't mind giving your baby formula if you had to be away from her for an extended periodINVEST THE MONEY IN A HIGHER-END MODEL IF...- You're going back to work- Your milk supply is medium to low- You plan to pump more than two or three times per month- You are opposed to giving your baby any formula, ever (with a higher quality pump you could build up reserve breastmilk to have in case of an emergency)Also, it's worth noting that most of the more expensive models can be safely re-used by other people so could be sold to someone else when you're done (unlike this one).
B000056HMV This pump is decent but wasn't enough for me. I am home with the baby so I didn't think I needed one of the larger double pumps since I am not working. However, I needed to pump to improve my supply in the begining and also while I was healing from a cracked nipple and the single pump just didn't cut it. I ended up purchasing the Medela Pump-in-Style and it works much better. Now I use the double pump to fill an evening bottle for my husband to feed to the baby. It would take twice as long with the single pump. I REALLY hate pumping so it is worth everything to get it done in half the time! I think this pump is only worth it if you will rarely need to pump or to use for just a few minutes before feeding the baby to relieve engorgement.
B000056HMV I received this pump as a gift.  I like it because it is electric.  I got the manual attachment free from the hospital and it is very difficult to use even with the spring loading.  For manual use I recommend the Avent Isis.  However, there are times when I just feel like sitting down and not having to manually pump.  This works great.  It comes with storage containers and a nipple insert for smaller nipples.  Plus it comes with some lanolin just incase you get sore nipples.  It is a pretty good buy.  It doesn't work any better than a manual, but it is more convenient since you don't have to work as hard.  I wouldn't have bought it myself, but since it was given to me, I am glad to have it.  :)
B000056HMV I have the larger, double Pump In Style but I wanted to leave that at work and still have something at home.  I used this to pump in the morning before going to work or if I was unusually full.  It's small and light and perfect for travel.  I'm now onto baby #2 and use this occasionally since I'm now home full time, but this works so well when I need it.  It's efficient and has lasted through 2 babies - Medela is a really great brand!  I wouldn't recommend this if you're pumping often from both sides - get a double pump, but it was a perfect supplemental pump for me.
B000056HMV My sister used this pump for 3 months (daily) and passed it down to me which I was able to use for 3 months (daily) and then it died on me. I used it much more than the occasional use that it's meant for (which I didn't know this at the time). I used it about 5-6 times a day for the first month and then 3 times a day for the following 2 months before it died. It's horribly loud which can drive you nuts so I put a blanket over to drown out the noise. My husband was actually glad when it died because then we could buy another one that's less noisy even if it meant we had to spend $200 on a new one. I guess we got good use out of it considering how much it was improperly used but if you are looking to use a pump more than once per day I would definitely get the Medela Swing model...it's GREAT and is much quieter. After listening to a baby crying all the time, listening to this pump was the last thing I wanted to do so if you value silence...steer clear!
B000056HMV I love this pump!  It's the best single pump I've tried, and I've had a few different ones.
B000056HMV This pump is very slow so unless you have 45 minutes to an hour to pump 4 ounces, don't get this.  In addition to being slow, it began leaking while in use and this is only after being SPARINGLY used for 5 months.  It's a waste of money all around!
B000056HMV Awesome product, a little loud 
B000056HMV I bought this pump before leaving the hospital and it was a waste of money. It hurt like heck and did not express enough milk to relieve my engorgement. The motor cycles very slowly so when it's tugging on me all I can think is ouch...ouch...ouch... I ended up buying a used Pump-in-Style online and love it. I can pump both sides at once in less than 10 minutes and have a good-sized bottle to show for it.
B000056HMV I'm pretty sure I first bought this pump when I had my first 6yrs ago.  I only used it a couple of times then - we never got the nursing thing to work out.  When my second came along, I pulled out this pump and used it regularly for almost a year. (expressing away from home, helping with engorgement, pumping extra for more supply)It works great!  (Especially if you may be on a budget)  Yes, I know the motor is loud, and it took a little while for me to get used to it - but if that is something you can get past or it just doesn't bother you, this single breast pump is fantastic for the price.  (if you want a quiter one, look at the Medela Swing, but you also pay more)  It only took only 15-20 minutes to pump what my baby could nurse in the same amount of time.I mostly used the AC adapter, but I have taken it on the road and away from home quite a few times with batteries (2 AA if I remember?) and it worked just as well.  I have never had problems with burning through batteries, they always lasted a long time, so long that I started using batteries while at home too so I wasn't stuck in one place.If I still had this laying around, I would also use it with our 3rd, who is expected in 2 mos.  But I have no idea if we gave it away to someone else, or where else it may have went to over the years.  I do plan on upgrading to the Medela Swing this time, and only for the noise factor.  My kids are 4 and 6yrs now, and with the activity level in my home now, I think a quieter model will better suite everyone's needs.
B000056HMV This pump is very good.  I had to pump while my daughter was in the hospital the first month of her life.  During the day I used the hospital grade pumps at the hospital, but at night I used this pump until finally buying the double electric Medela pump. I got just as much milk with this pump as I did the hospital pump.  I only used the electric plug, never batteries.  It is a handy pump to have.  I don't see how a nursing mom can go without ever having to pump at some point, even if its for cereal when they start that. Medela is definitely the best pump to get, and don't even think about a manual one.  I never pump now since I'm home with my baby, but I am so glad I have this pump. It is definitely loud, but putting a folded towel over it helps.  If you have to pump a lot, and can afford it, a double pump is the way to go though...it takes half the time, which is very important when you have a baby to take care of.
B000056HMX I found this gate hard to set up - the instructions weren't as clear as I would have liked and did not mention to remove the vertical bars before trying to adjust sections.  (I am a minor DIYer).It's great once it's in place, though!  It is very sturdy and the gate is easy to open if you have a free hand.
B000056HMX Overall this appears to be a decent gate set - it easily configured to fit the area we needed to cordon off from our wee one. However I do have a few issues with the gate that are keeping me from being completely satisfied.The biggest issue, to me, is the door release. Basically, you squeeze up on the handle and then pull the door up. It actually takes a little  effort and the gate itself doesn't feel that it's truly sturdy enough for this abuse. Plus, did I mention it takes a lot of effort? It's not as well designed as several of the other gates we've used.The second point is just how narrow this gate is. I am not a large person and while I do fit through the opening I do worry that some of my larger friends may have a harder time of it. This width of a coach class airline seat, maybe a tad less, and you have idea on the width of the opening.Their are some good points. The gate is easy to configure. When you have it set up, it feels like it's locked into place (unlike a few other large area gates I've used). It does feel very secure. Additionally, it won't be hard to take the gate off it's wall moorings should I need to temporarily remove the gate. This is a great feature.Overall this is an ok gate. It may be the best gate for versatile areas where traditional gates don't fit. However if you can avoid this gate and go for something else - you might be better off looking around.
B000056HMX This gate is grate especially if you have pets and stairs.  The only thing I didn't like about the gate is how hard it is to bend/configure each panel of the gate.
B000056HMX We have a soon to be 5 month old and he is not crawling yet but we wanted to be prepared.  Our stairs needed a special gate and this is perfect for us.  We especially love the fact that you can take the entire gate off when not needed and it's easy to put up and take down.  Thanks to Little Folks and Amazon!
B000056HMX This gate was perfect for our split-level home with the addition of one 24&#34; extension. It does the job of keeping the baby away from the stairs and the dog out of where she isn't allowed. My husband said it was very easy to install. The stay-open and auto-close features are great. I plan on buying another for the bottom set of stairs.The only reason I gave it four stars instead of five is because I do feel like it could be slightly sturdier for the abuse my three-year-old tries to give it.
B000056HMX We needed a gate for a really wide space between our family room and kitchen and this gate works perfectly.  It doesn't look terribly cheesy.  The gate is easy to open and close, but not so easy that our toddler can figure it out.
B000056HMX I'm quite happy with the gate, although I had to spend $250 to make it fit the bottom of my stairs. I removed the left 24\" panel, replaced with an 8\" extension, then inserted 3 more 8\" extensions on the right.  The $30 8\" extensions are way too expensive for what you get I think (and often arrive with scratches and rust due to the extra pole in the box).Like many Kidco gates, the instructions could have been better.  And it would be nice if the mounting hardware were metal instead of plastic.I used a 1/8\" drill bit to create pilot holes before screwing into my banister (rather hard wood).  While it may be obvious to some to do that, others might not know, or might not know what size drill bit to use.  I tried a smaller one at first but the screw was extremely difficult to attach.  Only when I used a 1/8\" drill bit did it go in.
B000056HMX We got *seven* extensions for this and put a fence across our den, marking off a one-hundred-square-foot area for the lil'guy to crawl around in. I was worried that the length would make it insecure, but it doesn't: Just be sure not to have the fence completely straight; use the nifty connection corners to alternate turns, using either angles back and forth or a serpentine pattern. Then hang stuff like toys, instruments, and mobiles from it. Our lil'guy loves it! :)
B000056HMX We bought this gate for a opening between our foyer and kitchen. We ended up buying one extension and are very pleased!!! We put it together in about 30 minutes. It's great because you can bend it into whatever configuration you need. For us, we were hesitant to drill into our walls but didn't have another solution. Now that it's installed, we definitely feel like the safety and convenience factors far outway the problem of drilling into our walls.  I definitely recommend this gate!!
B000056HMX We bought two different kinds of Gates for our living room area.  We bought the Kidco Configure gate and the Kidco Elongate.The elongate was to cover an area of 84\".  The elongate can only go straight across and opening.  It's extension are screwed together and have an overlap. So the gate is not actually straight across.  We are very disappointed in this purchase and wished we had bought two Configure gates.  Took us some time to screw the extension in and then to screw the supports in and then to mark it on the wall.  Took us over an hour.The Configure gate is on the pricey side.  We almost did not buy it.  But it has two different size extension pieces and you can bend and configure it to the space you need.  We use it at the bottom of our stairs and it bows out to give you an area so that the gate is not up against the stairs.It was so easy to add the extension piece on.  You just snap out the pole and add the extension piece.  You can bend the gate different ways to fit in the opening.To Mount on the wall you just mark the screw holes and screw in the plate then snap the gate on.  It was mounted on the wall in less then 20 minutes.  It was very sturdy.I highly recommend this gate.
B000056HMX I love this gate!  We have a spiral staircase that continues for 3 floors and it was almost impossible to block off on the second level.  This gate has solved all our problems.The door does not swing closed behind you, which I like.  The bar across the bottom of the door is very low compared to other gates, about an inch.  When the door is closed it is secure, much more so than our gate that swings shut behind you.  The entire system spans 72\" and is very stable, even when my 1 year old shakes it.This gate is a great solution for difficult areas and is well worth the money.
B000056HMX It's pricy, but very sturdy.  To open and close gate is little tricky though.  I purchased Northyard gate also.  I like it better.
B000056HMX We have two landings where we use these gates and they work really well for them. The first one was a little tricky to install but the second was much easier to do. I love the magnetic latch because I know the gate will close every time. It can be difficult to open sometimes but I'd rather that than have it open too easily and have my child sneak through.
B000056HMX We've had this gate since late 2007 when our oldest started walking.  Fast forward to home# 2 and three running , half-heathen boys.  The gate has stood-up to our abuse, the elements (having been outdoors since first acquired), and the dismantling and ressembly due to a move.We've never had a problem opening or closing the gate and find the opening more than adequate.  My larger friends due as well.We did buy another Hearthgate to section off our family room from the rest of the house and yes, the mounting screws are coming out of the walls.  but, I'd like to preface, that is because I didn't use drywall mounts to attach the gate to the walls. I desperately needed a gate ASAP since our new house had a narrow, metal spiral staircase with a gate which didn!t latch( yes, we immediately rectified our spiral staircase gate sitch and now have a key lock on it!)..  So As soon as I got the gate home, I installed it.  After almost two years of dogs nosing it, kids hanging on it, people pushing on it, the screws are finally beginning to come out of the wall.  Tomorrow, I'm headed to the hardware store for some drywall mounts.After all the gates we've been through, I still think this gate is the best.  Installation for both gates was a breeze.Customer service was great as well.  I installed it while kids were napping.  I had to call the company after We received the wrong extension piece( wrong gate piece in extension piece's box)Oh, FYI: even after all these years, our original hearthgate doesn't show any signs of rust.
B000056HMX We have a row home with very low banister.  I purchsed the Kidco Configure Gate along with the extension and it fits perfectly and wraps around the area nicely and doesn't take up too much room.  For the purpose I gave it 5 stars, but I did feel both the gate and extension were a bit pricey.  The gate is crafted well, easy to install, and the peace of mind is well worth it.
B000056HMX I have this gate set up in two different parts of my house... one part as-is, and one part with two extensions. The gate that that has no extensions is very durable, and easy to open, however there is a bar that goes across the bottom of the \"door\", and myself and my guests are always bumping bare toes on it...ouch!In the other part of my house, I have this gate with two extensions. It's such a LONG gate, that there is no stability... the whole thing kind of sways, and my toddler finally was able to pull it out of the wall. There aren't many gates out there that will let you cover such a wide room, though, and for that it was nice while it lasted.
B000056HMX This is a great gate, and one of the few with the flexibility to accommodate non-straight spaces. It's pretty sturdy, the kids shake it sometimes but it hasn't ever opened or torn from the wall. The downside (or upside, depending on perspective) is that the gate is harder to open than the previous version. The magnetic catch is handy for a quiet but easy close. I got the extension, and it still stands pretty sturdy. No regrets on the purchase.BTW, this gate works really well as a separate space for an older child to play. We use it for my 3 year old to have a space on the main floor to play with toys without the baby able to interrupt. It's nice because he feels included with everyone else there, but doesn't get upset by his brother knocking down or taking his legos. Highly recommend for that purpose. Looks ok, good if you have white for trim, but ultimately, its a baby gate and looks like one.
B000056HMX We have used several other gates to block off the stairs in our home and have been frustrated with them all. My husband and I wish that we had ordered this gate a year ago! It was easy and quick for my handy husband to install at the base of the stairs. The gait opens easily with one hand (the trick is to pull the latch and then LIFT the gate just a bit, which we didn't know to do and initially caused us to think the gate was defective until reading the directions. This feature is nice as our toddler can pull at the latch but can't lift the gate to open it by herself). The gate is also fairly wide, allowing us to pass through it easily, even when carrying things. The gate automatically swings shut, which is convenient, but will also stay open if opened to 90 degrees. Would highly, highly recommend this gate!
B000056HMX This kidco configure gate is worth every penny if you need to enclose and odd shaped space!  We needed to block off a hallway in our basement, but had uneven walls, and this gate works perfectly.  The installation was a little bit involved, since you have to screw the brackets into studs in the walls, but it only took about 20 minutes and we had it up.Some tips for installing the gate:1.  First, read through the entire instruction manual before you start.  The way the manual is structured, there are instructions in several languages in the front, and then reference pictures in the back.  If you read through the manual and flip back and forth until you understand the pictures before you start, it makes the installation go pretty smoothly.2.  Try to mount the brackets to studs in your walls.  Since you can configure the gate to any length/angle by changing the angle of each joint, try to configure it so that you can mount each bracket to a stud in the wall, so you don't have to worry about energetic kids pulling them out.3.  Try to configure the gate so that each joint is at least at a 10 degree angle.  If you put them straight across, the gate will flex a little bit.  It doesn't really affect the stability of the gate since it is anchored to the walls, but the flexing will go away if you angle each sectionOverall, this gate worked for enclosing our odd shaped space perfectly and I would highly recommend it!
B000056HMX I run an in-home daycare in a townhouse in addition to having my own young children.This gate is by FAR the sturdiest gate I've used and it is my absolute favorite.  I have 4 different baby gates.  We used it in a previous home to surround the fireplace but have it in use for keeping children in the playroom across a large doorway now.The gate is attractive, too!  I don't feel like I'm keeping the children \"trapped\" like with other gates.My only issue is that my oldest daughter figured out how to open the gate at the age of 2.  However, by then she understood and obeyed when I told her WHY she couldn't go through the gate.This gate is also taller than the average baby gate, which I love for my 12 month old climber.  She stacked pillows and climbed over the first gate I installed in that doorway.
B000056HMX The advertising for this gate made it seem like the right purchase for me, but I was wrong!  First, the hinges on the gate which allow you to place the panels at an angle are not wonderful.  If you're a little too forceful, it can easily break.  And if it breaks, you're out of luck with installing this gate.  Second, the mounting pieces for the wall are fixed position, at the top of every fence panel.  The wall mounts are not the same as shown in the Amazon picture, which is in the middle of the panel!  This became a problem for me because I have a window ledge that is lower than the wall mount location.  Third, this Kidco gate is clearly terribly overpriced.  Most people will have to buy extension gate panels to make this work and boy does the cost add up.  If you have an irregular shaped area or room that needs a gate, I'd recommend that you look into the North States 3 in 1 Super Yard Gate.  I bought this North States Gate with a total of 6 panels (12 feet) and it did not have any of the problems I just described.  It was expensive, but cost less than the Kidco.  Overall, it is sturdier and better made too.  The North States Gate can be placed at various angles too just like the Kidco.  North States Gate needs to amp up their advertising though because it isn't quite clear that it can do the same as the Kidco Gate at a better price too.
B000056HMX We have used this gate since our oldest started moving around. Now 3 years and another child later it is still functioning great! It still looks and works as well as on day 1.We picked this for the top of our stairs so we could have a \"landing\" at the top. We did not like other gates where you have to balance on the top stair, with a baby in your arms, to open or close the gate.It is easy to open, but not for little ones. My 3.5 year old still cannot open this on his own.I would buy this same gate in a heartbeat.
B000056HMX We have been using this system for about two months now.  We have 2.5 walls in what was once our dining room (now play room).  We used 4-5 extensions as well.  We bought this new, and it was easy to set up.  Be sure you install it into the studs - infants will pull up on the railing.  Kidco is pretty easy to work with.  They sent me free \"templates\" for the wall and I bought some screws (for another gate).I LOVE this system.  The quality is great.  I recommend it and would purchase another if needed.
B000056HMY This item was a LIFESAVER when I brought my son home from the hospital. The sounds were so soothing they helped him to sleep longer at night. For anyone who has read Dr. Harvey Karp's book, The Happiest Baby on the Block, they will understand. The only thing is this is better for smaller babies. Once my son was bigger, I bought the Fisher Price Aquarium and that works well for older babies.
B000056HMY We have really enjoyed having this since my son was born.  We do not use the heartbeat or music setting, but he seems to like the other two settings which are more 'nature oriented.'  I love the automatic shut-off and the voice-activated modes.We have gone through one set of batteries already, but it took seven weeks to do so.  (That includes a few nights/naps that I forgot to press the automatic shut-off)  Overall this is a great product and very useful.
B000056HMY The only good thing about this is the night light function.  The waves and water sound horrible and my son never liked listening to the music or the heartbeat sound.
B000056HMY The voice activated feature is great!!And for what it offers, the price is very attractive.Four sounds, light, etc. - you will be glad you bought it.Our daughter can't sleep without it now :)
B000056HMY My daughter is now 11 weeks old, and we have used this since she was born.  We usually use the ocean sound, but once or twice we used the rainfall and she seemed to like that, too.  It's true that the lullabies sound mechanical, so we just don't use it.  We didn't buy it for music, anyway.  We wanted white noise to soothe her and block out other noises.We always use the voice-activated mode, and when we first put her down, we just go \"shh\" into it or snap fingers to start it, when it begins to play for about 15 minutes, and then whenever she cries.  It does take a pretty decent sound from her to set it off, but that's okay -- her softer noises are usually in her sleep anyway.  She only sets it off a couple of times a night -- I think!The biggest drawback is batteries.  Despite only using it on voice activate mode, when it's only on for 15 minutes at a time, we seem to have to change batteries about every two weeks.  We switched to rechargeables, and they seem to die even sooner -- but at least we can recharge them.  The unit runs through batteries even quicker if you use the night light -- even for only a few seconds to check on the baby.  This is hard for me to fathom, considering that our swing runs much more, and since our daughter was born, we have NEVER had to replace the batteries!
B000056HMY Good while it worked! My baby really liked the sounds and the night light was great for midnight feedings. I only had it for three weeks when it stop working. I changed batteries thinking that was the problem but the next day it stop working again. It didn't play music and light would not turn off. I am really disappointed. Buyer beware!
B000056HMY I wouldn't rate this as a baby necessity. It was nice to have at times, but our baby was never really addicted to it. I used the sounds as background noise when she was an infant, but not all the time. I was afraid she would get hooked on sleeping with white noise and wouldn't sleep any other way. The light was very helpful. I used that all the time for middle-of-the-night nursing sessions. It is very dim, so it is not bright enough to realy wake up baby (or you!) but you can see enough to avoid fumbling around.
B000056HMY When I first had this product, I used it on my daughter's crib like it is intended.  Then I realized it could also be placed on the side of the carrying handle on most infant car seats.  I found it worked great if my daughter was fussy in the car.  She loved the soft sounds and musical melodies.  It helped lull her to sleep.  The added light is also a great feature to peak on her rather than turning on the bright overhead light in my car.  Just make sure it is placed securely on the side of the handle to prevent it from falling.
B000056HND I was a little woried about buying a metal crib, but because it was mutch cheeper than the wooden moddles I baught this one. I love it and so does my son. We have had it for over a year. It hs traveled with us, Surved as play pin, and iven was used as the main crib for 3 monthes while we have no room for a big crib. I do wish it were a little easier to fold and ajust, although the litle buttons are stuck in mine it still works and is very safe. Should offer maybe 1 mor hight? I like that the bottom of the ligs are removeable, the description doesn't say that.
B000056HND This is a great crib so you wonder why I rated it 3 stars? Well I would love this crib for infants and short toddlers but If you go by the age on the box you can be fooled they say this crib is for ages 0-3 I would not put a 3 year old in this crib with the wheels on it!!!!! My 2 year old almost fell out of it ( Don't worry I knew my 2year old could get out of it if he tried so I left the wheels off and Daddy was right there and caught him) Truthfully if you have a 2 year old get him a blow up bed with ridges around it for traveling. Otherwise this is a great pruduct for children under 2years whose shoulder are at or below the railing. It is quite easy to put together and very sturdy with the wheels off but I never put them on so I wouldn't know how they are with them on. But my son slept great in it. It was a perfect temporary crib for our week vacation and I only used it for him to go to sleep in when I was laying on the bed right next to it.
B000056HND The first crib they shipped me was damaged in the shipment, so I asked them to ship another one...the second one was also damaged...I was able to take pieces from both to make a useable one...It is a great crib! It folds up and can be rolled on it's wheels even when folded. It can be assembled very quickly. So I rate the item very high, but check out your product when you receive it because the FedEx guys really beat ours up!
B000056HND In the middle of a summer heatwave my husband and I were faced with either disassembling our 7 month old's huge crib and moving it into our air conditioned bedroom for a more comfortable sleep, or getting a portable crib which can also be used later in the year when Baby #2 is due.  We purchased this and are delighted.  It assembled in under 10 minutes, which is unusual since most baby items take several people and loads of patience to figure out complicated directions.  This crib is light weight yet sturdy, nicely compliments any room, and is comfortable for our daughter for either sleep or play. It handles easily and can roll between doorways with no problem.  We gave it only three stars because I felt the metal bars were spaced too far apart and are not baby-friendly since the standard portable crib bedding doesn't come up high enough to protect little heads from getting bumped.  Our child already hit her head twice and the bedding did nothing to cushion the blow.  All in all it's a fine item and priced well.  We'll get better use out of it when the second baby comes since we don't have lots of space to fit another full size crib.
B000056HND I bought this because my daughter has hated the pack n play from day one. She is now 13 months old and it was a major battle at each travel destination. When we decided to leave her with grandma for a few nights we knew we needed a crib.  This one is great because it is very sturdy.  The folding locks take a bit of getting used to, but they work well.  The mattress is thin and we purchased a mattress for it for about $20.  I bought portable crib sheets at Babies R Us and they work great.  My daughter sleeps in this like her regular crib and I think we will get a lot of use from it! It does fold nice and flat, but it is still large for the average car. We can put it in our Suburban.  It would be nice if they made one that has sides that fold in half for storage, but no one does! I love this crib.
B000056HND I purchased this crib after my son grew out of his Graco travel lite crib (at three months). My son is four months old now and fits in it perfectly and there is still a lot of room for him to grow. It is a nicely made crib and is worth the $80 that it costs. It is so cute and I love the fact that they sell a bedding set for it. We bought the malawi set for it, which looks adorable. I wish I would have gotten this crib from the begining.
B000056HND great crib, easy to assemble (it was pretty much assembled when it arrived!) My 6 month old son who is almost 20 pounds fits well in it, but I had to double wrap a bumper pad around it so he wouldn't roll into the cold metal! I am not sure how long he will fit into it, but I love its portability and how I feel there is no rush to move my happy 2 yr old out of his crib. And 
B000056HNM I bought this for my son. I thought it was a good product for a fair price. He has been using it for the past 8 months with no problems. But just yesterday I saw a sticker on the side of the strap that said the table had a 20 lb weight limit! I was surprised. My son almost weighs that and I don't want to buy another table now. Next time I will buy a more substantial one for more money that can be used longer.
B000056HNM I love this changing table. This changing table has lots of space for keeping babies things handy.  You can put everything you need like diapers, rash ointment, powder, wipes tee shirts ,burp cloths on one of the shelves and still have room for a few toys. It has ample room to change and dress the baby without any problems.  You may want to get a thicker changing pad though. I have never had a problem with this and I used it for two kids.
B000056HNM My husband and I bought this changing table in the \"cherrywood\". It wasn't hard to put together--my husband put it together in a 1/2 hr or so.  It provides ample space for diapers, burp clothes, blankets, and other items you may need on it.  The table comes with a simple foam mattress, which is easily wiped off with a cloth.  We've been using it everyday for nearly 16 months, and still good as new.  No problems encountered at all.
B000056HNM I bought this for my 6 week old daughter because the price was nice and the table was attractive. I tried to put it together and I could not figure it out! It does not seem very sturdy at all and I would be worried putting her on it. I am returning it back to the store. My sister has the same table and her's is fine. Maybe I just picked up a bad one.
B000056HNM I bought this changing table with the matching Delta Jenny Lind crib from another store (shop around for the best price).  When they arrived, my husband and I set up the changing table first.  It was very easy for us to set up (although I think it would be quite difficult for just one person to do).  I did feel like the wood was going to crack at times, as in some places it must be strained to fit together while you tighten the screws, but it held up in the end, and is actually much sturdier than it looks like it is going to be when you take it out of the box.  Are there nicer, sturdier products out there?  Absolutely, but you're going to pay for the difference.  Overall, we are very pleased with the value of the product for the price.However, as a side note, the oak crib did not match its \"matching\" changing table.  The changing table is a nice reddish oak, while the crib was very blonde.  We took the items back to exchange for a matching set, only to receive another unmatched set.  Please be aware of the color differences if you are considering purchasing the set.
B000056HNM This is a good solid dressing table.  We received it because my in-laws found it at a consignment shop, so I can't comment about other reviewers' concerns regarding assembly.  The table serves the purpose and is a good value for those who don't want to spend a lot of money on a dressing table.  We didn't feel that we needed a fancy dressing table and instead opted to purchase a more expensive crib, which is really the focal point of the nursery.  The dressing table has two shelves that are quite convenient for holding supplies.  I placed baskets on those shelves to hold diapers, etc.
B000056HNO I purchased these covers because there doesn't seem to be anything else to fit the contoured changing pad.  Even after just one washing, the cover already shrunk.  I washed in cold water and dried on low since I had read the reviews saying they would shrink.  It didn't help, they still shrunk.  They still work though, but the corners of the changing pad are crumched down.  I don't see the problem with the straps either.  Mine are attached to the bottom of the pad, so there is no need for any slits for them.  Overall, these covers serve their purpose, and that's about all.  I would definitely suggest covering your changing pag with SOMETHING so that all the yuck doesn't get down into all the little crevices of the pad.  You might prefer covering the pad with a receiving blanket, so you can easily toss it in the washer with no worries when it becomes soiled.
B000056HNO this changing cover has worked well with our changing pad helded up in the wash from so many poopie diapers...which is a nice pad along with our changing pad (which we whip clean before use  and after use..over the pad its self (which sometimes my nephew sticks to without a oniez on!)
B000056HNO I have had this from the day my daughter came home from the hospital and it has held up in the wash. No major accidents on it but the few there were are due to my not folding up the stinky diapers all the way or her spitting up. Washes well and never shrunk for me. If you are washing it on warm your water temp may be too high(hot water heater) so that may be causing it to shrink. I love mine and it is softer now then first use and it is secure so she does not slide like when we tried a towel on the changing pad.Have had the same 2 since February and look like new. Would have given this 5 stars but this is not as soft as I had hoped...maybe expecting alot from terry cloth.
B000056HNO We haven't had any shrinkage problems, but the terry material isn't soft at all.  Even when it's machine-dried, it's stiff and rough as if it were line-dried.The pad's safety straps stick out easily enough from under the edges of the cover, but since they are from the same manufacturer it really was poorly designed.
B000056HNO The softness of this cover makes up for the fact that you have to stretch it a bit to fit your changing pad.  At least once you have it on, you know that it's a snug fit and won't pop off!
B000056HNU I used this when I became too sore to use my electric pump.  The milk seeps under the pump guard and it leaks out from the edges onto clothes. I wouldn't even say getting this as a pump for when you're on the go is a good idea because the leaking milk will get all over leaving you with clean up. I had to buy a replacement part because the bottom part that screws on the base of the pump cracked from sterilizing (which it says you can do).  They don't sell just that one little piece so I had to buy the actual pump again as a part.  It cost nearly $30 to order this part and it took over 2 weeks to receive it.  The entire system just isn't durable or made for much use.  Also, cleaning down into the bend of this pump thoroughly is practically impossible.
B000056HNU My son is three weeks old, and I am using this pump every day to express milk for his middle-of-the-night feedings. It is so much easier to use and more comfortable than the Medela pump they had me using in the hospital to increase my supply.It seems very complicated to put together the first couple of times, and it took me a little practice to get to where I had the pump (and myself) positioned properly to get consistent suction. But once you get the hang of it (give it 3-5 sessions to get used to it), it works great. I can pump enough for an entire feeding in 20-25 minutes.It does occasionally lose suction when I am using it because the soft plastic massaging attachment comes loose from the hard body of the pump. This requires me to stop momentarily but isn't a huge deal, just a minor annoyance. And it seems that the more I get used to the pump, the less this happens.This morning, I was even able to hold my fussing baby on one arm while pumping with my free hand. Talk about convenient....The lactation consultant who taught my breastfeeding class said this pump is so popular that Medela is now trying to copy the design.Considering the price, I'd rate it an outstanding buy.
B000056HNU Recently, while on vacation I misplaced the membranes for my Medela Pump In Style Breastpump, which are vital for operation. The spare parts were safe at home, and with a hungry boy on my hands I was in a predicament.  Unable to nurse, I have provided my son with breastmilk by pumping three times a day since birth.  I was concerned about maintaining my milk supply, not to mention the discomfort of very full breasts, so I purchased the Isis Breastpump because I use Avent products and like the idea of being able to pump right into the feeding bottle, 4 oz, 9 oz or disposable. I am amazed by the comfort, control and power this little hand pump provides.  In addition, I enjoy the convenience of not having to be \"plugged in\" and the reduced amount of bottles to wash.  I found this pump to be great in a pinch, or for a weekend away.  However, for my particular situation having to express 30 ounces a day in order to keep up with my little guy, the Pump In Style is superior to the Isis both in speed and quantity of milk expressed.
B000056HNU I bought this pump because I am an at home mom and don't need anything quicker.  I saw no need to spend the extra money to save time when I have plenty of it.  Plus, once your milk really start to come in and your baby has been breast feeding for a few months, the milk really flows.  It wasn't especially useful for the first few months because expressing was just not feasible yet without a hospital grade pump.  Now that it is, I love this pump.  It doesn't hurt my nipples, and the small breast milk storage containers fit right on the pump.  My daughter still only drinks about 3-4 ounces at a time so I mainly use those.  I bought the disposable one because it came with the storage bags and the bottle to hold them.  I thought they would be useful for when I need to have more than 4 ounces.  The bags hold 7 and are very easy to thaw.  This breast pump is definitely worth the money.
B000056HNU I have been breastfeeding my son, since he was born, and now he is 9 months old. I couldn't have done it without this Avent pump. As a first time mother, I always knew I wanted to breastfeed my child, but it was a lot harder for me than I thought it would be. My son had trouble latching on in the hospital, and so, until he could breastfeed consistently (I went to a lactation consultant and she worked wonders), I was pumping my breast milk for him. At the hospital, they provided me with a Medela manual pump. It was PAINFUL. I eventually got calluses from pumping with the Medela pump. So then I was considering whether to buy the Medela electric or the Avent Isis, and I went for the Avent, a much more economical buy. This pump is so comfortable, it really imitates the suckling action of the baby. At first, all the parts might seem overwhelming, but when you put the pump together, it's a breeze and washes easily. I chose the disposable system because I thought it would be more convenient if I traveled to take the pump, however, I find I use the reusable 4 oz bottles a lot more frequently. Whether you're taking the pump on vacation,to work, to extract milk for an occasional bottle or to mix for cereal, this pump is a great buy. Now that my son is older, it is harder for me to pump so much milk (the let-down takes a little longer, and he drinks less, so I do have to pump a bit), but it's so convenient if you have to go out and run an errand, or freeze your milk so that you'll always have supply on hand for the babysitter.
B000056HNV I was hoping for more of a pad feel to make my baby's mattress softer but this is more like a waterproof cover with some quilting as an afterthought. Didn't make the matress any softer.
B000056HNV Had it not fallen apart after one wash, this would have been the perfect mattress pad.  It never even made it into the dryer.  What a waste of money.
B000056HNV This pad makes our 1 year old daughter's Colgate classic mattress not feel so hard, but at the same time it is thin enough and seems safe for younger babies. I'm very glad I bought it!
B000056HNV This was about as thick as his cozy baby blanket. There was nothing &#34;UltraSoft&#34; or &#34;UltraThick&#34; about this mattress pad, if you could call it that. It's probably the first amazon purchase, after a couple hundred, that really left me disappointed. You're better off putting a thick, soft blanket under your baby's crib sheet if padding is what you're going for. As a mattress protector, it might be good. As a quilted pad to make it softer- it's useless. The packaging it came in is less than 1.5 inches thick if that gives you any indication as to how thin the entire thing can be folded up to. My 7 month old wouldn't have even noticed a difference. He naps SO well on our Tempurpedic with a down topper that I wanted to get him a little something to soften his mattress with now that he's older. Guess I'll have to keep looking.
B000056HNV When I opened the packaging I was appalled by the strong chemical smell of this mattress pad. I had to open the windows to get rid of the smell in the room even after I wrapped the pad back in plastic. I can't imaging my baby being in the same room with this product, let alone sleep on it! I also realized that there is no need to have a water proof mattress pad because most crib mattresses these days already come in a water proof cover. The non-waterproof cover I got was a much better choice for my baby.
B000056HNV First of all why is this product listed under toys?Now to the point. I bought this hoping that it would help replicate a pillow top mattress as my son has been co-sleeping with me and he has become accustomed to my mattress and I want to try to transfer him to his own bed. Sadly this isn't as plump as what it looks or as much as what other reviewers try to make it out to be. I even tried it out by placing my son's mattress on the floor and lying on it myself, his mattress still feels hard as a rock! Plus his mattress is a simmons beauty rest foam mattress with square corners, so it's slightly bigger than the average mattress and this pad still fits loosely on it, but I will add that a well fitted sheet seems to help fix this problem a little. So far it has held up in the wash, but mind you I wash it on cold and dry it on extra low. My son is just over 4 months old and I don't have any worries about SIDS because of this product. To give you an idea of the thickness of this pad it is just over the width of my pinky finger so about 1-2cm.
B000056HNV I own two of these mattress pads and I love them.  They help to make my extremely firm crib mattress a little cozier for my son.  They hold up very well in the wash and fit great over my Simmons mattress.  It is a little more expensive that other mattress pads, but in my opinion it is worth it.
B000056HNV This fits our crib mattress tightly and keeps our baby from sweating against the vinyl of the crib mattress.  We didn't have a mattress pad with our son and he would wake up soaking wet from sweating against the vinyl of the crib mattress.  The crib sheet alone wasn't enough to keep him from sweating.  This pad is also not too bulky so it doesn't cause a safety concern.  Just make sure the pad fits TIGHTLY on YOUR crib mattress for safety's sake.  We have a Sealy Crown Jewel Mattress and it fits great on it.
B000056HNV Unlike many other pads on the market, this one is very soft and durable. It holds up great to washing, fits my baby's mattress perfectly, and appears to be very cozy for my little one.
B000056HNV I'm trying to get the toxic smell out of this mattress pad. I've washed it 4 times so far and now I'm airing it outside. It is the plastic liner that smells toxic. The pad itself is quite a lot thinner than I expected based on the reviews. It might make a difference in wetness protection but I don't imagine it could make much of a difference in comfort.
B000056HNV This mattress pad is waterproof. That is all I need. It goes in the washer and the dryer. Not only that it is thick and fluffy, like a good quality mattress cover should be to add softness and quality of sleep to a bed. I only need one. It's QUITE a necessity.
B000056HNV This fits well and is so soft.  I haven't found it to be the best with waterproofing, though.
B000056HNV Fits the mattress well & Holds up well in the wash. I actually bought this b/c my toddler's new bedding set showed his mattress design too much. This was my solution and he seemed to love it too! :)
B000056HNV I love it!  It keeps my sons mattress dry and it washes easily and comes out great. He has peed through his sheets twice so we have washed it 3 times and it is still in as good condition as when we bought it the week before he was born 9 weeks ago.  I will be getting another one soon.
B000056HNX Look through the reviews and you can see many people upset about these leaking. They are correct! Because it only happens to one in about four or five reviewers, I think there must be a problem with production. Maybe some are leaky, some are not. Fact is, out of ten bottles, five of mine were leaky. I ended up throwing the whole lot out after using more money on paper towels than bottles.Save yourself the headache and get evenflo or playtex. They are half the cost and never leak
B000056HNX Don't waste your money!  Overpriced leaky bottles!
B000056HNX These worked good for about 3 weeks and they started to leak. I went to the Avent website and they said that I was overtightening the bottles and that was causing the leak. Well less tightening did not help. Don't waste money. I am using the Playtex Premium Nurser now and it's much better.
B000056HNX At 2 months of age, my doctor said to start supplementing my breastmilk with formula at each feeding. She would not take the avent bottle. We switched to Playtex and have had no problems.The nipples are sooo long and even the \"slow flow\" alow for much more formula thru than the playtex.Now, the only use our Avent bottles get is to store the formula made for the day in the fridge. Maybe as she gets older, she will like the avent style nipple....
B000056HNX I bought a few Avent bottles when I was at a grocery store and had to have a bottle RIGHT then and this was all they had.  I was not disappointed in the quality of the bottle, but I was not overly impressed.  I did not notice a change in my son's spitting up using these bottles, either.The downside of using the Avent system is that, once you commit, you're really committed - the bottles and bottle parts do not fit standard bottles and parts.  I now have a wide variety of bottles and bottle parts, and the Avent bottles sit largely unused because I cannot mix and match the parts.  Who has time to search for the right parts when their baby is hungry and crying?
B000056HNX these bottles proved to be better than any other bottle.  myb baby gets much less gas from these than any other on the market.  its definately worth the price.  i have bought and wasted money on so many different brands of bottles.  dont waste your money and just go exclusivly with these.
B000056HNX and I have still come back to them in the end as they have kept me from the dreaded nipple confusion. I rate them 2nd only to the Dr.Brown wide neck, and that is only because of the gas issue. They are super easy to break down and clean. And yes, I had the same problem with the nipple leaking at first. However, after a couple runs through the dishwasher and sometime just opening and reclosing the bottle, I haven't had the problems since.
B000056HNX I bought these bottles after reading reviews on them and have been pretty happy with them. They have never leaked with me BUT I have never screwed the lid on too tightly. You HAVE to remember that. When you overtighten the lid, the nipple gets distorted and the seal is broken. My husband and others in the family have had this problem. It is probably always helpful to test for leaks (when you test the temp of the milk) BEFORE you give it to the baby, just to make sure.I like the plastic they use. It has always felt extremely sturdy. They are easily to hold (thanks to the curve) and I really like the wide mouth of the bottles which make them easy to clean....and you are pretty sure they are clean!!I bought the newborn starter set and the infant set and together they are all I require for bottles and a breastmilk storage set!!All in all I think they were a great buy and worth it. I would use them all over again and would use avent with my next baby too.
B000056HNX In the midst of all of my bottle testing, I was against Avent, mostly because they do cost a bit more than most bottles.  I thought that I could test a bottle and cup, to see if Avent was really telling the truth when they said all the parts were interchangeable.  Well, they are.  They also have more nipple selections, depending on how fast your child drinks.One thing I wish Avent has was a design or something on the bottle. I did find that if you buy the Evenflo Cool Pals 9 oz. cup holder, these fit in them great.I would suggest only getting 2 packs of these, couple of Magic Cups with handles and some extra spouts (have at least 2 green ones and 1 white one).
B000056HNX These bottles are a good choice if you're breastfeeding, but have to introduce a bottle. My son has never had a problem going from the breast to this bottle and back to the breast again.Also, after months of frequent use, I have never experienced the leaking problem with these bottles mentioned by some other reviewers. I also know of other moms who have used these for more than a year and no leaks either. I have even taken the tops apart and put them back together and still no leaks.
B000056HNX My wife chose Avent on recommendation from a friend and we glad we did.  These bottles worked perfectly for us.  They also fit right into Avent bottle warmer, which we also have.
B000056HNX Wanted to use the Avent line, but baby just wouldn't take this nipple.  Went with Playtex ventaire natural instead.  Looks like a science lab...but baby switches easily from breast to bottle.
B000056HNX Avent bottles are not as great as all the write ups.  They allow to much air to enter the baby's system.  Spend your money on a better bottle like Dr. Brown's or Platex.  I know several new mother's who bought in the ad hype about these bottles and ended up trashing them and buying something else.
B000056HNX I wouldn't use any other kind of bottle for several reasons:1- they work great with the avent breast pump.2- They have wide mouth openings and this makes it easier to clean the bottle as well as dump formula or breast milk into the opening.3- The nipples are silicon and this is very important to me since I understand from my research silicon nipples are less apt to cause breastfeeding nipple confusion.4- The nipples seem to mimic a breast more than any other nipple on a bottle I have seen. I was concerned about nipple confusion for the few times I wanted to bottle feed instead of breast feed and I understand that these are some of the best available that mimic a mother's breast.5- We have noticed that our children have less gas when they use these bottles rather than a normal, cheap type bottle. (maybe it's our imagination, but we think that this is the case.)6- the whole avent system makes for easy growing with the child- there are different nipples for different ages, including a sippy cup nipple. Great.These bottles are great. My husband sometimes screws a lid on wrong and gets shaking it and formula leaks out the sides. This is only when he doesn't screw the lid on correctly. I have never had this problem.We wouldn't use any other type of bottle. They are well worth the money.
B000056HNX I used these bottles with my first son and would have given them about 3.5 stars. I would be the first to tell you if they were not fixed just right they would leak. After trying all others once again with my daughter I decided to use these. When I went to buy new nipples I noticed they looked different. Oh, wow, what a diffrence. Baby is 4 months old and no leaks. The new nipples have a raised edge that guarantees the nipple is tight in the collar. Then there is a lip that hugs the rim of the bottle to guard against leaks. The REALLY great thing is you can tighten these bottle to your hearts content. I tightened it as tight as I could and it didn't leak a bit. The new nipples have the words \"Extra Soft\" on the package and if you look closely they look different around the bottom. I am extremely satisfied with these bottles now and will use them untill baby is weaned.
B000056HNX My son has reflux so we have an ongoing battle with spit up in our house. When I stopped breast feeding I tried a couple different types of bottles and eventually ended up sticking with Dr. Brown's because they helped the most with his gas and spit up. After 3 months of washing all of the parts that Dr. Brown's bottles have, I decided to try Avent. I like the bottles, they are made of a good quality material and they are wide, which made it really easy for me to mix formula in them. My son didn't have a problem latching on or anything, and his gas didn't get any worse, but his spit up became out of control!!!! He began spitting up twice as much as he did on the Dr. Brown's bottles. I was forced to switch back to Dr. Brown's because I just couldn't handle changing his clothes and mine 5 times a day. So they just didn't work for my baby. However, I never had a problem with them leaking...they are pretty good bottles!
B000056HNX Don't bother buying these if you want your baby to take in less air.  Go with the Dr. Brown's.  My kids actually ingested more air b/c of the nipple shape - they just couldn't get their mouths around the large base.Reasons I give 2 stars:-well-made-easy to clean
B000056HNX My son is breast fed, but we have given him an occasional bottle. He refused these. I got them because of all the great things I heard about them. I thought it would be easier for him to switch back and forth. No chance. He hates them. He hate the Playtex disposables too. He now takes Gerber bottles, traditional and New Traditions.
B000056HNX I had nothing but leakage problems with these bottles. I contacted the company and they told me all these different tips of assembling the bottles that should stop leakage. Needless to say none worked. Luckily for me I was able to return the larger bottles. I am although stuck with eight of the smaller ones. First off let me say when you are sleep deprived you dont' want to be worrying if the bottle lip has a drop of water on it that will cause it to leak or if you have over tightened or under tightened.  There is no time to worry about all these little things when you have a hungry screaming baby. The bottles are by far not cheap and there shouldn't be so many issues.  I have many friends that have said that theirs leaked as well...too bad they didn't tell me before I registered for them.  Oddly enough if you buy a bottle in the .99 cent store you don't have all these issues.  When I returned the larger ones to Babies R US there were a lot of other returns as well.  I will give these to my daughters to play with their dolls.  In addition to the leakage I noticed that my son was extremely gassy and would cry so much after eating.  I have told my friends who are registering now to save their money and find an alternate bottle.
B000056HNX I spent SO much money on these bottles while I was pregnant, because they were supposively the best bottles to use while breastfeeding. The bottles are expensive so I thought they must be good bottles. WRONG. Expensive does not always equal good. I tried using these bottles when my baby was two weeks old, and the feeding session ended in complete frustration on mine AND my baby's part. The nipple shape is horrible. Even the newborn nipples are WAAAAAY too long for a newborn's mouth ( and my baby has a BIG mouth. He was 9 lbs at birth) . Not to mention that these bottles let him suck SOOOO much air and caused him to spit up several times. I thought maybe my baby was just having problems with taking a bottle, so I went and bought the Playtex VentAire. Those bottles are a LOT cheaper and SOOOOOOOOOOOO much better. He took the bottle immediately and didn't get NEARLY the amount of air.  Don't waste your money on these bottles. They are NOT the \"best\" bottles to use while breastfeeding. SO if you are pregnant, don't make the same mistake that I did and buy a whole load of these bottles thinking that they are the best.
B000056HNX After trying Dr. Brown's, Playtex, and even the cheap bottles, Avent bottles have come to my rescue.  First of all, they have many different flows with their nipples, which is a huge plus in my book.  The Playtex have 3 - slow, fast, and tri-cut.  Avent has newborn stage 1, stage 2 (slow), medium (+3 months), and fast (+6 months), plus a tri-cut.  I have NEVER had a problem with the nipples clogging, even after putting them in the dishwasher a few times (I had this problem with all other nipples).My 3 month old daughter can finish a 6 oz bottle in 10 minutes instead of the 45 it took with the other bottles.  Also, I have never ever had a problem with leaking, I think many other moms who do are probably not reading the directions or using common sense.  If you tighten ANY bottle too tight, it will leak.  And the nipple has a special seal that you can hear when you turn it, so that will prevent leaking.There's no extra parts to wash like Dr. Browns, and they do not give my daughter gas.  In fact, my daughter will burp better now than with her other bottles.  She also prefers the wide-mouth shape and I know it gives her mouth the needed motion to widen her palatte (which is one of the reasons breastfeeding is recommended.)  We ended up selling all the other ones to our local baby consignment shop and spent the money on more Avent bottles.
B000056HNX They leak like mad... and although you tell yourself you must be doing something wrong because no bottle should leak this much, it's not your fault. It's these idiotic bottles! I can't imagine how they passed any kind of testing when they were being made. Please don't buy them, it is a huge waste of money!
B000056HNX These bottles leak.  It doesn't matter how you assemble them, or if you assemble them wet, or dry, or in space, or in a cave.  They leak.  Terribly.  And Avent knows it.  They will even replace your leaky bottles if you call 1800 54avent.  Of course the ones they replace it with also leak.  Buy Dr. Browns instead.
B000056HNX I give 5 stars to all Avent Products. I have had no problems, whatsoever, with Avent.
B000056HNX We have tried every bottle out there and like these the best for our newborn. There are a few drawbacks. The nipple flow is fast for a newborn. The bottles also leak which is annoying. Usually if you just unscrew and screw top back on, it stops leaking. The bottles are easy to clean.
B000056HNX I purchsed these bottles on a recommendation from a friend who was breast feeding as well.  The fact that the nipples were to more mimic the breast than others was great and the fact that you could use the bottles as storage containers when pumping was even better.  When I first had my daughter, we had to put her on a bottle a week after she was here to help me have time to heal.  She was getting one bottle a day and was having no problem going back and forth from breast to bottle regularly.  The nipples are great because they force the baby to suck on them as if they were the breast.  The nipples are not supposed to be shaped as the breast but force the baby to latch the way they do on the breast.  I swear by these bottles ans will not change to any other bottles for her!
B000056HNX These bottles are great. The entire line works together from breast pumps, to sanitizers, to storage containers, to sippy cups. Also, my son had no problems with colic. Not sure if this says anyhting about the \"anti-colic nipples\", but whatever.Here are some of the major comments I have:LEAKING-They only leak if you don't dry them completely or put the lid on wrong. They have leaked on me b/f but only occasionally when they are wet. I love these bottles.VARIABLE FLOW- There are several different grades of nipples. I love that there are slow flow, medium, fast and then sippy tops. They even have variable flow nipples so you don't have to buy three sets. A friend of mine uses different ones that only had two different flows and was envious of my choices!GROW WITH ME- The fact that the whole set is interchangeable is great. You can use these bottles from newborns to toddlers. You can convert your bottles into sippy cups!!! There are screw on handles and sippy tops you can buy. Fabulous. To me, this also justifies the cost.
B000056HNX These are the widest bottles that I have seen available.  They are well made and easy to assemble.  I sterilise mine every day and there has been no fading of level markers (a problem with another make I tried.) or discolouration of bottles.  They come with a whole range of accessories like handles and sippy cup teats for older babies and so will go from Day 1 right through to when you no longer need sippy cups.  The best thing for me is the fact that you can get specially designed teats that allow for thicker liquids (my son had rice in his milk at 8 weeks (with Doctors approval) because he is so big (90th Percentile) and was so very hungry.  The Adjustable Flow teat has a slot cut instead of a hole and so the flow depends on the way the teat is lined up with the babies nose.  What a fantastic idea and such a godsend for us.  They also hook up directly to an avent breast pump either the manual or electric.
B000056HNX These bottles are absolutely fantastic! They are so easy to use and they cut down on gas wonderfully. I just cannot say enough good about them - well, here's an idea. I have 8 of them! The nipples can be a little pricey at times but check out the stores and babies rus - they're on sale at different times in the year and you can save about 15-20% on them. I wouldn't use anything else.  Target puts them on sale as well.  The silicone nipples are so much nicer than the rubber ones on regular bottles, and if you nurse and use bottles as a supplement, these are the more like yourself so the baby has an easier taking it.  The bottles withstand hundreds of washings in a dishwasher without the markings being washed off.  By far, the best bottle on the market in my humble opinion.  I received one in a gift set and my husband immediately ran out and bought a week's worth - they're just so much easier to use and they fit so well on the fridge shelves, plus those huge plastic caps that fit over the nipples are easy to remove and makes you feel like everything is cleaner.  Highly recommend!
B000056HNX HI, I HAD THESE BOTTLES BACK IN 2002 WHEN MY SON WAS BORN BECAUSE THE HOSPITAL GAVE THEM TO US TO USE TO FEED THE BABY. I HAD NO PROBLEMS BUT WHEN I BOUGHT MORE WHEN I GOT HOME, I HAD NOTHING BUT LEAKY PROBLEMS!!! I EMAILED AVENT 2 TIMES AND THEY TOLD ME FIRST THAT I HAVE TO CALL THEM TO \"TALK ABOUT IT\" I SAID FORGET IT AND THEN I COMPLAINED AGAIN WHEN THE LEAKING KEPT HAPPENING. THEY SAID THAT I WAS NOT PUTTING THE NIPPLE AND RING ON CORRECTLY. THEY TOLD ME TO ONLY TURN THE RING UNTIL U FEEL IT JUST ATTATCH TO THE BOTTLE AND DO NOT OVER TIGHTEN. I TRIED THIS AND YET AGAIN THE BABY WAS SOAKED!!! MY POINT OF WRITING ABOUT THIS NOW IN 2005 WHEN I USED THESE BOTTLES IN 2002 IS THAT I CANNOT BELEIVE THIS PROBLEM HAS NOT BEEN CORRECTED YET!!! WE THINK WE HAVE ANOTHER BABY ON THE WAY AND I KNOW THAT WE WILL NOT, NOT, NOT, BE GETTING AVENT BOTTLES!!!
B000056HNX Avent bottles have more BPA than any other leading brand. BPA free brands include Born Free, Nurture Pure, MAM, Green to Grow, Baby Life and Adrini.(For those that missed the news reports - BPA is a chemical found in some plastics that a recent National Institutes of Health report indicated may be harmful, especially to infants.)
B000056HNX We bought this because this is a good brand to use.  We love how big these are and they are so easy for someone to mix formula in.
B000056HNX I have had 3 children, all formula fed from birth, and we only used this brand with the 3rd child - mainly because I could not find the brand I used previously (Canon Babysafe).Yes, they are more expensive, but if you think how many times you use them and wash them ... you certainly get your money's worth.  I only have 6 and this suits us perfectly.I have not had any trouble with leaks and find they seal quite well for outings when they are in my nappy bag.My baby took the teat from birth with no problems.  But I know some mother's who had babies that just wouldn't take this teat and they had to switch brands.  I guess with everything to do with babies it's a case of trial and error to find what suits you and your baby.What I like about the bottles is that the wide opening makes them extremely easy to wash and easy to put formula in.  I used the narrow necked bottles previously and I was forever spilling formula trying to put the formula in with the scoops.  The Avent bottles are also very comfortable for me to hold and easy for my baby to grip on to as well.They suit us perfectly - give them a try and see what you think.
B000056HNX These bottles are very finicky and if you do not put them together just right they will leak... not drip... POUR out all over the floor, and if it is breast milk that is gushing out of the bottle you may just be crying too!I ended up with a full set of these bottles (without the ring) and one that required the ring (which I felt leaked less), I could never justify going out and buy all new bottles, so I dealt with these for 11 months. I have now weaned my son off of these and onto a sippy cup because I just could not deal any longer!What's the trick? Well, the nipple has these three little lines on it and inside the screw on part there are solid parts and slotted parts (sorry if this doesn't make sense). You have to line up the lines on the nipple with the solid parts on the bottle top. This requires two hands, so you will also need to find a place to put down your screaming baby while you concentrate and get it all lined up perfectly. Once you have them lined up, now screw on the top. You have to make sure it is nice and tight. Now, shake it and see.... it leaks! It is because when you screw the top onto the bottle the nipple shifts and turns as you screw it on tight, so all that time you spent lining up the holes with the slots is garbage. Take it off and try again. Finally you will get it right and only then can you give the bottle to your starving child.I cannot wait to throw them all in the trash.
B000056HNX i have zero complaints about these bottles. wish i had bought them in the first place (i started out with the playtex nurser system). they may be pricy compared to other bottles, but, you don't have to buy liners for these bottles. my daughter found these bottles much easier to hold herself than the playtex ones and these have a bigger selection of nipple flow to choose from (besides slow and fast, where fast for playtex really just means not so slow), so i put them away and got more of these, and my daugher was a much happier baby.what i found with the leaking some people complain about: if there is any liquid in the seal it will leak. this problem can easily be solved by wiping the inside of the ring that holds the nipple and the outside rim of the bottle with a dry rag, and if it squeaks when you screw the lid on, you're not going to have any leaks.hope this helps!
B000056HNX I have tried five different types of bottles and these are horrible. Don't waste your money.  Dr. Brown's is the way to go!
B000056HNX Sent me 3 bottles one of which didn't have a lid in the box.  Crappy quality control.  Just buy them at the store for more money, at least you'll get all the parts with it.  5 stars for avent, -5 stars for seller.
B000056HNX I loved these bottles. Never had one problem. No leaks, nada one. I also was able to attach these to the ISIS breast pump. I only use these for baby water now, since I use larger bottles. 5 stars
B000056HNX In 2000 when my first son was born, I bought the Avent bottles to go with my Isis breast pump (which I LOVE) because everyone raved about how they were the best.  The first time my son tried the bottle with a newborn nipple he couldn't get anything to come out.  After trying for awhile, I finally called Avent and they told me to move up to a different size nipple.  These bottles worked out relatively well after that dilemma.  With me second son I assumed I would use the bottles again and tried the newborn nipple with the opposite result.  The flow was way too fast for him and he would choke and spit out half the milk every time I would try to feed him. I finally gave up on Avent bottles and went with the much cheaper and economical Evenflo Classic bottles (on the recommendation of the lactation consultant.)
B000056HNX In my opinion the Avent bottle system is superior to any other product on the market. The disposable system works great for storing and freezing milk and it's convenient for Mom's on the go. My only mistake was not buying enough bottles in the beginning when my son ate eight times a day. The bottles are designed to reduce gas, and seem to do the job. The one slight annoyance with the system, you have to place the ring on the lids directly on top of the nipples; otherwise the bottle has a tendency to leak.F.Y.I. - I purchased the adjustable flow nipples when my son turned three months old as recommended, but nowhere in the product information does it tell you that you are supposed to line-up the Roman numerals of the nipples directly in line with your baby's nose to adjust the flow. This makes sense of course, but I had to call the 1-800 number to discover this 'little' detail.
B000056HNX I had and hated the VENTAIR!  Stupid leaky valves!  This bottle feels nice in the hand to feed and my husband like them too.  The placement on the babys face with the nipple is perfect too.
B000056HNX I decided to breastfeed my second son,when that didn't work out, I used playtex nursers.  We often fell asleep while he was eating and would wake up SOAKED in formula.  Not a good thing because formula stains and then you have to change baby and you in the middle of the night (and pretreat clothes and wash them if you didnt want to end up replacing them).I decided to try these after seeing an add in a magazine.  THESE WORKED WONDERFULLY! No more buying and changing liners (which by the way would always break even if i was being VERY careful when i \"burped\" the bottle...its hard enough to burp baby without trying to BURP a bottle!  I never had to burp my avent bottles.  They never leaked for me.  And I rarely had to change the nipple which hold up very well to repeated dishwashings! If you think about it these really are cheaper then playtex nursers as you dont have to buy the liners and worry about them breaking and getting formula all over yourself in the mall and then having no formula and having to leave anyways...
B000056HNX I decided to use these because I wanted the Avent Breast Pump and would use these with it.  Well, my newborn had a hard time latching onto the nipples and when he did they were way too fast with the flow.  He would choke and gasp almost everytime.  I now use the Playtex Ventaire bottles and he doesn't have as much of a problem.  Every baby is different, though, but if you have a baby that tends to want to eat quickly, these won't work so well.
B000056HNX My daughter was born 3 & 1/2 weeks early and had to stay at the hospital for a week, she was lazy at the breast but did great with these bottles which came highly recommended by a friend.  I only have an ocassional problem with leakage when you twist it shut it seems that every 1 in 10 times it leaks.  I don't mind the leaking except that it takes several tries to re-twist it before it stops leaking.  I hate losing precious breastmilk to leaks, thats why I gave it only 4 stars.
B000056HNX Our baby seems to drink the best from these bottles.  I like them because the wide mouth makes it easy to fill and clean.  I've noticed leaking a couple times and just rescrewed the cap and it was fine.
B000056HNX These bottles are pretty good.  The nipple is a little large and seems to flow kinda fast for my breastfed baby.  She makes quite a mess while drinking from these.  However, the bottle is nice and durable.  The nipple and caps fit snug.  Also, they work great as breast milk storage containers.  You can take out the nipple and put the insert in the cap for freezer storage.  I like that.  My daughter doesn't get a bottle often, but when she does this in one of the types I use.
B000056HNX Both bottles do a fine job of keeping bubbles out of your baby.  We tried and used both bottles with our boy.  The real deal between the two is the nipple.  The nipple on Avent bottles are larger at the base and firmer than the Brown bottles.  When we first introduced the bottle to our breast fed boy he did not take to the Avent bottles.  He just couldn't get comfortable around the nipple.  We switched to Dr. Bown's and he took to it with little problem.  As he got older and bigger we later switched and are currently using the Avents.  Why did we switch?  Cleaning Dr. Brown's bottles SUCKS!  There are so many little parts that all need special brushes to clean with that it takes forever to wash bottles.  Plus, the Brown bottles are thinner but taller and just don't seem to pack away as well.  However, if your baby is picky there isn't much you can do.  For expecting parents, I would not recommend buying a bunch of one type over the other.  Buy one of each first and see which one you baby is comfortable with.
B000056HNX I've only tried the 9oz bottles and they leak for me alot. It's really annoying since I spent so much money thinking that they were quality. They also make alot of noise when my son eats. And he doesn't like the nipple, it's too thick for him to get a good suction. One thing that is good is these bottles don't give him gas which I've tried cheap bottles and he gets gassy with them. After trying alot of bottles the only brand I have absolutely no problem with is the Dr.Brown bottles. They are just the best. But they have extra parts to clean which is a pain.
B000056HNX I recieved boxes of these bottles as gifts, every one of them leaks. I tried everything to stop the leaks, but nothing worked. Avent makes a great manual breast pump, but they need to put a better bottle on the market.
B000056HNX I like the bottles. Have only had trouble with leaking a few times when I had the cap to tight. You just have to take off the lid and start over. Good system.
B000056HNX The Avent bottles are great if you breastfeed, but I would caution you not to put them in your dishwasher.  All of my 9oz bottles have cracks in them because of the dishwashing detergent (according to Avent).  I called Cascade and they told me the manufacturer of the dishwasher is to blame.  On any account, Cascade and Avent both recommend using a gentle, not antibacterial soap on these bottles.  If you notice star like cracks on your bottles call Avent's customer service.
B000056HNX THEY HAVE A GOOD QUALITY FOR THE PRICE, IN MY COUNTRY THE BUTTLE AVENT ARE SO EXPENSIVE, I LOVE TRADE AVENT
B000056HNX These bottles are Great! I've never had a problem with any of my bottles leaking. My daughter loves these bottles she's already strating to try to hold bottles herself while I am feeding her. I love them too since they are easy to clean and handle. I highly recommend this collection of bottles.
B000056HNX Ever since the day my daughter got home from the hospital she has been using the Avent bottles. For a few days even the Stage 1 nipples were a little too fast for her, but she got used to it. She loves the nipple shape which is so much like my breast. In all actuality i like the bottle, but my little Aliya loves it. After introducing her to Avent she rejected most other bottles, she wouldn't even take the new Ventair bottles. A great product!
B000056HNX We recieved these bottles as a gift for our son (now 16 months)and expected greatness from Avent. When I opened the first package I was amazed at how stiff the nipples were that are included with these bottles. Stiffness is hardly a correct simulation of the breast. The bottles are also very wide and hard for little hands to grip when they begin to hold their own bottles. I also saw no indication that my son got any less air from using the Avent system. I MUCH prefer the softer, easier to hold, less air producing Playtex Nursers which is what we ended up switching him to.
B000056HNX The nipple is so long that my infant was gagging everytime i tried to feed her. It isn't great for infants that are nursing...My daughter had a fit when i tried to feed her. Not only was she gagging, but she just didn't like the nipple. I used the playtex nurser bottle and she loved it. I have been using those bottles and nipples ever since, and she is doing great when i need to switch from breast to bottle.
B000056HNX I am extremely tired of having to clean up messes after feeding our twin sons with the Avent bottles.  Especially if we are out for a big event and the boys are dressed nicely.  The bottles worked great for the first six months and then.....THEY ALL LEAKED.  It was not a small leak rather, a pouring leak that soaked their shirts.  I hate these bottles and plan to switch!!!
B000056HNX I bought these bottles before my daughter was born and have never regretted it.  I have NEVER had a problem with the bottles leaking and my baby is very happy.  She doesn't have gas problems or gas pains.  She loves drinking from the bottles and refuses to drink from any other bottle.  These bottles are great!
B000056HNX I absolutely love ALL Avent products... their bottles, bottle-warmer, pacifiers, etc.Both of my boy used the Avent bottles, and the ones my first-born used are still being used by my second one. Yes, sometimes there is a slight leak when shaking... I found that is from formula powder getting stuck between the nipple and the bottle, and breaking the seal. So, when it happens I just wipe the rim of the bottle, take the nipple out of the ring, rinse the nipple and ring, and then the problem's gone. These bottle seem virtually indestructible to me, and haven't discolored with age of anything. (Although, old nipples do discolor.)It's hard to believe my mom gave me bottles with little bags in side... what a pain and mess that must have been!!!
B000056HNX We used Avent bottles for several weeks, but our baby was spitting up _all the time_, seemed like she was choking during feedings, and had gas all the time.  We switched to the Playtex VentAire bottles when she was 6 weeks old, and problem solved! No more crying from gas, she hardly ever spits up anymore, and she has a much easier time at feedings.  The flow is slower and it really does cut down on the amount of air she takes in during feedings.  So, I highly recommend trying something other than the Avent bottles for small infants.  Maybe later, when our baby is a bit older we'll pull out the Avent bottles again, but for now, we aren't using anything except Playtex VentAire.
B000056HNX I went through 4 different bottle systems (and a lot of $$) - and I'm sticking with Avent.  Easy to clean - easy to use - no problems.
B000056HNX when i became pregnant i planned on using these bottles, i bought everything bottle warmer,sterilizer,breast pump, and a ton of bottles and nipples. well 2 weeks into using them i threw them out the window. my daughter had  very bad gas. when i switched bottles the gas stopped. Plus the bottles are  expensive......you  have to keep buying new  nipples there are sooo many different sizes. a waste i think, most bottles have 2 fast or slow but there seemed to be 4 different sizes or more.
B000056HNX These bottles were terrible for us.  They leaked no matter how many times I tried and followed the directions.  They also did not keep my daughter from being gassy.  As soon as we changed her bottles to the Dr. Browns she slept through the night with no wake ups.  I was not a big fan of these bottles and neither was my daughter.
B000056HNX These are the best bottles ever! They are a little \"pricey\", but they are worth every penny. My baby gets very little air in her belly since we started with these bottles. They are heaven sent - my baby has a full happy little tummy!
B000056HNX I am breastfeeding currently but I do like to leave the house every so often. When I get the chance I'll pump directly into one of these bottles using the Isis pump. I love the nipples of this bottle because they are the most like the human nipple and my baby has not developed nipple confusing because of this. One thing that all Avent users should know...if you read the directions carefully for the pump, the makers tell you not to use anti-bacterial soap on any of their products. Doing so can cause the plastic to crack. I just wash all the parts as directed using regular dish soap and then sterilize all the parts using the Avent sterilizer. That too is convenient and easy to use.I would recommend these bottles to any woman who is breastfeeding and will have to return to work. Yes, they cost more than most bottles, but if you can afford that little extra you will be very pleased with the results.
B000056HNX Everyone I know has registered for Avent bottles and generally found success.  The shape is handy and comfortable, the pieces easily fit together, and the bottle travels well.  The main problem across the board though is the fact that the bottles leak.  I knew from the beginning not to tighten them too hard, but even so, we have had problems.  It just goes to show there is not perfect bottle or stroller for that matter out there!
B000056HNX I admit it: I am impressed with Avent bottles! They are easily one of the baby products capable of handling extremes without a blink. Example: microwave sterilize them and after a couple of minutes, pour a stream of recently boiled water; mix with formula and put next to the ice bin in the freezer for five minutes. Do this with your average bottle a few times and be ready to say bye-bye to them, but Avent bottles hold on strong and in the process also happen to offer the best bibs in the market (the ones that best mimic the nipple, thus giving your baby the least gas, if you feed the bottle perpendicular to his/her mouth). No wonder they've been voted among the best baby products for several years in a row!
B000056HNX My daughter liked the nipple but got to much air. I tried these and the Dr. Brown but ended up going back to Playtex Nursers(I used these with all my other kids) I wouldnt recommend these.
B000056HNX I bought a bunch of these bottles because many people have recommended them to me.  My son HATES them.. the nipples are too hard for him and it takes him forever to get anything from them..  He wears himself out sucking on them.  I finally switched to the gerber comfort hold bottles which he loves.  They are similar but have softer nipples.  My son is no longer cranky from not getting enough formula. I know alot of people love them, but my son doesnt.  I never had a problem with leaks however as some people said.
B000056HNX I have been using these bottles for about 5 months now.  I really like them.  They do leak on occasion for me, usally when I do not have the top screwed on right.  I find that if the seal between the nipple & the bottle is not right, then you will get a leak.  I solve this problem by just unscrewing the nipple/lid and then rescrewing it on SLOWLY so I know it is getting a good tight even seal.  This always works!
B000056HNX These bottles just didn't work for my baby. We tried and tried for 3 and 1/2 months to get my baby to take these bottles but it just didn't work. My baby is mostly breastfed, and is only given a bottle occasionally, so I didn't give up on these bottles right away, just thinking that he wasn't used to the bottles and that's why he was having a tough time.  My mom babysat and she has raised nine kids, all who were bottlefed, so she is an expert. She said to me that the baby just really can't use this nipple. He chews on it and couldn't suck properly, the nipple seemed to hard for him. He couldn't latch on right and all the milk would spill out the sides of his mouth. Well, I take anything she says seriously! After investing alot of time and money in Avent, I decided to scrap them and start over. I went out and found a nipple that was closest to his pacifier that he loves. I found Gerber Nuk nipples, got four of them for about $4 and bought Especially for Baby bottles for a whopping $2.99 (you get 3) and my baby LOVES them!!!! THe bottles are cute (the gerber bottles would be fine, too, but they weren't cute enough!) He takes the nipple right away and finally the bottles are emptied in no time. What a relief. I am sure Avent is good for some babies, but not mine, even after months of \"training\". My advice is to try different bottles before settling on one kind. One more note, I read the other reviews that talk about leaking, I didn't have this problem at all. The only leaking was from my son's mouth when he couldn't latch on properly. But my cousin used Avent and they leaked terribly for her and she switched to Dr Browns. I would have tried Dr Browns but it looks like their bottles have the same nipples as Avent, too hard and not good for my baby. Expensive isn't always better!
B000056HNX Wonderful bottles, as our daughter won't use anything else.  Wish they were more narrow so she could hold them herself.  Occasional leaking when shaking milk around or mixing a bottle of formula.
B000056HNX I understand that some people might have a problem with this bottle type. If you screw the top on crooked at all or too tightly - you may have issues. But if you take a second and make sure that you are screwing on the top properly - you might have a leaking bottle once every 30 or 40 tries. I have used 4 of the other top brands and am very pleased with Avent. The Brownies are really good too - but just too hard to clean on a regular basis. If you only use a bottle once in a while - use browns - but if you use them a lot - get Avent. Only way to go.
B000056HNX When breastfeeding, these are highly recomended. The problem with a breastfeeding mom is, they do not fit standard US breast pumps. So basicly you have to pump into one bottle, then transfer into this one (this causes a problem for those of us who don't produce quite enough milk --- every drop that is lost in transfer is crutial). Then you are faced with the leaking problem. The directions say to wet the rim to prevent leaking. Well, sometimes that works and sometimes it dosen't. Again, I am reminded of how delicate every drop of milk was. Sometimes these bottles will taunt you. I would test the bottle before giving it to baby... then after I was convinced it wouldn't leak... baby would begin to suck and would instantly be drownded! And there you are, wasted milk, and a hungry baby who is drenched, and really mad by the time you get another bottle ready and her clothes changed!!! The day I stopped breast feeding I switched to playtex vent aire, which only leak once in a blue moon, if you dont put it together right.
B000056HNX This brand of bottles was recommended to me by a certified lactation specialist when I was having trouble with low breastmilk supply and was forced to supplement.  It was extremely important to me to be able to still feed my baby by breast and I was afraid that introducing a bottle to my daughter would cause her to lose interest in me.  I was told that this brand of bottles was created to closely imitate the breast and this is the only brand that you can easily switch baby back and forth from breast to bottle.  And it has worked wonderfully--my baby girl will feed from both without any problem.  I love the shape of the bottles--very comfortable to hold--and they are extremely easy to clean.  Out of the four 4 oz size bottles I own, one of them has a leaking problem, but I can usually solve it by loosening or tightening the cap.  My daughter has no problem sucking from the nipple, as one person reported.  These bottles are great!
B000056HNX I choose these bottles because they are very popular but then realized that the size of them are so large that the baby never really seems to be able to get a good hold on them. I started bottle feeding at 6 months and ended up having to switch and buy an entire new line. After my son turned 1 began to wean him off the bottle and introduced the avent bottles again just to see if he could hold it and it was still way to large for him..... I guess these bottles would work if you plan on bottle feeding a toddler with big hands
B000056HNX Unlike a couple of reviews I read, the only times I've had problems with the Avent bottles leaking is when I screwed the cap on badly or had the nipple in wrong.  Otherwise, they are perfect.  We were told that there may be &quot;nipple confusion&quot; if a baby goes from back and forth from breast to bottle but we haven't had a problem whatsoever.  These nipples are enough like the breast that he does just fine.  (His mouth is open wider than other bottles because he puts the whole nipple in his mouth, like the breast.)  I also use (and love) the Avent breast pump so you can pump right into the bottle and attach a nipple.  It couldn't be easier.
B000056HNX These bottles are superior to any on the market.  One of my daughter's had severe reflux and used the variable flow nipple so that she could have cereal in the bottle.  Avent is the only bottle company that offers this specific type of nipple, which was a life saver.  I tried using the Soothie bottles with my other daughter, because they were cheaper and she has no signs of reflux and I figured what the heck.  Wrong decision!  She ended up with a soaked face and bib every time.  Mind you, my little one is a health, full-term newborn with no latching problems.  So I switched back to the Avent bottles.  Feedings are now mess-free and pleasant!  As for the leaking issue, people should just take the time to read the directions.  Avent clearly states in their directions that if you over tighten the nipple ring onto the bottle, it causes the nipple to wrinkle and the bottle leaks.  The nipple ring just needs to be tight enough for the nipple to grab the bottle and seal.  It is specifically designed to do this.  It's not product error, it's user error.
B000056HNX I have had these bottles with my now 2 1/2 year old and his now 4 month old little brother. They work great and are very durable. These have been dropped, sterelized, boiled, thrown, kicked, bitten, EVERYTHING and they still hold up! If you use the bottle correctly there are no leaks and it is very simple. They also work wiht the Avent Isis Breast Pump. My sons will only take to the \"natural\" nipple, and avents got it! The flow is not too fast, nor is it too hard to get it to come out! The available covers work nicely for carrying them and making sure the nipple is sanitary. The wide-neck allows for easy cleaning too, I never spend more than 2 minutes scrubing a bottle. They also are great for the \"Magic Cups\", those are sippy cups with a soft spout that are no-spill, (made by Avent), my 2 1/2 year old uses them and I dont have to buy a whole set of sippy cups because that top fits on any avent product! These bottles also fit very well in almost any cup holder (unlike the playtex) and greatly reduce my little ones gassy problems. I love these bottles, and the ventair is second, but a VERY far second, Avent is deffinatly much much better and actually do what they say they do, REDUCE GAS! What a lifesaver
B000056HNX I am breastfeeding but feel the need to have a back up plan in case I need to leave so I tried the Avent bottles on the recommendation of my sister.  My 5-month old daughter took right to them.  No nipple confusion!  They are the best!  Now I can be assured that she will be able to eat without me there!
B000056HNX My baby never wanted to take them, or when he did, he looked like he was going to choke (even with the newborn nipples!), and was doing a mess, with milk dripping everywhere. The Evenflo nipples were cheaper and better.
B000056HNX When my daughter was born we stocked up on these bottles because we heard they were good and the price alone would make you think that. Well after using them for about 2 weeks they started to leak. NOT fun at 3:00 in the morning when you shake up a bottle and there is milk fling around.Even worse is when you are feeding and the milk pours out on baby's face. Not only do you have to clean up but your baby doesn't want to wait for a new bottle. After slowly running out of bottles that didn't leak we decided to go with the Playtex Nursers and liners.These work perfect! They don't leak and our baby has less gas. The liners prevent a lot of gas. If you are worried about the cost of liners Target has their own brand that is about half the price. You get 100 of them for maybe $5.00. We haven't had any problems with leaking at all.So I don't recommend the Avent bottles unless you want to be cleaning up milk all the time. But the other Avent things we have like the sterilizer, warmer, & many other products work just perfectly and would recommend all of them! So if you want to give these bottles a try because they do get some great reviews then just buy a few at first.We had no luck with the avent bottles but that doesn't mean they are all bad. I just had to give a warning so you don't lose a lot of money like we did.
B000056HNX These bottles are just okay.  I registered for them because of all the good things that I heard about them.  First of all, they do leak.  Making sure they are completely dry does help but does not prevent the problem entirely.  Second of all, they are expensive.  I have heard just as many good things about other brands of bottles that are a lot less expensive.  For my next baby I will not be using these.
B000056HNX I used these bottles with my son and loved them!This bottle system was excellent and my son almost never had any gas with them like he did with some others I tried out.  He took right to them as a newborn and I didn't have to encourage him like I had to with others.The wide mouth is so nice and makes them so much easier to wash.  The nipples and bottles are extremely durable and held up for a very long time.  As my son got older, I had other bottles I would use for him, but he always preferred the Avent ones.I never had problems with leaking like I had read about, so I don't know much about that.  But there was absolutely no leaking here!There is a great range of accessories that go with this bottle as well, including sterilizers and breast pumps.  Everything was compatible with my Avent breast pump and it made it a dream to use.I am pregnant with my second and Avent is all I am going to buy for her.
B000056HNX I absolutely love these bottles!!  I've been using them for about 4.5 months now and I've NEVER had a problem with leaks!!!!  I have also never overtightened the bottles!!  I love how they are designed.  Because of their width, my daughter was able to hold them at 3.5 months!!  I also love their 'wide-neck', which makes it very easy to fill the bottle while holding a squirming baby!  They are also EXTREMELY easy to clean!  And they are interchangeable!!  I plan on buying the sippy cup spout in a couple of months so that my daughther can learn to drink from a sippy cup using the same bottle!!! My daughter has also never had colic!! I LOVE EM!!! I LOVE EM!!! I LOVE EM!!!  I also have the breast pump and microwave sterilzer which all fit the bottles perfectly!!
B000056HNX these dont require that extra ring to make it leak proof. i had the originals and they work great too but i like the big capacity but not big size of these. they will leak out of the nipple if it is upside down so if your baby feeds themselves, watch that they dont drop it and wedge it somewhere upside downupdated review***** i love avent NATURALLY bottles and trusted that is what i was getting when i looked at all 12 customer photos. well i broke these babies out to use em last night and they are reg avent bottles with the stupid ring on the inside that makes it not leak(something not needed in the other bottle)the plastic used is also completely different. it isnt the hard clear plastic that doesnt cloud or stain, it is the dull non see through plastic that feels pliable. and the oz numbering on these reg bottles is the kind that will scratch and rub off easily. so disappointed that i now have to return these :(
B000056HNX I love these bottles.  My Amelia is hardly every gassy with them.  As for the leaking issue, it is Not the bottle, it's the user!Bottle use de-mystified: you MUST  make sure that the top of the bottle and its threads are DRY and the flange of the nipple on the inside is dry as well.....then when you tightly screw on the cap it should make a soft squeak sound that perfects the seal. If either are wet or have milk on them (like when you open it to re-fill a partially full bottle) you must re-dry the threads and nipple before screwing closed. Motto: \"IF you don't hear a squeak, it's gonna leak\".  Good luck.
B000056HNX We got these bottles because they are supposed to be the closest thing to breast feeding, and they advertise a 'slow-flow' nipple.  Needless to say, the milk just ran down our baby's chin every time.  The slow-flow is not slow enough for a baby who is accustomed to breast feeding and having to work at gettimg milk out.  They are way too expensive and didn't work well for us.
B000056HNX Baby is breast-fed and I registered for these so I could pump and my husband could feed her at night.  Our baby hated the bottle and wouldn't take the nipple.  The nipples, on the Avent, are too long and hard and would make her gag when she attempted to latch on.  We switched to the Platex NaturalLatch and now she takes a bottle.  The nipples on the Platex are much softer and shorter.  Baby switches between the bottle and breast now, no problem.
B000056HNX I like the nipple flow on these bottles for my newborn, as well as the small bottle size, but I found that the nipple only vented air back into the bottle properly about 50% of the time.  The rest of the time, my baby would nurse until the pressure was too great, de-latch, and air would flood into the bottle through the nursing hole.
B000056HNX I found the nipple to be way too hard for my newborn son to suck.  I then ran out and got the Munchkin Tri-flow.  You can change how fast the milk flows out of the bottle as you baby grows and the nipple is much softer!Munchkin also sells just the nipple that is compatable with the Avent bottle.  So, if you've already purchased the avent bottles your money has not gone to waste!  The only problem is that the Tri-flow is still fairly new and is very hard to find!  Good Luck!
B000056HNX The Avent brand of bottles is an outstanding product.  For those experiencing leaks, it is simply because the bottles are an interlocking system and must be screwed on properly.  I have had no problems using these bottles, and yes I have experienced an occasional leak which I notice while I'm shaking the bottle because I have not screwed the cap on properly.  These are well worth the price paid.  I have tried both Dr. Brown's and Playtex VentAire and find the Avent products to be superior to both of these.  Highly recommended by this mom!Update March 06:  one more great feature about the Avent bottles -- they sell a sippy cap that can replace the nipple, so your investment goes into toddlerhood with no need to buy additional sippy cups!  They are leakproof, and come in a 2 pack just as the replacement nipples do.  I have found them in Toys R Us, since my local Babies R Us does not carry them.  Still a great product in my book!
B000056HNX I have to agree with reviewers, the nipple of the Avent bottles is great. It's obvious watching my baby that he latches on similar to the way he does on the breast.The problem is that the bottles leak like crazy. My little guy ends up wearing as much milk as he drinks. I've tried all of the suggestions, but have had no success in making the bottle leak proof. I've had to go out and buy different bottles with nipples I don't like as much just so that I don't have the mess.
B000056HNX Avent bottles are one of the best out there. Handy and easy to clean. They protect your baby from getting gas while he eats. But if your baby is really gasy and has colic, I recomend you the Dr brown bottles. I suggest you buy or register for both (avent and dr brown)so if your baby does ok with gas and colic you use avent, and if not, you use dr brown (at least for a while). You will notice the difference in a few weeks. But I most tell you avent work very well with gasy babies, so if you dont want to invest too much  money in bottles, avent will do great.
B000056HNX these are wonderful, they were recomended by a friend of mine and i have no regrets. no other bottle compites with avent!
B000056HNX We think these bottles are very durable and easy to use. The markings didn't come off in the dishwasher, even after repeated washings. Also, Avent makes a long-spouted sippy top that fits on these bottles. Using this helps switch from bottle to cup.
B000056HNX We've been using these bottles since our son was 1 week old, and they work great. He had no problem with nipple confusion switching between this bottle and the breast. We've had no problems with leaking, and I love the fact that you can convert the bottles to sippy cups later.One note for breastfeeding moms -- your baby may be able to use the #1 nipple for much longer than a formula-fed baby, since it more closely resembles how the milk comes from you. So wait before buying #2 & #3 nipples, because you may not need them!
B000056HNX I bought these after trying the Dr. Brown's system (don't waste your money there.) I love Avent bottles and so does my daughter. Easy to assemble, wash and use. My daughter likes the easy to latch on nipple and I like being able to purchase faster flow nipples as needed. Good quality bottles, don't leak and have easy to read oz./ml. measurements.
B000056HNX A lactation consultant recommended these bottles to me. I bought one to make sure my baby liked it before buying more. I didn't want to hassle with the disposable liners. I feel my baby doesn't swallow as much air. A lot of babies are gassy and I wouldn't blame it on the bottle.  I also like the idea of the different sized nipples to adjust the flow.  I have only used size 1 because we need her to slow down; she eats to fast and gets a tummy ache.These bottles also fit perfectly in my bottle warmer (the first years) excellent choice!
B000056HNX I was told that Avent bottles were the bottles to get and they were the only ones I ever gave to my son.  I was very pleased with them right off, so I never bothered to try any others.  He took the nipple right away and did not have any nipple confusion during the time I was both nursing and giving him a bottle.  I have not had any problems with leaking.  If the nipple is screwed on correctly, not a drop comes out while I shake it to mix up milk or formula.  The wide mouth makes the bottles very easy to clean.  I just use a bottle brush with warm, soapy water, then put the bottle, nipple and ring in my Avent steam sterilizer (which I love).  I have been using the bottles for seven months now and they are still in great shape.I have a friend who said her baby would not take the Avent nipples.  Since Avent bottles are not universal and can't be used with other brands of nipples and rings, you may want to keep this in mind before you spend much money on a lot of them.I think that most babies start eating more than 4 ounces during their second month, so you probably won't need many of this size.  I had seven bottles and that was the perfect amount for us.  Although my son uses the 9 ounce bottles now, I still use some of the 4 ounce bottles to mix and store formula that I add to his cereal.
B000056HNX I have been using nothing but these bottles for the first 6 months of my baby's life. Yes they WILL LEAK if you don't pull the nipple all the way through. But that is an easy fix! I never had an issue with my baby falling asleep during a feeding or the flow being too fast. And colic has never been a problem here either.I breastfeed and pump for my baby and I found that she went easily from bottle to breast as early as 2 weeks old. I attribute it to the unique design of the nipple which encourages her to open her mouth wide instead of tucking her lip in to suck on a smaller nipple.Also these can be converted to sippy cups. They are very durable as well and so easy to clean. I threw all the other bottles I got as a shower gift right out in the trash - my baby will not drink from them.
B000056HNZ I really like this pump.  Works great sort of a pain to clean but easier than having to clean tubing on an electric.  The bottles however are junk.  After one use they leaked from under the plastic disk.  EVERY bottle I have leaks.  In order to stop it is a pain.  I pull up on the nipple and roll it around clockwise to make sure it's in there right, then I use a rubber gripper and tighten the crap out of it so it won't leak.  What a PAIN!  I sold my lot on ebay and replaced them w/ the Playtex vent air.  I did save one bottle so I could pump into it though.
B000056HNZ I bought this to use with my Avent bottles (which by the way LEAK) and I was very disappointed. My doctor told me to pump to stimulate my milk production which was coming in slowly. I could not get very much with this and needless to say it was not helping. Once I started using a Medela Electric pump, I got tons of milk! I was skeptical about the price, but it's totally worth it if you want to be able to use a pump on a regular basis.
B000056HNZ I bought this pump mainly because were always out and about.  I am actually a stay at home mom but this came in handy in MANY ways.  When my daughter was first born she was re-admitted to the hospital at 3 days for jaundice.  I had read that breat milk can increase or worsen jaundice so I pumped to save the milk for when she got out of the hospital.  The ice packs were definatly a plus and so was the cooler bag.  I had frozen just the bag to keep it cooler along with the ice packs and that really helped keep it colder longer.  The bottles that comes with it are ok.  I don't recommend Avent bottles for feeding but for storage they're perfect.  But if you prefer Avent you can just pop a nipple on the bottle and wha-la, ready to feed.  These bottles can go from pump, to fridge/freezer, to warmer, to bottle with not problem.As for the pump, once you get used to assembling it its a breeze.  It's also VERY comfortable to use with or without the &quot;petals&quot;.  I NEVER had a problem with not pumping (or producing) enough milk.  This also came in handy and quickly reduced engorgement for me.  All I had to do was pump for about 5  min on each side and it was instant relief and baby latched on better.I highly recommend this pump for everyone.  It's comfortable, efficient, whisper quiet, and easy to clean and put together.  A must have.
B000056HNZ This is a great pump... forget about spending over $60 on something you are not sure you are going to use too much... NOT TO MENTION - now that I use this pump daily - I am still happy I did not spend the $260 for the 'Mack-daddy&quot; - this is comfortable and fast and easy to work with.
B000056HNZ My daughter was in the NICU the first day of her life, and then the special care nursery the next few days, so I had to use the hospitals electric medela dual breast pump to express milk. i returned home and rented the medela for a month and hated it. It HURTS my nipples. My friend got me this Isis breast pump kit and I tried it. I LOVE it! I used it since my daughter was about 2 weeks old. I doesnt hurt my nipples like the electric breast pump does as I can control it with every squeeze. It doesnt hurt my wrist (as one might think.) I only supplement my daughter with one bottle of EBM at night. It takes me 10-15 minutes and I can express 5 ounces with this pump! I LOVE IT!Oh, and it is virtually silent so I can pump one breast as I breast feed my daughter on the other!!!
B000056HNZ I mostly use the Ameda electric, but used this on a weekend trip and was very pleased with the milk volume.  I get most of the milk in just a few minutes and the one hand operation is simple.Drawbacks: it can be tricky to get the suction going, but little pumps at first followed by long slow pumps will eventually get it. Also, I've found that I can still get milk out with my electric even after I'm done with the Isis.  It is a little higher maintenance to clean, but I still recommend it.
B000056HNZ It's a great manual pump, but it's just a manual pump after all. Manually pumping both breasts one at a time takes more than twice as long as double electric pumping to get the same amounts of milk. It would be impossible for me to keep pumping at work if I had to take that much time out of every work day. However I do keep this pump in my desk drawer for emergencies (like the time I forgot my other pump at home) or for out-of-office meetings (because it's small and discrete). It's also great for occasional home use or for women who need to leave the house with a pump every once in a while. I'm giving it 4 stars because I don't think it should be advertized for use at a full time job.
B000056HNZ This is a great pump. I haven't had any issues with it. I pump constantly as my son is very finicky as to when he wants a bottle or a breast in his mouth.  Easy to use and clean. The carrying case is great for when I go back to work and it can also be used as a carrying bag for keeping milk/formula cold when you go out.  While I love the pump I am not happy with the Avent Bottles. They can leak easily if you over or under tighten the bottle.  Let me tell you at three in the morning you dont' want to worry about that stuff.  You want to get a nipple on and feed.  I recommend the pump but not their bottles.  Sometimes if I put down the pump on the bed and it tips a bit I get spillage from where the pump connects to the bottle.
B000056HNZ I based my decision to purchase this pump based on all the reviews it got.  However, it takes me about 20 minutes to pump 4 ounces.. on a good day!! Luckily, I have an awesome boss, who allows me all the time I need to pump.. I average 2-3 ounces every hour and half.. at 20 minutes at a time.. which is rediculous. If I could, I would purchase an electric pump, because as my baby grows, I don't see how I'd be able to catch up to her growing appetite using this pump, and not spend my whole day in the bathroom pumping.  On the plus side.. all the litle extras it came with are great, and the case is discreet and keeps the bottles cold for a few hours.
B000056HNZ I am a first time mother and a stay at home mom. Since I am not working I wanted a hand pump rather than electric for occasional night out so I got Isis. The first time I used it (1 week after giving birth), it took me 45 minutes to pump 1 1/2 oz! I thought it to be terrible! So I bought a Madela electric.But as months passed I got a little bit more experienced in breast feeding, I realized that if I knew how stimulate a \"let down\" that the Isis would have worked for me. It took me 45 minutes the first time I used Isis because I never had a let down. Unlike Madela which simulate a baby's sucking which then stimulated a \"let down\", with Isis it is up to me to get myself to \"let down\".Isis would work great for any mother if: 1-you pump while your baby is breastfeeding on the other breast or 2-if you know how to stimulate your breast enough to stimulate a \"let down\".My Isis did squeak when I used it, so beware if you plan on pumping with this in public if this sort of thing embarasses you.
B000056HNZ I had NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO idea..!!! I only recieved this pump - no electrical one and I wanted 2 diiiiie! I was in pain for days after I gave birth,irritable because of the lost of sleep and trying to conform to the babies temporary sleeping pattern. I had a low milk supply and breastpumping for 1 hour for only 4ounces - this was not a joke! I wanted 2 diiiie I tell you.. I would finish pumping and da baby would be getting up for a feeding... NOooooo! already, I would think... yes and with only 4 oz to show. Here I go with the stupid MANUEL pump... NO.. I NOW know better.... electronic and a good brand- so what you pay 300. and change its worth your sanity, sleep, time, energy and appreciation for the bond with the baby. My milk supply in time grew (not soon enough) I am still nursing and again the manuel pump and I did NOT have a good relationship. We started off badly
B000056HNZ I read all the reviews on this pump but still wasn't convinced about buying this pump. I originally purchased a Gerber pump and it worked until it cracked. I asked a lactation consultant what kind of pump she'd recommend and she recommended Avent and Medela. I needed a pump in my price range so I chose the Avent.I like how the suction mimics a baby's latch but milk gets stuck everywhere and it leaks all over the place. The pump also makes an annoying squeaking noise and sometimes I lose suction. I'd recommend this pump over Gerber though. I will give it credit though, it's a lot easier to take apart and clean.
B000056HNZ This isis breast pump set is great. The only thing I have a problem with is the little noise it makes whenever I pump and it feels not private. Besides that, its very conviencent to use and easy. I think, since its plastic rubbing plastic it just makes the noise after awhile you pump.
B000056HNZ I love the Advent line & highly recommend their bottles & microwave sterilizer, but this breast pump is awful! The prong that connects to the handle, which creates the vacuum to pull the milk out, consistently becomes unlatched breaking the vacuum so you have to fix it and start all over. The only reason it got a two stars rating was because the pump handle does fit extremely well on the bottles and everything fits in the bag nicely.
B000056HNZ I bought this pump after seeing the success a coworker had with the ISIS pump. I'm back to work full time and it has been working very well for me. I started pumping at about 3 weeks, and was very fustrated at first. It was tricky to figure out the timing and how much suction to use to get a good let down and milk flow. After a few calls to the Avent customer service line (who were wonderful, very helpful and patient), I was getting much better results. By the time I went back to work I had a very nice supply of milk in the freezer and was comfortable pumping at work.Why I like it - 1) it's discrete, you can pump anywhere without the noise of an electic pump and the black case looks like any other professional bag a woman would carry 2) it's portable, It's small and light to carry around - even with a few bottles of milk. 3) it's easy - not only to pump with but assembly and cleaning are a breeze. I know a few reviews state that there are too many parts and it's hard to put together, but I can do it in 15 seconds flat  4) it's comfortable - I think any breastpump may be awkward to use at first, but compared to an electric pump I tried my nipples and breasts were much more comfortable with the ISIS pumpI think for the price, you can't beat it. Also the realm of accessories available is impressive. Avent has thought of every possible need you may have.
B000056HNZ I am sold on the Avent Isis Breast Pump--it works great for me.  I nursed my 2nd child exclusively for 13 months, and I used this pump to express milk so that my husband could feed him.  He never really took on the bottle, but that's a different story.  Anyway, I just couldn't justify having to spend a couple of hundred dollars for a pump--maybe if I was working and wanted to continue breastfeeding, I probably would have.  But I was a stay at home mom and just used the pump to express every now and then.  I had no problem expressing 4 ounces of milk in about 10 minutes, and it didn't hurt either--it actually felt comfortable.  I had the Evenflo electric pump for my first child--now that one was very uncomfortable--it felt like it was sucking the life out of you.  Maybe it was me being a first time mom, but I swore off that pump.  I still nursed my first child for 13 months but not exclusively--he got both breastmilk and formula.Now, I am on my 3rd child.  I figured after having such an easy time breastfeeding my 2nd child, it would be a piece of cake the 3rd time around.  Well, it wasn't.  She did not latched on properly and I got really sore within the first couple of days.  But I did not want to give up breastfeeding, so I purchased another one of the Avent Isis Breast Pump, because I wanted to help increase my milk supply.  It worked and I got to breastfeed again exclusively--my baby wasn't getting frustrated anymore because my milk supply increased.  Then when she was 6 weeks old, I had to leave her (unexpectedly) to attend my father's funeral in California.  I couldn't take her with me--she was too young.  I was gone for 3 days, and I did not want my milk supply to dwindle down, so this pump helped a lot.  I was able to express some before I left so she would have some breastmilk along with formula supplement while I was gone.  And then I pumped while I was gone--I did it on the plane restroom and airport restrooms very discretely, and I was done in about 15 minutes at a time.  And because it is manual, I was able to express whenever and whereever I needed to.  This helped me  keep my milk supply while I was gone so when I got back, I just continued on like I was not gone.  Thanks Avent.
B000056HNZ Although I haven't been using this pump for very long, I've been able to get very good results. Of course, pumping takes practice but this pump works great for beginners. It is very easy to set up and clean...making it easy to take along. I also like that the bottles fit onto the pump-nothing extra to buy (and clean). I also have an electric pump but prefer this pump when I am home during the day. I find that I can more quickly get it ready and am able to pump one side as soon as my baby is finished nursing on the other side. I definitely recommend having a manual pump, even if you plan on or already have an electric.
B000056HNZ If you are only going to be pumping once in a blue moon, then this is a great pump for you.  I found it to be an incredible nusance, so I borrowed a friend's Medela electric pump.  Never used this Back to Work pump more than twice after using hers!  Why spend a longer amount of time pumping that you have to (and yes it does take longer even though the manual says their stats say otherwise).  With our next child, I will definitely be buying electric!
B000056HNZ Being a stay-at-home Mom, I don't need to pump frequently, but when I do pump, this item is terrific!  Easy to use.  I'm able to pump a 4 oz. bottle in 5 minutes.  I suggest using it without the let down massage cushion.  It works better for me without it.  Easy to clean and case makes storage easy.
B000056HNZ I borrowed this breast pump from my sister and it is awesome!  This is my third child and I have breastfeed all three.  I have tried them all and this one is great.  The one-hand squeeze handle allows me to do other things while pumping!  I am only expressing twice a day so it is easy to clean!  What a great investment.
B000056HNZ The Avent pump in this kit is very good. I also like the carrying bag, which is subtle and good for work - it can even be used as a lunch box when you are done breastfeeding.However, the nipples in this kit are very hard and the speed on the slow flow was far too fast for my newborn (when I tested the milk on my wrist, I didn't get a drop - it squirts). There are better bottles out there too, that keep the baby from getting too much air. Instead of the Avent bottles, I have started using the Playtex nurser system - which means I pump into the Avent bottles and pour them into the nurser (the Playtex system sells a kit with a pump adapter - but it does not work with Avent). This has worked fine for me, though if I were not pumping at work I would not pay the extra money to have the kit. Since I pump at work, the insulated bag is helpful.
B000056HNZ I used this product briefly and found it to be great for the price.  I used the electric Medella pump in the hospital and found this pump to be very comparable.  I actually think the Isis may have been more comfortable.  I would recommend to anyone who is considering breast feeding.
B000056HNZ I had this pump with my first child back in 2003 and I worked great for when I was at work but it was messy. The milk always seemed to leak out underneath the plastic insert, so I took that out and it helped a little bit. I also had probably with the pump maybe working a little TOO WELL and would stimulate my \"let down\" and so it was a panic to keep myself from wetting my shirt on the other breast I wasn't pumping, while I kept pumping and answered phones! I was a night receptionist so I just pumped away while working.I like that it comes with a bag that is nice and stylish. I saved this and I will use it with my next baby due in Sept. 2009.
B000056HNZ After trying a dual electric pump that was very uncomfortable for me I tried the Isis berast pump and never looked back. I could not control the suction with the electric pump and,  however with the Isis I was able to control the pressure and was able to completely empty both breasts in less than 20 minutes total. The cushioning made the pump very comfortable. And my hand never got tired from manually pumping. I used this product years ago with my daughter and I am adding it to my registry for my second child. I highly recommend this for anyone who would like to continue breast feeding.Follow-up: My youngest daughter is now six weeks old and I still love this pump. Its a moust-have for breastfeeding mothers.
B000056HNZ When my son was put in the NICU, he immediately stopped nursing.  I'm assuming it was due to the stress.  While I was at the hosptal, I used their Ameda Elite hospital pump, but at home, I was pumping full time with this pump.  It gets the job done quickly and the handle is very comfortable.The milk can leak out the sides, which can be very upsetting, especially if you're pumping for a hospitalized newborn and you need every drop you can get.  You just have to make sure to keep the pump perfectly upright.  Don't tilt it at all!I didn't have any problems with creaking, and if I did, I'd just take it apart and put it together and the problem was solved.I also know some had problems with the milk getting backed up and the silicone star not letting the milk flow to the container, but you just have to be sure to release the handle completely so the milk can flow out.  Another way to get it into the container is the break the suction between the pump and breast and pump the handle a few times.This pump worked great and I was able to come up with ways to avoid problems until I had used it (full time) for a month and a half.  The star would start getting sucked up into the top even if I slightly pumped the handle.  I emailed Avent and they emailed me back and had some great tips (great customer service, by the way!).  They said to boil the silicone parts for 10 minutes in water and 2 teaspoons of white vinegar... and viola! Problem solved.  If you use it as much as I did, the tackiness of the silicone wears and has to be fixed by the boiling.Lastly, I read some had problems getting everything to fit in the bag.  It takes talent, I tell you!  My advice is this: Remember how it was packaged in the first place!  Before you take it out of the bag, take note of how it's arranged.  After several attempts, I finally got it all back in.All in all, it's a great pump if you don't want to invest in an electric pump, or if you're only pumping occationally and you work around some of the little issues.  In those instances, I'd definitely recommend it!  I have an Ameda Purely Yours as well, 
B000056HNZ I received this as a shower gift and boy am I thankful! After I returned from the hospital and my milk came in, boy was I engorged!! I hadn't expected to have to use this until I actually went back to work, but I was hurtin bad and was so greatful I had this already. I don't know what I would have done if I didn't have one yet-probably exploded!I went back to work as my son turned 2 months old. I wanted to continue breastfeeding, and this has helped me do just that. I work in a small office with nothing but a handful of men...with one bathroom! So I didn't want an electric one where everyone could hear an odd humming sound coming from the closed door. With this one, I can discreetly pump in the bathroom for about 10 minutes. It expresses the milk pretty fast in my opinion and it doesn't really hurt. Maybe because my nipples are toughened up now. It's great to store the milk in if you need to or for the ride home. It keeps it at a good temperature until you can get to a refridgerator again (I don't use the cold packs).All in all, this is a great breast pump set in every way.Something else that is great is that I own the Avent Microwave Steam Sterilizer and it has slots especially for the Avent pump to click into-and Avent bottles. It only takes 4 minutes in the microwave to have everything sterilized. Awesome all the way around!
B000056HNZ Two of my friends used this one daily and recommended it to me. One of them went back to work and bought Medela just for pumping at work. I simply got this set to use both at home & work, and am I glad that I didn't need electric pump to express milk quickly - with ISIS, I can get 1 oz foremilk in less than a minute! Of course it takes a little longer for hindmilk because the pressure from the breast is less by then. On average it takes less than 10 minutes to pump 4-5 oz.I was back to work 2 weeks ago & have been using it twice a day. Before this I used it 1-2 times a day to pump a ounce or so foremilk for 6 weeks, and it works very well for me. All the parts are sturdy. You just have to make sure that you don't turn the connecting \"neck\" while pumping, else you'll drop the bottle!The numerous parts are a little daunting to assemble in the beginning, but you'll be an expert in no time. Just be careful with the little white valve when washing the parts, without it the pump won't work. But the kit does have extra valves.The insulated carrying bag is attractive and discrete. There's even a non-transparent drawstring pouch for storing breastmilk-filled bottles in the common fridge at work where everyone keeps their lunches! The included bottles, nipples etc represent extra values.I'm extrememly pleased with this Avent product and have also bought Avent Microwave Express Sterilizer in which the ISIS pump parts can be sterilzed.Jan 3,2003: I've been working full time and nursing for the past 4.5 months using Isis exclusively. I'm so happy to report that it's been working great for me without any problems at all. My now 6.5 month old daughter is at a healthy 65 percentile.
B000056HNZ I love my Isis. A friend bought it to me as a gift and I use it everyday. First it was a little hard, but it was only because my milk wasn't coming out at all. But after my production started, the pump started to work perfectly. Highly recommended :)
B000056HNZ it's THE best item you can buy! practical, easy to carry, easy to store.maybe, it should come with 3 9oz bottles and 1 4oz, instead of 2 and 2; becuase babies rapidly start needing more and more...also all mags that come with these items are great, with great tips, some of them are not even included in m. stoppard's book! very useful.i STRONGLY recommend this item!
B000056HNZ It can be difficult to get started with this pump. Once you achieve letdown it's great but it can take 10-15 minutes to get there. DON'T freeze milk in these bottles - use a bag - they didn't seal properly and the milk went bad.
B000056HNZ This pump is comfortable, easy to use, and affordable.  I wish I could find replacement parts more easily - my only complaint.
B000056HNZ I pump just as fast from this pump as I do from the electric hospital grade one that I rented for the first month! Of course, you can only pump one side at a time, but I actually like haveing the other hand free to read or email.The AVENT instructions say that some users can use the pump without the \"cushion.\" I did it this way first because when I was putting it together I did not see the petal cushion. It worked great. When I later found the petal cushion, and tried it - the pump did not work as well for me. So if you are having problems with the pump try it without the cushion. I think it has something to do with your size and the suction as to which works best. The hospital grade electric pumps did not have cushions, so that was what I was used to anyway.My only complaint is that the star vaulve is annoying. It sometimes falls out - while pumping and suction is lost and you have to take the whole thing apart to put the star vaulve back in. For this reason, I like the cheapo Medela hand pump a little better.But for all you out there deciding between electric and manual - I am one user telling you that I get EXACTLY the same results with this manual as with an electric. (4 to 6 ounces in 15 to 20 minutes)
B000056HNZ My friend gave me her pump when she was finished with it, I just boiled all the parts, and then threw them in the dishwasher.  Anyway, the pump is fine for a bottle, I only use it once in the day, but during the pumping time it will lose it's suction or you have to get it on just right before it will really get the milk quantity you want.  It took me about 4 times (4 days) to figure out  how the pump suction needs to be for myself.The other complaint I have with the pump is the parts that screw together to make the pump complete come unscrewed throughout the pump time.  (the bottle, and the other screwed on piece to the pump.)  This is really anoying while you're trying to pump.Overall it's ok, but I think I can find another one.
B000056HNZ I have been using this twice a day since going back to work almost four months ago. With it I can express milk discreetly and quickly. I can get between 7 and 10 ounces in 10 minutes. I have never used an electric pump so I can't compare but if you are looking for a manual pump this one is perfect.
B000056HNZ Mine just didn't work with this pump.  It wasn't operator error - it worked, it just didn't work well, and it didn't work equally well on both breasts (one is larger).  I had to go with an electric, and even then I still would have been better off with a variable shield.
B000056J1C I bought other more expensive racks. This one is the best. Simple and goes with all kitchen decor, love it.
B000056J1C I was looking for a small drying rack for Sigg water bottles and this is perfect. It has two different sized adjustable arms so that you can arrange it to suit your needs. Also, not pictured, is a little attachment for tops and lids.
B000056J1C This thing is pretty good for a bottle drying rack, comes with a little shelf for drying nipples, Sturdy, drains well, allows you to make different configurations in consideration of your bottle sizes. I like the size because it isn't huge butcan dry several bottles. COmes with a kinda flimsy bottle brush, will be a back up. Good product.
B000056J1C Using it for all the baby items - pacifiers, nipples, etc... Holds the items well, easy to put them on. Wish it could fold up and fit in the cupboard when we aren't using it, then would give it 5 stars.
B000056J1C This is small, sturdy, and great for the price.  It takes up minimal space on the counter yet holds all my bottle pieces and accessories and then some.  I would recommend this over some of the fancier ones.  It does the job well.
B000056J1C I wanted a small rack to dry my granddaughters bottles and accessories - and this works nicely.  Holds the right amount, drains right into the sink and also has a small hook on tray for drying items that won't fit on one of the &#34;stems&#34;.  Just what I wanted.
B000056J1W Sticks well and comes with a bunch of additional adhesive stickers.
B000056J1W Protects heads from sharp corners well enough. Little fingers are eventually able to figure out that it's fun to pull off though. Just needs to be re-taped.
B000056J1W This a necessary item. I hated to have to cover my coffee table and have my house look baby proof(I even avoided it for a while) but after two big bumps i bought this item.Its easy to install and I like that I could cut it to the size i needed. It came with the corners which is great. The tape it uses is perfect because it really stays put. My baby has tried to pull at it and it doesn't come off.This color is light enough that doesn't call too much attention in my living room.
B000056J1W I have purchased what feels like 100 ft of this stuff to protect my son who is quite a climber and runner.Overall I would say this is the best stuff but loses on star because sometimes that double sided sticky tap doesn't stick right.But you can't go wrong and should buy this to give yourself some piece of mind
B000056J1W These edge guards come in handy in a number of places. They stick very well, even on uneven surfaces.  They are easy to cut and to mount exactly where needed.  The variety of colors is also nice to try and match various types of furniture or hazards.  I've deployed them in some areas for my own protection too ... I've stubbed my toe one too many times on my bed leg in the dark heading to change a diaper ... put a piece on each corner, and saved several swear words as a result!They've saved the day in several spaces:- Fireplace hearth (even on uneven red brick they stick well)- Underside of dining room table edges and corners- Edges of dressers and furniture- Edges of bedpostThey include 3M adhesive that sticks very well. My only complaint is that they provide the adhesive in strips rather than a roll. So you have to pull of many pieces and join them together on a long strip.  For best grip you need to put it on each side of the inside &#34;L&#34; of the protectors. A roll would be much faster to apply.
B000056J1W I have only owned this for a few days but I love it so far. It's very cushion-y and very soft. It has already prevented my child from a scrape. It comes with a bunch of different sizes of tape as well. Its double sided and seems to be holding up.
B000056J1W So easy to install too!  I did the corners first so it was easier.  You have enough tape for every square inch.
B000056J1W I would have been okay with just the table corners. I have a glass table and I was worried about my 1-year-old niece visiting.The corners helped a lot as did putting a tablecloth over my table. There was no way the table guard was going to work around my glass table even with the tape included though. It's for a much thicker table and my glass table was too thin.Also, my niece is still crawling so the guard wasn't necessary. Even when she stood up, she couldn't reach the table and she was safe as houses in her booster seat and high chair.
B000056J1W This item, it is so good. it protected my 10 month old son from many bruises.  Baby crawls without looking what is ahead, he hit the coffee table edge mostly, but I have this on the edge... It is very helpful to have it on the sharp edges.  I wanted to tape all the corner of my house.
B000056J1W worked great for a few weeks but living in a hot humid climate the seals eventually loosened up. very easy to use and install
B000056J1W I have used it on both a glass-topped table & wooden crib. It was easy to put on & has been very durable, despite the best efforts of my very active 1 year old!  Very functional & economical.
B000056J1W i reviewed similar product from this company before. it is a good product which can absorb force well so all in all it serves it purpose well.One thing it can improve on is the adhesive glue used for bonding. Currently it uses 3M tapes, which is okay but over time a child's curiosity will grow they will pick on it and over a period of two months of picking it may come off. But they give you plenty of 3M tapes, so you can put it together again.
B000056J1W Easy to apply, stays on, and is perfectly cushioned for protecting little heads (and also great for teething!) Make sure your table is clean, you might even want to go over the edges with rubbing alcohol. If your table is dirty, it won't stick as well! I've seen some reviews saying that it's not very attractive... of course it isn't! That's not what it's made for. We love this, and highly recommend it!
B000056J1W With an adventurous and slightly clumsy baby, these have gone a long way towards avoiding bruises and bumps while she learns to walk and run. The ability to cut the padding and included double sided sticking tape with scissors make it easy to pad sharp furniture edges of all lengths. However there are a couple of things we have found that help us optimize its usage.  We learned to make sure the ends of any piece were very well stuck down and didn't jut out otherwise our baby would pick at them and start peeling off the padding - to avoid this, it helped to put double-sided tape all the way to the end of the piece on both inner edges.  Also we didn't use the precut edges because we found that our baby managed to rip them off pretty easily and then tried to eat the backing tape.Just be aware that if your baby is teething, the spongy texture of the padding makes it tempting for them to bite on.  I'm not 100% comfortable with that as it is fire retardant-treated despite being labeled non-latex and non-toxic.  For now I just wipe them down several times with hot water and dry well or try to put other more tempting teethers within reach.
B000056J1W The instructions that came with this are terrible. The diagrams are really tiny and have no labels. The written instructions for Step 1 say \"see the diagram\" and do not elaborate, making the instructions worthless. The 3M sticky tape is REALLY sticky. Do not expect to get it off your furniture or to reuse these edge guards - the tape will cling to your furniture and to the guards, destroying both.In the end I was unable to install my guards properly - they attached to the furniture crookedly and then I couldn't un-stick them in order to make it right. The guards are nice, thick foam, but that doesn't matter if the installation goes miserably.You can see my photos of the final results I got in the Customer Image Gallery.
B000056J1W Nice bumpers. Very soft and easy to place. The only down fall is that they may be too soft. My daughter stood up to it and but a chunk off the day after we put it up!
B000056J1W This is pretty simple to put in place and not too much of an eyesore as childproofing goes. I'd recommend it.
B000056J1W I like it. It is nice. It sticks nicely. and soft. Not worried about baby's head hitting the table anymore. Thank you.
B000056J1W I gave it only four stars because the item arrived with some of it missing,that was however resolved.The product does what it is supposed to.
B000056J1W My crazy bruiser has made this probably the best baby purchase I made.  Doesn't come unstuck like the crappy clear one I tried before.sticks to my wood coffee table and glass trim on tv stand.Haven't tried to take it off yet so I don't know what that's going to be like but it was def worth it.
B000056J1W I bought thisPrince Lionheart Table Edge Guard with 4 Corners, Greyin hope of protecting my son from bumps on our coffee table. Well i procrastinated and didn't put it up till this week. My son is 10 months and is full blown running so it was time. problem was i could not find the adhesive to attach the thing to the table. So i improvised. We measured the foam and cut accordingly to make it a tight fit. we then attached the corner pieces to the cut out parts using gorilla glue and then clear packing tape to re-enforece the hold. finally we put it on the table, it has just enough give to put on and off but not enough that LO will pull it off easily and huge plus for us...no damage to our pottery barn table! once i get so me photos i will attach but for the moment it is serving its purpose and we are very happy! another plus we had about 6 inches left over that we used to cover our desk pull out keyboard thing. can't beat that.
B000056J1W We LOVE Prince Lionheart products.  We decided to get the edge guards.  This are awesome around our coffee table, end tables and entertainment center.  The are soft and fit perfectly.
B000056J1W Great Idea and has helped out alot as our son seems to always be bumping his head on stuff in the near vicinity of him. However the glue on this device could be a little stronger because soon after applying it to what ever you need it on, our son figured out how to pull it off and now it won't stay on!
B000056J1W I used this product on our fireplace to cover up the sharp edges but it doesn't stick very well to natural stone.  So occasionally I have to re-stick it once it comes loose. Other than that it looks great and helps protect my baby from injury.
B000056J1W I just put this up yesterday and was glad I did. My daughter been using the coffee table to pull her self up to stand and also been crawling through it to play with the stuff underneath. Just right after I put it on she was doing that! She even bumped her head on the edge! Thank god this was on so she was fine!Not sure how it would work on a walking/running baby into corners/edges. But this seem to be doing well. It's nice and thick.The tape that came with it isn't that sticky though. It makes it easy to stick and restick back on so you get it on good. But at the same time, I fear my daughter would figure out that she can pull it off.I'll see how that goes but so far I'm content with this.Cutting the roll itself seems a bit annoying. because I can't seem to get a STRAIGHT edge using a scissor.
B000056J1W Very cushioned.  They stick fairly well, but a toddler could peel them off if motivated.  I'm not wild about the brown color, but this is a case where the safety and thick soft material outweighs my aesthetic sense.  We have even used this around a rock fireplace base and it stayed stuck.  The longer guard is easy to cut for whatever length is needed.  I've reordered and used this product for two houses and I will reorder again if I ever need more.
B000056J1W I think my daughter would pull off any table corner I put on, but this one at least seems the most sturdy and is easy to put back on when she does pull it off. The chocolate is the closest color we could get to our espresso tables, nothing is going to look great, but this at least looks decent and clean.
B000056J1W Just installed in on my coffee table and it is not an eyesore! It really blends in at the same time that protects my son from the sharp corners. Will be buying more to apply to the underside corners and the leg corners - for some reason my son keeps hitting his head on every corner possible!
B000056J1W This a great product. Also it would be good if you could buy plastic cover for the top of the crib railling.
B000056J1W This edge and corner set is a great value. We started with just corners and found we missed a lot of other dangerous areas, including a knee-high tall toy chest with thick drawers. This set was perfect to secure the entire thing. It was easy to trim and apply. I prefer the gray to the chocolate for lighter woods. Its sort of a cement tan color. Its very dense foam, so if you press down pretty hard you still wont feel sharp edge. Good product.
B000056J1W People seem to have unrealistic expectations of products sometimes. They want it to stick like crazy YET not hurt their furniture. There is a balance there that you have to have. You can't have everything. I bought this to try to cover some of the worst corners. You can't cover everything, but we have to make an effort since our 10 month old is scooting around now. He hasn't paid any attention to the padding nor tried to pull it off YET. And we haven't had to remove any to see if it hurts our furniture. It doesn't make the furniture look great by any means, but it is what it is. I care more about the safety than the aesthetics of my furniture. The padding should be sufficient to stop minor bumps and bruises. I'm satisfied for the moment...I'll update if that changes.I deducted a star because I ordered beige and got chocolate...not worth the hassle to return it. On a second order, we did get the beige but it is darker than they make it look in the photo. Neither was a HUGE deal to us, but I could see this mattering to people wanting to match their furniture more.
B000056J1W We  have used  this edging  and corners  on several  pieces of furniture.  It serves it purpose well.  However, our son just started pulling  the trim  off so we  have  had to replace the adhesive a few times.  Overall a  good product.
B000056J1W The title says it all...the edges of the bumpers were very tempting for my daughter to peel every chance she got. You'd think her ability to remove the ends of the bumpers would indicate the bumpers would be easy to remove.They were a nightmare and have ruined our beautiful coffee table. I've tried goo gone to no avail. If anyone has any tips how to get the tape off, which is coated with random pieces of foam from the old bumpers, I'd love to hear them. I can't believe how awful my table looks.
B000056J1W I needed a solution for a sharp tile step down into my living room- every time I stepped down I envisioned my baby cracking her skull on that :( I was hesitant to buy this, though,  because I was skeptical that it would stick and chocolate seemed like the wrong color to match my tile. It sticks really well- we'll see how it holds up over time- and the color looks great against my taupe tile. It really doesn't look cheesy at all. We're going to use the corner pieces on a table of mine and I've already checked the color there too. Not great against some sort of reddish brown wood, but miles ahead of the hideous Safety 1st Expandable Table Edge Bumper. This stuff gives a perfect fit since it's cut to fit. The expandable thing doesn't fit the sizes listed (no way it will work on a 90 inch table) and it looks like a pair of hand-me-down training pants from the 1970s.
B000056J1W I just installed these a couple of days ago, so I will downgrade my review if I have any problems in the future. Mine came with a 3M tape, and the installation seems very sticky. They are certainly installed firmly enough that my toddler daughter will not be able to pull them off, and that was the whole point. The only reasons I knocked off a couple stars are:1. The installation tape comes in pre-cut strips, so you have to use several of them. It would have been better if they sent a roll of the double sided tape instead. If the tape was in one roll, that would also make installation of the foam strip easier because you could put one piece of tape on the foam, and just pull the backing away from the two ends to get it aligned properly before pulling off the rest of the backing and securing the middle of the strip to the table.2. The foam strip develops something of a shape memory from being rolled up in the package, and by the time you get to the center of the roll, you really have to fight against that curved shaped to install the tape and get the strip installed on the table in a straight manner. It would have been better if it came in strips (perhaps two 6-foot strips or four 3-foot strips), but I do realize this would have also increased the shipping cost.3. There were no directions included. I am sure there must have been some things that would have made installation easier, but they included no directions other than simple pictures showing to put the tape on the foam and stick the foam on the table.
B000056J1W We have a raised stone hearth fireplace. It was the greatest feature of our family room until we had a baby. It is super easy to put on, works really well and I KNOW we would have had lots more tears, bumbs, cuts, bangs, etc. if this wasnt on our fireplace. We've also used it on some other wood furnture and it works well.
B000056J1W Sticks amazingly well and cushions nicely. The straight pieces can easily be made into corner pieces, since four corners go quickly.
B000056J1W Other reviews have said that this product is difficult to cut, but I used a pair of ordinary scissors and didn't have any problem whatsoever. Also, the foam is a bit stretchy, so your measurements don't have to be exact. I cut the foam a bit short and then just stretched it to fit. While it's true that the tape won't last forever, it is also true that it won't leave a mark on your furniture once you want to remove it permanently. Simply apply more double-sided tape when the adhesive breaks down. Easy!
B000056J1W This took care of our immediate need - PROTECT THE BABY'S HEAD.  :)  This was easy to put around our oblong coffee table and didn't leave too bad of a sticky mess when we needed to remove it.  I'm not sure if he ever really hit his head on the table but if he did, we either missed it or it didn't hurt - thanks to the bumper!
B000056J1W Good quality but it only covers the top part of the corner so it is still dangerous for baby to get up.
B000056J1W I purchased this for the breakfast nook around my marbel countertop.  Since I don't have kids yet (we are adopting) I can't really comment about the durability.  However, they seemed to stay on tight when I applied the tape to the top and bottom on the inside of the foam.  If not I will do what some of the other posters suggested.It wasn't difficult to cut the foam to length.  I just started with one corner edge, measured the long foam piece, and then cut the foam with scissors (just alittle bit longer then what I though I needed.  It cut slightly jagged, but since I cut on the long side adjusting it wasn't a problem.  The finish product doesn't look funny or leave any gaps at all.
B000056J1W A lot of reviews say that the stickiness of the tape isn't that great, and it isn't- but so far it's not a problem. The guards are great because we have a fake stone fireplace so the edge is much more uneven than brick, but the guard works great. A definite for anyone with a fireplace and a squishy little handful of a baby :)
B000056J1W We put this on our coffee table six months ago, all but one of the corners have fallen off repeatedly. The long strips dont really protect my child much. She will still bump into the table at times and it doesnt offer much cushion. It is not really thick enough or wide enough. Corners are a joke. The tape provided is not sticky enough. Just keeps coming off.
B000056J1W Love the ease of use, color, and cushions very well for my clumsy baby.  I have it guarding edges of my glass TV stand and it works great!
B000056J1W We purchased these edge guards just to be cautious but, once my son became mobile, we were thankful for these edge guards. Our son has clipped his chin, run around corners and hit his head and even bit the sides of the furniture when teething. What a great baby proofing item.
B000056J1W We bought 2 sets, used on window sill, formica edges and corners, and along mirrored wall edges... we suggest not putting tape in guard but putting on the surface first, then slowly rolling the guard over the tape in a straight line.
B000056J1W I got this set to edge our stone hearth, and the color is a nice neutral beige/taupe. The adhesive has stood up to 18 months of abuse by my toddler and pre-schooler. No lifting or peeling. The seams blend nicely together where the corners and straight pieces meet, and its discreet and doesn't scream &#34;BABY PROOFING!&#34; Highly recommended.
B000056J1W We used these with my first daughter and bought them again for the 2nd. They stick well and are very helpful with the sharp corners. Use more sticky stuff than you think you need.  Also, after a year on my entertainment center, I was able to take everything off with a little elbow grease!
B000056J1W This worked perfectly for our fireplace.  It fit snugly and firmly.  There was plenty of adhesive tape for the entire length, which I know was a concern for other similar products.  The coloring was a nice neutral match as well.
B000056J1W We were able to cover the edge at Grandma's house with ease.  Cuts easy, tape is sticky and hasn't peeled off.  My daughter has tried to peel off a part, and we just stuck it back on and it's still sticking and working just fine.
B000056J1W Only reason why this is 3 star is its not good for protecting corner walls. My son peeled it off immediately and the wall plaster came off and he was trying to eat it.So I. My attemp to baby proof the corners I created more problems.I had to fix the plaster from peeling off and prevent him from eatting it. But I think this is the only solution out there to protect corners.
B000056J1W Provides the right amount of cushion. My son was pulling up on furniture by 5 months but was very clumsy. This product was great and came with lots of strong double sided tape.
B000056J1W The table was a little larger but cutting it to leave a 1\" space in the center of each length works great.  The triplets climb all over the living and always come back to the table to play.  It looks good and you don't even notice its there.
B000056J1W We have a big fireplace and this fit it, with some left over.  It's easy to install but, keep in mind that your baby can easily pull this off of whatever it's attached to but, you don't want something that is going to stay on forever.  Great product, Great price!
B000056J1W so glad we put these on when we did. My 11 mo old daughter has bumped her head many-a-time since we put these on our tables and shelves about 3 months ago, and has not been hurt once. They are still sticking strong too.
B000056J1W I don't understand why they would make a product that does not fit standard corner tables! I need to return this item
B000056J1W Shipped in nice original box.Four corner plus the long strip - as described.A nice touch is the double-sided-tape is 3M and not some cheap fall-off-next-week tape.
B000056J1W These were easy to install and are aesthetically bearable. We'll see how easily my 8-month old will pull them off, but so far they are holding even though we've had some climbing onto them and such. I do wish that it came with a LOT more tape so that when it does come off I can just put it back on.
B000056J1W Good idea but this is very cheaply made... it is not sticky enough to stay on anything... my 6 month old baby would just yank it off immediately. I wish I never purchased this because you'd basically have to crazy glue to your furniture and there's no way I am doing that!
B000056J1W I'm just worried for when i need to remove it! I might be purchasing new tables?  I even used it on a wall corner near the play area.  Stays fine. My son even tried chewing on it w his new sharp teeth. It held up. He was not able to puncture it!
B000056J1W I used this table edge and corner guard to edge a window in my son's playroom. The window was level with the daybed he often played on, and I had visions of him cracking his head. I lined the edges of the windowsill. This works well. My son is a pretty good listener, and I kept telling him not to touch or pull the foam off, it was there for a reason, and it is still there two months later. It will come off very easily if pulled, just a forewarning. But I like this product and would use it again.
B000056J1W I got this when musings started crawling so I would be ready when he started walking and I'm glad I did. This product works great on my entertainment center and my lower window sills. The product sticks great and my little one can't pull them off. Just this morning he walked over to the window and fell and hit his head on the sill and he didn't get hurt. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone with little ones.
B000056J1W I bought a Safety First Foam Edge Bumper from Wal-Mart for the SAME price as this that was only about 5ft and didn't have corners, and it was already cut into strips. That was a HUGE mistake. Comparing this set to the one I bought, it wins in every category. It contains more than twice as much foam - PLUS corners, you can cut it to whatever size you need, it bends around curves, and It's MUCH softer than the Safety First bumper!I love it, and it's perfect. It STICKS! It's 3m brand double-sided tape and it didn't budge! I suspect people who said it doesn't stick did not clean/dry the surface properly, touched the tape too much, or maybe had a textured surface. I couldn't pull mine off, so I know my 9 month old can't.
B000056J1W This edge guard is very easy to put on and sticks very well. Its very soft as well. Would recommend.
B000056J1W I put this on my coffee table and it works great. Seems pretty secure and there will be no split foreheads with this stuff on the edges!
B000056J1W We used this for our fire place. There is a raised seat and we used two of the corners and covered the edges. So far it has stuck well and I feel so much better not having to worry about our little guy falling into the sharp edge. Our fire place is tile and the color blends in well!
B000056J1W Easy to put up, takes a bit of time, 
B000056J1W We use this on the bottom edge of our coffee table because the baby loves to crawl underneath and then he hits his head on the way out.  This sticks well and he really has not hurt his head since we put it on.  It does the job!
B000056J1W This stuff works great for baby proofing. Have had it on our coffee tables and other sharp edges for over a year. Still in place and working. Has saved my son from some nasty bumps and bruises many times. Totally worth it. Wish it came in black.
B000056J1W I have an espresso wooden rectangular coffee table.  I bought two sets of these and they are working perfectly!  They come with 3M adhesive tape and attach securely.  For some reason, even when I measure and lay out the tape carefully the strips always were cut a little too short so I had to cut a few filler pieces for the spaces between some of the corners and the edging.  I applied the edge guard on both the top of the table and the lower table that sits close to the ground.My little one was making us so nervous from hitting her head on this thing before so now we don't have to sit there with our hands over the corners when she plays around it!  I know she will fall and bump her head from time to time but I think this could help prevent a serious accident.  When I googled some babyproofing options for coffee tables I read a lot of stories about some really gory coffee table accidents so I do think this is worth it even if they aren't the most attractive thing in the world!
B000056J1W Great product! The foam is thick and durable! It has stayed in place for the most part. The corner pieces tend to easily come off with a little one around. I would still recommend!
B000056J1W I bought this for multiple purposes and it worked perfectly for all. The only con is that it is a bit pricey.  Overall, definitely worth the price.-Corner pieces used separately on corners of tables without the longer strips:  This doesn't look great but compared to the other clear plastic or silicone corner pieces I have much greater piece of mind with these.  They are soft enough that when my 18 month old hits his head directly on the corner he doesn't even flinch.-Long strips both with and without the corners used on table edges and on my bottom step:  I have a ledge/stoop inside my house near the backdoor and it has sharp metal edges nailed in along the entire length.  It makes a bend so I needed these strips to stick to metal on a step and not come off when we hit the edges or my son slides down on his rear.  This works like a charm.The edges have not peeled off metal, it was extremely easy to install and there was more than enough tape strips/squares given.  The double stick tape makes application quick and easy.I would highly recommend this product.*FOR A CHEAPER but not so pretty ALTERNATIVE:  Head to your local home improvement store and get pipe covers/insulation which are foam and come in varied sizes.  THey have a precut slit down the length so you can open it up and slide it on the edges of tables.  You'd need to tape it somehow but each strip is long and costs less than a dollar.  I covered a large coffee table for around $3 and some blue painters tape.
B000056J1W Bought this item to line the corners of the coffee table, side tables, and fire place. It has worked out nicely and did not have any problem w/ the double sided sticky. You can customize the padding by cutting them.
B000056J1W I ordered 2 packages in order to cover the appropriate circumference of 1 coffee table and the front edges of two end tables. When the package arrived the length of edging was 7'6\", not 12' as advertised. That means I was completely short and could not complete my project. Aside from the lack of length, the product works well and seems secure. I would have ordered more had I known about the length. It's quite a disparity between 7' and 12', so purchase appropriately.
B000056J1W These provide protection for our daughter on the coffee table.  My only complaint is that the corners don't stay on and that's where we need it the most!
B000056J1W My only big gripe is that they are stingy on the adhesive you can just get all your edge guard on with the adhesive. Just dont waste any part of the adhesive it is precious. But once on it wont come off easily even by a prying little hand it take quite a effort.If you use the adhesive on the edge of the guard that makes sure kids cant take of easily. It become furniture. I bought two of this in light and dark for different furniture when my kid was 7-8 months old.And i can vouch that this tape has avoided a handfull of accidents.CautionThe paint(especially wall paint) can come off when removing it.Once off any surface it doest stick again.Apply after you kids go to sleep needs some time to have a firm fix and so that they dont know it can be taken off.Also would add taht applying this when the child is young gives better chances that they stay on.Also Matching color should help being noted by children But you know all kids are different ;)
B000056J1W It works but I expected it to be a different color, a bit more white, rather than beige. thank you
B000056J1W Works great.  Takes some time to put the adhesive strips on, but these work so much better than other brands we have tried.  Also, they are soft enough to prevent bruises when they do fall into them.
B000056J1W This blends well with our coffee table and kept my little one safe. The real test will be when we take it off - will it peal off the wood from the furniture ?
B000056J1W You know when you're child free and buy great furniture? You can't fathom the day when you'll have to apply foam to your beautiful wood table so your child doesn't go head first into the sharp corner?  Those days are now a distant memory and you bite the bullet and apply a foam guard.  Then you go to take it off because your child has spilled parmesan cheese and... what...the? The wood came off.  The WOOD came off.  I expected to have to use some Goo-Be-Gone to get off the adhesive but this actually destroyed the table.  Not like a dent that could be sanded.  I piece of wood literally splintered off.  So, while this product will protect your kid's noggin, don't put it on a piece of furniture you like.
B000056J1W These work for small corner surfaces. If you have a large surface to cover, like a table corner, make sure that you cut the strip in half. If you put it on as one long strip it will fall off.  Works good for coffee tables.
B000056J1W my baby has been not intrigued enough to pull this out. I have it even on the wall corners in my house. It has given me more peace of mind to let him walk without worrying too much.I have brown ones on my wood so it looks better.
B000056J1W Good quality product.  Lots of cusion and sticks well.  We had a hard time getting it to stick to our fireplace because it has wood around the brick hearth and the corners aren't flat.  But we used it for other things in our house and my son can't just peel it off like other products.  Thank you!
B000056J1W These have a nice amount of cushioning to protect my 9 month old daughter as she &#34;cruises&#34; around our coffee table.  They come with a good amount of adhesive tape, which is why I purchased this brand over others.  It is difficult to get them to stay adhered without putting adhesive tape on BOTH sides.  Once I put it on both sides, it works much better.  Because this item is also a bit &#34;stretchy&#34; it was tricky to measure it exactly right.  So, we have small gaps between the pieces which aesthetically isn't great, but it still protects my daughter.  If I had the time and money, I might purchase again and install it better knowing what I know now, but it works fine.
B000056J1W This product does not adhere well.  I have tried it on wood, metal, and painted surfaces.  What's more, other \"safety\" products I have purchased that use well-known 3M tape were defective as well. Also, when I tried to remove the cushion, the tape removed my furniture paint.  Overall, I rate this item with 2 stars because the neutral color does not attract my toddler's attention and the cushion does prevent painful head bumps.
B000056J1W Quite simply this product does what it says.  I accidentally ordered 2 packs and in brown but I like it anyway.  Just gives me peace of mind to now that if my daughter should bump into a table corner the blow will be cusioned
B000056J1W Clean your coffee table or whatever well for the sticky to stick especially on a round glass table top. Protects the kiddo's noggin pretty well!
B000056J1W I have tried tons of different bumpers and my favorite is prince lionheart, it is easy to apply and is nice looking as well.
B000056J1W When you first put this on the table you feel like it has made things safer for your child, however the first time they get near it they are able to pull it off because the adhesive provided with it doesn't hold well unless you have a completely flat surface to attach it to.  (I suppose if you use a stronger adhesive you would run the risk of damaging the table).Only buy if you have a large top face and edge to the table with no decorative surface changes (must be completely flat to hold at all)
B000056J1W My daughter's bed had sharp edges and she once bumped her head pretty bad and didnt want to sleep in her bed anymore. So I brought this to resolve that issue and prevent further damage-- works well.
B000056J1W These bumpers work well on our wooden coffee table. Our daughter has already hit her head on the edge and she was not injured at all. They're ugly, but I'm not sure how a bumper could be more attractive. They were easy enough to install and I found that the adhesive worked fine, although I have not tried to remove it yet.
B000056J1W So far, my 9 month old hasn't tried to pull this off.  It seems pretty stuck with the tape they gave you.  It has stuck really well onto our fireplace (which is small, square, not totally even tile) for 2 weeks now.  This brand is MUCH better than the Cosmos brand, also sold here on Amazon.  The corners fit better, and the tape works a lot better.
B000056J1W This is the worst thing ever. It sticks for one week and then its down. I put in on my coffe table and end tables and they are all damage because of the tape.Don't buy it
B000056J1W This product works rather well.  It is easy to apply to furniture and it remains in place.  I highly recommend it.
B000056J1W The guard came heavily distorted from probably sitting in the box for way too long. The fragment of about 20 inches in length had to be cut off due to severe distortion. I used the guard to cover the fireplace brick edges and it worked out fine since I didn't need the whole length. I would have given it one star and returned it if I used to to cover a table.
B000056J1W This comes highly recommended in my family.  My brother used these for my nephews and keeps them on things because his niece (my daughter) is now toddling about.  I like them, they don't hurt your furniture (don't sue me if they hurt yours, but they didn't hurt mine or my brother's).  This is often the difference between a quizzical look and a meltdown.
B000056J1W This product comes with special double-sided sticky tape to attach the guards. It&#699;s easy to apply to the inside of the guards and easy to attach to the corners and surfaces that you want to use. For us we have an extremely sharp edge in our shower and baby crawls around so we didn&#699;t want him to slip and fall on the edge. We put the guard on the edge and it stays even though it gets wet every day as we shower. I used the table corners for the corners of low window sills that are in his play area and it works well to protect him from falling on them and doubles as a teether. lol He loves chewing on it! It&#699;s a very soft, spongy material. Hopefully there&#699;s no BPA in it because it&#699;s constantly in my son&#699;s mouth!
B000056J1W Needed this item for our brick fireplace and decided to give it a shot despite some saying that the double sided adhesive tape didn't work well.  I assumed we would try it and then rig something else up (velcro, etc) if it didn't work.  It has been one month and the included adhesive tape is working very well.  My 11 month old goes up to it and tries to chew it (for all the chew toys that child has?!) and it stays put no problem.  Time will tell how long it lasts, but I am happy with the density of the edge guard and how well it went on that even if I did have to do some reworking of the adhesive in the future I would still be happy with the quality of the edge guard as well as the safety the product provides.
B000056J1W This is a great product for protecting your babies! We loved its quality and baby proofed our entire living room with it!
B000056J1W This edge guard worked out pretty well for our needs. Since we have an old, beat-up coffee table, it didn't really affect the looks of our furniture much. Baby was able to pry off the corner edges after just a month or so (of course, the corner edges are where she hurts herself mostly). And it does leave behind some pretty substantial sticky bits when it comes off, I've just been too lazy to clean it up with anything yet. Overall a good investment.
B000056J1W We like the product and works very well. It's a little pricey 
B000056J1W soft foamy, with double side tape.  seems a bit old perhaps, because when I unroll it the foam is showing stress marks from being rolled up too long, and appears to crack from being dry rot?  but it'll do for now.  lets see how long it lasts.
B000056J1X These are very basic.  They're terry cloth but they really don't look as nice as I had hoped.  I don't see this lasting a long time.  For the money, I'd reccommend the Wendy Bellisomo brand of cover - they're a better material than these are.
B000056J1X I wish I had two! One to use, while the other is washing! It seems as soon as I take off my baby's diaper, it's then she decides to \"go\".I read other reviews about complaints of color fading and shrinkage. Well, I have had NO color fading and the shrinkage has been minimal, and certainly not to the degree others had mentioned. I have washed the cover over and over on hot and then let it air dry instead of putting it in the dryer. Maybe that's why I havent had so much of a shrinkage problem. Regardless, it fits the contoured pad fine still, a bit snugger but not at all too small.I would have given it 5 stars if the terrycloth they used had been a higher quality. I mean really, for the price, I could have bought a better made towel that had emblishments that cost more than the cheap elastic they used to make the cover. I would have even paid more to have the choice between this terrycloth and a better one.Finally, I still am very pleased and would purchase it with the contoured changing pad for a friend's baby shower too!
B000056J1X I love how soft and cuddly this changing pad cover is.  I also appreciate how many colors it comes in.What I am disappointed with is the durability.  I have 3 of these and have used them for just over a year.  They are totally falling apart at the elastic. Now, keep in mind that we use disposable \"chucks\" (those blue hospital disposable under pads) on top of this terry cloth changing pad.  It makes it less messy (especially early on) and doesn't require washing as much.  I also washed them in cold water with Baby Dreft detergent, hung them to dry and rotated the 3 covers that we have.While it is a nice product while it lasts, I just expected them to be more durable.
B000056J1X This works well with the contour changing pad.  It fits a little snugly, so the corners of the pad don't exactly stay as \"pointy\" as they were when it was new, but it works very well.  It works even better if you cut the straps off the changing pad.  You're right there with baby, anyway.
B000056J1X After only a few uses and washes, this pad cover started to tear.  It was ripping in the corners, and no matter how gentle I was, the hole got bigger.The color choice is out standing. . .however I just wish that it had held up a bit better for us.
B000056J1X Great colors, and I like Simmons' contoured changing pad, which this is supposed to fit, but keep in mind that washing will significantly shrink the covers &amp; the terry fabric doesn't hold up well. After just a couple of months, ours are already coming apart.
B000056J1X I am so pleased that the Contoured Changing Table Pad has so many choices in color for its cover! I purchased the lilac, and a white cover and they both go well with my nursery decor. I only wish I got more that two!These terrycloth covers are thick, absorbant and easy on my newborn's skin. The only problem I have with them is that they shrink a little when you wash them. So, when you go to put them back on the pad the fit is a bit tight, but I find they pull out pretty quickly to thier normal size. When they do finally get to small to fit the pad I will go out and buy some more! I mean it's terrycloth, what do ya expect? Besides, the darn things get all kinds of yuck on them all day. They are going to take a beating being washed all the time as it is. They are totally worth the money to replace! I would buy them again!
B000056J1X Washed it once according to directions & it shrunk beyond belief!  Didn't even use it once!  Don't bother!!!
B000056J23 Very convenient - I have a one year old and I babysit a one year old. I'm definitely not going to spend 100 bucks or more on a double stroller, but since I found two umbrella strollers on sale for 10 bucks each, my double stroller was only 30 bucks! It handles well. When you put the connectors on, make sure they're tight, and even so it will seem like there's too much slack for it to really move, but it does work. Just give it a go. :)
B000056J23 do not waste your moneyi got it and i tried with  2 strollers the same exact one but it would not work goodyou can not  move that much and its hard to make a turn......
B000056J23 I connected two different brands, a double jeep and single (? brand) which are two different heights. It was slightly difficult especially since the double didn't have much room to put the middle connector on.. but it works! It's not like a SMOOTH push or anything (but it is smooth with same size/brand ones, I have another same brand single lol), but it's worth it! Love!
B000056J23 I like the idea of this however they do not stay connected very well. If they stayed connected it would be perfect. I have twins and have 4 strollers but sometimes travelling it is nice to travel a little lighter and use umbrella strollers.
B000056J23 These are easy to put on and take off.  They work well to connect two umbrella strollers.  The rubber inserts do fall out easily, so I can tell these may not last long.  They only work with one thickness of bar so they are not compatible with all strollers.  I use a combination of these for the top connection and a different brand for the bottom that are adjustable since my stroller bars are wider at the base and I connect in 4 places instead of 3 for a sturdier connection.
B000056J2D I was a bit hesitant to buy this booster, although it came highly recommended.  I felt like it was overpriced and essentially offered nothing...boy, was I wrong!  I've been using this booster for 2 years now.  It has been used by my 3.5 year old and his 2 year old brother.  Both of them LOVE it.  The seat is comfortable for them to sit on, unlike the hard plastic seat we had before it.  It doesn't slide around on the chair, and it is SO easy to clean.  I also like that it is easy to take along if we're headed to grandma's house.  No extra straps, trays, or pieces to worry about! I don't have a single complaint with this seat after 2 years of use...it is well worth the money!
B000056J2D This is a great booster and is effective for it's job--but there are a few things that could make it an even better seat.  I can't use this booster in my home because it is made out of a rubber substance that my kids LOVE to pull apart!! My young toddler likes to bite and take chunks out of the booster seat.  If you have an aggressive chewer in the house, you may want to think about this--this material is highly attractive to chewers!  Also, the seat does not come equipped with straps.  I had to switch to another booster with straps due to some safety issues associated with this also.
B000056J2D The Cooshie Booster is a good booster seat for toddlers when used in the right conditions.  However, my wife and I are yet to experience the miraculous calming effects at the dinner table that so many other reviews have mentioned.The Booster is made from one solid piece soft foam material.  The material is very lightweight and cleans up very easily.  The one-piece construction also aids in clean-up - no cracks to trap food or let spills get through to your furniture.  Plus, the material grips on wooden chairs;  it's never budged when our active two-year-old is using it.  This ease of use, both at the table and when getting washed in the sink, are its major selling points.On the other hand, the one-piece construction makes the bulky Booster less than ideal for use away from home.  Forget about using it at restaurants because it's not different enough from what they'll provide.  We only take ours out when we're going to Grandma and Grandpa's house for a few days;  otherwise, it's more trouble than it's worth.  Sure, it's lightweight, but the supplied carrying case is roughly the size of a bowling ball bag.  Plus, the bag is very cheap and unattractive;  basically they're selling you the packaging as a carrying case.Lastly, we haven't seen the Booster effect any great improvement in our son's attention span at the table - when he wants to get down, he wants to get down, period.  I don't believe that any booster seat could make such a difference in toddler behavior, so I don't hold it against this one;  I'm just surprised how many others have reported these results.  If anything, our son is frustrated by the Booster because its size prevents him from climbing into his chair unassisted.  Because he's in the toddler independence phase, he'd often rather climb into another chair by himself rather than be lifted into the Booster.So, the Booster does a great job of providing a simple-to-use and easy-to-maintain solution at home, but if you take your little one out frequently, a more portable options would suit you better.PROS*  Stable, soft foam stays in place without marking chairs*  Very easy to clean with one-piece constructionCONS*  Bulky on the go*  Will frustrate toddlers who like to climb into their own chair
B000056J2D After tiring of wiping up trays that didn't stay put, straps that couldn't be cleaned completely and levers that didn't operate easily, we tossed our high chair and booster seats for this absolutely WONDERFUL little seat.  Made of an interesting foamy material, it actually stays where you put it on a chair so your little one can eat like a \"big person\" at the table with you.  The surface wipes clean easily, it's portable and comes in its own plastic carry case so you can toss it in the car to bring along to restaurants (who wants to use a filthy universal high chair that maybe 1000+ kids have spilled on before yours??)Your child will love the comfy feel, the secure bottom and the colors!  We bought ours in the store and there was a choice of Aqua, Red, Black, Royal Blue and Purple.  The price is right in line with other toddler feeding contraptions, and this one will grow with your child till they are old enough to sit without a booster.  There are no straps on this seat, however, so don't expect to prop a baby inside...your child must be at least 18 months old OR old enough to sit still while eating and not topple out.
B000056J2D My 16 month old daughter has gotten to the stage where she no longer wants to use a highchair or any of those other booster seats with the trays (ie. Tot-Loc, First Years 4 in 1 feeding seat, and First Years Folding Booster...all great products by the way)  She really just wanted to sit at the kitchen and dining room table like a big girl, and she didn't want to sit in the baby seats that allow you to convert them to big kid boosters by removing the trays.  We were at our wits end and after reading all the reviews here, we decided to give it a try, but I must admit we were a bit skeptical and nervous using this for our daughter because she is so young and most of the other reviewers said they used this for an older child.  Well our daughter absolutely loves this and is so proud of her upgrade from highchair to big kid comfy booster.  The booster wipes clean very easily, sticks to the chair very well, and the seat itself is non-slip, so our daugher does not slouch and side off this seat like she did with other hard plastic boosters.  Best of all, the seat brings her to the perfect height at our table (much better fit than the hard plastic boosters) and she appears to be much more comfortable (not to mention our once picky eater is now happily eating everything she sees now).  This booster seat seems to have completely changed the way my daughter looks at meal time for the better.  Also, the travel case this booster comes with is a nice touch, and it has room to pack a bib or small snack as well as the booster.  We're looking forward to using this booster for the next couple of years, and since it's so portable, we only need to buy one and just take it everywhere we go.One thing I should mention, I wouldn't buy this booster for a child who is overly active and doesn't like to sit still.  My daughter has no problems sitting still for extended periods as long as she is occupied, but if she were the kind of kid who always has to be moving at this age, I wouldn't use this booster just yet as it does not have any safety belt to hold your child in.
B000056J2D This is the best booster seat. It \"grips\" easily to chairs and does not slide. We use it in our captains chairs and our son is great in it! It is the most durable seat too. My nephew has had one for two years or more now and it is still in EXCELLENT condition. It is soft and comfy. It may seem pricey for a booster but it is definitely worth it. It travels easy and wipes clean in a heartbeat. Grandma even bought one to keep at her house for all the kids! Definitely a must have!
B000056J2D My 2 1/2 year olds highchair was terrible, so I threw it out on his first b-day. This chair is great, but I dont see anything miraculous going on.PROS-* Very comfortable, my son always says everything should be like cooshie* All one solid piece of foam, bo creveces to get food stuck in* It doesnt slip due to the material, a plus for a wiggly toddler* Sits him up high enough to eat* Can be easily taken off, no straps and all that stuff* Cute color, not bright and pastely* Very light weightCONS-* Is not at all portable, I dont know about you but I wouldnt want to \"travel\" with something the size of a large platter everywhere!* The \"carry case\" is cheap and really the size of a diaper bag... uhh sorry I already have one of those* leaves his feat dangling, although this is a problem occuring in MANY booster seatsThis is just a booster. I like it and I am glad I chose it but I dont really understand the amazing changes in children with a booster (not that I am denying the fact that those reviews are true) I just dont see how this cooshie could do it. My son is still fussy, and will get down when he feels like it, this comfortable booster doesnt stop him. He loves his booster and loves being a big bow v.s sitting in a highchair like his little brother
B000056J2D For the older toddler, this booster seat is more comfortable and spacious than the hard plastic booster seats with trays.  The hard plastic seats slide around on wood chairs and never feel stable, even when strapped around the chair.  The trays don't leave enough room for a bigger child's legs.  However, this booster seats is soft and cushiony.  It feels stable on wood chairs, and it allows the child to sit at the big people's table.  Obviously, it's not as good for the young infant or younger toddler who needs a tray to contain the mess, but it's definitely better for the older toddler who knows how to eat neatly off a plate or bowl.  The older toddler hopefully is also well-trained enough to know not to jump around in the seat because it's not attached to the adult chair.
B000056J2D We love this booster. My 3 year is still using it and I think he started using it around 18 months or so. We have solid oak chairs and didn't have the problem of other reviewers. It sits in the same chair almost all the time and there's no residue. Maybe it has more to do with the chair finishing. Your chair does need to be made of something to \"grip\" this chair, such as a wooden chair. I tried to take it to my dad's house and he has cooshy leather chairs, and it didn't work. It cleans extremely easily, holds him securely, and works better than I could have expected.
B000056J39 These are nice jumbo corners that didn't make our table look too hideous, but at some point your baby's going to learn to pull them off!  This didn't happen for us for a while and I really think any other brands would have the same problem, so this one's the best in the market.  My daughter fell and hit her face on the corner guard and her mouth still bled, though the damage would have been much worse without the corner guard.  It's definitely better to have these than nothing at all.
B000056J39 This is a great product.  They do what they are supposed to do, at least on my desk.  My desktop/corners consist of a wood laminate, with a very smooth surface, so these things stick very well.  However, I have not attempted to take them off yet, and i'm sure a little 'Goo-Gone' or rubbing alcohol will do the trick when the time comes.  I will be dissapointed if they harm some of the finish, but then again you can't put a price on protecting your precious child from severe injury, which can easily occur when their head hits a table or desk corner!  For this 'peace of mind', I give this product 5 stars.  One more thing... there is NO substitute for proper and constant child supervision.
B000056J39 I must have a newer version because mine stick just fine.  I have very sharp corners on the bottom of my kitchen counters and these guys do the job.  They are so much thicker and cushionery than the other versions (pricey though), but I think they're worth it.  No more bumped heads!
B000056J39 I love these. I haven't had to take them off the table so I can't speak to the residue part, but these are snug and protective.
B000056J39 These don't stick at all! My guys ripped them off the sides of the tables the second we put them up. The adhesive wouldn't restick either. What a waste. :(
B000056J39 just to point out first, the guards are NOT white! they came in a light brown. they cover the corner very well seeing how big they are, but once again the sticky tape sucks. I have yet to find a good double sticky tape.
B000056J39 Use these on areas where the Jumbo size is just too big.  I found the tape supplied a pain to use.  It;s not 3M just some generic stuff that is inferior.  Taking the backing off one it's stuck to the pad takes a bit of effort.  They seem to have stick OK but 3M tape would be better.
B000056J39 They don't seem to stick very well.  Also, once they did start to come off, I noticed it was leaving that sticky residue behind on my coffee table.
B000056J39 I'm not judging anyone else, but I was very surprised when I read how many people wrote about these coming off or being pulled off. I guess my daughter never tried very hard, but they are really stuck tight. I've had one set for about 14 months, and bought a 2nd set for another table about 8 months ago, and they're not going anywhere.  I can't speak to them hurting the finish of the wood, since I've never tried to take them off.  They don't look too bad either, since the dark color matches most of my furniture. I do wish they came in more colors for some of my lighter wood.
B000056J39 I ordered these for our coffee table corners. The are rounded corners, but not so round they can't knock a little noggin. From the information I read about this product it said to order the jumbo/wider (rather than standard size) guards. Unfortunately I guess what I really need is something not just for wide corners but rounded as well. We have a lot of items to baby-proof, these seem very soft and durable, I am sure I will find corners that can use them. But they won't work for the coffee table and that is the area I am the most concerned with at the moment.
B000056J39 I just put these on some sharp corners in my house and they are great.  The tape is sticking well so far and they have already protected my son's head.  He moves so fast right to where the furniture is. I watch him and move him away, but it makes me feel better to have these there just in case.  I needed the jumbo size for the bottom of my entertainment center.
B000056J39 When a baby gets to the crawling stage, your life changes. Table corners are just one of those places that must be protected and this little gadget does so very well. There are some tables that require the corner piece and the long padding all around the parameter of the table due to sharp edges, but in most cases, this is enough. I only wish they were a little less obvious. Unless you have very light wood furniture, these things stick out like a sore thumb. My only concern is that there is an adhesive (that supposedly comes right off).  Many months from now I suppose I'll find out if that is true, but in the meantime I have (relative) peace of mind when my grandson is crawling or toddling around and that is Priority 1.
B000056J39 I ordered these corner guards for my TV stand and coffee table and they work great, the only down fall is if your furniture isn't as thick as the guard the sides don't stick very well because they aren't flat against a surface like they are on the top.
B000056J39 I put this on the corners of my brick fireplace and sticks well.  My one year old son tried pulling on it once and without success and never tried again.  They are large with good cushion and will do its job.  The adhesive is strong enough and after 3 months, they are still there on all three corners.  I would recommend but of course, if your child is persistent, I am sure he/she would get it off eventually. So far, so good.
B000056J39 it never worked, i cleaned the surface and followed direction...failed.tried with double sided tape... failed.tried with regular tape.... failed.i think the problem is that it's not smooth again the surface on top, so it creates a little gap and easily falls off.
B000056J6T I considered this when it was full price, 50 bucks.  When I saw it for 25, I just had to get it.  I took it back the next day because the latches that keep the buttons away from Baby broke and the buttons wouldn't work.This second try has been better.  I found it for 12.50 and decided that it would make a gift for someone else if it didn't work for me (man, I can be cruel :)  This time, it seems to work pretty well.  All the buttons work.I did have a little trouble with the light because when the light is on, the button is pressed in.  I have fingernails, so the button can be a bit tricky until you get the hang of it.I am glad I decided to try this product again, but I wouldn't have paid the 50 bucks for it.  If you can't find it on sale, get a regular CD player: they plug in and are cheaper.
B000056J6T We love this product.  Being able to change the music our son listens to every nite is such a nice option - and we don't have to listen to the same lullaby's all the time (if at all).The light is dim, but as a few others noted, who wants a bright light?  The baby is trying to sleep!It's enough light to see him if I peek in and it's still on.I feel the volume is plenty loud enough.  It is a crib cd player, not a house cd player.  It's plenty loud enough for his tiny nursery, and i've never turned it all the way up.I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 for the battery issue - it eats batteries worse than any other toy he has - including the swing which we use much more often.I thought that was strange, and if it does take that much power, it should come with rechargable batteries.Maybe the next mode
B000056J6T I really like this CD player.  I do not understand why it has such a low review.*Yes the light is dim but I did not want a bright light.  It is a nightlite.  It is just fine.  I can check on baby and see him fine.*The volume does not get very loud but for what this is designed for it is fine.  I put in a lullaby CD and he drifts off to sleep.*The timer function if great.*The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is that I wish the digital readout and the buttons lite up.  It is hard to see in the dark and I do not like to turn on the light to see the buttons and digital read out.  Maybe in the next version the manufacture will include this.*As far as the CD's ckipping when hit, I solved that by sliding a piece of foam between the play and the rails of the crib.  No there is no space to move at all and it does not skip.***It is not perfect but it does the trick!***
B000056J6T This item is not top quality.  I don't have too many of this company's other products, so if this is an example of their quality than I don't think I will.  First off the cover does not open without popping off the hinge and needing to be reattached, the batteries only lasted through two cd's, the volume doesn't get very high, and it doesn't even fit on the side of our crib.  Being in the baby business they should know that not all crib's are made the same.  You are much better off just getting a simple boom box that play's cd's.
B000056J6T could not even try it it didn't fit on our crib. looks like a good idea.
B000056J6T I love my cd player. My baby uses it every time she goes to sleep...at night and for naps. I like it cause it shuts off itself. I gave it 4 stars cause I wish it would play louder,...but it truly is worth buying!
B000056J6T What a disappointment!  We were so grateful to receive this at a baby shower- it was something we really wanted.  However, it did not live up to expectations.  The sound quality was awful- very, very quiet even on the highest volume setting and, even worse, extreme static.  I exchanged it for another one thinking that maybe the first was defective but had the same problems.  For such an expensive item the quality is very poor.We ended up ordering the Fisher Price Tape Player online and it is really wonderful.  We love it- buy it instead, better quality and cheaper!
B000056J6T I thought this would be a great idea. So when we found out we were having twins i ran out and bought 2 of them. We started to put the nurserys together and when it came time to put these on they wouldnt fit. I didnt want to stratch the crib rails up so we took them back. When we did try to play a cd in them it skipped. We ended up just buying small cd/radio players for each of their room because this is something they can both use for a long time.
B000056J6T I bought this for our son when he was born 3 years ago.  I loved it at first.  For his first 6 months of life he slept in a bassinet and this conveniently attached to it and then came the crib issues where he would stand up and try to get it off the side which inadvertently made the cd skip, fall off the track and post the \"E\" sign. When he moved to a big boy bed we placed it on the dresser.  I, unlike other users, had no trouble with the volume.  In fact, I found myself turning it down on numerous occasions as I could here it in other rooms and it seemed like it was blaring.  The cd compartment is a little hard to get into and yes it is a little noisy but who in their right mind is going to change a cd while their baby is already sleeping.  It shouldn't take longer than the 20 songs or so on a regular lullaby cd to get your baby to sleep.  Therefore I never had an issue with the noise of opening the cd compartment.  The battery compartment on the other hand is a joke.  I now have another baby and just a couple days ago was once again trying to open the battery compartment.  I had to put all my strength into it and when it finally decided to open, the whole cd player flew out of my hand, hit the wall, the front compartment broke off and well needless to say wouldn't play another cd after that.  It's ridiculous to have such an item for only 3 years and then have to garbage it because it's so poorly made.  On the other hand though, I was thankful to have it many times as it did lull my kids into dreaminess and listening to it on the baby monitor-it had the same effect on me.  So I guess it serves it's purpose just inconveniently.  I debated buying another one in hopes \"First Years\" would have fixed these issues but honestly I'd rather find another product who can make things right the first time.
B000056J76 We have been using this seat for about 6 months with our toddler boy.  I love how it attaches to the seat easily and securely.  Once it's on, it doesn't budge, but it removes easily.  However, if our son sits down to pee, he gets pee all over the place.  Even with him holding his private part down with his finger.  The cheap \"bob the builder\" toilet seat does a better job of keeping the pee in the toilet while he is sitting.  I wish they would make the seat more compatible with boys.
B000056J76 We've tried several different potty seats and this is the best by far:1)  Fairly easy to clean, integrated design.  Love that it wipes clean if it gets messy2)  Built in pee guard for boys...  We had another seat with a snap on attachment, and of course it got lost while our daughter was using it.3)  very sturdy and stable on toilet.  This seat positively sits on the toilet, and my son is comfortable on it for even long periods of timeWe tried the soft plastic ones, and ironically he complained a lot more about those being uncomfortable than this one.  Highly recommended!
B000056J76 We have two of these and love them.  I tried to use the little potty that sits on the floor but I prefer this one.  It is much less messy.  We have a boy and the front of the seat is high so it keeps the pee in the toilet for the most part. Would highly recommend this!
B000056J76 Fits on most seats with minor adjustment. Once set it is one hand operation especially for the times when you are running with the kid in one hand. My daughter likes to do it herself and it is very easy for her to do so. It not heavy in case the finger gets in between the seat.
B000056J76 After some little potty chair fails, I decided to try out a seat that fits on the big toilet. This one came up first as it has the most reviews, and it does for a reason. This seat works, period. I do have a girl though so I cant vouch if it works for the little guys.It has a device underneath that tightens it onto the big toilet seat. My toilet seat is the flat plastic kind so it went on with little problem. I have to finagle it a little, but it fits and is very secure so thats a win in my book.SIDE NOTE: Grandma owns the Fischer Price froggy potty which works perfectly, so if you are also thinking about getting a little chair, I highly recommend it.
B000056J76 Fits perfectly on our toilet and is easy for our 23-month-old daughter to sit on securely. She can even put it on the toilet herself.
B000056J76 I definitely, wholeheartedly recommend the Baby Bjorn toilet seat reducer.This seat is contoured in a way that makes it comfortable to sit on and boy's pee goes into the toilet.There is a kind-of dial thing at the back that you turn to make the seat fit snugly and securely onto your toilet so it does not shift when your little one is on it.The handle at the back means you can hang it on a little hook if you wanted to stick one of those removable 3M hooks to your wall.I also give bonus points for the colour- white without a licensed TV character in sight :-)
B000056J76 We've tried a few different brands of potty seats, and this is by far our favorite. It stays in place when kids climb on and off instead of slipping or tipping like some other seats. Unfortunately we changed our toilet seat/lid combo to one of those slow close plastic ones that has the removable hinges for easy cleaning, and the Baby Bjorn training seat doesn't fit it. Also, after about three years (and a couple of kids) the black rubber handle on the back started to break, but I consider that minor wear and tear. Overall, I'd recommend this seat above others on the market. It safe and looks nice.
B000056J76 My son is 21 months old and likes the bear on the product, which entices him to sit down on it. There is no risk of him falling in, and it doesn't seem to slip.
B000056J76 While I think it's a great fit for the toilet, my daughter won't sit on it for more than a couple minutes, having to adjust every few seconds because she says it &#34;isn't comfy&#34;.  After the great reviews and was actually recommended to me by my sister, it just doesn't work for our daughter.  I'm going to have to buy a cheap padded one I guess.  Stinks that I can't return this thing. Pretty expensive.
B000056J76 this fits my elongated toilet which the padded cartoon character seats will not. It's easy to clean too - there are no crevices like the padded seat. The splashguard doesn't really do much for boys and because of it, my son can't keep his legs close together like he can on the mini toilets in his daycare, so he has to be very conscious to not spray when he pees.I think it's a bit bulky for travelling. we have a folding potty seat that we bring with us for travelling.
B000056J76 Before buying this seat, we used a generic seat from a local department store that was padded and pretty flat, with a slight \"pee shield\" in front. It was pretty bulky and messy, so we looked elsewhere. The Bjorn Toilet Trainer is definitely more contoured to little peoples' bodies, which is great, but we still found it to be pretty messy.It fits our toilet great- it doesn't slip at all. Sometimes, though, it will stick to my son's skin after he's been sitting on it for several minutes, so it pops up as he stands. I can't really blame the Bjorn, though, as it seems to be just the fact that it is made out of plastic.I like that it is so slim, so it doesn't add much height to the existing toilet. It's easier for my son to sit down and stand up (with the help of a stool.) It's also very simplistic, so it is easy to clean.Speaking of cleaning, though, I have to clean it after every single use. I guess I was hoping for a basic seat that would act exactly like a normal toilet seat- the child sits down, the pee goes in the toilet, and you flush it away. Unfortunately, whenever my son urinates, even when keeping his parts pointed down, the pee gets everywhere! Maybe it is our particular toilet or something, but the splashing created from sitting so close to the edge of the toilet makes quite a mess. The urine gets on the toilet seat, between the bjorn and the seat, and on the bjorn itself- up under the edges.Honestly, I'm not really sure how the device could be improved to prevent this issue. I'd say- spend less money for a basic seat that you still have to clean up, but at least you'd have saved money! If you buy this seat (at least, for a boy), keep some wipes handy to keep your toilet seat clean for others to use!
B000056J76 I bought BABYBJ&Ouml;RN Toilet Trainer to potty train my son.  He likes using it, and the splash guard in the front works.  There is an adjustment wheel located at the back of the seat by the handle to adjust the Toile Trainer to the size of the regular toilet seat.  We have elongated Kohler toilets and the BABYBJ&Ouml;RN Toilet Trainer adjust to fit snugly.The reason I am rating it 4 stars is the adjustment wheel started slipping after a few removal and reinstallations.  Now if I have to reinstall the seat, I pre-adjust it and then position it onto the regular toilet seat.
B000056J76 It fits my toto oval shape toilet bowl, I like it! And my baby loves to put it on the toilet bowl and sits on it.
B000056J76 We bought this about 8 months before my daughter started seriously training. Once she started training this was a great seat and she used it until about six months after she was trained and could get up on the seat on her own. Great seat.
B000056J76 i first sat my baby on this when she was about 9 months old, and we've reduced the number of diapers significantly, with very rare #2 diapers, woohoo!!! of course i had to hold the baby, but at 11 months, holding is discouraged. there are occasionaly wiping of the front lip, but it seems much less ickier than cleaning out a typical potty.this fits almost all toilets except some smaller-sized apartment toilets, though i was able to place it on the toilet seat without having the trainer fit properly. (but then if your kid isn't too young, you probably won't need a trainer for a small toilet.) i even take this to other people's homes and have used it successfully everywhere.i'm so relieved that my baby cooperated with early potty training, and this product enabled me to accomplish that.
B000056J76 I just got done potty training my boy/girl twins using the small potty chairs that sit on the floor but we are planning a vacation in a few weeks and they were terrified of using the big potty but we really had to get them using one.  I bought a cheap-o potty seat and it slid around all over the place and they were scared to use it so we went back and paid twice as much and got the Bjorn and so glad we did.  We have a TOTO brand toilet and the seat is very deep and contoured so the lock on the Bjorn didn't work at all on our toilet seat, but because it also has a grippy bottom and is quite large, it fits great anyway.  My toddlers were fine using it and began using the big potty the same day we bought it.  Definately worth the extra money, great design!
B000056J76 Yes I am trying the impossible of early potty training with my 13 month old.  This seems well built but just in case anyone was wondering, a little too big for a 75%ile 1 year old
B000056J76 I like this toilet seat. It keeps his little butt out of the toilet. He likes it, too.Good for boys, no spray. Looks nice. Cleans easy.
B000056J76 the best!  we have 4, all over the house...
B000056J76 I love this seat. I have two in my house and this one is my favorite. The kids say it's comfortable and it adjusts to fit the seat. Which is great, since we actually have a round seat in one bathroom and an oval one in the other. I keep this one in the main bathroom, since it's the favorite. Definitely recommend this to anyone who has smaller butts (you know, children) in the house.
B000056J76 Good toddler toilet seat.  No issues.  Fits well on long toilet seat.  It does come up a little easier then I thought but still no issues.
B000056J76 We bought a couple of stand-alone potty seats a few months ago when our daughter was about 20 months old.  Although she was mildly intrigued by them at first and quickly learned what they were for, she seemed to view them more as glorified chairs rather than places to do her business.  Now that she's nearing the two-and-a-half year mark, we decided to buy a toilet trainer seat to see if that would get her more engaged in the potty training process.  After reading tons of potty seat reviews, I decided to purchase this BabyBjorn Toilet Trainer, since it's one of the few on the market that's made of BPA-free, non-toxic polypropylene plastic instead of toxic PVC or vinyl.  As an added bonus, this toilet trainer seat is fully adjustable to fit practically any size toilet seat.  We have oval-shaped, elongated toilet seats in our home, and the BabyBjorn potty seat fits them perfectly.  This toilet trainer doesn't slide around at all on the toilet seat, which helps my little-one to feel more secure while sitting on it.  Despite the exact fit, the toilet trainer seat is so easy to put on and remove that a preschooler could probably do it unassisted.  There's a handy loop at the back of the seat so that you can hang it nearby for easy storage.  (We hang it on aPotty Hookthat hooks over our toilet tank).As I said in the title of this review, the BabyBjorn Toilet Trainer would be just about perfect, if only it had handles for little-ones to hold onto.  Apparently, when toddlers first begin to use the \"grown-up toilet,\" many of them experience an innate fear of falling in, even when using a potty seat insert like this one.  Handles can help alleviate this fear by giving them something to hold onto to anchor themselves while sitting on the potty seat.  This was the case with my daughter.  When sitting on this toilet trainer seat, she couldn't relax enough to urinate, much less have a bowel movement.  She would either hold my hands or grab onto the sides of the (unsanitary) toilet seat in order to steady herself, but even then, she still couldn't relax enough to do her business.  On a hunch, I tried theArm & Hammer Secure Comfort Potty Seat, Colors May Vary, which is one of the few polypropylene potty seats that has handles.  The first time we used that seat, my daughter immediately grabbed onto the handles and peed for the first time in the toilet!  However, the Arm & Hammer potty seat is too small for my elongated toilet seat, and it's not adjustable, so it constantly slides around when my daughter is on it.  And unfortunately, none of the adjustable potty seats that are readily available on the market (the BabyBjorn, Pourty Flexi-Fit and Prince Lionheart WeePod), has handles.I thought we were doomed to be stuck with the ill-fitting Arm & Hammer potty seat until I came across a nifty product called the \"SHANDLE\". The Shandle is a handle that sticks to the underside of your toilet seat with a strong, moisture-proof adhesive strip.  It's intended to help little boys avoid touching the germy toilet seat by providing a more sanitary grab-handle for lifting and lowering the seat.  But the Shandle has turned out to be a perfect solution for us to the problem of using the handle-less BabyBjorn Toilet Trainer seat.  We just stuck a Shandle on each side of our toilet seat (around the same place that our daughter would grab onto the toilet seat), and voila!  She had two, secure handles to hold onto to anchor herself has she used the toilet trainer seat.  It doesn't hurt that the Shandle comes in a variety of kid-friendly designs such as dinosaurs, martians and robots, which makes them attractive to toddlers.  (It also comes in elegant fashion prints and plain white, for those who prefer their bathrooms to have a more adult look).  Our daughter isn't yet fully potty-trained, but now she's comfortable enough to pee in the toilet while using her BabyBjorn potty seat, and she looks forward to using the \"big potty.\"  (So much so that she's pretty much lost interest in her stand-alone \"baby\" potty!)If you've been holding off on getting this BabyBjorn potty seat because it doesn't have handles, please Google \"Shandle\" and consider giving the product a try.  It was the perfect solution for us.Grade: A- (1 star deducted because the BabyBjorn Toilet Trainer doesn't have built-in handles).
B000056J76 This is a fantastic seat for these reasons:1. Doesn't slide or wiggle on the toilet.2. Easy to clean!3. Pretty flat, light-weight compact design can pack easily in a suit case or other luggage for travel.4. Doesn't pinch skin.5. Child doesn't fall through hole (holds little behinds securely).6. Easily removeable for adult use of toilet.7. Carrying handle is great for kids and sanitary for moving the seat around.The only reason I did not give this seat 5 stars is if a little boy is sitting to go #1, you really have to make sure his \"aim\" is down otherwise as the force of urine stream hits the deflector it can splash up onto his legs a bit (nothing a bit of TP can't hande, though). If the deflector were a tad higher this problem probably would go away. The other issue is that if his \"aim\" isn't directed either right in the center of the deflector or right down into the bowl, the urine can splatter up under the deflector and make its way onto the toilet seat, toilet rim, and/or the back of the kid's pants if the clothing is not pushed down beyond the gap between the toilet seat and rim.No problems with #2.Don't forsee any trouble with little girl use either (daughter will use this seat in about 1 1/2 years).Despite the deflector issue - I would buy this product again there are too many other great attributes of it. All it means is a little extra foresight for mom and dad when he is getting ready to go.
B000056J76 I started having my son sit on this and the potty chair when he turned 14 months and he actually prefers sitting on this than the potty chair that is low to the ground.  This is great for me because it is less clean up!Would highly recommend!
B000056J76 This item is very simple to install and the white plastic makes it very easy to clean.  My son (22 months) has no problem sitting on it.  The shield for boys is not high enough to sit him close to the front but if I move him to the rear of the seat the stream doesn't go over the shield.  Great design, if it wasn't so pricey I would get rid of my portable potties and purchase 2 more of these.
B000056J76 This seat has worked very well for our 25-month-old boy.  Very easy to use and clean, and also easy to remove and replace to allow adults to use the toilet.  One caution: the splash guard in front will not always catch everything, especially if our son is not sitting centered and aligned with it, or if he moves around.  You'll need to watch out for this, and you'll likely have a little spillage from time to time.  Perhaps the next version can offer an expanded splashguard.  I still think this seat is very much worth buying.
B000056J76 My daughter was scared of falling in the toilet when she first started potty training.  She was so scared that she would wait until the very last second to go and she would have accidents because of it.  With this training seat she fit perfectly and her fear was over.  We ended up purchasing 3 of these because they worked so well.I am only giving it four starts though because we did find that she would hurt her booty and &#34;parts&#34; some times when she would try to slide up on it.  I understand why the bump in the front is there (to stop kids from peeing out the front of it) but if it could be made with a softer material (at least on the front) it might make it easier and less painful for kids to get on and off of.
B000056J76 After lots of reviews I figured this was the best seat for our long toilet's (Kohler brand). While this doesn't 100% fit/lock in. It does stay in place and is very comfortable for my son. It made for an easy transition from potty chair to the bigger toilet.
B000056J76 I think you have to like this toilet trainer.  It's comfortable, reliable and easy to clean.  This is a better model than many alternatives.
B000056J76 We have two of these toilet trainers: one for upstairs and one for downstairs. Love it! Easy for my two year old boy to use, non-slip, and does not attach to the toilet, so you simply lift it off to use the regular seat. The raised part in front is great--we don't have any aiming problems with this potty:)
B000056J76 It fits! Finally a sturdy potty seat for my awkward toilet. Potty training has been much easier now that my wiggly boy can sit without sliding off.
B000056J76 This is the first seat you used for potty training.  I LOVED it for the following reasons: 1. it adjusts to stay in place, 2. it fit all of the toilets in the house (important when you have two round and one elongated toilet), 3. it wasn't padded or cheesy (cheesy characters), and 4. I like that the shape sort of holds the child in.  I potty trained my daughter the week she turned 2 and wanted to be sure that she didn't fall off of the potty, but I also didn't want to deal with emptying a little potty into a big one.  This is a GREAT seat.  I would give it 4 1/2 starts if I could.  We ended up needing a second seat for another toilet and it had handles.  My daughter prefers to have the handles (even if the seat itself is not as secure), especially when she is pooping.
B000056J76 Happily we are way past the training. I forgot to review earlier, but this is a very good choice and no pinching or hang ups for my Grandson. I do recommend this one but you also will have to train him to hold himself down so the flow doesn't jump the small cup. He caught on right away so no problems there. Last but not least, the cleaning was easy, fast and comfortable from the first time on without fear of falling in because it's a perfect size.
B000056J76 The hubs and I don't really buy a lot of special baby/kid goods. Our two year old son drinks out of normal glasses, he eats with adult silverware, he never used a pacifier, etc etc. So we didn't want to buy him a separate little potty chair, either. Might as well start him on the real thing so we don't have to switch him over later, right? We bought this so that he could sit comfortably on a normal toilet.This is a lovely, sturdy device, which is very easy to clean and has a convenient hook for hanging on the wall. What a nice bathroom decoration. The guests. just. love. it. &#34;You have a toilet seat on your wall! Wow! That's great!&#34; said nobody ever. But whatever, it's an easy way to store it. The front lip is a little difficult for my son to get over when he's sitting down, but it seems like somewhat of a safety feature, so I'm good with it.I don't really know what to say. It's well made, but come on, it's a potty seat. Your kid sits on it to pee. It's not super hard to get that wrong. Anyway, my son is still not really interested in the potty, but that speaks more to his love of pooping in his diaper in whatever hidden corner he can find than the quality of the chair. I'd recommend this product to others.
B000056J76 I have 3 boys and this is the solution for our needs. I like it is made of hard plastic instead of the foam type seat, easy to clean. It has a nice shape for sitting. As far as a boy doing number 1 while sitting on the potty, he has to lean forward or you will have a mess to clean up. That doesn't seem to be a big deal to the boys. It has a nice loop on the top so we can hang it on the toilet with the potty hook and it is adjustable to fit different potty hole sizes. Seems very durable. I have one in every bathroom.
B000056J76 Having our grandson move closer meant I needed to purchase some necessary equipment - and a potty seat is definitely necessary.  However, the toilets in our home have elongated seats and many of the potty seats I looked at were made for standard toilet seats.  After reading numerous Amazon reviews, I decided to purchase the BABYBJ&Ouml;RN Toilet Trainer and am very pleased with my choice.The BABYBJ&Ouml;RN Toilet Trainer sits on the seat and is then secured by turning a wheel at the back of the seat.  This moves two \"wings\" so that the seat attaches securely to the toilet seat, even if it is an elongated seat.  After securing the seat, I tried to wiggle the BABYBJ&Ouml;RN Toilet Trainer from side-to-side as might happen with a rambunctious toddler.  The seat held firmly in place.The splash guard at the front of the seat is sufficiently high to prevent accidental oversprays.  Further, it is curved so that liquids do not hit it and splash out the sides; they flow down into the toilet as they should.  The solid piece construction of the main seat prevents waste products from becoming trapped in grooves or joints and minimizes the possibility of odor.Further, the seat rinses off easily and can then be hung, by the large attached loop, to dripdry.  I hung a light S-shaped hook over the towelbar on the back wall of the bathtub and use it to hold the BABYBJ&Ouml;RN Toilet Trainer after it has been rinsed.If you are looking for a quality potty seat which will fit both standard and elongated toilet seats, you should definitely consider the BABYBJ&Ouml;RN Toilet Trainer.  It is a five-star necessity!
B000056J76 This seat is awesome, it fits both elongated and normal bowls very snugly.  It does not slip and slide.  My 2 year old daughter can lift it up and put it on the toilet.  It is very easy to clean.  Great product.
B000056J76 Love this thing.  Relatively cheap, comes in various colors, has an adjustment knob to 'fit' various toilet sizes, the hooks allows you to hang it (added a tacky hook to bathroom wall) and best of all it doesn't have the creavises other seats have - let me explain.  Had another potty seat that was 'cushioned' -&#62;  not sure why a kid needs a cushioned seat, it is not like they will be sitting reading the newspaper for ten minutes at a time - anyway, it didn't take long for the vinyl cushion to get pee and other 'gunk' stuck between the cushion and the plastic rim - and then you have to look at it each time to put it on the toilet.  This is a better option.
B000056J76 I purchased this hoping to avoid using a stand alone toilet trainer.  This seat fits snugly onto the toilet and doesn't move around.  My daughter just didn't like sitting up on the adult toilet...Oh well, I know it will get used someday when she does feel more comfortable sitting up there.
B000056J76 We've been potty training my son for several weeks now, and he showed signs of being interested in using the big potty.  So we bought a well-rated fancy potty seat with all sorts of \"features\" that was absolutely terrible.  It was quickly returned, and replaced with this one.This seat is SO easy to use - there's a dial that's accessible from the top back to adjust its fit, and it's snug as could be.  We have one of the long oval toilet bowls, and that didn't cause any trouble with this seat.  It's secure and doesn't move around, but really easy to take off again for adults and older kids to use.  This only showed up this morning, but already my two and a half year old has nearly figured out how to get it on and off the toilet seat by himself.  It has a nice pee-guard for little boys, and sits down into the toilet a bit so the pee doesn't end up coming out between the toilet and seat.  We put a big sturdy step stool in front of the toilet, and my son is so excited now that he can get up there and down again by himself!
B000056J76 Works well, but you basically need to also buy the steps that go with it or your kid cannot get on the potty by themselves.. which is the point.  To be honest we have the mini potty by baby bjorn and it is simpler and the kids can do it all on their own... so this might be good for someone to use in a second bathroom where they do not want to have a little potty sitting around. You can easily hide it behind the toilet...
B000056J76 At first, I wasn't sure if this seat would work as it doesn't have side handles and the splash guard seemed too high. However, after three months of regular use, my 2.5 year old son has no problems with it and it fits nice and snugly on our Toto toilets.
B000056J76 We love this seat so much, we ended up getting two...one for each of our bathrooms. Our 2.5yr old has no problem getting on this herself with the help of a step stool and she likes the fact that she's going potty like a grown-up. Our favorite thing about using this seat is no more cleaning out pee-pee and poo-poo (gets pretty gross when my girl has diarrhea) since it goes right in the toilet!
B000056J76 great seat, fits well on toilet, my son loves it. comfortable.  great quality.  we also have the baby bjorn potty, so they make great products.
B000056J76 We ordered this seat for our daughter after she liked the one her cousins had.  It is a great size for a little two-year-old learning to sit on the toilet.  The front part can get a little messy if they scoot forward after using the bathroom, but the surface is very easy to clean.  This is a great little seat.
B000056J76 Used this seat for my daughter, and now using it for my son. The guard is great as long as you teach your son how to sit properly on the seat. This has been a great seat for us, and it fits both of our toilets securely. No complaints from the kids either.
B000056J76 Now I know why the cheap potty seats are so cheap. Wish I has been able to see this side-by-side with the cheap ones. If I had this would have been the one I would have bought. This potty seat is well designed, doesn't rock, and is one piece. It's adjustable and easily fits the toilet at my son's house and the one at my house. My granddaughter wouldn't sit one the \"cheap\" one bought originally but really likes this one. Dry days are coming soon, wish they had these when my kids were at this stage.
B000056J76 This potty seat is simple, comfortable and easy to use.  I have only found one toilet that it did not fit on.  Only potty seat we'll use for our kids.  We love it!  Seat is made in Sweden.
B000056J76 This product really does fit ALL toilets. We used it on the road at a hotel, and it fit on the hotel's elongated toilet. I highly recommend it.
B000056J76 Which just about says it all!This potty seat is easy for my daughter to put on the potty and remove. We have a hook on the wall for hanging it when she's not using it. She seems to find it comfy to, judging from how long she's willing to sit there sometimes. And, best of all, it's relieved her totally valid fears of falling into the big potty, which means a lot less little potty clean-up for us.This is our 3rd potty seat. The other two had soft, foamy seats, which try as we might, we couldn't keep clean. We ended up tossing them, as they would eventually begin to smell, and become discolored from the inside out. They always seemed to leave my daughter's bum with an angry red rash too. So, the absolute best feature of this potty seat is how clean it is, how clean it stays, and how low maintenance it is. We wipe it down occasionally, but its wonderful design keeps it from getting waste on it, and keeps germs from accumulating.Lastly, it's easy to install for any toilet. We have one in both our bathrooms, and sent one to my daughter's preschool, so it fits large toilets as well.Despite the higher price, this is an item that will last a long time and function as expected. Ultimately, I believe that makes it worth the extra money.
B000056J76 Fits on larger toilet seat. I don't even need to secure it to the lid, fits perfectly without moving. Easy to clean and lightweight. Transportable if you need to take it places.
B000056J76 It is so secure when placed on a toilet and really - that's what I was worried about.  It's very comfortable for my big/tall toddler and I feel very safe when she uses it.
B000056J76 So easy to put on, use and take off that my two-year-old has no problem doing it by himself.  I have an oval, enlongated toilet that we use this seat on. A twist of the dial in back simply adjusts it to fit. There's no screwing and unscrewing it each time you use it... just do it once for fit.There's a different brand at church that has handles, so I thought he'd miss not having the them to hold onto. He doesn't miss them at all. In fact, if you are potty training, it's best to imitate the really thing anyways.  You're not going to find handles on a public toilet, so why train your kids to get used to them being there?The rubber edge allows it to grip the seat. You put it on there and it's not going to slip.The gentle contour of the front splash guard makes it a great seat for both boys and girls to use. It doesn't get in the way and is still functional.It does what it says and does it well. Very happy with this purchase.
