My daughter loves this swing. The little animals are adorable and the fabric is incredibly soft. The fabric also holds up well for washing and is not bad to stain. The swing speeds are wonderful. My daughter was slightly premature and weighed just over 6 pounds, now at 2 months she's about 8.5 pounds and levels 1 or 2 on the swing are excellent for her. I feel like the higher speeds will be handy as she grows and gains weight.
If you're into keeping it simple, this swing is for you. It does the job. Indeed it is a little low to the ground and the reclining settings are tricky, but for the price, I found it to be alright. The music is okay. Maybe a little too loud. The swinging motion does take a few seconds to warm up. Overall a good swing for a low price.
Level set - First time parents.We were using a swing from a family member until it broke.  We started reading reviews and bought this one.  It's great!!  Very quite (compared to the one we had), cannot even hear the motor if your right next to it.  The timer setting is great and helps saves on batteries.  It plays music, but lets just say the sounds not coming out of a Bose system (but thats normal with all baby noise makers).  Would recommend to anyone looking for a swing.
I got his swing as a baby shower present. We started our son on it when he was about a week old, he is now 9 weeks. Some pros and cons:Pros:--Is truly very quiet--Has a variety of speeds, and does seem to recognize the baby's weight--Compact size doesn't take up too much room - a plus for us since we live in an apartmentCons:--We got this in the Biscotti color. The color scheme is pretty but, to a baby, super bland and uninteresting. If I had it to do over again, I'd get a more colorful one.--The toys are placed too high and, again, mainly white and very light blue. They aren't very inviting to bat or swing at. My son ignores them.--Solely battery operated - it takes 4 C batteries. I have yet to replace them, but it's probably because we don't keep him in the swing for very long (he hasn't really taken to it).--Bucket shape of the seat seems pretty uncomfortable. My son ends up with his head to the side after a while.All in all, it's probably an okay swing for the price, but it hasn't done much to really keep our baby happy. He gets uncomfortable in it quickly, and for the short amount of time that he is in it, it's not very stimulating. It could be that he just doesn't like swings, but there are definitely design elements to this one that make me think he'd do better in something else.
We had a big swing with my first baby.  It took up a ton of space in the living room, so we opted for this one.  LOVE the idea of having a compact swing for the next one.  Unfortunately, it just didn't swing much... even on full batteries, so the next baby hated it.  I would love this if it had a more vigorous swing!
This is a nice, quality made swing.  Unfortunately, my grandson doesn't like it.  Has one at home just like it and loves it, but doesn't like the one at my house.  I really wish he did because it's a really nice baby swing.
This swing is great for the price.  My daughter's old swing was just that...  old.  It was hard as a rock and the recline feature was practically non-existent.  This new swing is really nice, I almost wish they made it for adults because it looks so comfortable.  The fabric it's made out of is nice and soft.  I was a little hesitant to buy this after reading some reviews that said the rocking motion wasn't quite up to par with some of the full sized models but so far I'm not seeing any problems.  It's top speed, while yes, is a little less intense than that of her old swing, it is still a nice amount of rocking.  And when this product says it's quiet it really means it; the only noise this swing makes is with the music.  On that subject, the music is nice and calming, each track comes with two sound levels depending on your preference.  The combination of the swinging and the music puts my daughter right to sleep.
We purchased this swing for my son because we have a small home and didn't want a full sized swing because of the large footprint. I would say this swing is just \"OK\". On the pro side, it's an attractive swing, and does fold up nicely for storage. It also performs the function you would expect - it swings. On the con side, as other reviewers have stated, the upright position is *very* upright. Couple that with the fact that the harness is not very well oriented for security (shoulder straps seem to easily slip off my baby's torso) and I can see how other reviewers have said their babies have fallen out of this swing. I would not leave my baby unattended in this swing in the upright position. Also, the music is pretty dang bad, and as other folks have said, it's pretty loud. The animals that hang down really seem to be more decorative than functional. They are very high up and I think my son will be grown out of the swing before he could ever reach them. They are also very monochromatic, and so aren't very exciting for baby to look at (by contrast we have the Fisher Price Calming Vibrations bouncer and my son loves the animals that hang on that one). I can't comment on the timer function because I never leave my son in here for long periods of time. Not sure I would buy this swing again, but seeing as though we already have it, it does the job.
we have the 'my little lamb' full size swing, which we absolutely love! but we keep it upstairs next to our bed and i wanted one downstairs for during the day so i thought this would be perfect. i absolutely hate this thing. first of all, it's not comfy. maybe if your baby starts out in this thing, it's ok, but if you are expecting a super plush soft place for your little one to take naps, this is not it. secondly, the sounds are either too quiet or too loud. there isn't a dial to turn it up and down, just two buttons, loud or quiet. thirdly, and worst of all, my child almost fell out of this on numerous occasion. it's not shaped in a cup shape to hold baby. it's almost too flat and the baby can slide right out with just a little bit of movement. we sent ours back. i would spend $40 more and get the my little lamb swing. its the best swing ever and our 4 month old son still takes naps in it!
I am a mom of two and have owned several baby swings. My kids needed the swings to get them to sleep when they were infants - if you have a bad back and can't rock your child, then a swing is what you need! If you are looking for portability then this is a great swing, but keep in mind that NO travel swing will be as powerful as a full-size model. We have the full size Fisher Price papasan and the ocean wonders swings, and they were amazing and plenty powerful - colicky babies prefer vigorous swinging to soft rocking. Yes, they eat through batteries, but who cares when your child will sleep 4 hours in the swing as opposed to 1 hour in the crib! But I digress...As for this travel swing:Pros:Much more portable than a full size swingMore portable than the fisher price travel swing (I had the ocean wonders model)Folds pretty flat for travelNo noise at all (the full-size models always click when swinging)Decent battery life for a swingEasy to assembleHas a recline optionDecent music if you want itTimer if you want it, or just leave the swing on constantlyCute to look at for you and babyEasy to cleanCons:\"Speed\" settings are really all 1 speed - why bother with a speed dial? This seems to be typical of all swings though, both travel and full-sized.Will never move as vigorously as a full-sized swing - top speed is barely moving in comparison to a full-sized swing. If your child is used to a full-sized swing, this swing might not move vigorously enough to rock him/her to sleep. However, if they are not used to a full-sized model than this one might be fine.A tip for all swings: Use good batteries (Duracell only) to get the most vigorous swinging out of your swing. The cheap ones, even Energizers, will barely move your swing!Update: 1 BIG CON for this swing that I discovered last night - it automatically shuts off after 1 hour, even without using the timer feature. I wanted it to run continuously like the full-size swing would, but it won't. Why include a timer for 15 minute increments if the swing shuts off in 1 hour anyway? My babies wake up when the swing stops, which is exactly what happened. Argh! This makes the swing fairly useless to me if I want my baby to sleep in the swing during the night, because she will wake every hour when the swing automatically shuts off!
When my baby turned four months, we decided to go on a family trip. I didn&#8217;t want to use the hotel&#8217;s crib, so I purchased this swing for him to sleep and play in. He is now almost six months and he uses it daily to just hang around in. It comes in handy when we need to go places, such as the beach, park, or family member&#8217;s house. The colors are nice and neutral so it looks nice when it&#8217;s placed in my house. The only thing I don&#8217;t like about this swing is that when you attach the arch playing thing it hinders the swinging. They should make an attachment that actually work with the swing!
I was using a \"My Little Snugabunny\" swing (by Fisher Price) that I borrowed from my friend, but the motor went out in it. Rather than spend $75 for a new motor, I thought I'd try a smaller, more portable, more economical swing.Here's what I like:-This swing was reasonably easy to put together.-It is lightweight and easy to tote from one room to another, so I can use it as a baby seat if I want, as well.-The fabric and designs are cute and soft.-The toy bar moves back to make it easier to get baby out.-It doesn't have difficulty swinging my 3 month old son, who is almost 14 lbs.Here's what I don't like:-The 5-point harness is a little hard to put on, so sometimes I don't use it, like if he is fussing when I put him in and I'm not sure if the swing will calm him to sleep or if I will need to take him out right away. Probably just a habit I need to get used to.-It doesn't swing as hard as the Snugabunny, but my baby is getting used to it.Overall, this is a good, economy-priced, portable swing.
I really like everything about this swing. I love how the material feels, and how soothing the color scheme is. It's not super bright and over whelming. it was easy to assembly and it folds away for storage. I wish it had an AC adapter because like any portable swing it goes thru batteries. it also had 2 head recline positions depending on baby's age.
I already have a larger Graco swing/bouncer that I keep downstairs, but wanted something that I could easily pack up for trips and also for upstairs. Lugging the large one is just too much of a pain. When my little guy is feeling the need to be held all day, but I want a shower I just pop it out and stick it front of the door. If he makes a mess of it in a matter of seconds I can have it stripped down and in the washer then dryer (on low). The only thing I find annoying about it is that the toys don't face the baby.
The swing itself functions fine, but the straps are extremely stiff/rough. I wouldn't want that strap rubbing on my skin, so imagine having that rub on baby skin?!
We debated getting a full-size swing like the Fisher-Price Papasan-type, but in the end decided our house was just too small. I'm glad we did. I've gotten pretty much everything I wanted out of this swing for less than half the price of the larger one we were considering. It's quiet, unobtrusive, and it makes our baby fall asleep in an instant. It doesn't have a power cord, but the batteries have only just run out after three months of near-constant use. It's also very sweet-looking. The music is obnoxious and overly loud so we don't use it, and I don't like that it stops automatically after an hour, but in general I am very pleased and would buy it again.
I bought this for my newborn daughter and she loves it. Its easy to pack away or pack up to send her to her grandparents! I have a 2 year old daughter that at first thought she could sit in it, but after a couple times telling her it was for the baby she stopped and doesn't bother with it at all now.
I've bought a lot of products from bright starts 
I just left a review for another Bright Starts product (Bright Starts Safari Swing, Dots and Spots) because I tried them both, starting with that one and then \"upgrading\" to this one hoping to get better results. Useless to say that my LO hated them both.The reclining positions are awkward, the straps are uncomfortable, it doesn't swing with the toy bar attached (the other one had the same issue and customer service told me to bend it, that trick worked with the other swing but not with this one, they are sending me a new toy bar but I doubt it will solve the issue). My LO just hated them both. I also didn't care much about the music played and never really used the timer, my LO lasted in it an average of 2 minutes and never fell asleep in it, only way he would sleep in it was if I put him in it once he was already asleep - but as soon as he woke up he used to start yelling.I would not recommend this swing - go with a bouncy chair instead if you don't have much room for a regular size swing.
This swing is so nice and it truly is portable, well made, and it collapses down for storage or for toting around to where ever!
It's a very nice product.  It was relatively easy to assemble, and it does the job perfectly - it swings, it's got excellent music (probably the best quality music out of all the baby toys that we own), and it looks comfy.  One thing I didn't like was that the toys are attached to the bar in such a way that you can't take them off for washing or just to give to baby to play with.  Our biggest disappointment was that our daughter didn't like being in it, but I don't think that's criticism of the swing, that's just the way she is - doesn't like being strapped in and stationery.
i love this swing.. i love the fact that it reclines almost flat so if my baby fell asleep she wont get tired. i've had it for three months now, can't complain, i use it daily for like 6 hrs total every single day.. and I didn't have to change the batteries not even once.... to whoever said the speeds are all the same.. don't listen, they're wrong, i actually put it on third or second speed.. because the highest speeds are too fast my 6 month baby girl is uncomfortable.. so the speed ascends it's not all the same.. and the swing is safe,, i always leave my baby in it while i do chores and cook.
So, this is small and very low to the ground but it is nice and soft.  I wish it had more recline options than just upright or fully reclined.  Unfortunately, my newborn baby (for whom the swing was intended) doesn't enjoy being in this swing and cries soon after being placed there.  I do not know whether it is because she doesn't like any swings or whether it is just this particular swing but I do not have plans to purchase another swing to find out.On the bright side, my 2 year old toddler loves it and uses it every day, although not in the way it is intended to be used. He is 35 pounds and hasn't broken it yet but it has only been assembled for a few days now.  He likes to sit in it and rock it with his legs (using it sort of like a mini recliner).  He also gets more daring and balances his whole body in it while swaying the swing wildly.  Sometimes he gets on his belly and swings that way, too.  All of this is pretty humorous if not completely safe.  Luckily, the swing is low enough to the ground that he can't get too badly hurt.  The toddler also likes to play the music but the baby doesn't seem too interested in it.So, at least my toddler is enjoying it and in that sense we are getting our money's worth and a few laughs out of it...until he breaks it, of course.
I've bought two of this swing, one for my baby girl, and another one for a friend, so you can tell I really like this swing.The color of this swing is beautiful (I bought the pink one).  It's portable, and it is easy to use.  It's very quiet.  The thing I like most is that it does not swing too fast, perfect for a new born baby.  The manual says this swing adjusts the swing motion according to the baby's weight.  I already got a full size swing at home (Starlight Papasan Cradle Swing from Fisher Price), but that swing goes very fast even when I set it to the lowest speed.  I guess the TrueSpeed technology in this Bright Starts swing does help for lower weight babies.My baby has reflux, so I cannot lay her down after feeding for 30-45 mins.  Usually I set the seat to upright position and put my baby there after feeding for 45 mins (of course with the swing turned off), and then I can move her to the crib.
We used this swing till my baby turned 9 months old. This swing is perfect ,it doesn&#8217;t occupy a lot of space, its very sturdy, the material is soft and machine washable and the music is very soothing. It&#8217;s a great product for a low price. I highly recommend this product.
I purchased this to keep at my home for my grandson, rather than go for a full size swing that would be in the way in my rather limited space.  I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of this swing, and the price was great.  The music is sort of classical, and it grows on you.  It also folds up nicely, easy to just stand it in a corner, out of the way until you need it.  We used it until my grandson was about 7 months old, and after that he sort of lost interest, but I would think it would work well until the child is 18 pounds or so (in my opinion).  I would recommend this swing.
I realize a portable swing won't do as much as a full one, but it should work consistently! Mine swings sometimes and others not! I've tried changing the batteries, making sure no one moved it or pushed it while it was on, tried different speeds. But it's all luck. Sometimes it swings great and the next time you barely get any movement no matter how high you set it. Very disappointed.
We got this swing for my newborn daughter after returning a more expensive one (by Fisher Price which was making horrible screeching noises!) This one is very quiet, easy to assemble, doesn't take much space, BUT! It doesn't seem to help calming my baby =( When I try to put her in the swing when she already cries, she only starts to scream louder... It seems like the swing irritates her more. =( She is sleeping well in it when I put her there while she is already asleep, so really I could just keep her in her bassinet... There are only three melodies (which are a bit annoying to me) and she is not paying attention to the toys above her yet. According to most reviews it works well for other babies, so it's worth a try. I agree that this swing is better suitable for the newborns.
We have a newborn son who does not like this swing. Many experts say to bring your child to the store to try out each swing to see which one they like but who can do that? I wanted to have one at home when he arrived. So we picked a travel ready swing. The swing itself is super cute, good quality, and looks exactly as advertsied. The music is cute if not a little quiet, and it swings pretty fast which is great. But our son cries the second we turn on the swing part. We use it now just to sit him. He likes the vibrating bouncy better. I recommend trying it our first. Many children probably love it. It is a good product, just not for my son.
I really like this product the design and colors are very cute. It works well for my baby who is now 2 months old andstill loves it.
This is a nice little swing with a small footprint... but unfortunately our daughter prefers the much more expensive \"side-to-side\" swing. No complaints about this swing. It was a great price, quiet, and the small size was great, too. Just didn't work for us.
He seems to like this wayyyy more then his papasan cradle swing im not sure why but he does.  I agree with the other post about the dial speed not really increasing that much but on the highest setting it was still kind of fast so I really dont mind.  My son is 4 months and i give him maybe a month or 2 more depending on his growth spurts whether or not he will still be able to fit in it without his feet dragging.
so cute so precious sound and swing quality is excellent. Low to the ground, stable, easy to move around, good quality.
uses c batteries , my son never liked the swings much , but he loves his bouncy seat but if a kid likes the swing i am sure they would like it
its not one of the sturdy ones. my daughter was good in it for the first three months and after that she doesnt want to sleep it it better buy a big one which could hold them for a year or so. this one cant be used beyond 3 - 4 months.
It probably is a very good swing. Our baby just wasn't excited about it. She would get bored quickly and had to be moved to the bouncy chair.From a parent point of view, it seems nice. The music has two volume and two duration settings. And it's not too annoying. The swing was fairly easy to put together and the cover is machine washable.
I purchased this swing for my granddaughter.  She is five weeks old today, and I'm watching her sleep in it as I write this review.  It was easy to put together.  I did it myself.  It has numerous levels of motion.  She seems to like it on level 2.  I did put it on the highest level, but it was going very fast.  I will give my best assessment so others can make a good choice in deciding to purchase.  There is a curved bar across the top with 2 hanging toys.  The toys hang low so I placed them across the top of the bar.  The bar has to be pushed all the way back in order for the swing to be in the right position for a young baby......in a more reclined position.  The swing itself is a stretchy material that goes over a metal frame.  This creates a type of pouch for the baby to lay in.  There is a timer button with 15, 30, and 45 minute sessions.  I have not used this feature.  The swing seems to have a good long battery life.  It takes 4 C batteries.  You will need a small Phillips screw driver to open the battery cover.  You will need a regular Phillips screw driver to put the 4 screws in the frame of the swing.  There is a musical feature that plays in two levels.....high and low.  Neither of which are too low or too high.  Hope this helps...we love it!
This toy has saved the day on long car trips.  My son adored this thing at the age of 4 months, when we got it.  He's seven months old now, and this is still his favorite car toy.  The octopus's face is so friendly that he can stare and talk to it for an unbelievably long time.  He loves to grip the legs and rings, and the music is a never-fail way to stop tears and bring a smile to his face.  This is a really great toy.
This is a cute and  colorful octopus. It will surely grab the attention of our grandson with the dangling legs and the colors.
I have the Octoplush and this hanging Octopus that I bought because I thought it would be similar to the Octoplush but able to go along for stroller rides.  It is almost identical in concept, but the differences make this product a huge letdown.  The legs are not fun to press and you have to pull the string to make music rather than pressing the head, which my daughter knows to do.  I think this product was a blend of the Octoplush and Baby Einstein's answer to the Lamaze toy \"Captain Calamari,\" but they made him more like CC than Octoplush.  You'd be better off figuring out a way to attach the Octoplush to a stroller/carrier and take it along.
It keeps my 4 month old busy while he is in his car seat. The sounds are short but he just keeps pulling on it to listen to it. It plays two songs and bubble noices. He also loves the crinkle paper in it. I like that it has other languages on it to help teach your child.
I love the ocean and was excited to get an ocean themed toy for my baby.  However... no wonder kids these days have ADD!  The music/sounds are soooo freaking short!  The ocean/bubbles sound lasts ONLY 1 second, then there are 2 songs that lasts ONLY 10 seconds each.  You pull, hear the bubbles sound, pull again for song #1, pull again for the bubbles, then pull again for song #2... that's a lot of freaking pulling in only 22 seconds!  I am NOT exaggerating... I timed the sounds.I would have returned it had I not torn off the packaging in my haste and excitement.  Toy looks cute but dang... it was made for kids with super short attention spans!
My boy love this octopus immediately when i introduced to him. But sad to say that the music part get spoilt after a few pull. Thus he is playing it now without the music.
We introduced Mr. Octopus (we call him that too!) to our son around 3 months and he just loved this toy. He couldn't grab yet but we would crinkle the tentacles and play the music for him. Now that he is 6 months, we can't go anywhere without this toy! He can now grab the tentacles and crinkle and chew on them as much as he wants. He chews on all the rings and snuggles with it in his car seat and the music does (most of the time) stop the bored tears. So far, I've just been spot cleaning it but does anyone know if there's a more thorough way to clean the whole body? He gets dropped/thrown on various floors a lot (restaurants) so I take it into the bathroom and dab it with paper towels but I'd just like a more thorough cleaning when we get home. It's soft, no hard edges and I feel safe letting him play with it while I do something else.
I bought this cart cover to replace an Infantino cover that I HATED. I haven't used it for a highchair yet, but it's fine for shopping carts. It covered the whole cart and has little loops that I attached my son's toys to. I'm only giving it four stars instead of five because it doesn't come with a belt. I feel that it's silly to have a cover to keep your baby away from germs if you're going to use the yucky belt on the cart. But if you don't mind the cart belt, or if you get a belt for it, it's great! I've washed it once so far and it held up fine.*****Four months later and it's still holding up great! I've washed it a few times and it hasn't started to fall apart, like some other reviewers claimed. I can see one or two loose threads, but nothing that's going to make it un-usable or that I can't easily fix. Still love it!*****
I love that I have a little more piece of mind that my teething daughter won't be putting her mouth on the cart or high chair, but it dosen't stay on the handles of the cart well.  I also wish it had a bit more flexibility as to where the restraints could come through.  A lot of carts have the restraint at the top of the cart and then it won't clasp if I put it through the spaces provided.  Cute design and good quality material.
This is wonderful for covering not-so-clean restaurant highchairs and cushioning shopping cart seats.  The colors are bright and Baby loves to chew on it.  There are 3 cloth hooks on the front for attaching toys.  Wonderful idea!  My son can have a few toys to play with and be entertained all through dinner.  It rolls up for storage in the car - not great, but smaller.
This cover is the same color as the picture, Sometimes you buy something and the color is off but not this, It's so nice and fits most shopping carts, the carts at target are made a little bigger so it doesn't fit as well all the way around but still does the job, it fit's a high chair well and I even put it on the swing at the park.  It has 2 hooks to attach toys and pockets in the back for maybe a bottle keys and your wallet.  I definitely recommend this.
I really went looking for a nice shopping cart / high chair cover to use with my 7 month old son.  I was drawn to this one because of the bright blue colors, it really compliments the baby, and I've had more than a few comments: )The Good:- It's not bulky.  Folds up well.- Simple design- Pockets in the back for storing items- Two reinforced feet holes for baby's legs- Elastic that fits well around the handles of the shopping cart so baby won't lean over and suck on the handle bar.- For a standard shopping cart it covers well!- Strap in the back to attach the cover to the grocery cart for security.The Bad:- Most covers fold into themselves making it easier to carry; this feature isn't a big deal for me, but to be able to roll up the cover and clip it together would have been nice.  Unfortunately with this you end up stuffing it under your arm making carrying baby, purse, and cover a bit difficult.- The cover includes one strap to attach it to a grocery cart, but not one to strap the baby in.  There are holes for the straps of the grocery cart, but I've found some store straps are just too short, so baby wasn't able to be strapped in at all.  That was a big disappointment! It would have been nice to have a fall back option.- Shopping cover works well on standard carts, but on a oversized cart like the one's at Costco, or Sam's Club, you have to pull it over in the back and it doesn't fit well.Overall it's a nice cover that works well.  It works great in restaurant high chairs too, pretty simple to use, here the straps work great.  But I was really bummed that the cover didn't come with it's own strap to secure baby, it would have been a nice added feature.On a side note, this cover is very similar to the Boppy Cart Cover, which they sold with a similar pattern, but isn't being sold any more.  I wonder if they were designed and manufactured by the same company some how.
This is a life safer. It assembles perfectly like everything Bugaboo. My toddler loves riding on it. It beats having a two baby stroller. I do have to walk a little sideways so that I dont bump into it but it is no big deal.
It will help you a lot! Toddler loves it, it makes a fun ride everywhere you go, if you have the &#34;mono&#34; version of donkey, it is the perfect complement.
I was prepared not to like the board based on the split reviews but I ended up liking it. My  3 1/2 year old likes it too. We have the (now discontinued) Gecko, which is basically the Frog (the handle doesn't extend on the Gecko either). Yes, the board does stick out a few inches and it does \"duck waddle\" my stride a little (I'm 5' 5\") but I'm willing to sacrifice that for being able to corral my child and move at a good pace with two kids. Also the wheel is sturdy and the ride still Bugaboo-smooth on rough surfaces (including dirt road). We keep the board attached to the stroller--the board is light and folds up and out of the way nicely, even when we fold the stroller to put in the back of the car (I see another reviewer had problems with the cord, there's a catch it slides into on the underside of the board that she may have missed, I did too at first. We haven't had a problem with it).We don't rely on this set-up as our sole stroller option for both at this age--we have a double umbrella stroller for longer trips etc. But for shopping trips, walking the dog, shorter day trips this works well, even on rough terrain. And I enjoy the face time it provides between my kids. I'd give it 5 stars if I were completely waddle-free when I walked. 
We got this wheel board for our Bugaboo Frog (a discontinued model that is very similar to the chameleon). With baby #2 soon to arrive we were hoping it would mean we did not have to buy a double stroller...but unfortunately that is not to be. While our 2 year old absolutely adores riding on it (and it is very convenient when we are at the zoo or somewhere else where getting him in and out of the stroller frequently is necessary), it is a total pain for the parents. Maybe if you are both 6' it wouldn't matter, but as other reviewers have mentioned we both have to stand off to the side and push with one hand (this also might not matter on models with an adjustable handlebar). This really detracts from the Bugaboo's otherwise smooth handling and good ride.We're also not sure that it's going to work well for our toddler when there is a newborn in the bassinet. The bassinet extends partially over the board, and the whole contraption will be awkward. So it looks like we'll be getting a double after all and saving the wheel board for trips to the zoo or short trips places where a double wide isn't convenient.The other problem is that we can not figure out how to get it to stay folded up when not in use without removing the wheel. Removing the wheel isn't difficult (push a button and it pulls right out), but for $100 you'd think it would stay upright when that's how you want it. The cord doesn't do a darn thing to keep it upright, no matter how much we play with it or adjust it. So we remove the wheel and put the strap from the storage bag underneath around it as extra security.If we'd spent $50 or less I'd be happy enough with the limited use we'll get out of it. For $100...eh. Not worth it.
I was a bit skeptical about buying this board after reading the reviews.  I thought the board was too expensive for what it was and it seemed really annoying to have this attached to my stroller.  My son is 3 years old and I have a 7 week old baby.  I finally caved and bought the board because my friend said that her son loved it.  My son has not used this stroller for some time.  He now prefers to walk.  BUT once the new baby came, he all of a sudden wanted to use the stroller and threw tantrums when we tried to put our daughter in the stroller.  Once we attached this board, it was like a new little boy!  He loves it! He jumps on and off and wants to go outside JUST so he can ride the board.  He does occasionally still get jealous of our daughter riding in the stroller but for the most part, he is a happy camper.PROSReally easy to install (took me, the mom, about 10 minutes)Comes off really easily if you need to take it off for any reasonMy son LOVES itFits bugaboo perfectly, so easy to pushCONSExpensiveYou have to walk to the side of the stroller to avoid kicking the board
I bought this new board to use with my bugaboo cameleon3 and I am really glad I did. I think the reviews on here can be misleading because bugaboo redesigned the board a few years back, and it sounds like some of the reviews are from the old board.  I had the old board too and it was a real pain. This one is much better.1. People complain that you have to walk to the side a little or you will otherwise bump into the board. This is generally true of any buggy board. I don't find it to be too bad with this one, as the newer board is much shorter than the old one so it sticks out less. Also, when I am using the board i extend the handle of the stroller so that I can stand a little further back and push.2. The best improvement about this board is that it is easy to attach and detach whenever you may want. With the old board you needed to turn the stroller upside down to detach it, so you certainly couldn't do that while a child was inside, and it was a real pain to do even without a child inside. This board has two little latches that you can use to simply detach it. I find that it doesn't fold up very well with the bassinet option because the bassinet is so long. So instead i just detach it after I drop my older child off at school and put it in the basket underneath. Then I can walk the rest of the way without bumping into the board!I have used a few different boards for different strollers and I definitely like this one the best.  And when you read reviews please keep in mind that the product changed a while back (I don't know when exactly) so make sure you are reading about the newest model.
Read the previous reviews, how you have to waddle to push it. I don't really have that problem. I extended the handle on the stroller as far out as it could go, and just keep my arms out more in front of me when I push. I walk normally. It's no big deal. For the convenience of keeping both kids contained, I don't mind. Our son calls it his &#34;skate&#34; and asks for it every time we are out. I am so very glad I ignored the previous reviews and purchased it. Sure, it's pricey, but it is well made. I don't use the strap to hold it up, since that part does seem a bit flimsy (the bungee cord doesn't seem strong enough to hold it up); I simply don't put on the skate when I know we won't be using it. Otherwise, son is quite content staying on it. I've gotten LOTS of positive comments from other moms...about what a great idea it is, how wonderful it looks, etc. We have the car seat adapter, and we put the car seat handle all the way forward so our son holds on to that handle, peering into his baby sister, as I push it around. I also LOVE that even with the extra 40 lbs our son adds to the stroller, I can still maneuver it with just one hand! I LOVE the stroller (it's the same one we used for our 4 y/o, so it's lasted us that long) and I LOVE the &#34;skate&#34;.If you are on the fence about it, buy it, and try it around the house. If it doesn't work, return it. If you have long legs, then I can see how you'll step on this often. I am 5'3&#34;. My husband, who is 5'10&#34; usually walks next to it when he's pushing both kids; but he doesn't seem to mind since we don't have to worry about our 4 y/o running off.
Our child enjoys standing on the wheelie board when he just doesn't want to sit in the stroller anymore. It was easy to assemble and even easier to operate once attached, but the restraining cord is a little weak to take the weight of the board, causing it to open on more than one occasion. Many heads turn and smile, too, when they see this in action!
I JUST found out there is a weight limit on the Bugaboo Universal Wheeled Board...We've been packing our 2 kids on it just fine for about 6 months now (they are about 30 pounds each...whoops!). We haven't had any problems at all. Yes, you have to either walk on the side of it or straddle it while walking, because you'll kick it if you walk normally. But to me it's a small price to pay for the convenience and awesomeness of being able to take 3 kids all around town with such ease. Kids love riding on it, I love pushing them on it. Attaches to the chameleon like butter.
This wheeled board was a bit of a disappointment.  My son loves to use it to stand and, even more, to get in and out of the stroller.  However, it sticks out too far to walk comfortably with the Bee, even though it's meant for the Bee.  So, you have to walk a little to the left or right of the stroller, which isn't comfortable.  In addition, the strings will not hold the board up while not in use.  It falls right down.  Lastly, it's difficult to access the brake with it on as it covers where the brake is.
I have two of these to use in just a regular white step trash can for my cloth diaper pail.  I love the colors (I have chocolate and sage) and they function perfectly for what we need.  I've been using them 4 months so far and they've held up great and each one is washed and dried about every 4 days (I do wash every 2 days but alternate pail liners so I always have a clean one).  Just what I expected and needed!
Great product- it's a pretty color, exactly what's in the picture. It does a good job keeping the moisture in the pail and is easy to clean!
Works well as a basic pail liner. Nothing fancy which is what to be expected for the price. If your looking for a 'odor' blocking bag you need to spend more for the zippered ones. I use this in my diaper dekor that we got before we started CDing. I have washed and dried numerous times and they are still holding up well.
I use these for my cloth diaper pail and throw them in the wash with the diapers. Keeps my diaper pail clean and is easy enough to transport to the washer. Fits great in an 11 gallon (pretty standard sized) trash can. Really like the green color (I have the navy as well). Seems like quality material and has been holding up well, I expect it to last awhile! Not sure it contains 100% of the smells (but it is holding diapers after all!)
This pail liner is great. I actually have two of them so that I always have one clean. The elastic is very strong, so it stays on your pail until you take it off. I don't know what else to say other than that it does its job well.
Love these bags. We have two (you need the second while the first is in the wash) and are about to purchase a third for our little ones' soiled clothing. I love that the elastic stays put - so easy to take in and out of pail with one hand! (Baby in the other!) A few notes: as other reviewers have mentioned, you'll need a pail with these as the top is elastic, not drawstring. Also, because it's waterproof, I find that it sometimes holds onto water in the spin cycle which requires longer dryer times for my cloth diapers. No biggie, but something to be aware of.
I prefer this pail liner to the hanging wet/dry bag made by the same company. Of course, it depends on your set-up, but I find it easier to put the dirty diaper into an open trashcan with this pail liner in it than having to hold open the wet/dry bag to put in a dirty diaper. The wet/dry bag is just a tiny bit more of a hassle to wash because it is 2 layers and the inner PUL layer needs to be pulled out, whereas this one you can just push the whole thing inside out as you dump the diapers into the washing machine. This one dries so much faster than the wet/dry bag (which is not usually completely dry after hanging overnight), again, because of the 2 layers. It also seemed like the outside fabric of the wet/dry bag would absorb a little bit of the moisture and would be slightly damp (and smelling of pee), wheres the fabric on this liner does not get wet. And of course, it's also a little cheaper.I thought I would miss the handles of the wet/dry bag, but this one is long enough that I have plenty of fabric around the top to hold when taking it to the washing machine.
This pail liner is great. It's the perfect size for a few different hampers and cans I have used it for. It washes great and dry it on low along with my diapers. I have two and rotate them. Love the colors too. I would recommend this!
I bought one of these pail liners before my daughter was born in December, but after she was born quickly realized that we would need two pail liners (one to use while the other was in the wash.  We bought another Planet Wise pail liner because we loved the first one so much.There are several aspects of this pail liner that I found to be an advantage over others on the market.  First, the elastic opening allows for it to be easily put into any diaper pail (we just use a step trash can as a diaper pail and the pail liner works great in it.  Second, the opening is large enough that we can just throw the pail liner in the wash and the diapers will agitate out (we do this on occasion, although we do usually empty it out and then include the pail liner in the was, simply because it is too big to put in our top loader while full with diapers).  A few times, a diaper or wipe has been stuck in the pail liner for the entire wash, but enough water and soap was able to get in that they came out clean as well.  The pail is also the perfect size.  It holds two full days worth of dirty diapers and wipes.  Finally, the pail liners have held up really well.  After 5 months of cloth diapering with each pail liner going in the wash about twice a week, they don't show any wear and I anticipate getting many more years of use out of them, with this child and future children.I also have a Planet Wise wet bag that I'm very happy with.  Planet Wise's products seem to be high quality, a fair price, and designed with the cloth diapering parent and his/her needs in mind.  I definitely will be a loyal Planet Wise customer in the future.
This is the best pail liner! It's compact, easy to clean and fits in my Dekor diaper pail perfectly! I've had it for almost a year and it's definitely worth the money!
I have a large plastic garbage can with lid that I use to put my baby's dirty cloth diapers in. I was using a vinyl type of bag before and it would always seem wet. The inside of the can was always damp too. I switched to these bags and they work great! They are completely waterproof and I no longer deal with dampness on the inside of my garbage can. I also notice the smell is less strong (when I open the lid to put a new diaper in). These are a great product.
Keeps moisture in and smell out of the nursery. Great product for cloth diapering and fits great in the small trash can.
I use this in a trash can for my cloth diapers. I bought two and I alternate between them for washings. I just toss the whole thing in with the diapers and the liner and wash it all. Its holding up great so far and I would buy them same liner again if I needed another one.
love it! this product works well to hold a large amount of cloth diapers. i do not notice any stink and they have held up during washing and drying
the elastic around the top started to separate from the rest of it after a couple months. It wasn't as sturdy as i expected.
Works great, have been using the green one for about 4 months now, washing it every other day.  It's holding up great, I just toss it in the washer with the diapers and in the dryer with the liners.  I live in a cold climate otherwise I would line dry it (will do that this spring/summer).  I wanted to try it out before purchasing 2, I did purchase a blue one about 2 months ago.  You will definitely need 2 of these, 1 for the pail while the other is in the wash.  So far I have been impressed with my Planet Wise items, the wet bags are great too!
We have two of these that we interchange for our cloth diapers. We keep the in a Simple Human stainless steel trash can and just toss our dirty diapers in. To wash we just invert the whole bag into the washer and wash it all together then we hang dry. The softer side of the bag holds a lot of water, so be careful. They usually dry in under 24 hours under normal conditions. Works great, don't know what we'd do without them.
Works great for the diaper pail.  Keeps messes, smells, and spills inside, and cleans up super easy.  It does come out of the washer super wet and takes longer to dry than my other pail liners, but I'll trade that for super cute color and design offerings. The only thing I would suggest is possibly a drawstring on top rather than elastic.  The elastic holds it securely in the pail, but my other one has a drawstring which is nice for hauling them all to the laundry room with limited smell escaping.  Overall, I would recommend it though!
Got these for cloth diapering & they fit really well into the large Diaper Dekor container. Great color selection. Only problem is they take about 24 hrs to hang dry, but with 2 I can alternate & deal with that.
We use this reusable liner for our cloth diapers in the Dekor Plus diaper pail. Works great. Both washer and dryer safe. Keeps moisture in.
I appreciated the reviews written by others regarding this item and learned others used it in a 30 gallon trash can which kept me from buying an unnecessary diaper pail. These work great. I bought two and wash one with each load of cloth diapers.
We haven't had any issues with the planet wise diaper pail liners!  We have 4 now and they seem to be really good quality compared to others.  They don't leak and are quite sturdy!  Would recommend them.
Works perfectly with a basic tall white step can from Target. It's the perfect size for one load of diapers.
I have been very happy with this item, and the several other Planet Wise items.  We have 2 and use them to line a regular hamper for cloth diapers once they are dirtied.  They have worked great keeping moisture and smells in; and after and normal wash and line dry they are ready to go again.  I have been using them for 16 months and they get washed about twice a week.  The fold at the bottom of the bag is showing a little wear but other then that they are good as new and still performing as well.  -  Planet Wise has become my go-to for all similar products.
We are very satisfied with 
It does the job, but a drawstring on the elastic would have made it more versatile.  As is, you can't close it.  It also catches water in the washing machine, so that's kind of annoying.
This diaper pail liner is working perfectly in my Safety First diaper pail with my cloth diapers.  I wash it every time I wash diapers (about every 4 days) and then line dry it.  It's so cute and still in perfect condition.
I have had this in my son's diaper pail, a cheap plastic trash can with a flip lid for over a 1.5 years.
I bought the butter and black for out babies room. I put it on a slim step garbage can and it works great!! no slipage. washed great. as for pilling on the elastic or rolling yet not sure only washed it once so far. if it happens ill repost something. I really like planet wise. Also there were no leaks.
This wet bag is cute and functional. We use it over the door of our changing table. Just fold the elastic over the door and good to go! The owls are super cute and the bag is great! My only challenge with it is that it is so large that it takes on water from the washing machine and I have to dump out a bit of water each time since it doesn't leak water it obviously keeps it in a bit more than other fabrics. It doesn't hinder anything I just dump it and through it in the dryer and no problem.
This liner fit the Ubbi pail. Seems to be well made and helps reduce the smell in our nursery. Great liner, we bought an additional liner so we can immediately switch it out.
We use these in a standard size garbage can with a flip lid. After a couple days we pull out the bag and all the diapers and it all goes in the washer. Wet hang dry the bag and it had held up really well. I would suggest buying more than one.
This liner works perfectly for my cloth diaper inserts and cloth wipes that are wet and used. I usually let it fill up for about 3-5 days before doing laundry and it hasn't leaked or clung to the ammonia odors from the inserts. Its also a beautiful color!
I purchased these to use with the 30 liter Simple Human tall trashcan. They're a perfect pair. I definitely recommend purchasing 2, so that when you're laundering one, you have a free one to use in your diaper pail.
I bought this as a back-up to my fuzzibunz in and out bag and that is all I use it as. I don't like the fact that it only has one opening so when you wash the bag it collects water which I didn't realize the first time I washed it and so I dumped a good amount of water everywhere when I removed it after the cycle. It also can not be washed in hot water which means you can't wash it with your diapers, it needs to be washed separately. In all, it does what it is designed to do and I haven't had any issues with leaks, smell or construction but I do not use it as my main diaper bag.
Best pail liner, fits in my Ubbi and does a great job. Plus, it comes in a lot of adorable colors.
We love this diaper pail liner! It's really cute and does just what it is supposed to do. The only thing to keep in mind is that when you wash it, it is waterproof (as it is supposed to be!) so be careful when taking it out of the washer to put it into the dryer. I've made a big mess of the floor a couple times when the water gushes out.
I have had this pail liner for several weeks and have not yet felt like it needed a washing - it is not stinky after pouring our load of cloth diapers into the wash, but I do let it air out in the laundry room while the diapers are going through the cycle.  We use it with the Safety First Simple Step Diaper Pail and its not that great because the foot pedal mechanism on the can has to be jimmy-rigged with the liner, in order to work properly.  Overall the Liner is pretty big and would probably fit great into a 13-gallon trash can if you were looking for an easy diaper-duty solution.
I've been cloth diapering for over 2 years and was in need of an extra pail liner for our new baby. I was using Fuzzibunz pail liners and have had no problems with them but was feeling adventurous.This Planet Wise liner serves it's purpose and is sturdy and well made. (I have been using it for about 3 months now in my rotation, so at least 2 washes/week).However, I have 2 complaints:#1 the waterproof lining actually makes drying out take longer and tends to hold usually about 1/2 cup of water with each wash that ends up on the floor.#2 The Fuzzibunz bag also has a zipper at the bottom that makes it a bit easier to empty dirty diapers into the wash. I bet that would be the solution to the bag o water that is no the Planet Wise pail.
This liner is perfect for cloth diapering.  We use ours with the Dekor Plus Hands Free Diaper Pail and it works great!
This product is a life saver.  I just dump my diapers in the wash with it, (shaking it out as I empty) and don't have to touch a dirty diaper at all!
We bought these bags to hold our cloth diapers in a diaper pail. We ended up buying the Dekor diaper pail one based on feedback from another buyer. They work great together! The only reason I didn't give these bags 5 stars is because there is no way to tie/zip/etc the bag closed. This affects us because we have the diaper pail and this bag at our daycare facility. We then have to bring the bag home every day. The car ride is very short, but it would be nice if we could seal up the bag. They also don't cinch as tight as I had expected, but it doesn't affect how well the product works, so I don't mind that.Overall, I would recommend this product for cloth diapers and to be used with the Dekor diaper pail. I would not recommend this for a wet bag or to be used by itself since it does not close.
I'm very new to the cloth diapering system but a friend who is well schooled in cloth recommended this bag. I love it. It fits the flip top can I purchased and I've not had any odor. I don't want my diapers every day but love that I can just dump the bags contents into the wash followed by the bag. Very durable and really a must for cloth diapering (buy 2) one to wash and one for the pail.
Very durable & in use every other day.  Bought two of these and switch them on laundry days.  Has held up like NO OTHER even though it's had over 100 washes. Very cute pattern. Is quite big and should fit even up to 30 gal cans.  When I hang dipes on the line, I use this as the basket as it can hold a ton.
Same quality as the planet wise wet/dry bags! The Sea Spray color is not quite as bright or green as pictured. It is closer to a pastel than the bright color pictured.
I bought this diaper pail liner to go in mySafety 1st Easy Saver Diaper Pailand it's absolutely perfect. The pail and liner are practically made for one another!We've been using this liner for about three months now and it's holding up very well! It gets washed and dried on HOT every other day and it isn't fraying or peeling or breaking down in any way. I just bought a second Planet Wise Diaper Pail Liner so that I'd have one in the pail while the other is in the wash. Wish I'd bought two when my baby was new, but you live and learn, I guess!
Holds up in my washings every other day and fits in the 7 gallon odorless diaper pail (White Busch Systems Odorless Cloth Diaper Pail).
Use it for storing dirty diapers. I only wash when I get poop on it, and I wash diapers every other day. Not every time poop gets on it, so thats good. I don't want to wear it out. I use it in a 13 gal trash can.
We bought two of these to switch out every other day while I washed diapers.  They were wonderful at first, but after a year or so all the lining came out.  I still used them, but they didn't hold in the urine.  A bit pricey for something you might have to buy two or more of every year.
I purchased two of these 1.5 years ago (in Celery and Slate) and they have gotten a lot of use. I cycle between the two so one is always in service, and after all this time they're still going strong. I use a regular kitchen trash can with a step-pedal to lift the lid and these fit perfectly. The waterproofing is still holding up (some days you may get some condensation on the outside of the bag in a warm can so don't be confused by that) and the elastic still works fine. There's a bit of thread stating to unravel in the elastic but they stitched enough extra that it still works great. Due to the nature of these bags I don't expect them to hold up forever, but so far so good. I will definitely purchase more when these wear out.
I love my Planet Wise pail liners. They keep the pail clean and dry and are fit perfectly. They hold up great in the washer and love the ease of being able to throw my liner right in with my diapers to be washed. The liner's color is a bit more of a pastel shade rather than the bright aqua color in the pictures. However, when shopping online colors are often off from what you see in pictures, so I'm not disappointed. I highly recommend this brand!
fits our trash can perfectly and is easy to clean for those loads of dirty diapers and washcloths. No hassles!
We ordered two of these liners and I couldn't be happier!  They are cute and durable.  They have held up well to many washings, and I don't have to worry about the PUL fabric failing.  The elastic is still strong as well despite heavy loads of diapers in them constantly.  Also, we have a step lid trash can as our diaper pail, and I was worried about the part that forces the lid up causing a problem with the liner.  As far as I can tell, the liner is holding up very well to all the abuse we have given it.
It took forever to dry--over 24 hours in the dry Southwest.  It retains odors even after serious washing.  I just used a cheap diaper pail from Target, which I guess must be meant for disposables.  But I didn't use a liner, just threw the diapers in and after the diapers went into the wash, I sprayed out the inside with Windex Multi-Purpose Cleaner with Vinegar (it seems to neutralize ammonia) and wiped off with a paper towel.  I didn't really need the diaper pail liner after all.  It's expensive, unnecessary, and still smells faintly of pee and poopy diapers despite not having been used in months.  The plastic of the diaper pail itself never did seem to retain odors and is still fine after being used for 2 babies.
These are essential for cloth diapering.  They are perfect with the simple human trash can and you can toss these bags in the wash with the diapers and hang to dry.
These things are great!  We use a standard garbage pail with a lid and foot pedal for our cloth diapers, and these bags really DO hold in the smell and any liquid left over after rinsing the diapers.  The only time I smell dirty diapers is when I'm emptying the pail, but here's the best part:  the moment I twist the bag back up to take it to the laundry, the smell disappears.  It's not left behind on the pail; it's totally contained in the liner.  Then into the wash it goes with all the diapers, and comes out clean on the other side.  Worth the cost.  I have 2 so there's one in the pail and one in the laundry.  And the colors match my decor.  Highly recommend for anyone doing cloth diapers.
I've owned this liner for about a month.  It's held up great through washing on the sanitize setting (extra hot!) on my HE washer and being dried in the dryer.  It doesn't leak and contains the smell very well.  I'm very pleased with this product and am purchasing my second to use while this one is being washed.
Well its a diaper pail liner. We transitioned from the diaper big bags to this as the bags were &#34;just big enough&#34; but these are nice and big and bit more convenient. I'd get two for when you are washing one.
We bought a 13 gallon garbage can with a lip to use as our diaper pail and this fits perfectly! The elastic top clings to the inner rim so that it never falls in and the elastic isn't too bulky so the lid that has a clasp in the front stays closed. We bought another one with a drawstring that has a plastic end to close the bag but the lid of the garbage can never stays closed. Really, there is no need to have the bag close because we take the load from the pail and put it right into the washing machine.This has also been fully waterproof. No leaks for us. Also no residual smell at all and we have been using it for 6 weeks now. Would highly recommend it, especially for the price.
We use this in our diaper bin, so it has to contain the smell of all our cloth diapers until the next washing. It does a great job. We just toss it in the wash with the diapers, and it's ready to be used again. I love this so much better than contributing more plastic bags to the trash heap. We've used it for several months now and his had held up wash after wash.
I purchased these diaper pail liners to replace ones I had purchased that leaked.  I relied on the reviews and also purchased this one because it was one of the few that said that you could dry it along with the diapers.  And sure enough, these are great.  I've washed our new liner at least 20 times and dried it in the drier and it remains waterproof and leakproof.  Based on my experience so far, I'd definitely recommend this.  I wish I had gotten these the first time around!
I love this thing because the bag is just so cute, it's fun to have a little pattern where you may not expect it (the bin for my cloth diapers)These are easy to clean. I have 2 of them so one can be in the wash while the other is in the bin. I don't dry them in the dryer, I just hang them on the rack and they dry easily and within the same time frame as my diapers.
Perfect size, cute print, easily washed and dried. Not a single bad thing to say about it. Does a fantastic job of holding in the smell and keeping the pail itself from getting musty. Very pleased.
This has lasted us for months and months now, with regular washing with the diapers. I love it. I really should get another one for when this one is in the wash!
I think these bags are great, we never have had stink issues for our cloth diapers, and it washes up easily with our cloth diaper loads.  I just hang it to dry.  The only thing I wish it had is a string handle or a draw string for ease of hanging.
I have had this bag for a month now and it is great! I use it in a normal kitchen trash can with a lid. It fits better than a regular trash bag! I wash it with my diapers and dry it on low heat. No problems. I'm a very happy customer!
This is a fantastic product.  It does just what it says.  In 10 months it hasn't started leaking.  One thing I might want, however, is a drawstring.  We use it in a garbage can and put the lid over it to use for a diaper pail.  We haven't dried it in the dryer, just hang dry.  The seams are really well done: the plastic parts are together and serged from the outside, meaning better sealing, in my opinion.  We also have another brand (bought a loooong time ago) that the seams leaked a bit.  Not enough to make us not use it, but we don't have the same problem with this brand.  And I love the fabric pattern and elastic top!
Keeps the wetness in and traps bad odors, the print is really cute and it washes well. Still looks like new 4 months on.
I got this diaper pail liner and the Kissas - I think they are very, very similar and I'm happy with both. This Planet Wise color is particularly cute though !
If you are cloth diapering, these make it so easy to launder!Do yourself a favor and get two. Or three.
I got this last week and so far, so good.  I really have no complaints.  I love the color and it doesn't leak.  I've washed and dried it with my cloth diapers and it came out fine.  I would definitely agree with other reviewers that this is a very well made, high quality wet bag.
I haven't tried any other brand of pail liner but I don't think I ever will because I've had zero problems with Planet Wise products. I've been cloth diapering for over a year. It's the perfect size. I've switched different trashcans and this liner always fits. It doesn't old odor, and washes well with my cloth diapers. I don't baby this thing in the dryer either. I've never had a leak at the bottom or the seams. This really is a quality liner and I really trust their products.
This wet bag is perfect size for almost a tall kitchen garbage can. I have yet to be able to fill it all the way up before needing to wash the diapers. Works great, washes easily
This pail liner is really cute and keeps the pail clean - we have 2 so when we wash the bag goes in too.
I purchased this diaper pail liner along with a Kissa pail liner. Both seem to work the same and have held up well. I wash the liner right in with my diapers and use it with the Safety 1st Easy Saver Diaper Pail.
We love our hedgehog liner....washes well, doesn't leak, looks cute and i need another one for when my other one is n the wash. I recommend getting 2 for this reason
I got this as a second wet bag for when my other was in the wash. The other one I got was the kissa's antibacterial pail liner because I wanted to save money. I also decided to only purchase one just in case I didn't like it. I'm glad I did because the kissa's is already having problems but I will save that for the Kissa's review. The Planet Wise bag is far superior and definitely worth the extra money. The material is nice and it cleans easily. The elastic around the top is stretchy and not too difficult to put around a pail. Plus, it's really cute. I am planning to buy another one soon to replace the kissa's liner.
The only bad thing I can think of about this product is that water gets trapped in it when I wash it so I have to pull it out last to prevent water from getting on everything.
I have 2 of these and have been using them for a year now. They are still waterproof and look like new. Highly recommend!
I use this pail liner with my safety 1st diaper pail and it fits great. I also appreciate that the odor stays contained to the bag and the diaper pail. I do diaper laundry every other day, but even with diapers sitting around the stink does not go farther than the pail. I had to switch to disposables to deal with a diaper issue my son was having and the stink of those diapers was terrible. It really made me appreciate the quality of this product. Also, the avocado color is a fun, bright green color that adds a little pop of color to the room!
I got two of these to use for our cloth diapered baby: One for the wash, while the other is lining the pail. I got a cheap lidded trash can from a department store as our pail and this fits in it perfectly.  This doesn't have a drawstring top, it's an elastic top (kind of like underwear elastic). Holds the day's worth of diapers and it's waterproof.  Color selection is good, too (we got the orange, it's very bright).My only reason for not giving it 5 stars is how sopping wet it gets in the washer.  I line dry this, and it *does* dry overnight in our NorthEast climate... but while taking it out of the washer, it's a wet mess and you have to ENSURE you dry it with the 'fabric' side out, else it'll just hold the water (proof that it's truly waterproof).  However, I would purchase again, no question.
This is a great diaper bag. I wouldn't say it's odor control, but it can holds around 10 prefolds and 5-6 fitteds.We have 2. So far so good!
Holds wet/dirty diapers until laundry-day. Does get a bit damp if the diapers are wet from toilet-rinsing but I've got no complaints. I wash it with the diapers and dry it in the dryer (not sure if that's recommended).
Does exactly what it's supposed to do. No problems with leaks or even smell.  We use it in a kitchen trash can with a lid.
Keeps moisture and odors from my cloth diapers to a minimum.  Cool colors and good quality.  Slightly moist thru other side when time to wash, that's after sitting up to 5 days.
I bought these to line my cloth diaper pail.  I don't always cloth diaper though...now I am using disposibles so I use these to line our son's dirty clothes hamper as well because you never know what will end up on a 3 month olds clothing!!!  And I don't want a poo-ey hamper!I also take them with us when we travel...they are great to throw dirty clothes in to keep seperate from clean clothes.
We have had this little liner for three months and it works great so far. We use it for cloth diapers and we haven't had any leaks from it. We wash it on a weekly basis and toss it in with our cloth diapers and wash with cloth diaper safe powdered soap. We also toss it in the dryer with the cloth diapers. It's a great little liner , holds up great and I love that it comes in tons of colors.
This works great as a diaper pail liner for our cloth diapers. We use a large trash can with a lid for our diaper pail and this liner fits very well around the wide mouth of the can but would probably fit a wider or narrower trashcan as well. I have thrown it in the washer and dryer countless times and it still works like new. The fabric doesn't hold on to smells and is completely waterproof which is really nice considering what goes in there. I would recommend this product to anyone using cloth diapers.
I got this for our new baby, my son has one for his diaper and it has worked great for over 2 years. We love the color and it fits in regular trash cans and works great for trips too.
Was hoping to use this as diaper pail liner at daycare to bring dirties home daily.  But it was larger than I expected and did not have a way to close or tie off for the trip home.  Sadly its going back.  I could see it working great for a large diaper pail at home where you didn't need to seal off. We returned it.
It's well made and the elastic on the top edge helps it stay in place very well with no fuss. Waterproof and washes well in the same load as the diapers (cotton prefolds). I have two and wash the dirty one every time I do a load of diapers. My only criticism, and I'm not sure if there is a way around this, is that it retains a lot of water after the rinse cycle and I have to do a lot of dumping and shaking out of water before hanging it to dry.
We have two of these liners that we switch out each time we do laundry.  We can fit a day and a half worth of diapers in this liner without any issues, we can even stretch it to 2 days if needed. 15 to 18 diapers.Easy to carry from the nursery to the laundry room and empty into the washer.
This Liner has been perfect for our cloth diapering.  It has yet to tear, rip or fade.  Gets washed about 3 times per a week, and is still in perfect condition.  Good Purchase for a liner!
This is a good quality item for not too much money.  It has a thick protective lining and it's as good as any on the market that I have seen.
This Diaper Pail worked really well for us for a while but they started to leak. Other than that they have been great for home and travel. I would recommend them just be careful to watch for leaking.
This item is going to be put to use very soon. Our daughter is only 5 days old and we're starting with cloth diapers and then transitioning to cloth diapers as soon as possible (once we're settled and have BFing down). The green color goes with our daughters nursery style / bedding set --&#62; I'd love to also purchase the pink color.
I bought two of these bags (one to use and one to wash simultaneously) and after about 4 months or so, one does not hold water anymore. There is barely any water inside the bag which makes soaking the diapers nearly impossible.  The bag that is working is still holding 90% of the water inside the bag. It doesn't seem that this much water could be caused by condensation... I now need another pail liner but I don't want to spend a lot for something that won't last long. I imagine I will still be cloth diapering in a year or so, so this is frustrating.  I hope to find another brand that works as well for a longer period of time as these did when I first purchased them.
I use these to line the trash can we use for recycleables.  I empty it into a larger bin outdoors a couple times a week and didn't want to be using trash bags (waste!) and didn't want to have to wash out the pail after every empty (our recycler doesn't require we rinse cans, etc so we don't and consequently the pail will become icky quickly).  This was the perfect compromise, I change it weekly and they wash up beautifully.  I throw them in with my towels cycle, always on high heat wash and high heat dry cycle.  I've had zero issues in the 3 years I've been using them!  I don't have a single bad thing to say.
We have two of these diaper pail liners to rotate as we wash our cloth diapers.  I put then in a flip lid trashcan with a box of baking soda in the bottom and I have never had any smell or leak issues.  The colors are so cute too (we have Avacado and Sea Spray) but you honestly don't see the color from the outside.  It's more for you to look at as you throw in the diaper.  One note to make, this says to wash in cold water.  However, the point is to wash this with your diapers which most always includes a hot wash.  My wash routine includes a warm wash and after three weeks I have had no issues washing this way.
I ordered a second pail liner because I love the one I already have so much. I am using a Better Homes and Gardens round 30 liter step trash can as a diaper pail, and this liner fits great. There is room to spare to fit a larger pail as well. I have had no issues with leaks or odors, and it washes and dries easily. Definitely recommend this pail liner!
We purchased this pail liner for cloth diapers in the bathroom. I didn't want a stinky bathroom and the lid on the trash can we purchased (basic $10 step-pedal trash can from Wal-Mart) seems to work fine at helping this bag contain any smells. It's very waterproof. We have never had a single problem with leaks. We've had this bag for two years and just purchased another for another bathroom. It has held up very well after washing. We toss the bag and everything in it in the washer (empty it out into the washer just to be sure everything gets washed, then drop the bag in after) and hang it to dry. I don't recommend putting it in the dryer.
High quality and excellent performance! We were late to the game with cloth diapering, but this liner has made it much easier than I expected. It holds up well, is stain and odor resistant, and has been through dozens of washes without any sign of wear.
Recommended to me by a friend, since she was also using this kind.  Been using it for approximately 8 months and so far, so good!  No leaks, and holds up when I carry my heavy loads of dirty cloth diapers to the washer.  Dries relatively quickly after washing.  No draw string to cinch close, but that doesn't matter much to me, as these go straight to the wash after taking out of my diaper pail.  The hedgehog pattern is very cute!  Compared to another brand of pail liner I purchased, this one is better and I would choose it over the other if I had to purchase again.
This bag is great. It's strong, durable, and washes well. Make sure you turn it inside out to wash it, otherwise gross stuff will stay on the liner. i suggest getting 2 so you can wash one while you use the other.
These work great. Like some of the other reviewers, I bought a regular 30 liter lidded trash can (the kind with the foot lever works best) and just pop in these liners. I chose to invest in a nice can I will want to use in the future versus another plastic diaper pail that will just go in the landfill in a couple years. The only issue is that sometimes the thickness of this liner folded over at the top can sometimes hinder the can's ability to close fully. But I don't know how another liner could resolve that issue. This one washes well, doesn't leak, and it keeps in the funk; I'm happy. In four months of daily use I have never had to wash out my can, that's saying something. It makes cloth diapering super easy, you just dump it in the wash with the rest of the diapers. You can even do this without getting poop on you (yay!). I wouldn't put it in the dryer, so get two for the times when one is drying on the line.
Seems to hold onto dirty washer water. Never leaked though. I started using biodegradable trash bags that I then use for the house
This liner does exactly what it's supposed to do. It fits perfectly in the rather large garbage can that we use for our son's dirty cloth diapers (it's a Simple Human 40 liter semi round). We bought 2 liners, as suggested by another reviewer so when one is in the wash, we can put the other in. No problems so far, and very easy to pull out when it's time to wash.
We have 2 of these (one in yellow, the other in avocado), so that we don't have to worry about what we're going to do with diapers while we're washing.Our diaper set up: 8 gallon trash can with the foot thing that you can step on to open it, lined with one of these liners, insert diapers.  Every other day the diapers (and liner) go into the washing machine and wash then dry (either outside or in the dryer) and the new liner is inserted.  Repeat!  The size is great for the trash can and we/I don't have to touch the diapers as they go into the wash.  Just turn the bag upside down and let the diapers fall into the washer.  Drop the liner in on top and viola!  Done!
It has begun delaminating after almost a year but I can repair it. So far no leaking around the delamination. It grips well around the trash can. Would buy it again.
Cute print (not really necessary) and fits a kitchen sized garbage can wonderfully.We bought 2 so we can alternate on diaper laundry days. The bag is dumped right into the washer and the bag has been going right in. We have been using these for about 3 months now and the lining has held up well in the wash and even in the dryer.Daddy has a much easier time dealing with cleaning the dirties thanks to these bags.I noticed that sometimes water will still be in the bag from the wash cycle when putting this into the dryer! Folds up flat too (Will be helpful even as kidlet grows for trips to the pool or camp)I would recommend these to any cloth diapering mamas and papas.
I bought 2 to switch out for cloth diapering and bought a stainless steel garbage can with foot pedal at target. They work great together.
It's the perfect size for our diaper pail (13 gallon), the elastic around the rim is easy to stretch around the pail top but strong enough to hold it securely open. It's very well made and the print is adorable.
Very cute design for a wet bag and its large enough to fit our pail without having too much extra. Works great!
Washes up nicely. Also holds up to dryer heat well. (Not all PUL or TPU does.) Doesn't hold on to stinky diaper pail odors.  I've already purchased a second one of these and plan to get a couple more to replace another brand that is falling apart. Great buy!
Really love this pattern, works very well in my CD pail. Does not hold odor and washes easily. Has held up well. Owned used for 10months now.
I love this washable liner- we just use a regular trash can in our baby's room and replace the trash can liners weekly. This is washable and makes me feel a little bit better about using disposable diapers!
I have 2 of these liners (avocado & yellow), and have been using them for about a year now. They are wonderful- I've had no issues when them whatsoever. They look practically new- no staining, no signs of wear, and the elastic is just as it was when I bought them. Our diaper pail has a lid that fits snuggly over these liners, and there's not even signs of wear where the lid would rub. I have occassionally dryed them on low in our dryer, but most of the time I line dry- which might be the secret to their durability. Planet Wise does say you can dry them on low- but I never dry my diapers in the machine (which are made out of PUL, too) so I figured that I'd be safe and just dry it with the diapers. This is a great quality item- I would recommend them to anyone, even at the price I would still buy Planet Wise if I needed another for some reason.
Purchased two of these bags right before my daughter was born. Both have held up very well, no issues 9 months of continual use later. We fill one and throw it and the dirty cloth diapers into the washing machine (which is why I recommend buying 2 because you're little one isn't going to wait for the laundry to dry before going to the bathroom). Make sure to wash them on cold or warm and low heat to dry and they will last a while. Very pleased.
No problems with smell or leaking. Easy to wash and dries really fast. It fits perfectly on my short pail.
I like this because you can throw it in the wash.I dislike this because it forever smells like pee/poop. I had to air it out for quite some time after washing. Poop hasn't even got in there uncontained, it's all been washed off with a diaper sprayer before tossing it in.Currently I'm using it for a beach bag to throw in wet towels in the car. (It's been aired out of course ;) )
JUST TOOK IT OUT THE DRYER!!!PERFECT WITH THE SIMPLE HUMAN TRASH CAN.I USE IT EVERYDAY AND WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND!
I bought two of these to hold cloth diapers for one baby. I think you need two so that you can put a new one in your pail when you start a load of diaper laundry because it will be a while before that one is dry. I use it in a simplehuman 40-Liter Plastic Rectangle Step Trash Can. It does not look as if it would fit into any of the diapers pails I saw at the baby store. I can fit about 18 BumGenius 4.0 cloth diapers in there and then it is pretty full. It is great that you can just throw it in with the diapers to wash. I would recommend these to a friend. I did not give it 5 stars because I found that I have moisture accumulate at the bottom of my pail after 2 days. I do not think this moisture is from leaking, but is from the humidity in the diapers and somehow this gets through the liner. I did not notice this the first few months I was using it but suddenly realized my pail was really stinky. I cleaned the pail and since then have made a point of airing out the pail before I put the next liner in.
This is a durable pail liner that washes well and dries overnight, which makes it the perfect pail liner for my cloth diapering experience!  I have two of them (slate grey and the sea spray) and I'd recommend them to anyone!
I love this. There is nothing bad to say at all. The print is adorable. The material is nice and it's very well made.
At first I loved it. It was a nice color, and a good size. I washed it per the instructions and always hung it to dry. I noticed the past couple of times that the bag seemed wet outside when I went to put my diapers into the washer. After I hung it to dry this time, I realized why. The laminate is cracked and peeling in several spots and it's delaminated  in several other spots. My daughter is 6 months old, and I have 2 liners, and wash every 3 days. This adds up to it being washes maybe 30 times. I'm pretty disappointed. I was told that planet wise was the best brand of liners, but my cheaper brand liner is holding up just fine and gets just as much use. I guess it was okay for the first few months, but I cloth diaper to save money, and it would have been just as cheap to use trash bags.
This has been washed and dried so many times and still is superb quality! I have had 0 issues with it and love the Fox design! Great purchase!
I really like Planet Wise products, I use their wet/dry bags for my cloth diapers, but this diaper pail liner is just so big! I didn't realize it when I purchased it. It is literally twice the size as my Bambino Mio diaper pail so I can't use it. I kept it anyways... I figured between spit up and leaking diapers, I could just use it for her clothes.
The washing instructions on this say wash in cold water.  But the dirty diapers have to be washed in hot water.  The initial cold rinse for the diapers doesn't use soap, so in order to follow the instructions, you either have to wash this separately (icky for handling), use soap in the rinse cycle (a waste), or hope for the best and wash in hot water with the diapers anyway.  I chose the last option.  I have one of these bags, and one of another kind, and have been using them both constantly for more than four months (so each one gets washed 2-3 times a week).  The waterproof lining on this bag is now starting to break down in multiple spots, and in one place there is now a hole (very small, but still).  If I'd written this review a month ago, I would have given the bag 4 or 5 stars -- it's big, has solid construction, and contains the smell of dirty diapers even when using it without a diaper pail.  But this is too expensive a bag for the short amount of time it lasted, and if I'd followed the instructions it would have been a pain in the rear every time I used it for two years.
I love these pail liners! My 3 year old was cloth diapered and we owned 2 of these bags for him. They lasted around 3 years being washed on hot with diapers every 4 days or so. We always hung to dry. After those 3 years the laminate started to bubble and the fabric started to get moist. The elastic also started to come apart and was loose. I was ok with that because I had a new daughter and wanted an excuse to buy PINK! I expect these bags to last just as long.I use them in a traditional trash can with a step opening. The elastic holds the bags in really well and we have never had problems with the bags falling in.When I am ready to wash diapers I just dump them in the wash and toss the bag in with them. SUPER EASY!
I bought one of these and one of the pail liners made by Wahmies. I use both, but prefer the one by Wahmies because it has a small cloth tab on the inside where you can put a couple drops of essential oils to help cover any icky scent that might escape. This one has no such feature.It took me a while to figure this out, but one important note for use is that the Planet Wise bags are used with the shiny side touching the diapers and the Wahmies bags are used with the non-shiny/cloth side touching the diapers - the two manufacturers have different instructions. This means that the shiny less attractive side tucks over the edge of the diaper pail with a Planet Wise bag - while the prettier cloth side tucks over the edge with the Wahmies bag.This pail liner (just like the other one) dries quickly. I usually hang it to dry in my laundry room and it is fully dry within a couple hours - even though I live in a rainy and cool area of the country.It's a good bag - but I do prefer the Wahmies brand.
These liners are just perfect! they are thick and great quality. HIGHLY recommend. and actually anything from this brand. If you're new to cloth diapering I recommend buying two liners one for the dirty diapers and one to go in the wash with the dirty diapers haha. Planet Wise is awesome and these liners are legit!!
I like the color options of this brand.... it is a bit pricey but has withstood mulitple washings and is still going strong. It tends to hold ammonia odor and has to be washed several times before you get rid of the odor.
Love this- no complaints so far.  We have had it for several months now and besides some yellowing of the plastic-y side of the material, it completely serves the intended function.
Love love this Pail liner! The color is true, very pretty & the PUL is high quality! It is very large also
I have been using two of these bags since my daughter was born Jan 2011. We did not follow the instructions and we washed it hot with the cloth diapers, which is probably why it fell apart within a year. That is our fault. However, having a diaper pail liner that cannot be washed hot is not for those who wish to use cloth diapers. It is a chore enough to wash the diapers - but who wants to do an extra cycle just for the bag? I don't want to wash the bag with her clothes on delicate, the whole point is to keep the really dirty stuff separate for maximum protection. This is the reason I never read the instructions to wash it cold, I didn't imagine that a bag aimed at cloth diapers would have that restriction. Five stars if you use it for regular diapers or wash you diapers cold - otherwise avoid.
I love these liners.  They fit the bin we use for our diapers perfectly (simplehuman 40-liter slim step-can http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004L9L3KW/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_14).  We bought two so that we can wash and dry the liner every time we do diapers.  There are a ton of design options to fit practically any theme and they are all really adorable.
Easy to clean, just throw in the wash with your diapers or diaper covers.  I have two. They've been working hard for 5+ months now and still look and feel brand new.  GREAT color choices too.
I would highly recommend this bag to any cloth diapering mommas out there.  It's a great color, large size, stain resistant, and doesn't leak!  What more could you want in a diaper pail liner?
Cute design (hoot), easy to clean, perfect size for my baby laundry. I use it with &#34;Rubbermaid 4D06 Configurations 23-Inch Foldable Laundry Hamper&#34; and it fits perfectly.I use it both for clothes and cloth diapers. I just toss it in the laundry machine together with the clothes, then just hang to dry - it drys in few hours.
This is a nice pail liner, but I have had issues with leakage in my diaper pail before. Most of the time it works, but I wouldn't say that it is waterproof. You can put damp items in, but not really wet items that have been.. say.. dunked in the toilet. Colors are very vivid and it washes and dries in the machine well, 
I have been using two Planet Wise pail liners for 3 years.  I wash my diapers at least every two days, which means that each pail liner has been washed about 300 times.  They both still look great.I wash my diapers and pail liners in hot water, and then machine dry them on medium or high heat.The Planet Wise wet bags are great, too.  I haven't had any problems with any of their products.
I bought this pail liner because I have a Planet Wise wet bag that I absolutely love.  The elastic around the top is nice and stretchy and makes the bag way easier to turn inside out with diapers in it than the other bag I have (I don't know what brand it is because it was second hand.)  I know the tag says to wash on cold, but I wash it in hot water with my diapers and have had zero issues with delaminating or any other problems.  It's not practical to wash with cold water, so I don't.  I do air dry it every time.  It dries very very fast.  I would say it takes about an hour to dry the inside, then I turn it inside out for another hour, and it's ready to go.  I would definitely recommend this product.
I have two of these and use them all the time.  I use them with my Diaper Dekor diaper pail and they fit great.  I just throw one in the wash with the diapers and put the other in the pail.  While they are water proof, I have found that you need to make sure diapers are wrung out well after rinsing before putting them in the bad.  If not, the bag can seep through because there is so much water in it.  But once I figured that out, I have not had a leak since!  I love that I don't have to throw away bags all the time.  A great find!
Doesn't seem to hold a smell, washes well, dries quickly when washed and hung up inside out... what more could I ask for, really? My husband and I are quite content.
This was my first purchase and I loved it so much for my reusable diapers that I ordered a second for when one is int he wash. I use it in a medium sized trash can. Easy wash and no stains and so much better then wasting trash bags like I was previously doing before buying this product!
Using it in a kitchen trash can with a closeable lid. The smell is contained really well. It holds enough diapers (prefolds and covers) to last almost 2 full days. I just dump it inside out in the wash with the diapers, and put it through the clothes dryer with them also. So far the liner is holding up perfectly (4 months into using it). Got a second one to switch back and forth so we always have a liner ready.
These liners are amazing.  The quality is much higher than the Kissa liners that are also available on Amazon.  (I had 4 Kissa liners over the years and they all deteriorated.)  These hold up very, very well.  They are slightly more expensive than the Kissas, but totally worth the cost difference.
I had heard this works best with the Ubbi diaper pail and they are right. Hate the pattern but it was cheapest and wouldn't be seen anyway. (Literally HATE the pattern.)
I bought this pail liner along with the Kissaluvs liner.What I like:-elastic band allows for snug fit over my 13 gallon trash can-I've put in around 18 diapers-sturdierWhy I like the Planet Wise Diaper liner better:-it's just sturdier. I noticed that Kissaluvs liner inner stitching has started to loosen up already! Kissaluvs is slightly more affordable than the PW liner, and I don't regret buying it. If you want to choose between the two though, I'd go for the PW liner.I will note that the Kissaluvs liner does have a fabric tab on the inside lining that can be used for deodorizing (a few drops of essential oils). PW liner does not have this, but I rarely use the fabric tab anyway.
we use this as our main wet bag. so far it's lasted almost a year. we noticed at the top we are starting to get small holes. could have been because we need run our clothe diapers through the dryer 2x on medium to get them mostly dry. i started to take the wet bag and diaper covers out of the dryer after the 1st run this may solve that problem. otherwise it is holding up really well.
Excellent wet bag. We use it as a pail liner. It holds up pretty well over several days, no stink gets out. It keeps the bottom if the pail dry as well. It's big enough to hold over a week's worth so it actually never gets too full in between washes for us (every 4-5days).  Would definitely recommend it.
I wouldn't go with any other maker for a wet bag! Planet Wise does a great job with keeping the bag dry and smell contained!
This pail liner is a nice, seems to be heavier than some, PUL as are all of my other Planetwise liners. Love them for their larger size. I use it a 13 gallon standard trash can. It's so nice that the elastic liner can fit any shape can, not like some narrower sewn reusable liners.
I ordered 2 of these - one to use in the diaper pail while the other is in the wash.  It fits the trash can I bought to use as a diaper pail perfectly and washes easily along with my diapers.  I usually wash every other day, which amounts to around 10 diapers.  However, it would probably hold 15 or so.  Great purchase!
\"Great pail liner\". Great size, doesn't leak at all(my Thirsties pail liner did)! Love it!!! Fits our pail great, elastic keeps it nice and tight against the lip of can without needing to adjust anything. And oh so cute! Thanks for making product in the USA!
I love the variety of cute prints.  It fits great on my diaper pail. I just wish it had a draw string & it would be perfect.  So far, functions great!
It's hard to wrap this around a container.  The opening at the top is way to small. A drawstring would be really helpful so it could be used on different size containers.  Or a strap to hang it on a hook or doorknob.
This fit perfectly in our large rectangular diaper bin. (We got from a Diaper Service company at first). This reusable bag works great. Material is strong and odor has not been an issue. It does require to be pulled sometimes to be cleaned and washed, especially if you're not washing diapers frequently. I hand washed it. This has been much better than using flimsy trash bags.  I've had no issues with ripped seams or holes in the fabric. Very satisfied with this Diaper Pail Liner.
Only issue is that it doesn't quite work with my diaper pail because of the large opening of the bag.
I use this in a standard size 15gal trash can. It holds any moisture put in it, and washes clean every time! I just throw it in with my cloth diapers, couldn't be easier! I would purchase two so there is always a liner in the trash can. So happy I found this product! and it's super cute too.
Awesome pail liners! I love the print! I have 2 that I switch back and forth between. I throw the whole thing inside out in the wash with all of my diapers and it comes clean every time! They also hold in all of the liquid and stink which I love! I use a laundry hamper and this liner, I do not use a cover over it and never have a problem with smell in our house! I think the circulation of air helps with that.
These bags work perfectly for lining our garbage pail that we use for our cloth diapers. I just turn them inside out as I throw the diapers in the washing machine and they dry in the dryer.  We have several different colors and have been so pleased with this product.  I'd recommend having at least 2 bags when using cloth diapers.
Before our daughter was born, we bought one of these. It's great -- goes in the wash with the diaper laundry, comes out smelling nice and fresh, and keeps the diaper pail from smelling too badly. However, we found one key flaw: you can't add dirty diapers to it while it's going through the washer. And babies, well, they pee a lot in the beginning.After we'd gone through a few weeks (I can't honestly tell you how long it took us to come to our senses, what with the Newborn Time Distortion Effect) with only one, praying the dryer would finish before her next diaper change while stuffing dirty diapers into a plastic baggie on the floor (thus defeating the purpose of a REUSABLE liner), we finally ordered a second diaper pail liner, and haven't looked back. 6 months in, they still both look as shiny new as when we got them and still smell nice and fresh (which is to say, no odor at all).Learn from my mistake and buy two now. When you change a diaper while the first liner is in the wash, I hope you think, &#34;Hey, random lady reviewing things on Amazon, thanks.&#34; And then go lie down and take a nap. You deserve it.
This was something I hadn't originally thought to get when I decided to do cloth diapers. It has been indispensable. It fits perfectly in my 30 liter trash can. I got a silver one with a lid to trap the odor, and this thing never, ever smells. I mean ever. And I wash the diapers every 3-4 days, and it never smells.
This liner does the job well and fits nicely in our trashcan. The baby blue color is a very nice shade, too.
I have two of these that I rotate through and wash with my diapers. I've been using them for about a year now and they are still in fantastic shape. I wash them in hot water and hang dry with my BGs
I love this pail liner. I just put it inside of a plastic trash can with a lid and I haven't had any smell problems. They pattern on it is so cute and after many washings, it hasn't faded at all! I just wash it with my cloth diapers and then let it air dry after. I haven't had them leak at all and that's saying something since I am currently cloth diapering two children! Great product!
This pail liner works wonders.  It doesn't let the smells out and the liner itself is very heavy duty.  We love that it comes in such cute patterns!  When we needed another pail liner so that we don't have to do laundry as frequently we ordered another Planet Wise.  This time in a different cute pattern!
This Diaper Pail Liner is great. It's really big and fit perfectly our 13 gallons pail.We put it with our cloth diapers in the laundry machine and it's well washed every time. Don't pur it in your dryer!We bought two of them so we can switch when we are doing laundry.
I am so far liking this liner. No problem as of yet. I hand wash and hang dry it whenever I wash my diapers. Not sure of machine washing it and  putting it in the dryer. Some customers had issues; e.g. elastic edge getting unraveled, etc. I do however have a little comment but not too big of an issue. It does not dry right away (hung dry) when I wash it. It took about a day and a half to air dry. Another thing though, I noticed it does still have a hint of smell. I did washed it with regular laundry detergent. Next time I will wash it with baking soda for my last rinse. Good bag.
Happy to have this liner. We have two and rotate them in the wash. Stays on the can nicely and cleans well. Only beef is that it fills up with water in the washing machine and then you have to find somewhere to spill it out. Small issue that is not REALLY the bag's problem! =)
Pail liner holds in moisture and works well for most sized diaper pails. The elastic around the top edge is not perfect and I'm concerned it will fray after a few more washes, but so far it's holding up after one month of washing every couple of days. I have 2 of these pail liners and one is always in use.  I wash this liner along with my cloth diapers in hot, warm and cold water and it's fine.
Love this, it's easy to put on my diaper pail. Perfect fit always. It's also good quality, I only have 2 large wet bag, and wash my cdwith the wet bag every other day, and bag still looks new.
I love Planet Wise products.  They are well made and pretty to look at...even if they are in your diaper pail.  I also use a spare one of these to store my family's dirty clothes when we are on vacation.
I have  been cloth diapering since my son was born in Nov. 2012. I use to use a small laundry hamper to put the diapers and cloth wipes in since I try to use what I have on hand before buying an additional product. When our daughter was born in February, 2014 I needed to get something larger to put all of the diapers and wipes in so we got a Sterilite 44 quart/11 gallon trash can with a footpedal to open the lid. This has worked perfectly with this size liner. I have not had any problems with smell, leakage or anything else and I like having a liner that fits the trash can. I would recommend this product to anyone.
No complaints from this consumer! I'm sure at some point it will need to be replaced, but I have nothing negative to say yet!
We own 2 of these bags and I would highly recommend purchasing 2 as we're able to throw the bag in with the diapers during a load and put our second bag in our diaper bin (Diaper Dekor - love it!). This allows us to wash and keep diapering at the same time. It fits very well in our Diaper Dekor and we've had no issue with leaks.  The main reason for not giving this 5 stars is after 5 months of washing every other day (so each bag is getting washed every 4 days), the elastic is starting to fray on the edges. There's no issue with the function of the elastic, but I'm not sure if this fraying will get worse and need to be replaced or not.  If so, I'll update this review accordingly.  Until then, I'd definitely purchase these bags again if/when needed.  We own Slate and Black - both of which are accurately shown online.
I originally purchased 2 of these for use in our diaper pails. They fit the pail wonderful and are cute (i have a second that has giraffes on it), but we've only had them 5 months and the elastic is already fraying and coming apart. The PUL itself seems fine, but  i'm not sure what good that will do when it won't stay in the pail because the elastic gives out. I really wish they would enclose the elastic so it was more protected in the wash and maybe it would hold up better.
Planet Wise makes the best wet bags, in my opinion. This is great as a diaper pail liner, and we also use these to line a pail in our kitchen for our reusable linens, like napkins, towels, etc, that are often damp.
I LOVE this wetbag!  I stretch it half way across my hamper and secure it with some clips.  The elastic top is so much better than a drawstring for our purposes.  We have a drawstring wetbag and the string is always getting wrapped around something in the wash!  We've used this hedgehog bag nearly every day for two months now, and it's still looks brand new.  I'd recommend it highly!
This pail liner drive me nuts. It takes forever to dry and is a soggy mess out of the wash. It hasn't leaked, and it you put your nappies in the dryer, the soggy mess might not bother you. I much prefer the fuzibuns pail liner.
I love my Diaper Pail Liner... it is so easy to just dump the whole container (including the liner) into the wash.  It comes in really great colors (love the sea spray).
My daughter registered for this diaper pail liner and it looks good and sturdy.  I'm sure she will find it very convenient to use.
It's a wet bag. It lines a trash can fine and holds a couple days worth of dirty diapers.  I have 2 so when one is in the wash the other is in use.  That's the perfect number. I wouldn't use this for travel since it doesn't close.  I have to walk a little ways to washer so it'd be nice to get one that does close but whatever, no big deal.  For the first 2 years I've been happy with it. Should it last longer?It lost one star because the elastic seems to be loose now after 2 years of use.  I literally throw it in with the dirty dipes and hang dry so it's not babied but abused.  I guess it's not suppose to be washed on hot so that may be why.  it still holds up as a diaper liner fine (I use a simplehuman locking slim can).  I'm not going to buy any more but if I could do it again I'd get one that will hold up...like a draw string one? Who knows but that's my experience of using this after 2 years.
I love that I can just throw this in with my diapers in the wash, but it takes FOREVER to dry on the rack. Seriously, if you get this you must throw it in with a couple towels in the dryer on low heat. This will make it wear down faster but it can take up to 2 days hanging on a line or on a rack to dry completely. Also, buying one is not enough, as you'll need one to put in the pail while the other one washes and dries, so make sure you buy at least 2.
I purchased, and had used a Whammies diaper pail liner 2 years ago and the interior \"waterproof\" lining began to peal away after a year and I thought they were supposed to last much longer.  When I asked for a refund from Whammies they said it was no longer under warranty and then didn't offer much help, nor a discount to buy from them again.  So I tried out the Planet Wise brand of Diaper pail liner and so far I LOVE IT!  It really does mask the odor, much better than the competition ever did, and no pealing has commenced and the bag is in tact through load after load.  I am very pleased.
Honestly, this liner is a bit overpriced, as it is the exact same design and materials as the Kissaluvs diaper pail liners...just with color. Great liner though and very durable.
This bag would work very well in a hamper, which is its intention, so I can't fault it for that. We bought it to use for storing soiled cloth diapers when travelling, for you can fit many more diapers in this bag than in even a large wetbag. We have the hedgehog print, which is adorable. The one thing that would improve this product would be the ability to secure the top of the bag; it has an elastic top to fit over the edge of a hamper, but no way to cinch the bag shut. That aspect makes it less than ideal for travel, since no one wants dirty diapers spilling out.
The item is just as I thought it would be, I haven't tried it out yet because baby isn't here but it will get tried out soon!
I have two of these pail liners and i alternate them when I do my diaper laundry. I would say that they get washed about once or twice a week depending on if they get soiled or not during use.  I have had no problems with delamination of PUL nor have I had any leakage either. Its a great value compared the prices of other pail liners and I wash these with my regular diaper laundry. Nothing special.
I line a stainless steel trash can with these. Works great, lightweight, washes easily with the diapers.  I have two of them and just rotate them as I wash my diapers.
I love this pail liner.  I own this one and this one -->(Blueberry Solid Colors Diaper Laundry Bag, Mint Blue.I have to say, I like the Planet Wise diaper pail liner better.  I like the elastic top so that it stays up on the diaper pail.  I throw this in the washer & dryer and have had no issues with the elastic or waterproof-ness of the liner.  The Planet Wise diaper pail liner is easier to get in and out of when I carry it to the laundry room.  The Blueberry one has a drawstring which ends up being in the way more than it is useful.Would highly recommend this bad for a cloth diaper pail liner!
Ok I really don't need more than the two I already have, but the product is wonderful!  For all of you cloth-diapering mommas out there, you know how important a great wet bag is to have.  I bought (only) two of these to have one ready to use while the other is in the wash, so with washing my dipes every other day, these two bags are getting to know the washer/dryer very well!  Zero signs of wear after 2 continuous months of heavy use and abuse!  My only wish is that I could have purchased one in every color! The outside fabric is clearly superior--soft, stretchy, durable; and the inside liner is wonderfully waterproof!  GO PLANET WISE!  Oh, and I also recommend their other bags (I have one medium zipper, small zipper, and a snack bag for the diaper bags!)
I bought two of these for lining a step can we use as our cloth diaper pail.  They go right in the wash with the diapers and I line dry it. I would recommend hanging it up to dry to keep it in good condition. Buy two and you'll always have a clean spare.
Got two of these to rotate in the diaper pail and they work great.  They have held up in the wash and look as bright and cute as the day we bought them.  Since it's PUL, I hang them to dry and they do collect a bit of water in the washer so I have to do that over the sink, but it's a great product that does exactly what it says it will do...and they are cute!
I love this pail liner! It is a perfect size, comes in great colors ( I have 2 chocolate and 2 sage), and is heavy duty. I would buy at least 2 so that you can wash one with the dirty contents, and have another fresh one in the pail. Look no further, these are the best out there!
I use this liner in a 15 gallon trash container I bought from Costco. It doesn't fill the container completely, but works fine. I wash it with the diapers and it washes nicely and dries quickly. The elastic top is well constructed. I prefer my other liner, Kangacare, to this one because it the adjustable top of the other liner - so when I take the diapers out I can close the top and set it on the floor without worrying about it tipping over, but this liner is just fine and certainly meets my expectations.
I love the elastic around the top, it stays on the diaper pail.  We were using trash bags and it would constantly fall in when you threw a diaper in it.
I was a little hesitant to purchase a print with the white background but after three months of soiled diapers, these liners have proven to be very durable and functional.  Ours is used in a diaper Dekor pail and it is usually filled within 2 days which is about the time the diapers should be washed anyway.  We also use washcloths instead of wipes so that takes up more room.I love that I can empty the bag in the wash machine and toss the bag in too.  I never have to touch a dirty diaper and the liner goes in the dryer too.  My only suggestion to make this product better is to have a drawstring at the top.
I use this to store my dirty cloth diapers. It gets the job done. I am glad I bought it. It doesn't keep all the stink out, but a good portion of it
We have two of these pail liners so we can alternate when one is in the wash. They are great. Fun, bright colors. No leaks. Good elastic band to hold it in place while in the can. Strong enough to tote the diapers down to the laundry room. Easy to care for (I wash them with the diapers on hot and sometimes machine dry them/sometimes air dry them). Very happy with them after four months of use.ETA: Just want to say that after about two years of use, these are still holding up amazingly well! We have two that we alternate in the diaper pail (which is just a standard plastic kitchen garbage can with a pedal-operated lid), so they each get washed once or twice a week, and they are still in perfect condition. VERY happy with this purchase.
We bought this diaper pail liner in the Hoot print and the Blue Giraffe.  They are both super cute and the construction is very durable!  We have another brand of liner that soaks through if the diapers inside are too wet.  We didn't even realize that there was a liner that didn't do that until we purchased these for a second diaper pail (since we now have two in diapers at the same time) and these are amazing!  We have not had any soak throughs.  We wash the liners about twice a week each with the diapers and they still look and feel brand new.  These are highly recommended!
LOVE THIS THING! I ended up just getting a simple flip top trash can but this liner fit just about every pail I tried it on. And I just throw it in the wash with the diapers once a week.
I bought this and Kissa's pail liner when I started cloth diapering a year and half ago. For the first few months I liked them equally, couldn't really see any difference. But after a few months of wash and wear (I machine wash them and line dry, never put them in the dryer), Kissa's antibacterial liner is clearly the winner.The problem with this one is, the PUL side, the side that repels water, for some reason always flips inward. When washing pail liners, you want to turn the bag inside out so the PUL side is on the outside, otherwise it's impossible to rinse off the soap residue on the PUL side. Planet Wise's liner usually flips back after being tumbled in the washer. I don't understand why it does that and why kissa's seldom has this problem. It might have something to do with the elastic or the bag design.Now with this liner, I have to hand wash in the sink after I take it out of the washer to rinse off all the foams and who knows what other dirty stuff on the bag.
I purchased two PlanetWise Diaper Pail Liners for use with our cloth diapers. After only a month, one had holes already. After a few months of use, both lost their waterproofing in several areas and began sticking to themselves on the inside - the waterproofing became like glue and made the bags pretty useless. Manufacturer won't replace due to \"wear and tear.\"Pros: Vivid colors, stretchy elastic, fits 13-gallon trash bins, soft and roomy.Cons: Not durable, waterproofing peels or wears away quickly, poor customer service.
Easy to use. First time cloth diapering and decided to use this bag. Wish I would have gotten a hanging one but all in all it does the job great. Would definetly recommend. It's been great so far.
Easy to use, easy to clean. It does it's job and keeps the diaper can clean. Not much else to say about this. Would buy again.
I purchased this to use for soiled diapers. It's perfect! It is sturdy, waterproof, washes easily and is a perfect size.
I have been using these for about 3 months now and I am really really happy with them. They are great for cloth diapers. We dont use a fancy diaper pail, we just use a Hefty step trash can that we got from walmart. This pail liner still works great with it. We have never had any leaks from it and really contains the odor. The bags are really strong to and quite big because we aer able to fit all 24 cloth diapers in there at once. I also have the smaller size zippered wet bag that I use in my diaper bag and that is awesome too!
We have two of these liners (Avocado and Blue). I love them! They are always in use. I have not had any issues with delamination/cracking/wicking/leaking. Nothing at all. They do get a slight smell to them, but an extra wash or some time on the clothsline out in the sun fixes that.We use them in a kitchen size step-to-open trashcan it fits perfectly. Great investment.
This diaper pail liner has no frills but it gets the job done. A large bag with elastic on top that fits into most standard trash cans. It really is waterproof, we have never had a leak. It washes and dries right along with the cloth diapers, and comes out clean and smelling fresh. Mine still looks new after dozens of washes. I have several so that I can always keep a clean liner ready. Comes in great colors, too.
We use this in a regular garbage can that we use as a diaper pail in our daughter's bedroom.  We have two so we can have one in the wash with the diapers and still have a liner in the can.  It washes great, we have never had a leak, and it fits the 13 gallon garbage can perfectly.  We have the pink color, and it is a very light pink where it almost looks white in certain levels of light.  I also highly recommend the Planet Wise wet bags, they are just as great and hold in smells and wetness flawlessly.
The diaper pail liner is pretty good, containing the smell, mess and wet without any trouble. However, the elastic on the top edge is already starting to come apart and show signs of wear; I've only had this for about five months. I'm disappointed in that and will call the company with my feedback.
Love this liner. Fits my diaper pail perfectly and holds plenty of diapers. Cute color, slate! Definitely will use for a long time.
Keeps in all moisture and odor even after repeated washings/dryings. Only drawback is there's no drawstring or other way to close up bag. Elastic band fits well in standard trash can, but lack of drawstring means this pail liner won't find a use when diapering is over. I also purchased a kangacare liner and it has a drawstring. It can be used later for wet swimsuits and towels from a day at the pool or beach.
With 3 months of exclusive use this product has held up great!  I use it in a 13 gallon steel step garbage pail and it fits perfectly and looks adorable.  I highly recommend to other CD'ing families.
If you are going the dry pail method this pail liner is great, my only problem is I bought one and you can not dry in dryer so it takes a while to air dry. So I recommend buying a second one to switch out when washing. But it works great to just throw in with your cloth diapers to wash. Nice product, made wellAlso- seems like it might make an awesome laundry hamper liner : )
Bought this liner for our cloth diaper pail. It's perfect! It doesn't hold odors, it's large, and it's washable. Love it!
This pail liner is totally worth it to not have to dig dirty diapers out by hand.  It works great to prevent messes from spreading, and cleans up great in the wash with the diapers. Worth it to buy two as it takes a bit of time to get both sides dry if you are hand-drying since it is waterproof.
I love the Planet Wise products (i.e., the wet bags of which I own three and swear by) that help to contain the fowl odor that comes along with choosing a cloth diaper system. I gave this particular product a four rating solely because it does not have a draw strong closure, which would be helpful with transferring the soiled diapers/clothing to the laundry room or on a trip.
I bought this pail liner for my daughters cloth diapers and it's worked out great so far. I throw it in the wash right along with her diapers and it comes out nice and clean. So far it's held up very well for me and I expect it to last a while.
no fault on the product but it just didn't end up being what i needed. thought it was a great idea to fill a pail with this then dump everything to wash. but i ended up liking to soak my diapers in a bucket of water before i wash them so i put them directly into the bucket of water after each changing so i ended up not needing this. think i might cut it up and use it to make potty training pants for extra protection.
does exactly what it's supposed to, holds up in wash, seems perfect.  hard to tell which way is supposed to face in vs. out when in pail, though.
A great liner for cloth diapering. No holes etc for having washed & dried it even though you're not supposed to dry PUL. Keeps the stink contained & fits a regular sized trash can.
Haven't used it for diapers yet but it fits my pail perfectly! I like the elastic top and how large it is.
I use this as a pail liner for a tall kitchen trash can. Works great. I haven't had any leaks, and I wash it with the load of cloth diapers.
I expected this bag to be a waterproof liner.  It's not.  It is a reusable moisture resistant liner and I suppose I'm fine with that.  Don't set this on your floor though.  You will get a yucky surprise.  Just use as a liner.
This bag is completely leak-proof! It actually can hold water in it (not that you need to). It fits into a standard 13-gallon kitchen-sized trash can. The elastic at the top is awesome - it stretches very well but is also very strong. It has held up great, and I wash it each time I do diaper laundry. It holds at least 3 days (or more, but I never go that long) of one-size pocket diapers and inserts. Highly recommended!
Great for cloth diapering, and made in the USA!!  We have three to rotate through as we do laundry, although we could probably get by with two just fine.
I love these bags.  Even if you don't use cloth diapers or cloth wipes you should get these.  You can always use a water proof bag you can use for laundry and they definitely do their job.  Great size, they hold a lot and I loved the cow print.
Love all my PW bags. Just don't put in dryer and don't dry in the sun (PW's website says UV rays damage PUL). My advice is buy 2, so while one is being washed and drying out, you can line your pail with the second one.
I love this bag.  It's a bit big for my 7 gallon pail, but that's my fault for not noticing the size.  It washes clean and air dries extremely well.  It doesn't hold onto stains or smells, so at each cleaning you get a fresh, clean bag that helps to reduce the smell of baby diapers.  In fact, so far, we don't have an odor control problem at all.  The color on this is very bright, and perfect for our little boy (although I wouldn't hesitate to use it for a little girl either!).
I use it in my Diaper Dekor pail and it works well, a little tricky to get out when it is really full, but other than that I like it a lot. Very strong, durable, and washes well even in my HE washer.  I dry it on low or hang outside.  Doesn't hang on to smells, and is very good size! I'm glad I went with it, I love Planet Wise products! Love their wetbags and wipe pouches too!!!!
Ordered this item to use with my dry cloth diaper pail. I have been using a 13gallon trash can that I bought at target for the cloth diapers and was going through a lot of trash bags so I wanted to by a reusable trash bag and this item has been working perfectly. fits the trash can/diaper pail perfectly. Fits snug around the top and does not slip.
I am so disappointed in these diaper pail liners. I got two in celery (currently unavailable) to use in rotation. I'm cloth diapering my lo, and after 3 months of use they are both falling apart. I loved them until after two months I noticed holes towards the top (near the elastic, but not on seam) and subsequently stopped putting them in the dryer. Today I found the elastic edge completely unraveling. I'm not rough on things at all, so I'm really shocked they fell apart after such a short period of time. I LOVE their wet/dry bags and use them often, but don't need to wash as often as I need to wash my diaper pail liners. Such a shame.
I've had two of these liners for over two years now and they are still in like new condition. On average they are washed and hung to dry every other day. Best pail liner out there!
This bag fits perfectly into the garbage can we use as a diaper pail for our cloth diapers.  It's so easy to use, has a cute print, and it's a cinch to just empty the contents and throw it in the wash with the diapers!
I use this, together with a pop-top trash can from target, for my cloth diaper laundry. Every day or every other day I just dump all the contents in the washing machine, and then drop the bag in too. It contains odors well and comes clean every wash. I have the \"avocado\" color and it is very pretty.
I have two of these for use with my cloth AMP diapers. I put them into a plastic diaper pail with a carbon filter in the lid. They work great. I can wash them with my cloth diapers (cold rinse, hot wash), and then thrown them in the dryer. Still looking like new after 1 year of use. I would recommend them for use in your diaper pail.
This is a great wetbag! I imagine it would fit many pails. I just wish it had a drawstring at the top. Still happy.
I really like this as a diaper bag but am still undecided as to whether I will keep it. As a diaper bag alone - love everything about it. Perfect amount and various sizes of pockets. It's also a huge plus for me that this bag is completely PVC and Phthalate free. The only thing I don't care for is how stiff and structured the bottom is. The reason for this is because I don't like to carry a separate purse and diaper bag. I keep my stuff AND my kid's stuff in the same bag. So the stiff bottom doesn't feel very comfortable when it's over the shoulder - it pushes my arm out instead of conforming under my arm and sitting closer to my body. If it had just a little slouch or give to it when you put it over the shoulder I wouldn't even consider returning it. For now I will keep trying it on to see if I can get used to it because I love the bag otherwise.
I loved this bag when I first got it.  The outside material looks like leather but is actually made of some glossy, lightly textured thick material which wipes clean without stains.  The inside has a thin umbrella-like material.  I loved the accessories: the pacifier holder, wallet, and great oval shaped changing pad.  Unfortunately, this bag is not practical.  It doesn't close completely on the top, and it is narrow.  So when the bag falls over, half my things tumble out.  The magnetic snap that holds the top \"closed\" is only an inch wide, so you can see everything inside the bag.  Yes, this lets you put more stuff in, but having your bag that full doesn't look very nice.  In fact, I got this bag thinking it would be big enough for cloth diapers, but it only holds about 4 pocket diapers.  Also, it sticks out a lot in the back when you carry it on your shoulders.  I was in a store with narrow aisles and starte hearing things fall on the floor.  I went to pick up the things, and as I stood up, more things fell on the ground.  I turned around to see what happened... and knocked more things over.  Aargh!!  I give it two stars for the super changing pad, but I am quite disappointed with the functionality of the bag.
The thing I love most? The pretty green color.This bag is honestly pretty small for a diaper bag. The top doesn't have a zipper, just a snap closure that was constantly popping when I was using this for my daughter. I just felt like I never had room for everything, and the shoulder straps were really small, so it was a bit awkward holding it on my shoulder.One big thing I liked: the stroller straps make it really easy to snap your bag onto a stroller. I wouldn't buy this again though.
I'm not a big bag person. Before my baby arrived I loved going out with my husband just so I didn't have to carry a purse period! My son is 4 months old and this bag and I have gotten along great.It's pretty long, but not horribly wide. The outside is very easy to clean (just wipe it down) but it doesn't have an awful plastic feel to it. The straps are big enough I can put it over my shoulder and it stays in place.Usually when we go out I put the following in it:5-6 disposable diapersFlat Plastic case of wipes2-3 bottles1 bottle of water1 burp clothA change of clothes for babyBaby Einstein Take Along tunes toy (it's a miracle worker for us!)A roll of diaper garbage bagsHand sanitizerMy walletMy phoneA pack of travel kleenexThe matching clutch--with chap stick, hair ties, bobby pins, tampons, etc)The matching changing padThis bag also comes with a matching pacifier holder (which we don't use) and the things to attach your bag to your stroller (which I just put my bag in the basket below for right now).I've heard complaints on how this bag is shaped---apparently some moms haven't liked the shape of the edges because bottles won't stand up. I've never had an issue with this. I just wrap my bottles with a burp cloth and put them in one of the inside pockets (there are four--and an inside zipper pocket---and 3 outside zipper pockets).This bag has worked great so far. If we have another baby soon we might need to look for something bigger though.I've gotten lots of compliments on it. Women are always shocked when I tell them it's a diaper bag. I had a younger girl (maybe 18ish) come up to me in Old Navy last weekend asking me who the designer was. It's nice having a bag that doesn't scream \"baby\".
I debated over this purchase based mostly on other reviews that it was smaller than expected.  I guess for any mom of multiple children, more space would always be nice, but how big do we really want our diaper bags to be? It's a normal-sized bag, not huge, but definitely not small. I think the style is great, really cute bag, already lots of compliments.  I do wish the pockets inside held sippy cups and bottles a little tighter.  They fall out all the time, and leaks in my bag are messy.  Overall, I'm happy with this purchase.
I also have a Skip Hop Duo Double since I have two under two. Although I love that bag, it has tons of space and compartments, I don't always need to bring that much for short outings. I was looking for a bag that looked more like a handbag, not so much a diaper bag and this does it. It comes with a great small purse, pacifier case, and changing pad. I bought the grey and its a great metallicy slate color. Wipes easy and has great compartments as well. Perfect as a diaper bag to use when you don't necessarily need all the newborn necessities and you want to be oh so stylish!
I just got the green bag and I can't wait to start using it. The green looks exactly as it does on my computer. This bag is so stylish that no one will believe it is a diaper bag.This bag is a standout and I guarantee you'll get compliments. It is also quite large and appears functional with several large pockets inside and two external pockets as well. I can't imagine that I will need more room for all my baby stuff. In fact, I think I'll be ditching my own purse so that I only carry the one bag once the baby arrives.update. I have now been using the bag for 2 months. It is really too small for anything but a really quick dash to the store. Once I had the baby I realised just how much stuff I have to take with me each time I leave home. This bag doesn't hold half of it. The inside pockets are not contoured enough for bottles so i have to stuff other thing around them to keep them upright and then they fall over anyway. The fact that the bag doesnt close is a big problem as stuff is always sticking out and it just looks untidy. Plus I use glass bottles so I am always afraid they will fall out and break. I will definitely have to get a bigger bag.I give this bag 5 for looks and 2 for practicality
We purchased this specifically for the nipple rings and covers because we purchased extra nipples for the storage bottles but couldn't use them to feed our son.  I just wished they sold the nipple rings and covers separately instead of including it with a package.  I'm sure the extra caps and disks will come handy some day.  Nonetheless, the set was reasonably priced unlike many of the Medela products on the shelf.
I do love having the extra parts, and they all fit perfectly with my Medela bottles.  However, I did discover inadvertently that you cannot put the bag into the microwavable steam bag to sanitize.  We placed the spare parts in the mesh bag, put the mesh bag in the microwave bag, and turned it on.  The plastic parts of the mesh bag completely melted.Otherwise, this is great.
So unfortunately I had to put my 2 month old in full time care and they do not prepare bottles, so I have to have enough bottles with nipples on them for him to take. Originally I only had 3 collars and I needed extra ones. This was perfect. He drinks out of the medela storage tubes still so I didn't need the bottles. This is a perfect set of extras.. I'm buying another set.
These are a good amount of extra parts for the price.  Overall good value and good for storage.  I would recommend.
This was exactly what I needed to replace some of the solid lids where I've dropped full bottles of milk and only broke the lids.
I needed more rings (my pump only came with one) and bottle caps for storage.  This pack met multiple needs.
I have ordered this product twice, because it is exactly what I need.  I wanted just enough to get me started with pumping and my new baby.  Every part is useful.  The parts are also very sturdy and will last a long time.  I recommend this product.
It has been useful to have spare bottle parts. One of my original caps recently cracked, and I was happy I had a backup. I also really like the mesh bag these parts came in. Unfortunately, my baby will not drink breastmilk from Medela bottles. However, she is very, very picky about bottles.
What can you say? I needed these parts, because between daycare and home I'm always misplacing these small items. The little mesh bag comes with, so you can toss them in the dish washer.
I wish that I had just bought the set of 3 Medela 8 oz. bottles instead since those came with 3 medium flow nipples (the part that we needed for the Medela 5 oz. bottles that we had), and we ended up needing the larger bottles a couple of months later anyway.The medium flow nipples have been great since we started adding a little Gerber oatmeal to our baby's last night time bottle (at about 6 months).  The Avent natural nipples and bottles that we had loved up until that point didn't have openings large enough to let the cereal-thickened formula through, but the Medela medium flow nipples have a larger single opening as opposed to just having more openings of the same size.
These tops can also be used on ameda, dr. browns, and evenflo bottles.  There are probably other brands as well, but these are the ones I have that I have found to be interchangeable.  I use them mostly with evenflo glass bottles.
Exactly what I needed to complete my very incomplete six-year-old medela kit.
I love have extra parts!! It has made going anywhere so much easier. The package came really quick as well.
I bought this after I had trouble breastfeeding and needed more bottle parts to get by after coming home from the hospital. Just what it says they are. Fits onto regular bottles and storage vials as well. Perfect for moms using medela products already.My only complaint is that these should come with the pump or in a set with bottles and not separately.
I have the Swing pump (read my review about how much I hate it) and it didn't come with enough nipples, so this was a perfect addition.
We go through a lot of bottles at daycare and sometimes parts never make their way home.  These spare parts were exactly what needed to make sure I could keep using all the bottles.  I consider this a must have for mothers sending medela bottles to daycare on a regular basis.  Or if your dog sometimes gets to the bottle, which has happened to me several times also.
This kit is a little pricey when for a few dollars more you can get bottles with all these parts, but it is nice to have them on hand in case a bottle gets dropped & a collar busts.
This has all the pieces you loose! Caps, rings, bottle covers...who knows where they go! You WILL need this, trust me! And you WILL regret not getting it if you don't buy it. If you pump, you go through caps like crazy!
I love the idea of the spare parts set, BUT the nipples are another story.  They collapse constantly, so my baby gets super frustrated.  Guess that makes the spare parts kind of useless.
I bought these to go with some medela nipples I bought at target. Target didn't sell extra accessories. They are exactly as described and it it very helpful to have extra lids for bottles to store. I use these with evenflo glass bottles from target and they fit perfectly. The only reason for 4 stars is that it is a little pricey for spare parts, but all baby stuff is expensive.
I hate that one drop can ruin the caps, and that my little one managed to break all of the ones that we had in such a short amount of time...just by nudging his bottle off of his high chair.  I recommend trying different bottles so that replacement caps aren't an issue at all.
I was so glad to find these-I don't know why it's so hard to get extra rings. Very glad I bought them.
Initially I thought this was a wonderful idea, until I realized this spare parts set is only three dollars less than the full set with bottles included. Medela really needs to sell the collars alone for a lower price - the wide-necked ones are the first thing to break when baby drops his bottle. I don't want to have to pay $13 or $16 dollars every time I need more collars, it's ridiculous. Other brands use standard collars which are very inexpensive by comparison.
I love these nipples since they are clear and I can see any little bit of milk, smudge, dirt that may get on them and keep them clean.  I do have a little trouble sometimes when they leak, not all do, and I can't figure out why some leak.
Medela parts are good, i do wish they stayed the same size though. We had some smaller sizes and had to buy new ones to get the bigger &#34;holes&#34; for the new nipples.
These make life much easier -- just pump, throw on a cap or nipple and go. I wish they sold the individual piece separately, but you will use everything in the set.
Buying this was ridiculous. Over priced items. Buying the 3 set of bottles is much more valuable. Would not recommend this item.
The product arrived quickly and nicely packaged. The items were true Medela parts and fit perfectly with my Medela bottles. I sterilized them and used them right away.
If you have Medela's bottles then you must buy spear parts, specially for the collars, since they break a lot.
I like the idea that it had a little of everything that we could possibly need. You don't know how this has come in handy.
This is a great set to have if you are using Medela bottles because the collars will definitely crack at some point.  We really liked the bottles, but we found that after about six months of use, they started to crack with frequency and we were constantly having to buy &#34;extra parts&#34;.
I liked this package a lot. I never used the little covers for the open bottle necks, though, so those were useless. I wash everything by hand, so I never used the bag either. Overall, everything fit well and did its job! :)
We can never have enough caps or rings, so it was a relief to find that they could be purchased without bottles!
Works exactly like you would think.  We love using the medela bottles and will continue to do so as long as we need
Comes with bottle caps, bottle collars and inserts to make them bottle caps, and caps that fit over the nipples and collars. The parts can be tossed in the dishwasher in the bag they all come in but you have to carefully arrange them to not collect water. Wish Medela would put in more sets for the price, and take out the unnecessary parts. The bag isn't useful and we don't need both bottle caps and inserts to make the collars into bottle caps.By the time you add in the cost of nipples, it's almost the cost of a new set. If you are still using slow flow nipples with 4oz bottles or medium with the 8oz., it's not worth getting these. Just buy a new bottle set as it will only cost a couple bucks more, if that. However if you are not, then these maybe worth it if you don't need more bottles and the nipples in that set.::posted by Rob's wife
My baby is 1.5 months and I am exclusively pumping, so I needed some spare parts. The mesh bag is great for the dishwasher and having all the rings and caps makes life easier by not having to wash parts as often.
This is just helpful to cut down on constant bottle washing.  We use it all the time and it helps to have plenty so I can always use a clean bottle and don't have to wash them several times a day.
love it, since i got missing parts of my bottle covers and i can replace them easily, nice product to safety using.
I bought these with the intention of using them as &#34;paper towels&#34; or napkins. We have been trying to reduce the amount of waste in our home. I have tried various assortments of dish rags and towels and I was never satisfied. Someone mentioned to me that flats make great dish towels so I figured I'd give it a try. While I am sure you could find a better deal on regular dish towels or bar mops, the price for these is still pretty good. So far I am very pleased. They are super absorbant and great for drying hands and cleaning up spills. The texture works great for wiping down counters and tables, as well as dusting. They are big, as most flats are, so I was planning on cutting some of them in quarters and sewing two together to make napkins or to put a basket of them in the guest bathroom for people to dry their hands with. I did notice that while I waiting to get a new sewing machine, I had used one of them that I had cut. After I washed it it started to become unraveled. So, if you're going to cut them, make sure you hem the ends otherwise they will fall apart really easily. I know this is probably the most random review because it has nothing to do with diapers but I figure there must be someone out there using them the same way I am. I do happen to use cloth diapers on my son and based on how I have been using these I think they'd hold up great as diapers too.
I didn't realize how huge these were when I purchased them, having no idea how &#34;old school&#34; cloth diapers these were. But the main reason I got them was to use on my changing table and as burp rags and they work great for both. Love that they're unbleached and they get really soft when they're washed. Happy with my purchase, I should have just paid closer attention to the measurements when purchasing.
Love these flats.  I've been cloth diapering for about 13 months now (daughter is 18 months), and my favorite diapers by far are these flats.  I fold them origami style, throw a cover on them and good to go.  They fit so nice and trim on my daughter that it doesn't even appear as though she is wearing a cloth diaper.  They are such a great, economical option for people who want to cloth diaper.  I change my daughter every two hours (or more often) in these diapers.  Great thing is they are so cheap, I can have 24 and do wash every third day.  I put an extra insert in for nap times and still use disposable for night.  Working on going completely cloth, but don't think these would cut it for night time but then i have not tried doubling or tripling up.
Love these! They are my favorite flats ever. Inexpensive, trim, easy to wash and dry, don't stain easily IMO. None have fallen apart after a few months of use.
I was very pleasantly surprised to find that I prefer these diapers over the Green Mountain Diapers unbleached flats. These came out of the wash so squishy soft, and the edges do not bunch up and wrinkle nearly as much as the GMD flats do, making a neat folding job so much easier. We have put these through the wash numerous times already  and there is no sign of the stitching coming apart or any other wear. Love them and definitely recommend!
These washed up really well. I just did one wash and dry cycle and started using them. They stayed pretty true to size (not significant shrinkage). I like that I can do a more complex fold or just fold a couple of times to make a pad. These also dry really quickly in the dryer as they are flats.
I use these pad folded in a cover or as an insert in a pocket diaper (trying to get rid of the microfiber).  They are increasing in absorbency as I wash them more.  I love how trim they are when using them either way.  I sun out the stains, but definitely throw them in the dryer for a few minutes after since they are stiff after drying outside.  These are a great flat diaper...I prefer them over my prefolds.
I was super excited to get these for my 15 month old.  I adore cloth diapering and heard good things about these flats.  I was unimpressed with them when they shrunk after washing and drying them the first time out of the package!  I would not recommend them at all.  My flower sack towels from Target work better.  They didn't shrink.
Honestly, flat diapers are the unsung heroes of the cloth diaper world. So many times, I see people write something along the lines of &#34;I didn't want to spend a lot of money on a newborn diaper stash, so I used disposables until they fit one-size diapers&#34;. People, flats fix this problem. Different folds allows the same diaper to work from birth to potty training (there are many folds out there which can make flats seem overwhelming, but I've only ever used 2 and will never need more than that). You only need to invest in a few newborn size covers to bridge the gap from NB to OS. Then you only need a few OS covers to take you to potty training. Flats are absolutely the most economical way to diaper a baby. Newborn pockets/AIOs tend to be leaky anyway, so why not use something super-absorbent from day 1 without breaking the bank?As for the folds I use, the origami fold works best for the first few months. It's nice and trim, even on newborns, and you can get a good fit around the legs to hold in the runny poo. When the rise becomes too small, I just switch to pad-folding. Pretty much, I just make an AI2 out of the flats and covers...there really is no need for expensive inserts! These are incredibly absorbent, around 9-10 ounces, which is better than almost all brands of microfiber inserts. Natural fibers are better for baby anyway. If you need more absorbency but don't want the bulk of doubling up the diapers, then I recommend bamboo flats. Hemp inserts wrapped in the fold work well for added absorbency too.
We bought a dozen prefolds and then a dozen flats by accident, and I'm pretty happy with the accident. It's very nice to be able to fold the diaper differently as our baby grows and to be able to choose where bulk does or does not lie. That's harder with prefolds. I like an orgami fold that I can use with the flats that gives my baby more wiggle room and doesn't push his legs apart more than they naturally are. To make diaper changes easier, when I fold laundry I just go ahead and &#34;prefold&#34; the flats to how I like them, and then I'm not fighting baby and the diaper at the same time. Also, it's very nice how much faster these flats dry. When I hang them outside on the line, the sun bleaches out all yellow poop stains and helps avoid diaper rashes (of course, that part you can do with prefolds too).
I bought these, loved them, and bought more!  I prefer flats seeing as they are much lower profile.  I use these in oragami fold for my chunky 5 mo old and they are perfect.  I will soon need to utilize another fold, as origami won't hold out too much longer, but these are nice and large.  When they shrink, they stay relatively square and they dry up nice on the line.  For prepping, they were prepped easily enough in 3 washes and dries using a front loader...  If you prefer prefolds, I highly suggest Osocozy's Unbleached Prefolds.  They are so soft and fluffy, although are on the shorter side.  They are perfect though for trifolding in covers or stuffing pockets with!
This hat is pretty cute.  I wish it had a strap to keep it from flying off when the wind picks up.
Super cute and keeps the sun out of my baby boys eyes.  Would like to order another as a spare.
This is a nice hat however for 6 months, it is very large.  It is way to big on my son's head.  I love the design and am keeping it because I know he will grow into it eventually.
I bought this for my 3 month old for a beach trip!  It fit perfectly.  He looked so completely adorable in it!  He is in the 75th percentile for head size and he was 3 months when we bought it and it fit perfectly for him, maybe just maybe a little too big.  
This hat is the only one I could fine that would fit a 4 month old. All others, even one's marked 0-12 months or 0-6 monthsm were too big. It doesn't have a chin strap but I wouldn't use one anyway. Great price too!
I have gotten many compliments on this adorable hat.  My 4 month old fits it just fine, though the brim does cover his face somewhat (though I think that may kind of be the point).  Goes through the wash nicely.
Nice colors, light weight, shades my baby's face exactly as a hat supposed to.Will get the larger one soon, since those little heads grow fast!)
This hat is so cute, and I wanted something for an infant.  Most of the hats are just too big, but this one, while a bit big, still works.  Plus, the soft brim allows him to lay down and still wear it when we're out in the car seat!
This hat is cute and plenty large enough for my 6 month old son's head, which is of average size.  There's some room to grow.  It's not quite as stylish as a bucket hat from the Gap that we lost, but it gets the job done.
My son is now 7 months old (40th percentile) and this hat still is a little big.  I imagine it will fit him better when he is closer to  a year.  It is a very cool hat, and quality is fine.
I bought this for my new grand baby and he looks so cute in it, especially when he wears his shades, too!
Got this for my 3 month old. It fits great, still a littlebig, so it should be perfect for this summer. Super cute!
This hat is adorable, and is just the right size for my son's head. The other hat we have is too big and tends to slip off - this one stays put and looks great.
Nice Summer Hat to keep the sun off their little heads, or just add to an outfit.  I would say that it would fit as expected. My grandson is 4 months old, but was born 2 months early, so his head his on the smaller side, and it is big on him and he is not able to wear it yet, but for a 6month old, I would say that it would fit appropriately.  Nice material as well.
My 10 month old son has a big head, so I order the 2T size and thinking it would be enough. It arrived promptly and looks super cute, unfortunately it's a little tight on his head. The inside measured 19.3 inches. And because of the material, it doesn't have much elasticity. So I had to ship it back. I wish they have a bigger size, because I really like the look and the light material for the summer.
maybe my baby's head is that huge but we got 2T and it never fit (son is 10 months now)it's a pity because i really liked it. it is breathable and light - just for the summer!
Cute cute cute. Runs a bit small so didn't fit our son as long as we'd hoped, but regardless, silly cute hat.
I bought this hat for my 8 month old.  He likes it, and it's very cute.  It doesn't have a very wide brim, so I still have to put sunscreen on his nose, so if you are looking for true sun protection, you might want another style with a wider shadow.
If you're looking for a cute hat, this one is great.  If you're looking for a hat to keep the sun of your child's face, keep shopping.  It is not as floppy as it appears in the picture, and does not do anything to shield the my son's face from the sunlight.
This is a great hat, especially for the price.  IT fits my 18 month year old son well and covers his face and neck.  Would recommend to anybody.
I bought this hat to protect my son from the sun while in the pool.  It has served its purpose well.  I haven't had any problem with the colors running and my son has dunked it in the pool more times than I can count.  The fit is good.  The brim could be a little wider, but protects my sons eyes for the most part, but I would like it if it protected more of his face.
Alittle expensive but looks very nice. Size is too big for my baby for now so haven't wore it for now.
My little boy looks so cute in this hat but tries to take it off any chance he gets. Still, it looks adorable on him and protects him from the sun. It feels very soft and comfortable. It is our 3rd hat already because we lost the first 2 but still a good purchase.
Lovely little hat in a lightweight fabric and cute design. However, on my 19 month old the 2T size is too small. I suppose I should have paid more attention to other reviewers complaining of the same problem. This will be going back.
This is a great car seat! It fit my HUGE baby and still does at 8 months (he is now 24.5 lbs and 30 inches long)! I am impressed at the size of the car seat itself. It was a full 8 inches SHORTER than the graco safeseat. I am very pleased with the performance and it is SUPER easy to use. This is great for someone with a small car and needs a means to fit a baby rear-facing along with a toddler front facing and 2 adults! This is a definite!
GREAT COLOR AND FABRIC! PRICEY BUT WORTH EVERY PENNY FOR SOMETHING YOU WILL USE EVERY DAY AND YOUR BABY WILL LIVE IN IT FOR THE FIRST FEW MONTHS! STROLLER THAT MATCHES IS ALSO A MUST HAVE!!!!!
I REALLY wanted a Combi carseat. We have a Combi double stroller that I am thrilled with, and I also know that Combi has a good safety rating. Well, first of all, this carseat - the violet one - is not as pictured color-wise. The color is actually a BRIGHT periwinkle, and I think it's much too girly for boys - at least for mine anyway. But even for being so bright, the carseat just looks very drab and boring. I know that's not the most important consideration for a carseat, but if people didn't consider what the pattern was, manufacturers wouldn't have so many. Anyway, as far as use, I didn't even install it in the car to try it out, because I thought the installation of the carseat itself into the base wasn't as easy as it could have been. Also, this was a little too big - in my mind - for smaller babies, which mine were/are. They were preemies (but going home weights of 5 and 6 lbs), and this wasn't going to work even though the lower weight limit was in line with them. It doesn't have one of those inserts for newborns, so if you were to put a newborn in, they would look, very, very small and although the straps keep the baby in place, it's always nice to have a little extra something to make them feel snug. Back to the Combi double stroller...it's a side by side, and with twins I realy wanted a stroller that would accomodate 2 carseats, and there's no way this was going to work out. The stroller will accommodate 1 carseat, but not very safely. The carseat didn't snap in and I felt like it wasn't stable. In addition, the carseats are too big for even one carseat to fit on one side and not take too much space from the other seat. I have a 2 year old as well, so if he were to be sitting on one side and the carseat was installed on the other, he would constantly have to lean away to the outer side of his spot. I think Combi makes some great stuff, but this wasn't a winner for us. I gave it three stars because it does have a good safety rating and it feels structurally solid, but costmetics and functionality cost it those last two stars.
Our baby hasn't arrived yet, so I will update this review when we can actually put this seat to use, but so far, we love it!I spent a great deal of time researching car seats, as safety, comfort, style, and size were all HUGE issues with us.  Finally settled on the Combi Shuttle due to it's safety ratings 
We have had 6 months to review this car seat.  It is a car seat...they are heavy and annoying to carry, all of them.  The handle is nice because it doesn't get slippery in my hand when hot out due to the grey skid pad.  The weight is heavy, but lighter than other modles. I have to carry it up stairs at times and I usually take the baby up seperatly.The fabric cleans up rather well.  We have had to remove all the pads a few times due to blow outs.  Removing them is fairly easy.  They dry quickly too.Getting the baby in and out of the seat is not too bad.  At first the clasps were a real pain, but after a few weeks I am use to it and it's really nothing to complain about.The baby does tend to get hot while in the seat, so we dress him in layers when necessary.Fitting the car seat into the stroller is a pain.  However, not enough where I wouldn't buy this travel system.  The plastic connector doesn't stay in place on the stroller and can pop up and move.  This is an easy fix, I just haven't had to time to 'secure' it.The car seat is very stable, the base is extremly easy to install in the car (as are most bases these days).  I have also used the seat belt attachment, and that is somewhat easy.  It was hard for me to push the seat down to get it secure but I'm a tiny person.  I had a neighbor help me.A complaint I have for this seat is the handle bar.  I wish you didn't have to use two hands to push it down (a button on each side must be compressed).  However, it looks like most other car seats have the exact same design, I assume it is a safety issue.  It is really hard to push the bar down when you are holding the baby.  I've tried using a knee (doesn't work) or balancing the baby on my lap (takes mad skill) but the thing that works best is having a routine where the bar is left down whenever the baby is removed from the seat.  Although, husbands tend to forget this and then you resort to the balancing act.All in all, this is a good travel system.  The stroller is SUPER light and easy to fold, super easy!  Attaching the car seat to the stroller has a minor flaw, but one you can secure a fix for.  The fabric washes well and dries very fast. Dress your baby in layers so he doesn't get too hot (easy layers, button jackets, etc).  The price is comparable to other brands but this brand takes into account additional safety features (further foam insulation to protect the whole back, not just to the neck).I also did a detailed review of the stroller.
After much research and asking friends, we left our beloved Graco and Britax and chose a Combi seat for our new baby.  Awful decision that we regret every time we use the seat.1. Heavy beast, even without baby inside2. Hard to get baby in over the rebound bar3. When taking our baby out, his feet get caught under the rebound bar, a couple of times hard enough to make him cry in pain4. The buckle is a \"puzzle buckle\" and let's just say it makes me want to throw the seat in the river.5. The way it works with the matching stroller is insane...poor design makes it hard to get in and out of the locking mechanism6. See #5 for the base, too...Clicks into base just fine but getting it out is like unscrewing a medicine bottle...push down while simultaneously pulling up7. Our sunshade broke almost immediately on one side.  We still use it, but it's now lopsided like someone sat on it.I do have one good thing to say...the fabric is easily washed and washes beautifully.
I was reading other reviews for this seat and decided to write my own and let people now how great this seat is!*Its NOT hard to get baby in or out the car seat, because feet get stuck ( i never had that hapen, i guess people just need to be careful )* Never had problems buckling my baby in the seat because of the puzle buckle, You just get used to it, and its safe and secure*yes it is tricky to put this car seat to the matching stroller, but hey, its not too bad. Just try again* And its not that heavy, there is car seats what is heavier that this!I know what i am talking about, i have this seat for more than a year now, and my baby is still in this seat and is happy.But there always will be two sides, people who hate this seat and people who loves it! I amd the one who loves it!
I like the styling of Combi products but have not been happy with the infant carrier car seat use-wise.  It seems a bit small even for my 50th percentile daughter.  She was comfortable in it up until about 8-9 months.  Definitely can't imagine 33lb infant fitting in this!  Also, really dislike how you have to pull apart the seat to re-thread the harness.  Not so easy to do which means I didn't adjust it very often which isn't so good for baby.  Also, found it not so easy to slide and click the car seat into the base.  Often required a couple of tries.  At 12 months, we switched to a Britax Marathon 70 which is so much more user friendly.
I bought this car seat for my first child. We have owned it for just under 8 months. My son is about 1-2\" away from outgrowing the height limit but he still only weighs about 18-19lbs. He fits (and always has, with the seat inserts)well and actually prefers this car seat to the convertible car seat in our SUV. The combi fits well in the back of my VW Passat and when I had the installation checked at the firehouse the officers were actually calling people over to demo the anti-rebound bar :) . I really like this car seat (SUPER light compared to the other car seats we looked at) and actually have a friend with the same seat whose 2 year old somehow still fits in it! She doesn't like the buckle mechanism but I don't really have any issues with it. The only thing I am disappointed about is I can't adjust the handle or canopy (had to detach it) with the headrest expanded to the height required for my son. My husband loves this car seat and so does my son. We highly recommend it.
I bought this stroller because my twins were no longer comfortable in the stroller we had bought when they were born, we had the standard Graco double stroller that the car seat carriers snapped into. Since everyone has different needs when it comes to strollers, I'll tell you what I was looking for:-Extra space between the front and back seat so as my twins get bigger there is room for their legs, and the one riding in the back won't be constantly kicking the one in the front. Some people are more concerned about \"footprint size\" but I would rather have a longer stroller that gives them their own space as opposed to a stroller that is shorter and lets them pick at each other and get irritated.-Easy to push and easy to turn.-Versatility with seating, since my twins do better when they can face each other and interact.-Cup holders. I know this seems like an obvious thing, but some of the higher priced strollers don't come with them, and if I'm dropping a car payment (or for some of the more expensive ones, a house payment) on a stroller, I shouldn't have to \"splurge\" for the cup holders.-A decent sized storage area underneath.-Visors that actually do what they are supposed to do!This stroller really fit the bill for us, but if you are looking for a tiny stroller to accommodate two small children, this probably isn't for you. I got what I was looking for in this stroller. It doesn't fold as flat as many other strollers, and to get it to latch shut, you have to remove one of the seats, which really isn't that much of a challenge, since you just push the two buttons on the side and lift. The seats are so easy to remove and snap back on, that I actually stopped a temper tantrum from my daughter in the middle of the store by turning her around (WHILE she was in the seat) since she was mad her twin brother had something she wanted. If you have a small car, it will take up a lot of trunk space, but we have a minivan, so for us its not something we worried about.I love the full back on the front seat, and if you have never purchased a double stroller before, its not something you think of until you are irritated by one that doesn't have one. Since the front seat on our last stroller was shorter, and there wasn't any kind of cloth between the top of the seat and the bottom of the visor, my poor daughter got stuck in the back almost every time we used it, because her twin brother is a hair grabber. With this stroller, the back of the visor attaches to the top of the seat with velcro. Plus, the visors are a great size.This thing turns on a dime! I mean, it turns so well that I had to adjust how I turned so I didn't cut corners too sharply. I also have absolutely no problems with the wheels. I remember reading reviews about how cheap the wheels were, but they are just like most stroller tires, made of heavy duty foam. The stroller rolls so smoothly and is so easy to push (and I'm pushing over 60lbs of kid!) that I don't really care about what the tires are made of.Other than the size issue for some people, as well as the way this stroller collapses, I don't have any complaints about this stroller. If I could collapse it and close the latch to keep it collapsed with both seats attached, I'd give it 5 stars.
I was searching for a double stroller that would work with my Chicco Keyfit 30 infant carseat and my 2.5 year old son. After being very disappointed with the Chicco Together double stroller, we tried this. First of all, it's very stylish. I love the look of it. The quality also seemed great. I liked that you could position the seats several ways. The color was nice, and the swivel bars very easy to use, and different than any stroller I had seen. It also does in fact work with the Chicco carseat. Even though it doesn't \"click\" into place, I was happy with the fit of the carseat on this stroller. I read that the seats had to be removed before folding it up, so I was ok with that going in. They are very easy to remove, rearrange, etc. So is the adapter for the Chicco carseat. I also had read that it was kind of heavy, so I figured I would deal with it. The deal breaker for me on this stroller was that to fold it up, it doesn't latch closed automatically on it's own like other strollers I've had. I've had several strollers, this is my 5th baby, so that was a disappointment. But not only does it not latch automatically on it's own, the latch that you latch it with yourself is made of flimsy bendable plastic. It doesn't stay in place at all and pops right out when the stroller is moved at all. In fact when it is latched, the stroller isn't even at it's flattest most compact form, so flattening it more, lifting it to your car, or moving it in any way once latched, makes it come undone. You are left trying to contain and manipulate this huge, heavy coming apart contraption because nothing holds it together. Because of this, it renders the latch basically unusable, but when you couple that with the weight of this stroller (it is indeed very heavy) it ruins it for me. I'm not that tall, and if I'm going to commit to dealing with the weight of a heavy stroller, there has to be something that holds it together to help me out getting it in and out of the car. Unfortunately, that stupid little latch or lack thereof was the deal breaker for me, which is sad because the quality of the rest of the stroller seems very nice. We ended up going with Baby Jogger's City Select.
As far as double strollers go, your choices are either wide or long.  I don't like the sit and stand ones because my daughter is tall and my infant son is growing very quickly.  This stroller is definitely longer than those so they'll both have leg room.  My issue with that is I'm short, so I can't see the front wheels and I have crashed into a few things.  I wish I could adjust the handle, it's almost at a perfect height for me but my husband, who is very tall, has some trouble.  The parent tray is kind of awkwardly placed because the handle bar gets in the way.  You either have to reach over it or under it.  The ipod thing is really just a speaker that you plug in to your MP3 player's headphones jack.  It fits into a pocket in the canopy of one of the seats.  It's not all that fantastic.  However, we have a hard time getting my daughter into strollers and she'll go in this one no problem if she hears her favorite songs coming from it.Kolcraft has two separate lists on their website as far as infant car seats go: the first is a pretty big list of common infant seats that will fit the stroller.  The second list is much shorter and is if you are going to put two infant seats in the stroller.It is kind of heavy, it takes some effort to get it into the trunk of my SUV, but I'm sure there are others that weigh more.  It turns pretty nicely for its size and it's not too hard to push.  You do feel every pound of your kids' weight when you have to get it uphill but that's not surprising.  The basket is so big that my large messenger style diaper bag fits under the car seat, leaving what would be leg room for the rear kid, plus lots of room up front.  The seats snap in and out really, really easily.  It took a few minutes to figure out how to get it to fold but once you get used to it, that's not hard either.  So far, I'm very happy with it.  We'll see if I still think that when my son outgrows his infant seat and he's using the 2nd seat it came with.
I read all the reviews and finally decided to get this stroller and let me tell you, it is awesome! I have a 4mo old and a 2yr old and it has been perfect. I LOVE that the seat positions are interchangeable and that it holds the infant carrier in either position as well. I dont know if it would be a problem for someone with a compact car as far as storing, but I have a truck and have no problem throwing it in the back. LOVE LOVE LOVE that I am able to put the infant carrier in the far one, facing me and have my two year old right by me facing out, that way I am able to see both of them and my toddler can still look out. It was definitely a great price for all the features. A+++
I am such a happy camper my two year old fits perfectly and is in the 99% for height, with room to spare for a while. I love how easy it rides and how easy everything is. The new features compared to the old are awesome and happy for the change in head room. We originally were going to buy the red old one, and I thought the head room was just too risky. This stroller is AWESOME! love love love love it!
I am really excited about using this stroller. It is bulky and heavy, but it glides easier than my Graco single stroller. It will be a lifesaver when my husband isn't on hand to help out.I wrote a somewhat lengthy blog summarizing parent reviews I found for this product online:I also blogged about my personal experience with the product--My Real World Test:
We purchased this stroller for a newborn and a 2 year old.  It is a fantastic stroller.  High quality, great storage, looks nice.  LOVE the multi-position seats, it's a wonderful feature.  The biggest draw back is the size.  It's so massive that we nicknamed it &#34;the beast!&#34;  It is very heavy and bulky when it folds down.  We fit it into a Lexus RX300, but there is no way that it would fit into a smaller sedan, and you have to remove both seats to get it to collapse (directions say one seat, but that didn't work very well for us).  Although it moves smoothly, it's a bit difficult to navigate and push because it is so long.  There is no such thing as a quick trip with this stroller, we only used it a few times for longer day trips to Disneyland, etc.  We decided to sell this and do two smaller high-quality umbrella strollers instead.
We've had this nightlight since 2011. It rotates between 3 colors, or you can set it to stay on one color. This is my opinion of the brightness options:  The Green is the brightest (almost too bright for someone to sleep with, lights up the whole room), blue(normal nightlight brightness), to red(very dim, only lights up the corner it's in). I love having those options. Like others have said, it's fault is that it doesn't have an off switch. If it's in a room that's semi dark all day long, it's going to be on all day long unless you unplug it.  Also be aware to those who have very small children, this nightlight will probably look like a toy to toddlers. When my son was 13-18 months old, we didn't use this on my son's room because he wouldn't leave it alone.  He wanted to touch the \"little person\". After that, we've used it and really like it
You can choose between blue, green, red, or all three. We keep it on green and it gives a nice soft glow. Enough to see, but not enough to keep awake. It automatically kicks on when it is dark enough and it doesn't take much to do so. Its kind of a goofy shape, but its perfect for a nursery or childs room. We are happy with this purchase.
It arrived broken.  Total waste of time. We also tried the portable model.  It stopped working after 2 weeks.  If I could I would give -5 stars for both models.
We first saw this light in my niece's room at x-mas, and immediately thought it would be good for our daughter.  (My niece is almost 3; my daughter is 2.)  And it has not disappointed.  My daughter loves watching it change colors.  I definitely think it helps her to see it at night; she seems a little less fearful of our turning off her room's lights at bedtime.  We've also used the light in single-color mode, usually in blue, which is my daughter's favorite color.  So far it has held up well to constant use.
Each color emits a different amount of brightness, so you should be able to find one that suits your needs.  Red is the lowest brightness and we leave it on that setting for sleeping during the night.  The blue and green lights provide the perfect amount of light for diaper changes in the middle of the night.
In fairness, I have found that a plug-in night light is just not practical in a child's room, for the simple fact that the child will want to play with it. If your child is in a crib at night, that really isn't a problem. As soon as they grow out of the crib, though, they will discover the night light, and you either have to take it out every day, or get a different kind of light.The design of the light is cute, but it is too bright in fixed-color settings, and waaaaay too distracting in multi-color settings. The brightness + color cycling was actually waking my child up, so we only used it for a day or two until we figured that out and stopped using it.
I actually bought this based on some of the less than positive reviews that said it was too bright. I wanted a very bright nightlight for my boys, as they are scared by the shadows and darkened objects in their room. This light is not bright AT ALL. I think those reviewers must be vampires.It works very well, though. You can make it green, blue or red (the red is especially dark). Or you can have it rotate all three colors. The rotating option is slow and steady, very soothing.Since it's not very bright, the colors do come in handy. If there are \"monsters\" in the room, the green light scares away the monsters (so says mommy). The blue light is to keep the \"dinosaurs\" outside from coming inside. If there is more than one threat in the room, then we do the rotating light. I'm not stupid...I know my kids are making these things up to stall. So though I would have preferred a brighter light, the different colors are good tricks to get them to knock it off. It cuts down on the shenanigans at bed time.  ;)
The night we got this (this was our 3rd one we have bought---the others are still working great, just needed a bit more light in another room) my 4 yr old daughter threw up everywhere....it soaked this nightlight!  I wiped it off as best I could and it still works!  So I guess I can endorse it for being puke-proof!  LOL.  This doesn't give off us much light as other nightlights, but it is a perfect low-light in my opinion.  We do have 2 in our twins' room and just one in my other child's room...getting ready to purchase another for the new baby on his way.  :o)
This is a perfect soft glow for the nursery. I like that you can choose your color setting or choose the rotating colors.
This has been a great night light. You can choose between red, green, blue or changing pattern of colors for this. The only downside is the top pops off, revealing the \"bulbs\" and my daughter likes to unplug it and play with it. She's been doing this for a couple years now, and my blue light finally went out. I still like this light and would buy it again though!
I really like this night light - very usual with the color changing function.  My kids love it!  And I like that it saves energy by turning on only when it is dark
This light is perfect for my daughter's room!  It provides just the right amount of light & she likes to change the colors.
I love this little light.  My son has the Mobi Tykelight GloMate, and this makes a great accompaniment.  I like that the light is not super bright, and not too dim, its perfect.  I also like that you can cycle through the colors.  It also has an auto-off when it is daylight (and when the lights are on).  I would definitely buy another!
It is more a novelty light than a night light. The only bright color is blue. I did like the colors changing but it got annoying because it will dim then get bright dim then get bright.....now I just leave it on blue.
I love these MOBI Tykelight WallMate's!  We bought one for the bathroom in our first tiny house after our son was born.  Now that he is getting older, we have one in each bathroom and his room and the hall.  they are terrific!  Have never had any problems with any of them.  They are simple and easy to use and provide just enough light so you dont have to turn lights on in the bathroom for 2am visits.  I highly recommend these night lights.
We have owned the Mobi Tykelight, the Mobiglow and now the wallmate. I am very pleased with the wallmate. It is nice and bright but not too bright for my afraid of the dark boys. It appears to be sturdy as well.
The settings on this night light are actually pretty bright, and we keep ours on &#34;Red&#34; which is perfect during the night (least bright).  If my son wakes up, I go into his room and hit the botton to blue or green to give me a little more light.  He is still in his crib, so he isn't tempted to play with it at night like other reviewers have mentioned.  When my daughter gets a little older, I will buy one for her room too.  Love these!
My daughter has the larger Mobi on her nightstand, and can't sleep without it on! She loved it! This one is in our nursery, and I love that it is light activated so we don't have to remember to turn it on and off each day! It is just enough light so that we can we can navigate through the nursery safely, but not so much light that it becomes annoying.
This night light is so cute, and I love that the colors change.  My kids love it, too.  The only thing I don't like, is that it is very bright. Almost a little too bright for them to sleep, so I have to shut it off when the kids lay down to go to sleep.  But we all still like it!
My daughter loves this night light- chosing which color to leave it as has become part of her bedtime routine. It allows enough light to leave her feeling safe, but not too much to keep the room too bright (which believe it or not was tough to find!).Only con was that the first one we received didn't work and had to be returned, but Amazon issued a quick refund.
I am 6'0 and wanted to find something to make stroller pushing less of a pain in my shoulders. It's not the easiest thing to install, with it being such a simple product. The instructions say you will adjust to this new way of pushing a stroller, using one arm and using your feet to maneuver instead of your hand. Whatever this all means, after 2 weeks of walking daily with it, I give up. It's too hard to maneuver and negates the benefit of making my stroller handle a little bit taller.
The Amazon listing doesn't mention it, but this item will not fit on a stroller with a hard plastic handle.  It has to be a soft rubber or foam handle.  I'm really disappointed that I didn't find that out until I got the package, and now I have to return it.
Reviewers loved Easy Stroll, you could move the stroller with ONE HAND! Letting your other hand free for holding a toddlers hand, grabbing an item or taking a drink. Not only that but it is ergonomic, helping posture. This was especially nice for those who are taller, and we noticed that we didn't have to hunch over to walk with the stroller, and there was less strain in our arms and backs. Easy Stroll works on most strollers that have standard handles with rubber or foam hand grips. The installation can look a bit daunting, but grab a mommy friend, or the hubby to help you install in quickly. You'll love this product! We also LOVE that CONT.@[...]
This stroller grip is okay. We have a medium size, collapsible stroller that's not quite tall enough for me to use and not kick the rear axle. I'm 5'8\" tall and my husband is taller. Our large stroller w/ travel system is designed to be able to use one-handed and that works better than putting this grip on the medium stroller. The grip didn't add enough length for us so it wasn't any easier to use one-handed. I would not buy this again as it just didn't make a difference for us. We just bring our huge stroller everywhere.
My husband is 6'4 I am a shorty at 5'5 we both LOVE THIS!  I can't say enough positive things about this. It adds next to no weight to your stroller and zero bulk on our Graco Ready2Grow Stand and Ride Stroller when folded. You can walk with the stroller 1 handed very easy. You also have a lot more room so you won't kick your feet every 5 seconds. I am over the moon happy we checked this out and bought it!
I love this handle.  I had the hardest time pushing the stroller when I took walks with my grandson, the handle isn't long enough and I found my back hurting and I kept kicking the tires.  I was thrilled to have found this and boy what a difference it makes!
This might work great on car seats but there was no way to use it with my stroller. Because you would have to take the straps out and rethread them through the openings to attach it.
We got this because my younger son learned how to be Houdini, and would get out from under the straps on our Baby Jogger stroller.  This adds an extra step to getting him in, but a necessary one because he was climbing out as we were walking in a busy downtown.So it frustrates him, but that means it works for us.
First ensure that your baby seat permits somehow to release the belts so you can introduce this one... sounds logic right?
We bought this to replace the original Sushine clip on my son's Radian65.  It is easier for his little hands to do, and I don't think will break as easily as the original one.  The cost was higher than I would've liked it to be, but it has proven to be worth it.
Sunshine Kids Harness Clip is easy to use. Well designed seat and their attention to detail and safety is why I chose their products.
This diaper does not fit my infant very well and so it always leaks when she pees.  I have been using it since she was about 11 lbs and I just can't seem to get the fit right.  Maybe it is not meant for such little babies.  I like the bicycle print and the snap closures.  The closures keep the bulk down so I actually really like the fit around the waist.  It is the fit around the legs that I don't like.  The inserts that came with this diaper also don't seem very absorbent so I usually put in different ones to help prevent leakage.  I would recommend the bumgenius all in one diapers over these.  Grovia does make a great cover diaper though.
Let me start by saying that  I have used quite a few varieties of cloth diapers before I came across Grovia.  I used Bum Genius, which was very bulky and hard to fit your baby's clothes over.  Additionally, if you need a clean diaper you have to use another diaper, you can't just change out the inserts as the pocket remains wet from the urine.  I also used prefolds, which were also very bulky and the wetness stayed against my son's skin.  He was constantly crying because he was so uncomfortable and his skin was red and raw from his urine.  I next tried the g-diaper which was a real step up.  I had the choice to use cotton liners or disposable liners which was convenient when I am out and about.  A few of the frustrations I had with it was that the insert would not stay put and therefore it leaked. Additionally, the diaper is not adjustable which means I had to buy different sizes (meaning more money..not exactly economical).  After months of trying all these different varieties I decided to use the Grovia diaper and I can't begin to say how easy and wonderful they are to use.  They are much trimmer than the BG and prefolds, the snap in cotton liner is VERY easy to use allowing me to cloth diaper even when I am out and about, the biosoakers work fabulous as they have an adhesive to stick them to the shells and the legs are gusseted preventing leaks, and the diapers are adjustable so I just had to buy one set.  I got an AMAZING deal from Costco on-line of: six diapers, 20 biosoakers, 6 cotton liners, the Magic Stick (which is very easy to use and really works to prevent diaper rash), as well as a sample pack of Tiny Bubbles, Grovia's new detergent for their diapers.  I also purchased the flushable disposable liners that allow you to line the cloth diaper and flush the poop down the toilet.  Our diaper pail has never smelled fresher!!The only negative to the diaper is that they flaps that you can fold the tabs under come undone pretty easily since the velcro is uber sticky.  However, if you own a needle and a thread it's an easy fix, or you can return them to Grovia and they will replace it free of charge.  BTW:  I did end up returning one shell because the velcro came apart and Grovia replaced it and even gave me a prestamped envelope to return the old diaper.  They have an awesome customer service department.If you are considering trying cloth, I would highly suggest this diaper.  It's worth every penny, and I can guarantee that it will save you quite few as well!!!
When I first bought these diapers I was very excited to use them.  Once I did I was disappointed.Pros- not as bulky as some diapers, and they are really cute, I have not had leak when he is awakeCons-  When the inserts get wet the shell gets wet as well and the odor is strong.  I don't feel the insert was designed well.  Its a great concept but not very functional.  I put my son down for a nap and he woke up soaked.  The sheets were soaked as well.  He is 9 mos old and the first and only time this happened is when I put this diaper on him.  These are the only diapers I have besides the prefold diapers so now I make sure to put on a prefold before a nap.I just recently ordered bumgenius and thirsties.  I have been using disposables for overnights since my son is a heavy wetter.  I am hoping with the new diapers I can eliminate the use of disposables.  I know for sure the grobaby diapers won't work for that purpose.
Pro's:-Once the liners for this diaper have been primed, they are quite absorbant.  I have not had any leaks.-The construction of the diaper is very good.  These have my favorite snaps and I love that the liner snaps into place.-Velcro is great for quick changes, my husband apreciates not having to line up the snaps.-They are very trim between the legs and the liners have a wide backside to them which is great for girls who pee a lot...My daughter.-they work GREAT with the Gro-baby disposable liners.Cons:-The liners are on the rough side, and once they are wet they feel VERY wet.  For some reason, (and this is since I've had them and not the result of a terribly stinky potty) they STINK!  They smell fine when they are clean but the second my kids pee in them I become very aware of the smell.  I have several other types of liners and do not have this problem.  These create the most pungent amonia smell I have ever experienced in CDing.-While these work very well for girls, they are not so great for boys as they get narrower toward the front.  They tend to bunch up around the genitals and are not very comfortable for him. I would like to have more of an hour glass shape to them since I use them for both of my kids.
When I first got one of these diapers, I shoved it in a drawer after a failed attempt and thought I would never use it because the side snaps were so much more challenging than front snaps.  Well I'm so glad I gave it another chance a month later!  For a slim or average build baby/toddler, this diaper offers a great fit with great absorbency!  I can't comment on its use for chunkier kids, but the snap configuration allows the thigh opening to be more generous and the waist tighter.  Grovia recently had users post toddler pics on their facebook wall, and there were some 3 year olds comfortably wearing this AIO!We always use the included snap-in booster for our 15mo old, but it doesn't make the diaper bulky.  If I know my son will soak the diaper, I fold the doubler back on itself so there are three layers in the front and only one in the back.  In fact, this configuration is my favorite to use after swim lessons (I guess pool water tastes better than sippy cup water).The reason for four stars rather than five is that I think side snaps aren't as easy or intuitive for care givers who are accustomed to disposable diapers.  My husband is totally fine with the Grovia AIO, but I would never send it to daycare or grandparents (both of whom are fine with the Grovia AI2 in either snaps or hook & loop).
I loved the Gro Baby diaper system and was sad when they changed over to gro via. But i bought one shell set to try it out and they have made great improvements! I would definately reccommend!
This is our fourth baby out of seven children, so we have used several different infant car seats over the years.  When I first opened the box, I noticed how cheap the fabric of this seat is.  It is very similar to the feel of chintzy outdoor furniture and is rather stiff.  There is almost NO padding in this car seat compared to similar infant car seats.  We will have to purchase polyester batting to go under the cover in the back or our baby will continue to be VERY uncomfortable in this seat with her little backbone up against the ultra-hard styrofoam.  I don't understand how one reviewer said that this was a very cushy car seat??  Also, for a 6-pound baby, the straps cut into the sides of her neck, so we'll be needing some strap covers, which we have never had to purchase for any of our other children.The straps were super-easy to adjust from one set of holes to the next, and also to adjust the length of, but the interval between the holes is just a little bit too long.  The lowest setting is too low, even for a small newborn, and the next setting is simply too high, even for an average newborn.  I can't understand why they have the lowest setting where it is, because it's too low even for our daughter's 15-inch doll!  Our last infant seat had 4 settings, which was perfect.  This seat leaves a lot to be desired...The canopy is cute and does the job it is expected to do, the seat is very easy to latch and unlatch out of the base to get it in/out of our 12-passenger van.  The handle is basic and easy to carry.  The color is adorable and very unique compared to most infant car seats out there, but I really dislike the feel of the cover because of the cheap fabric used.  Overall, I would not recommend this car seat to a friend, and I'm on the fence as to whether I should return it or not.UPDATE: Our littlest is now 8 months old and 17 pounds and she is still using this car seat.  The handle is comfortable to carry, it's not heavy at all, and it is easy to get in and out of the base.  The straps are still super-easy to adjust and taking the cover off to wash it is a breeze, unlike other car seats we have had.  The cover and canopy still look new after all these months of use.  I added extra padding to the back but she seems uncomfortable in it now, so we are looking for a new car seat.  We are still using strap covers because the straps are just too close to her little neck and would rub her skin if we didn't have the strap covers on.  Her shoulders are at the top of the highest strap slot, so I wouldn't see this fitting her until she was 22 pounds.  She loves to reach above her head and pull the canopy off to play with it...  I think she enjoys the rustling sound it makes.  This hasn't posed any hazards, as there is always someone sitting next to her, but if a mother is driving alone with her infant, I could see how this could be a scary situation.  We were hoping to use this until she was ready to be rear-facing in a convertible car seat, but it's time for this one to go now.  I still do not think I would recommend this car seat to a friend.
I bought the Discovery 5 because it looked bigger than what we had... It is bigger, and even lighter, but it is too hard to snap into the base to start. You have to push the front in first before the back locks (the other one I had just snapped right on top of the base), so it's quite hard to line up when you're carrying a heavy baby. Also, the straps on my other one adjusted from the front with a simple latch and pull. This one supposedly you can adjust from behind, but no matter what I do.. pull hard, pull light, pull with the buttons pushed, etc.. I can NOT get the straps to budge.I've had the seat get stuck in the base in the front part that you have to snap before locking the whole thing down. It is such a headache, and I hate this seat. I'm considering it $60 wasted, because I've had it 2 weeks and I just can't stand it anymore and I'm going to have to find a new seat.
This looks sooo cute in person! It also seems really comfortable. We bought a support cushion to put into this car seat to make it more comfortable for baby but it's already surprisingly cushy! Anyway, aside from comfort and looks, it also seems very sturdy. It seems to be well made and secure with great instructions. So long as you follow the instructions exactly as you are supposed to, it seems to be very secure and solid. The handle is awesome! Definitely a plus if you intend to carry this thing around at all. Also, I was not aware that this item CAME WITH the convenient base! I was considering ordering it so I'm glad I didn't! What a great deal! The base alone is $20 if purchased separately! One reviewer here complained that the front is too difficult to unlatch from the base and I would just like to say that while it does seem to like to hang onto it a little bit, you just have to tilt it at the right angle to get it off and I would MUCH rather that that front clip do its job a little too well than not hang onto it well enough, y'know?? It's there for safety, it's got to have a good latch on it. So I'm happy with that, personally. Seems like you just have to pull it off correctly if you want it to let go. Which, of course, involves tilting the car seat forward to a reasonable degree. Another complaint I've read is that the top straps are SO difficult to tighten or loosen from the back. Well, I disagree. There are two lever-like button things in the back right where you pull the straps tighter or loosen them and you HAVE to push on those in order to release the straps for tightening or loosening. If you don't, yeah, it's a lot harder to get them to move. But of course it is. That's why those things are there - to keep the straps secured in place. If you read the directions, it explains all of this very clearly. I had no problem loosening or tightening the straps while using that feature. I also didn't know that the seat comes with a metal clip if you need one for your particular type of car. It's snapped into little clips on the seat underneath in case you need it, where the directions are also kept. Another bonus - I didn't realize that the seat came with a little adjustable, removable awning! Very, very cute! I also love that the cover is removable for easy cleaning and appears to be made from a good material for messy little babies. I couldn't be happier with this car seat. And I couldn't imagine thinking that it's too feminine for a boy, BTW! Or too masculine for a girl, for that matter. It's an aqua color with little white, blue and green dots. I would consider this seat perfectly unisex and perfectly adorable! :) Highly recommended!
Nice car seat, very lovely color. The only thing that makes me give it 4 stars not 5 is ( it is hard a lil bit to open the fastners ). Maybe some people will think it is safer for the baby, yet it is disturbing somehow especially with a fussy baby who never handles long time touching her belly to open the locks of the belt.
Very cheap. Sits baby funny. Crappy plastic, hard to carry, and very hard to get in and out with lever. i would not buy this again and i would buy a more expensive one!!
I have this carseat in my car in the Marinara color, and my husband has the Safety First Omega seat which goes all the way to 5 years old www.amazon.com/Safety-Alpha-Omega-Convertible-Lamont/dp/B0043D2A9O/ .  That's the extent of my experience with carseats.  So far, this is my experience with the Evenflo Discovery carseat:Easy to install in the car:  This was easier to install than the other carseat we'd gotten.  It tightens on by connecting to pins that are present in all cars made since 2002 and many cars made before then (my car is older than 2002).  Because  the base detaches from the seat, it was easy to see what I was doing as I attached the base only, and then tried the seat on and tested that it was tight enough.Easy to adjust for infant's size:  The first time he was in the seat, he needed straps at the middle setting.  I was able to easily move straps from the smallest setting to the middle setting using the manual.  (The manual is kind of badly written, but it was easy to move the straps once I figured out what the manual was trying to say, so that balanced out.)Easy to strap the baby in:  I practiced once on a stuffed animal, and then put the baby in.  Strapping him in was intuitive and easy to do.Easy to attach and detach seat from base:  It makes a snap sound when the seat is connected to the base.  It is also impossible to get that snap in, if I slide the seat in wrong, so I know that the connection is good when the seat snaps to the base.  Removing from the base is easy, with a big red lever.Hard to remove and clean cover:  To remove the cover, you have to unhook each strap from the base.  I put this as easy to do, when I was doing it to adjust to the baby's size, because the baby is only going to grow through three settings.  It's hard to do, if I have to do it every time I clean the cover, because I would like to do that more often.  I also was unable to remove the hood, and I spent way too much time trying and cussing under my breath.  As far as removing the straps and cleaning them, forget it.  It's too involved.  You will have to get a wet rag and squeeze it along each strap to clean them.OK to carry, not too heavy:  I got this primarily because I wanted a baby carrier plus.  The only baby carrier I found on the market was the Shelby baby carrier by Dream On Me.  It looks like the seat part of this carseat, but weighs only 3 pounds.  In contrast, the seat part of this carseat weighs about 7 pounds (base purchased separately is listed with product weight 5 pounds, and product weight is listed as 12.4 pounds).  So, I thought, what's 4 extra pounds?  Well, it's 4 extra pounds you will always have to carry about.  This is OK for me with an 8 pound baby, but it's already much clunkier and hard to maneuver than just the baby by himself.  Really this is on the light end of carseat weights, and I know because I went to stores and tried carrying around the seat parts of a variety of carseats to test this out.No neck support for a newborn:  There is no neck support to keep a newborn's head upright.  This means the baby's head flops side to side in an alarming way, since he has weak neck muscles still.  Also, unless a neck support comes with the seat, you should not use one, because it won't have been tested for that use and could be a suffocation risk.  So, I can't improvise and install one myself.  If you have a long drive home from the hospital, your baby's head will be flopping to the sides that whole drive.  I don't know if it's bad for babies or not, but I'm a little uncomfortable with it.  When I take him to pediatrician or to my checkups, I feel bad for him and his flopping head.  Oddly enough, the Safety First carseat that goes all the way up to age 5 has a head bumper insert for infants, and fits the newborn much better.  It looked far more comfortable and secure for the neck.  But then that one was horrible to install and can't be used as a carrier.  If I saw this before hand, I probably would have gotten a carseat with a head bumper or support for newborns.Overall, this is a good carseat for short trips where you will need to be able to carry the baby and set it down.  The carrier is lighter than most that I looked at, and easy to install and strap a baby into.  I would not use it for longer trips or daily with a newborn, because they don't have neck muscles and there is no support to prevent the newborn's head from flopping around.
There is a hook at the foot of the base of this seat, that makes it feel dangerous to get the seat in and out of it. I only leave this seat in the care because of it.
This car seat is a beautiful and different color than most. It has been nothing but a hassle and I don't feel it's very safe. It is very wobbly in the base. The straps are HORRIBLE to adjust, be prepared to spend atleast 20 minutes doing so (from day one to last day of me using it, it was just as difficult to adjust). The latch in the front sticks and you have to tilt the car seat all the way up (waking sleeping baby everytime) to get the car seat out of the car. The canopy is very flimsy, my son at 5 months old (while I'm driving) pulls it up and down and the back goes over his face smothering him into the car seat, because of this I just took it off which gives him no sun protection at all (blonde hair blue eyed very fair child). The front harness does not snap securley shut. When my son was 5 months old he would pull it apart himself! VERY upsetting to get out of the car to get him and see that he is not securely in!!! A 5 month old should not be able to do this, SO dangerous! I DO NOT reccommend this car seat.I also want to add that my son is very small, only in the 5th percentile. A baby his size shouldn't be able to pull the straps apart or get himself stuck in the canopy at 5 months old.**My son is a very curious, busy baby. This just wasn't a good choice for him. It was okay when he was a newborn but it still was very wobbily, didn't seem secure and having to tilt him all the way forward to get the seat out would be a pain for any baby of any size considering it will wake them.This is not Amazon's fault. I am VERY pleased with Amazon and am usually very pleased with the products they sell. I have purchased a different car seat through them.
This seat was purchased for us from our registry.  I had shopped for seats since finding out we were pregnant. The weight of this seat and the shape of the handle and of course the color sold us.  We have used this seat(without the base) once or twice a week for three months.  Took it apart to clean spit up and discovered lots of stress marks in the plastic.  This is a brand new car seat, but appears that it has been through a lot.  I posted pictures and notes.  I have always loved the evenflo discovery and was so excited to get this one for MY baby (have used evenflo discovery in the past with nieces and friend's babies).  So disappointed.  I guess the quality is not what it used to be.UPDATE 6/23/2011:I wrote the evenflo company and received a response stating that all the white \"stress marks\" are simply discolorations from uneven temperatures in the plastic and coloring agent during the molding process.  I do not believe that ALL of the white spots are simple discolorations, however, I decided to update the review to give them the benefit of the doubt.
We bought this because our 4 month old daughter prefers to be more upright than laid back in an infant carrier car seat. It's a pretty purple color, seems soft yet durable, and she seems to like it. My only two complaints are the head pillow doesn't come down far enough for a baby. It needs a longer strap. Also in the rear facing position, it has to be reclined so that the arrow on the side is level with the ground. In order to do that it takes up so much room and doesn't fit even in my minivan without touching the seat in front. The leg buckle seems to sit more on her lap and if you're not careful, you can easily pinch baby's thunder thighs in the buckle, which is not fun (believe me). But as she gets older I think it will get better. I still really like this seat and would recommend it. Can't beat that price!
We purchased this car seat as an extra to be used by her care giver and for travel as is lighter weight than our other one.We were on a trip over the holidays this year and involved in a very severe head on car accident.My almost 2 year old daughter walked away with a tiny bruise on her chest/neck from the strap (my one complaint about comfort with this seat is it has no cloth gaurd for the straps at the neck line) and was playing with my brother's dog later that night while the rest of us (4 adults with seat belts) were in critical to severe condition and in the hospital for many days.I am purchasing another one to replace and can say from experience this seat did it's job!Always be sure your kids are correctly in their seats!!!!
This is a good basic seat. It doesn't have all the bells and whistles, but is a good value for the price and the color is adorable. I wish it had a little more padding, but in this price range the amount of padding is about what you can expect. No complaints
Ok, I HATE the color, but the carseat itself is wonderful! My 12 month old is sooooo much happier now in this over the infant seat. He can see out the window and seems to be very comfortable. It was easy enough to instal rear facing and I have not have any trouble with the buckles being hard to snap. I'm really pleased with this purchase
I really loved this car seat at first when I bought it for my huge baby boy. At 4 months he was a whopping 19lbs and ready for a bigger car seat. Anyways, I still really want to love this but can't say that I do. It's a great price and FAA approved for flights like I needed.But my number one complaint is getting the cover off. The back is held down by elastic loops , the sides are held down by plastic clips, but the front almost seems to be glued down. I can not figure out how to get the front end off without feeling like I might break something. All the manual says is that the cover can be taken off and is machine washable. I google for hours and all I managed to get was a few reviews from people that had a hard time with it and either 1)gave up or 2)finally figured it out without giving any details of HOW. This is very annoying and I'll feel like a fool to ask customer service. (Please give me a comment if you figured it out with some details!) Also the belts do tangle about once a week, and I have to be careful to not pinch my son's legs when buckling him in.
I moved from an infant seat to this one and so far it has been great. I have been able to adjust it so that she is tilted back far enough to rest comfortably and her head is not bobbing forward. It does the job, is easy to install and easy to take her in and out. I like it so much I bought a second for our other car, and now I don't have to shuttle it back and forth.
It was pretty easy to assemble and it occupies baby. It has enough toys - I can't say it has many bells and whistles, but babies get used to everything pretty fast. So i've ordered more evenflo toys for the saucer and just change them from time to time to keep her interested (one of the toys has lights and music which is nice since none of the original toys have it). The seat is pretty big for my 5,5 months old so I'm wrapping towel around her. The one thing she can care less is the mirror. Overall baby is happy, we are happy!
I am now using this with my 2nd child and it is still a hit in our household.  All the activities really keep the child busy.  Both of my children especially love the little green cup with the two chew toys hanging off of them for some reason.  Also the color is nice and neutral for any gender which is a big reason why I got it as well.  The leg adjustment is a great feature and it rocks a little to give the child some extra fun and the toys snap out so you can take them out to wash which is awesome.  This is a great activity to keep child occupied for small bits of time when you are getting dinner going or something like that.
I bought this for my 4 mo daughter for Christmas. She's still a bit small for it, but she is having fun with it anyways. It was pretty easy to put together too.
I bought this for my three month old son. He was starting to sit in a bouncy seat at daycare, so I searched for a high rated one for home. So far it seems great! He really enjoys the toys. The shipping was incredibly fast and it was very easy to put together. It seems like a good quality product.
I bought this product for my 5 month old son because it looked really nice in the pictures and my son loves playing with toys and jumping. When I received it, we set it up and it worked well for maybe about a month and then my son starting jumping in it and one of the blue caps popped out went down, and its NOT safe for your baby to be in if there is a older child around that likes to mess with things and who are curious about pushing buttons. My niece was curious about it and pushed it, and went down easily. I prefer something that is child proof. Also one of the springs came off. Also when he was playing in it, I noticed that he tore one of the paper labels and was chewing on it, I took it away. I think they really fix stuff on here especially the legging and the paper labels. I think its better of buying something else more expensive then buying this product because your baby could get hurt or swallow one of the paper labels.

This is so much fun for my baby girl!  She immediately loved it (at 5.5 months) and can spend an hour in here totally entertained.  I love that it doesn't have any lights or sounds - pretty simple.  Easy to put together without any tools and easy to clean and adjust as she grows.  It's much cheaper from walmart.com
My daughter absolutely loves this toy.  I was a little worried about her being able to pull the toys out of their sockets, but so far that hasn't been a problem.  She's 6 months old, but very short for her age (20% percentile), so she can barely even touch her toes to the saucer.  But she still loves to bounce up and down and she loves that she can spin.  She's always craning her neck to try and see everything at once, now she doesn't have to!  Another concern I had was the spinning bubble with the fish inside... I thought she might get her fingers caught underneath it.  But there is a plastic ridge that's just allows the bubble to spin, no way a finger could get in there.  It was very easy to put together and so far it's very stable.  Love that the toys are interchangable, so if she gets tired of them, we can get new ones.  I can see how the legs could collapse especially if the baby is very energetic and the legs are on the highest setting.  We're using the lowest right now, so no problems there.  The leg holes are a bit small, but my super-chunky baby has no problem fitting in there.  The seat is huge in my opinion.  Overall, excellent purchase and we're very happy with it.
I have twins so rather than get 2 things the same, I got this and a Jumperoo. The toys on this are better and my girls prefer to play with them, but the seat unit is so big that they are very unstable in it (including my bigger girl), so I have to put them in there with a baby boppy or towels and cushions etc which is a pain. I think they'll be too tall by the time the seat is a good fit which makes the Jumperoo my favorite.
This was so easy to put together and my son loves all the toys that come with it.  He's still a little big for it, but that's easily fixed by putting a rolled up blanket in the seat with him.
Great product, perfect price, better quality than other models. Like previous reviewers there is almost to many toys to play with its awesome!
I originally wanted the baby einstein exersaucer for my 7-month-old daughter but I settled for this one and got a few extra toys for it to interchange, which I haven't tried yet since I just got this today and so far, it's just okay. the design is really cute & my daughter likes it, however, I have the baby einstein 4-in-1 musical motion activity jumper and the chicco flower power dance walker for her, so she's kinda used to things that light up & play music and I think that this kinda bores her just a bit since it doesn't have any sound buttons or lights but she does get a kick out of it, she just doesn't like it as much as the walker or jumper. I actually ordered this before the jumper and got the jumper first, so I think that if I would've gotten this first, she would've liked it a lot better. the price is really good for everything that you get, although, compared to baby einstein, the seat fabric is a lot thinner and I noticed that right away. another thing is that it's very frustrating to get the legs into the base and then to get them just right with the springs & everything, so I worry about the springs, especially because when I pushed down on the entire exersaucer, just to make sure that I had everything secure & correct before I put my daughter in it, I could hear the springs. I really do like that the seat has a 360 degree swivel & it's easy for my daughter to turn in it. all in all, this isn't bad. given the same situation, knowing what I know now, I'd buy it again.
We also have the evenflo busy bee exersaucer so we could have one in each end of the house without dragging on back and forth. This mega splash one has ALOT more jump that the busy bee. It is easier to maneuver around for my son. The busy bee has kickstands which I kinda like but really don't use them a whole lot. There are nice toys and you can switch them around. The only complaint I have is that you can't hardly find any replacement toys that don't cost you an arm and leg.
My 5 month old twins love this exersaucer.  They will both play in it for 30-45 minutes at a time, giving me a chance to get a few things done.  At 4 months, they didn't bounce in it, but at 5 months my son is starting to enjoy that feature.  If you follow the instructions, it is easy to put together.  I did replace two toys with Switch A Roos.  We now have an Apple Book and a Chewy Fish - I'd hightly recommend both these items.I purchased this exersaucer because of good reviews, the price and the fact that it requires no batteries.  We're saving a bit of money on this toy and both babies love it!
My sister insisted on buying this exersaucer for my 4 month old son even after I had purchased a jumparoo for him.  She said I'd hate the jumparoo (which I don't... we do like it) but he loves this toy too.  It's a nice change because now that he is 6 months old I have this saucer upstairs in his bedroom so some mornings if he wakes up earlier than we do, I can put him in his saucer to play.  It keeps him happy and occupied for some time so I can catch a few more \"z's\".  The older kids like showing him all the new toys and it allows him to interact with them face to face so he can feel like a big boy.  His favorite toy is the one with the smiley face.  I was iffy about this toy, but I'm *so* glad we have it!  I am also fascinated that it is one of the few toys now a days that don't have any battery necessary parts yet it still is VERY amusing!
We originally ordered this when our baby girl was 4 months old. She was getting too big to carry around ALL the time and she no longer was content with laying in her crib/playpen when we needed a moment. She loved it immediately! She was still a bit young to really play with the toys at 4 months, but she liked touching them and looking at them. When she was that small, we'd just put her in for 5-10 minutes or so here and there. Now, she's now almost 6 months and loves playing with the toys. She beats and chews on them and the exersaucer holds up beautifully to her abuse! She can hang out happily in it for 20 minutes. We also love that we can remove the toys (and the seat) to wash them. The fact that the exersaucer can be adjusted in height is a great feature. She still has some room to grow into this more a bit, we think. Excellent product!!!!!
I purchased this exersaucer after having a bad experience with the Fisher-Price Luv U Zoo Jumperoo; baby hated it and it was enormous! I didn't want to get this one at first because it's so big, blue, and plastic looking. However, after having my baby play on it, it is totally worth having this ugly plastic thing in the house. My baby is 6 months and his feet can touch the bottom easily at lowest setting (not so on the F-P jumperoo) and will grow with my baby. There are plenty of toys and a lot of fun for the baby (not so on the F-P jumperoo). I love the orange tray to put in other little toys for him to find and pick out on his own. The seat rests on smooth rolling wheels so it makes it easy for baby to turn and play with the toy he wants (not so on the F-P jumperoo; very sticky seat). I considered the more expensive triple fun Evenflo exersaucer but opted for the cheaper one and I'm glad I did. There is still plenty of fun to be had by the baby and there isn't as much height from the simpler exersaucer. And it's more affordable than the F-P Luv U Zoo Jumperoo. I also love that you can purchase other toys and they are easy to pull out and change (not so on the F-P Jumperoo).Overall the great baby toy purchase, a must-have.
My four month old son loves his exersaucer!  He's not able to sit up on his own yet but has great head control so he's very comfortable propping himself against the front of the seat and playing with the toys.  I think he just loves sitting in it and babbling away and seeing the world from an upright position more often.  The spinning and twirling toys really catch his attention and he's very capable of moving the pieces around.  My husband said it was a bit of a pain to put together but nothing too intense or time-consuming.  My only worry is that it won't last us too long.  He's already 25\" tall and we've had to raise the setting up to the middle height since he's on his flat feet with the lowest setting.  I hope he doesn't grow out of it too quickly!
I read a few reviews, some obviously mixed. I am always hesitant when I see one or two bad ones. But I was desperate to put him in something that he would enjoy and of course help strenthen his legs. Alright,...honestly...so I can clean my house without him giving me the puppy eyes to pick him up all the time. In any case, he LOVES it!!! The product was easy to assemble and so far that I see, we have had no accidents or hazards occur. Whether or not it strenthens his legs...well I am not doctor. But does it give me a little break without the guilt...absolutely. We're both happy:) Oh, he's 4 months just in case you were wondering for your little ones. (Obviously, having him in the same room supervised is best.)
We've been using this with our daughter for the past three months and it has been invaluable.  We have limited space so the walker has to be our go to item to keep her occupied.  She is just 7-months now and has almost outgrown it, but for the past three months it has been invaluable.I chose this one because it is fairly simple and was the least expensive of the \"walkers\" I looked at from Evenflo.  Just the right amount of toys and you can detach and take them with you.  I believe it accelerated her hand-eye coordination and strength (per the doctor's suggestion that is what prompted the purchase).Relatively easy to assemble and the adjustable height is nice.  Our daughter is on the tall size, so she started on the middle setting (for height) and quickly graduate to the top setting.  As I mentioned, we will most likely retire this toy in another month or so, as she will be too big for it.
The good:  My 6 month old baby boy loves to rock out in here.  I'm very glad I didn't get one with MORE \"bells and whistles\" because the stuff on this one is plenty, in fact i don't even use all the attachments at once because he gets overwhelmed. I can't imagine the overload from one of the crazy ones that costs more. This thing is plenty entertaining and it totally wears him out.The bad:  At 6 months old and only 70 percentile in height, he is (according to the instructions) already supposed to be on the highest height setting so that he's on tippytoe not flat footed.  So that seems rediculous, he would outgrow on height almost immediately.  Also, because he's still pretty lightweight it seems top-heavy if I put it on the highest setting AND it also seems uncomfortable because then he is \"hanging\" from his hips too much and not actually practicing standing -- so actually i put it on the middle setting and just sit right next to it and watch very very carefully to avoid any chance of him accidental flipping it. (He can definitely really get it rocking and rolling!)
I felt a little guilty buying DS the one of the cheaper exersaucers that didn't have dangly things overhead and took 12 batteries, but he indeed has tons of fun.  At 6 mos, he's discovered the rocking and bouncing part and has a blast, not to mention refining motor skills with all the little toys.  Also, I'm definitely a proponent of buying things used, but once I saw how most of the toys are within 'mouthing' distance, I was very happy that we got this new.
My almost 6 month old is really enjoying this exersaucer. He wasn't sure what to do with it the first couple of tries, but his fine motor skills have really improved and he's figured out how to play with all the toys a short 3-4 weeks later! Very happy with this!
I originally bought this as a Christmas present for my son who would be 5 months by then.  However with how much he likes to sit up I broke down and put it together when he turned 4 months.  Assembly is very easy to do, which I had to do it while my son sat on one of my legs and was held.  I put it together and put him in it while I snapped in the toys and let the fun begin!  It does wobble a great deal when they start bounce and rocking around in it so do make sure you're child has good neck/head control.  There are times I will put my foot on it to stop it from rocking so much but then my son gets mad because he LOVES the rocking of it.  He loves all of the toys on it, especially the fish (he looks at it like he's going to eat it sometimes!)  I love the fact that you can interchange the toys to give them a variety to play with.  So far at about 2 weeks of it being up and together my son plays in it at least three times a day and at about 30+ minute intervals.  Overall definitely was worth the money and I got it when Amazon had marked it down at one point.
i had a similar exersaucer for my first son, who is seven years old, so with my newest arrival, i decided to purchase a new one... unfortunately, the quality of this exersaucer is less than the quality of the one we previously owned.positive points:some of the toys did seem to keep my little boy entertained, between when he was five months old to when he was eleven months old or so.the seat is generally well supported and sufficiently comfortablethe price was less than some of the other similar baby items...negative points:it's a pain to assemble correctly, and in assembly, it seems clear that it is not as sturdy as a parent might hope...the parent has to make sure the legs are rotated appropriately.  they can shift as the child plays, and can collapse if they are not appropriately turned.  this is not a task anyone but me did regularly, and subsequently, the springs fell out a few times.  no injuries, but a totally unnecessary issue.unlike the previous model, this can not collapse for easy storage.this toy is LOUD.  when my son bounced, you could hear him bouncing around our home.the snack tray is pointless.  who is going to give their child a snack when they are playing in a bouncy toy?this toy takes up more room than other options, if space is a concer
Packed with toys a plenty, my almost 5 month old, adores this. It seems to be really helping to strengthen her core and it is amusing to watch her in it as well. It only took about ten minutes to set up and this may be one of the few toys we now have that doesn't require batteries (which is an added bonus for us :)
PROS: Reasonably priced, doesn't require batteries, higher weight limit than most jumpers, interesting toys that can snap out and be exchanged.CONS: Springs in the legs sometimes snap out of place (easy to fix, but annoying), no 'kickstand' to stop the Exersaucer from wobbling aroundBEST USE: Around 6 months in age4 MONTHS: We bought this when our son was 4 months old, it took him another month to really grow into it. Had it come with some stoppers (old school exersaucers used to have them) it could have stayed still and been less scary, though he adjusted quickly.6 MONTHS: Ideal age, able to interact with toys, but because child is not really mobile - wouldn't object much to hanging out and playing. Would play for 30 minute clips easily.8 MONTHS: Nearly obsolete. While my son was still within the weight limit, he really didn't like to sit still. He might hang in there for 5-10 minutes, but no longer.12 MONTHS: Gave it away.RECOMMENDATION: Worth the investment. It provided a safe, entertaining place for my son to play if I had to run to the bathroom or couldn't closely monitor his playtime because I was preparing dinner or answering the phone. My son loved jumping up and down in it and it was his favorite toy for a while. Once he started standing and walking, he didn't want to be restricted and would fight me as I'd try to put him into the walker (however, he liked to stand and play with it - I used it as a blockade between a wall and sofa).
I purchased this for my first child. I am on #2 now and use it for the 2nd child too! I love it, it works great and both my babies loved it! I would recommend it!
Our six-month old LOVES this!!!  My only complaint is we didn't get this sooner!  Each time we put him in it he gets just a little bit stronger - it is great for helping him with balance and fine motor skills!  The bottom is concave so he can rock.  He can bend most of the toys towards himself - which he loves!  Bonus, he can bounce up and down because there are springs inside.  It was easy to assemble and it has been VERY easy to clean - gotta like that!  He really enjoys it - and we love watching him in it!
My 5 month old is a very busy boy. As soon as we stuck him in this, he LOVED it. There are a lot of steps to putting it together, but it took about ten minutes. There are three height adjustments. My 5 month old is 50th percentile and already needs to be on the second setting. So, if you have a taller baby, he might grow out of it.
We bought this one and the same thing in another design and our kids love it. It's sturdy, the toys are great, the snack tray is removable, it has a holder for the sippy cup or bottle, it bounces, it's easy to clean, and there is a lot of diversity in the toys. We bought two of these and one other brand, and I wish we had just gotten three of these!
This was a great buy for the price. Our baby loved this until he outgrew it and started crawling and walking.
My 5mo old was a little small for this so we put a folded bath towel under her feet.  There are no music pieces to this saucer but she seemed to like the toys attached to the top.  Easy to assemble.
My baby loves this exersaucer. It doesn't have lights and noise but i believe that those are for the parents' benefit, not the baby's. They don't need as much stimulation as we sometimes think they do. They're babies and very easily amused :) My little one would spend hours in this if I let him!I'm not sure what the size comments are about. My little one is 5 months old and about 16-17 lbs and he's still on the first setting.
I researched exersaucers for over a month.  I agonized over which one to buy for our 4 month old.  Our baby legitimately has everything and it was hard to justify buying another thing, but I wanted something I could easily move from room to room and outside during nice weather without lying the baby down in a pack n play or in a bouncy seat. I wanted him to be able to play.  I also didn't want to spend $100 because his jumperoo was $120 and the idea is the same.  Enter the Evenflo Splash Mega Exersaucer.  It's exactly what I was looking for.  No batteries/sound (I didn't want anything else that made noise), but lots of toys and baby is very entertained with the bright colors. He is 25\" tall and on the lowest setting his feet touch which I know he loves.  The price was fantastic, I believe I paid $45, and it was very easy to put together.  I think it's pretty sturdy and it doesn't have the \"feet\" that people are talking about.  It rocks a little, but nothing that would give our baby a problem. He also sits up pretty straight in it (he's 15 lbs)and doesn't lean forward like other reviewers have said.  The exersaucer even has a small handle so I can carry it outside and plop it on the grass.  We've had it a week and already gotten so much use out of it! Outside, in the kitchen, dining room, front porch, etc.  Even my husband who protested another baby purchase is really happy with this. Extremely satisfied with this purchase!
My baby enjoys this product a lot. I started using it with him at 5 months. He is tall for his age though slim and I think he will get a lot of use out of it. If you want stabilizers for the base email evenflo and they will send them for free. That way you can get more use out of it (I personally don't like to have my kid wobble around for a long time...when it's stable he can just stand and play in it without wobbling). It's a good product for a good price and to be honest I am glad it doesn't make noise/require batteries/etc.Note: my baby is 7 months and still using it. He continues to enjoy it. We do have it set at the highest height setting now so he won't be able to use it *too* much longer but I think it's a good value for money and a must-have. We have not had any problems with any parts malfunctioning/posing danger to my son.
I bought this for my twin girls. At first they were a little small so I wrapped a blanket in the seat to keep them snug and put a pillow in the base so their feet had something to rest on. The loved being surrounded by all the colorful toys. I bought the Switch A Roo Chewy Fish to go with it. That and the clear roller were their favorites.Easy to put togetherDurable PlasticThe toys are removeable for easy cleaning/washing and some can be switched around.The seat cover was secure but easy enough to removed to wash.Seat spins easliy.Easy height adjustmentThe only things I noticed:Rocks without the foot pegs. Didn't come with. I used a rolled up towel to stabilize it. I guess I could have called the manufacturer to get them like others have.Hard to wipe clean with all the toys attached. Luckily the toys easily detach to resolve this but would have like it better if I could give a quick wipe down without having to dismantle it.Big footprint. This is bigger then I thought it was going to be.Overall, I like the product. The girls like it. I would recommend it.
My mother in law continually told me I needed some kind of Exersaucer or jumper or walker for our baby. I resisted because something about giant plastic toys that claim to help develop your child physically makes me uneasy and smacks of commercialism. The little toys all around the Exersaucer looked so overwhelming to me that I thought they'd cause ADHD. I finally bought this, though, to give my MIL a 'win' since I have a very different parenting ethos, and after some moms I respected mentioned how much their kids loved their Exersaucers.I must admit, my daughter LOVES this toy. She's a large baby and is having trouble rolling over even now at 6 months old despite tons of floor time and 'exercise'. We bought this around 4.5 months, and I think the Exersaucer gave her a taste of physical freedom that she hasn't been able to enjoy on the floor, and reinvigorated her sense of excitement about using her body. She is very good at standing up and bouncing, even if she can't roll yet. She smiles for joy every time we put her in, and mischievously bounces to her hearts content. She loves the little doo-dads all around the edges and turns and reaches for them. I've seen her really start thriving physically since buying this. The first time we put her in she only lasted 5 minutes, and rarely lasts more than 15-20, but she really loves every minute she's in there.It's huge and takes up tons of space in our little condo, but it is worth it. I am a hippie mom, and an Exersaucer convert. Let your child have this guilty pleasure if you're like me and on the fence!
Our 10 month old daughter has been using exersaucers since she was 4 months old. WE used to have to put blankets around her torso to keep her in. She has LOVED using the saucers and it has helped strenghen her legs. She's not yet walking but she's close thanks to the saucers. This saucer is especially fun for our daughter. She loves the toys and doesn't seem to get bored with them. Now that she's a little older and bigger she really bounces herself silly in this thing. I have often wondered if it's going to break but it doesn't. It's very durable. Just becareful not to get any shoeless feet underneath the bottom sides of it while baby is bouncing - OUCH!
I received this as a gift while still pregnant. I didn't think it was that great when i was putting it together. i really wanted the baby einstein activity center, but it was a gift. my son loves this. before he was tall enough to reach things, he would get a bit frustrated. and it was cute watching him react to the noises. now he loves it. he has moved to the 2nd height adjustment, and he bounces away in it. i recommend this product, for sure.
We love this saucer!  We love it because our daughter loves it!  She is very big and strong for her age...we bought this for her and started using it at a little over 4 months!  She has been using it for over 3 months and has lots of fun in in.SUGGESTIONS: We read this from another review...if your child is young...all EVENFLO and ask them to send you the \"stabilizers\" that attach to the bottom of this...it will help it rock and roll a lot less when your baby is younger!  Also, they will try to get you to pay for them OR convince you they are not needed...THAT'S TERRIBLE!  Great product BUT that part isn't great!  The parts probably cost them about 50 cents IF THAT!  Just call and say I Need you to send me the stabilizers to make this product safe...they will!!!
Bought this for my 9 month old daughter to use when we travel to friend's houses or places where we don't want to hold her the whole time.  This keeps my daughter amused for quite a while and allows us some time to relax.  She will probably be too tall for it in a few months but for the time it can used it was worth the price.  This is very easy to put together (no tools needed) and we can transport it very easily (has a convenient carrying handle and is very lightweight)
We started our four month old on solids using these spoons. The longer handles are easy to hold and feed with, the larger end gives mom or dad an easy grip on the spoon.  The spoon head is nice and narrow for little mouths, and is soft and shaped nicely for cleaning up dribble along the way. Although the handles are easier for parents to grip, they do tend to fall out of bowls easily, due to the larger ends.  Also, we noticed after feeing our son orange foods that the edges of the spoons are becoming stained.
These are very good spoons for beginners, I sued since my baby was 4.5 month old. The are soft flexible and not too big for their little mouths.  The long handle is a plus in the beginning as well, but it can also cause the spoons to fall out of the bowl because it is so long. The biggest drawback for me is that after a short period of use, the edges on the back of the spoons start peeling off (the thin layer of plastic or something starts coming off), and I stop using them and buy another set, which is much cheaper at babiesrus by the way. Also, if you use them on like sweet potatoes or carrots, the spoons may change color to an orange hue, not the handles though. All in all, I would recommend it anyway because I found them to be most comfortable spoons, but you need to change them after a while.
I found these at Target about a year ago and they have been our favorite baby spoons.  These are great because they are soft tipped, bend, and are not too wide.  Not good for soups but we're not feeding the baby very liquidy thing.  They are great for baby puree and even for cereal as they hold just enough milk for the little bit of cereal we feed at a time.  Cons are that I had 2 start peeling on the underside so we threw them out and bought more because we didn't like using the other brands.  Another con is that they are heavy on the handle and tend to fall off the plate all the time.  It's very odd and annoying.
I got 3 types of spoons at my baby shower so when it came time to use them i was very excited.  These are by far the best!  I got some Tommee Tippee ones and they were not shaped well for a baby's month at all!  Very happy!
These spoons are soft and gentle on my little ones gums (especially when teething) and they're easy to scoop out whatever is left in the bottom of a container. BUT, they do stain pretty quickly and so I've had to replace them a couple times already.
I am very happy with the purchase.these work great to introduce solids for a 5month old which is why I bought them for. My son dint like any other spoon [I tried couple of them] The flat edge really helps believe me.but the spoon keeps falling off from the bowl as it is a bit long.other than that they work fine.I cannot speak to the wear and tear as I have been using them since a month and so far they are good,been thru dishwasher daily
My baby prefers these to munchkin big time. These are very soft, flexible, and are narrower than most wide-round spoons. It is the best spoon for stage 1 through 3 foods. From stage 3 onward, you may prefer the bigger munchkin kind
There is several things I like about these spoons. The scoop is nice and shallow and makes it easier for baby to clean the spoon with their mouth. It is also soft and flexible and does not hurt baby's mouth, especially when scraping excess food off of her face. The length is great for those containers that have hard to reach areas like those tall baby food jars. I think that they just make a great starter spoon until baby gets better at the deeper scoops.
The long handles are easy to hold.  The nice shape of the spoon is very compatible for baby's mouth (this was the reason I bought these). My complaint is that the soft spoon part changes color after usage.  The plastic on the spoon part also starts to peel off, so we stopped using it.  So the set of 4 spoons lasted a little over 3 months for me before I have to go buy another set.  I'm going to try another brand to compare.
I love the long handle and shape of this spoon.  These spoons are not heat sensitive, but I don't think that feature is helpful on other spoons anyway.  These spoons work great for gently scrapping food off of baby's face and from the inside of a bowl.  They are also a soft plastic for when baby tries to chew on them.  I have not had any issues with staining.
We keep this one clipped to her car seat and it has been a godsend on the way home form many places.  She is loving it more as she gets older (she is 6 months now).  She loves pulling on her hair and her tail.  Great toy for an infant.
bought this for my new baby niece and it is gorgeous, colorful, well constructed and worth the money. happy to have purchased.
We have quite a few of these Lamaze toys and my baby likes the other ones we have better ( peacock is her fave). I don't know if its the texture of the hair that off putting but my daughter really doesn't have that much interest in this toy at all.
This is a great baby toy.  My daughter loves the texture of the hair, which is strips of fabric.  She also really loves the rattling star and the mirror tail.  There is a crinkle patch too but I do wish it were bigger because she loves the crinkle sound on other Lamaze toys.
She isn't what I needed for the age of baby I bought for....When she gets older, I think she will like it.  Lyla was too young at 6 months.
We received this as a gift for our 5 month old daughter and it has quickly become her favorite dangle/chew toy. We attach it to her play mat and she loves grasping it and chewing on the green seahorse. She stares at the face very intently and has been fascinated with it since she got it. Great quality and a cute toy!
We have a lot of colorful toys for our daughter, but this is her favorite. She loves the mirror and the crinkle on the bottom. The face makes her smile. The teether is smooth and just the right size. AND it has a rattle. It's just the right combination of things and is tall enough of a toy to hook on her bouncy seat or the car seat handle for her to look at. We don't leave the house without this toy. I've come back to Amazon to purchase similar toys but I have a feeling this will still be our favorite. What's best is our daughter has a mermaid themed room so it's quite cute. I highly recommend, especially for the price!
We purchased this toy for our 5 month old and she absolutely loves it. There is so much going on with this toy, it entertains her for hours. We strapped it to her caraway, and she loves the teething toy part of it, as well as the mirror on the tail. The bright orange hair she loves to stare at. So many colors and textures, she juat loves it! And it was only $10... I would definitely recommend!
This is really brightly coloured and cute, but our baby just was not interested at all. She much prefers some of the other Lamaze characters in this line. Would recommend because it is a nice toy...just didn't work out for us.
My 5 month old loves playing with he textured hair. I think this is the only one that doesnt have a squeaker. Machine washable. Lots of different textures and colors to keep them entertained for a while. Plus, its just cute.
My daughter loves Jacque the Peacock so it is no surprise that she likes the other Lamaze toys as well, as they are all pretty similar.The dolls hair is fun for baby to feel (each strand is individual, felt like material). In one hand the doll has a starfish which has a rattle inside. In the other she has a plastic teether seahorse. The mermaid's tail is a flexible mirror, with some mirror and crinkle fabric on top.All in all a great interative toy for a newborn. My only small gripes are that the toy is made in China and also that it is surface wash only.
It was given to me as a present and my 4 months old absolutely LOVED it. But soon I started to notice plastic fibers thinner than hair coming out of it (the stuffing I guess). It was very disappointing since I had read that lamaze is one of the few companies that have high quality products, non toxic, PVC free, lead free, etc. They should care also about what is inside the toys or use an exterior fabric with smaller pores!
I bought this doll for my 4 month old daughter. She is fascinated with the hair strands and crunchy tail fin fabric. It is also very cute and colorful.
My little one is 2 months old and she loves it - she smiles every time she sees this little mermaid.
This was larger than I expected. My daughter likes the bright colors and looking at the doll's face. It's a great price for the item.
I LOVE Lamaze toys for young babies. I have Marina as wellcas a couple others for my baby. I started hanging Marina in front of my baby starting at 2 months. At first she just stared at the big eyes in front of her, then started lookin at the different colours like the bright orange hair or yellow sea star on her hand. The first toy my baby ever grabbed for was the little yellow sea star! Now at 4months old, we never leave the house wihout Marina. My baby holds Marina's hair which is a fun wavy felt material, as she sits, and plays with the star rattle. She has also just discovered the mirror on the mermaid's tail and loves looking at herself. She also puts the ring, meant to hang the toy from, in her mouth, as well as the green plastic seahorse. It has been amazing to see my daughter develop socmany skills with just this one toy! Definitely recommend for the baby girl in your life!
My 6 month old daughter loves her mermaid. She got her 2 months ago on Easter and instantly fell in love. She talks and babbles to her whole we ride down the road. She chews on her - the teether fish & the mirror. She loves feeling her hair. I love the crinkling sound in the tail and the rattle in the star fish because I know she is awake while I am driving (I have a severe anxiety about SIDS happening in her car seat or crib). I love that the toy has many bright colors and detaches from the car seat handle easily - not for a baby, I just mean I don't have to wrestle or pry it off. Lamaze wins again!
Love this toy among Lamaze collections.Marina has a lot of features like Freddie the firefly.Great size,good value for money.
purchased this for my grand baby, but this doll is not very cute!Bigger than I expected and I don't care for the fabric used to make this doll.Thinking about sending it back!
My baby lived it carried everywhere with her we would attach it to her stroller and carrier it made her smile and she loved playing with it
Colorfully playful mermaid with a variety of colors and texture for coloration, a rattle and crunchy.  She's a great size and has a clip to take along.  Great for babies exploration.
I bought this for my infant, but my 4 yr old also loves it.  The only issue I had with it was the obnoxious label smack center on her tail.  I spent a solid hour ripping that out.  Now it is perfection.
I bought this little mermaid toy for our daughter who just turned eight weeks old. She always smiles at this toy and it makes her happy. We keep it clipped on to her car seat!
The Lamaze toys are great!  My daughter has the Mermaid, the Peacock, the dog and the Kangaroo.  I would recommend them for any baby.  There is something about the different colors and textures and sounds it makes that keep their attention wonderfully!  I always have one in my car so that it will keep my little girl occupied while we are sitting in traffic.  The mermaid and the Peacock are her favorites!
My little girl loves to chew on the mermaids hair and tail.  It keeps her amused in the car seat for quite a while.  Plus it's cute!
My kid loved it. He played with it until one year.
The people at Lamaze really know what they are doing, this is another wonderful toy for babies. My 3 month old adores this toy and will sit there for quite a while playing with it. It is larger than most of the other toys in their line which is great. My only complaints are that the ring which it hangs from should be removable so that if he wants to hold the toy without it hanging it does not get in the way. Also the rings that the baby plays with are big enough for him to fit his hands/feet through and can get stuck if you are not careful. Overall this is one of his favorites.
From 4 months on, my son has loved this toy (he is now 14-moths). It has provided endless entertainment in the car.
I have several of the Lamaze Play and Grow toys. This is one of the better ones. My baby got this around 4.5 months and is now 6.5 months. The tentacles are nice for chewing on. He really likes the felt feather in the hat. The rings are probably his favorite part of this toy because they are easy to hold and he can chew on them. He's getting better at grabbing the rattle ball. The mirror does nothing for him, surprisingly. Over all, the toy is very cute and kinda reminds me of Captain Jack Sparrow which makes a lot of adults that see it like it as well.As far as comparing it to the other Lamaze Play in Grow Toys we have, I'd probably rank them in this order:1. Jacques the Peacock (excellent toy and perfect length to hang off the side of my diaper bag, I highly recommend)2. Freddie the Firefly (very good length to hang off the stroller visor)3. Captain Calamari4. Tina the Tiger5. Logan the Lion
Baby boy love this toy, he now that it's almost 3 months can show with facial expressions how much he likes it. I put him closer to it and he tries to reach him. It's and awesome toy my baby loves it, it keeps him calm and happy if he's crying.
I already have Jacques the Peacock and my son absolutely loves it so I figured I would get another Lamaze toy, I was quite hesitant to get Captain Calamari because out of all the Lamaze toys it had the least amount of reviews, but my son can't enough of him! I think he actually likes him more then Jacques the Peacock, only because he's a lot easier to grab at, and he bites on the rings.. It is a bit big, but it fits okay in our stroller plus we hang it from our activity mat and he's obsessed with Captain Calamari! Definitely recommend it :)
My son loves this toy.  It is cute and decent sized.  There are quite a few different textures, colors and sounds to keep a child occupied.
So many things to do with this toy- lots of different textures, sounds, colors for him to explore.  This is, by far, his favorite toy.  We hang it above him in the pack and play with &#34;lots of links&#34; to get it down to his level.
We got this for our son. It is a lot bigger than what we expected! We love all the toys on it and it looks and feels very durable. To top it off, it's adorable.
My baby & I was in LOVE withLamaze Play and Grow Rusty the Robot Take Along Toyso of course I had to get her more friends! The captain is such a fun little friend!! I am teaching her about textures right now and he is just too perfect for that lesson!!! She also loves talking to her 1 eyed friend when I hang him on theTiny Love Take-Along Arch, Sunny Strollthat I attached to her rock and play bassinet. I am seriously obsessed with buying all the lamaze toys! I also got herLamaze Early Development Toy, Dee Dee the Dragonand alsoLamaze Play and Grow Jacques the Peacock Take Along Toy
Lamaze products are so cute and colorful. This toy is no exception. i bought it for a freind and her son loves it.
This little toy is adorable and has a great concept, however; my son was never really interested in it so for me it was a waste. that doesn't discredit the quality though.
My 5mth old love this!!I put it on his carseat and take it wherever we go. He loves to chew on the rings and tentacles. It's cute too! It is great for him since he starting to teeth! I will definitely be getting more Lamaze brand items.
My daughter was scared of it at first but now she enjoys chewing his tentacles. The toy is bigger than I expected, the colors are so vibrant and beautiful. Also each tentacle is a different color and pattern. I am very pleased with this product. I love Lamaze toys!!!!
My baby loves this toy. He likes the textures, the rings, the rattle, everything about it. My 9 month old nephew also loves this toy, so it seems like it will be popular with my younger baby for a long time. I would highly recommend this to anyone with a small infant.
This guy is adorable and sturdy. My son loved grabbing and chewing on the tentacles. Now, I buy him for baby showers. Also, cleans up great in the washing machine. (It might say spot clean but yeah, right!)
My BFF gave our little pirate Captain Calimari and immediately he rose to the top as baby's favorite toy by a landslide.  Baby started loving at 2 months and continues to play with at 5 months.  All of the arms made out of many different materials are easy to grasp, some crinkle, and are safe for baby to put in his mouth.  The rings are perfect for little baby hands to grab and in fact I think this is where BB learned most of his eye-hand coordination.  The rattle is just for fun.  Love it, cannot say enough good stuff!  Also love the naming convention, now call ALL our toys \"Junior Jelly\" and \"Sergeant Seahorse\" etc...
Since 3 months, my daughter has been completely in love with this octopus! Best toy purchase I ever made! I was a little hesitant to spend the money on a \"stuffed animal\"... SO GLAD I DID! Worth much more than I paid! Will be getting a second one to keep at my mother-in-law's house now!
This toy is super cute and actually a bit larger than I thought it would be. It holds my sons interest for a while. He loves the two rings and the mirror on the bottom of it. The ball attached makes a rattle noise which is cool. I love how I can hook this to my sons stroller with no problem. Would definitely recommend to a friend.
Captain Calamari is a must have. Plenty of colors, textures, and surfaces to chew on this is the perfect baby toy.
this is more adorable in person. very fun and interactive too. so many noises and different textures. some of the arms and hat makes crinkly noises and when you move captain calamari around you hear the rattle and clunking noises from the 2 teething loops hitting the rattle. now i bought this for my baby and he isn't born yet so not sure how he'll like it so i'll update when he gets here but i've seen some babies on youtube playing w/ him and that's what won me over.
lots of crinkles and doo dads to keep the little guy busy, we hung it from the activity mat until he outgrew that, now its hanging from links in my car...
All the Lamaze toys are great, but I think this one is best because the rings are easy to grab and it has a rattle. She grabs and mouths the rings and the rattle all the time. I've put it on her car seat off to the side so it doesn't swing and hit her in the face, and hung it from the highest point on her baby gym (it's pretty long, so only the highest point works, and I can't put her right under it... I put her to the left or right of it, or so that it dangles over her belly), and she loves it everywhere I put it. I can also put her in a baby seat (like the bumbo) in front of where it hangs on her baby gym, and that works, too.
From the time he was only a few weeks old, up until now (he's 8 months old), our son has been entranced with Captain Calamari.  In the early days he would lie on his back on his play mat and just stare at him.  That eventually moved to batting randomly at his dangling rings & tentacles.  Eventually he learned to grab on to him and now enjoys chewing on the feet and rings that are attached.  The textures on the toy are great because they allow him to explore many different fabrics.  He loves all the different sounds, especially the crinkly one (that has always been a fav!).  This is our go-to toy for him still and it never disappoints!
honestly. this and the giraffe from bright starts. these two car toys and you don't need any of the taggies or the boring kids toys that will ultimately end up wasting your money (totally wasted a few bucks on uninteresting toys, can't you tell?) stick with these two and i promise you, you'll have a happy baby.
Our son DEVOURED his first Lamaze toy (the &#34;knotted&#34; one, without a character), but this one he truly can't stand. Both are terrifically well-made, extremely complex in color, textur
Mr. Calamari ohh how I love this toy! The little ball helps my son go to sleep in the car it's a lifesaver !!! It's a very entertaining  toy for my son.
One of my son's favorite toys which he has steadily played with from 3 months to 2.5 years.  It's durable and easy to clean with a damp cloth.
We bought a very large selection of the lamaze developmental clip toys for our son when he was born.  Captain Calamari is wonderful.  He's much bigger than he looks in the picture.  We were pleasantly surprised and our little boy loves it.
We love this toy in our house. It's cute, it hooks to everything, there are several different kinds of sensory items on it and a mirror. I've purchased a few more Lamaze toys that are similar but I think this is my favorite for all of the variety it has and the plushness.
Captain Calamari has it all! A rattle, rings and crinkly colorful arms! Very cute and one of the better Lamaze toys. My son loves to grab the arms and rings.  Very easy for a baby with developing hand control to play with.
My baby didn't become interested in toys until he was about 3 months old, but he loves these things now.
I would see Lamaze toys prior to having children and didn't really see anything special about them.  My eight month old has loved his Lamaze toys since the beginning, especially Captain Calamari.  He loves to chew and hold onto the Captains tentacles.  I don't know if this is recommended by Lamaze but I toss his Lamaze toys into the washer and let them air dry.  They have washed nicely which makes parents' lives much easier.  I tend to take these with us when we travel or go places because they are so easy to clean.  We have a few different ones (Stretch, Sir Prance-a-lot), so we always have clean buddies. These toys are always much cheaper on Amazon!
My LO loves Captain Calamari.  He smiles and stares at the Captain's face and eagerly chews on each of his legs.  We take the captain everywhere with us because it keeps baby entertained.
I think my husband and I love this as much or more than the babies do. We have twins and they really like this toy better than the Lamaze moose. Captain Calamari is an entertaining toy with a mirror surrounded by several legs, some of which crinkle. The rattle ball that dangles down is very interesting to the babies. They're over a year old now and this toy isn't probably as geared for their age. But, they especially love the mirror and rattle ball.
Someone gave this to us as a gift and it's been a huge hit!  I attach it to my child's stroller (so I don't have to pick it up every time he drops it) and it provides endless entertainment.  I've now purchased a second one for the car.
My son still loves this toy at 16 weeks.  I think the multiple arms are a big pus to my sons enjoyment of this toy.
There's a whole bunch of boys like this in the Lamaze infant toy category and whichever one you buy it's a MUST HAVE! This one in particular I like because you can attach it to your car seat and the legs are very easy to grab for babies tiny hands. The legs are made of diff types of fabric so the baby can get diverse tactile experience plus the rattles and rings attached are fun for the baby to grab and chew on as well. From the moment my baby could follow objects with her eyes, Lamaze toys were the ones she followed and were most engaged in because of it's patterns and bright colors. Now at 5 months I lay this octopus on her lap in the car seat and she loves playing with it. It's forever engaging so I leave this octopus in the car and have the Lamaze worm in the house.
My daughter loves this thing. She shakes it, tries to chew on it. She love Lamaze products. We also have the book as well.
This is a great toy!  There's lot of little things on the toy to stimulate a baby, from contrasting colors, to the rings and crinkly bits, and little tags and reflective surfaces.  We purchased both Captain Calamari and Rusty the Robot for our twins, and the girls' eye light up whenever we show them the toys and play with them with them.  This was my first time with Lamaze toys, and I was very happy with the purchase.  They seem to be great quality, and are very adorable to boot.
It's hard to say who liked this toy more, mom and dad or the baby.  We would hook the ring to the carseat strap for baby to play with while we drove around.  She loved the rings on his legs and the rattle ball.  She managed to get her feet through the rings when she was tiny, too, so be careful of that.  We loved this toy so much we found the corresponding book here on Amazon (you MUST go find that one!  Best book EVER).
My guys likes this toy, but he LOVES Freddie the Firefly.  If you are torn between the two, choose Freddie.  Freddie has been a hit since day 1.  He choose on the tentacles of this toy, but it's just not as well-loved.
I purchased this for my grand baby.However, it's bigger than I expected andI'm thinking about sending it back!
This toy is cute and entertains my newborn.  She likes to stare at him and his bright colors. He makes lots of noise even for infants too small to coordinate their movements.He is on the larger side for a hanging toy and we've had to be creative about where we put him.
I mainly bought this for the adorable name! lol but my 3 month son likes it.  I think it's a good toy for him to grow with.  As he gets older he begins to grab at the tentacles.  The mirror on the bottom is a plus!
My child loooves this toy. We have this one and \"dee dee dragon\" lamaze toys. There are so many great items to keep little hands busy. My daughter is 6months and we never leave home without Capt'n Calamari - her \"traveling buddy\"!
He's so fun- we love him! My ONLY complaint (and it's not even major enough to knock off a star) is that one is his tentacles is a large plastic ball with little balls in it- it's adorable but heavy so it always flops down and in the way of the other tentacles. Baby still loves it though so I guess it's not that big of a deal.
I think we have several of these baby toys. They are very large in size, and give the babies a lot to look and do for something you can take with you practically everywhere. A great addition to any baby gift.
My baby has been entertained by 'Captain Calamari' since he was 2 months. He loves trying out the different legs in his mouth but is especially loving the rings now that he is teething. We don't go anywhere without him!
IS a good toy and good enough to entretain the baby and teach him diff colors.he can bite the rings that have diff textures and the rattle us perfect to call her attention.hat is good n figure keeps her attention.I strongly recommend it
This is a great sensory toy, it's a good size and has a lot of texture and sounds. I would recommend this to someone
I can't leave the house without this thing. My daughter loves her Captain Calamari.  It has many textures and the rings are perfect for teething babies.
so first I bought the robot one and my son loved that so much I decided to buy this cute little octopus pirate he is so detailed, so many bright bold patterns. My son loves chewing on his hook tentacle. This toy keeps him occupied for hours on road trips and shopping in the store I love that it hooks right on the the cart so it does not fall in the dirt.
This little stuffed cephalopod has always entertained my baby daughter since we got him months ago.The legs are lovely to chew on, the hat makes nice crinkly noises when clinched in teeny fists, and the secret mirror between his teNtacles (careful spelling that) is always a happy surprise while slobbering on the plastic teething rings.The Captain is bigger than I expected, making him actually cuddly, which is great.The noises he emits when being played with are never annoying, which is much appreciated.He can entertain both sexes without lacking personality, unlike some gender-neutral toys...I am looking at you Mr. Plain Yellow Duck.I tip my hat to the Captain for allowing me to wash the dishes for a FULL 20 minutes to the sounds of a delighted and entertained baby.
My son enjoyed Freddy more, but this did the job as well, both are great toys and entertain him.  Would recommend it
Sorry to get technical here, but first things first: this guy is an octopus.  8 appendages = octopus.  10 appendages = squid.Okay, now that that technicality is out of the way...This toy is all right.  I'm sure it's just like any other toy--it's going to be a hit or a miss.  With my daughter, it's been a miss.  I bought this thinking I could hang it from her carseat handle, but I wasn't paying attention to the dimensions and it's rather huge to be doing that.  I started exposing it to her around 2 months of age at which point she showed minimal interest.  On an exciting day, she'd suck on the knots on the ends of the legs and that was about it.  She just never got into any of the features or found this toy particularly interesting (she's now over 1 year old).  She loves toys that rattle and make sounds or toys she can gnaw on, but I still could never get her interested in the rings or rattling ball on this toy.Unfortunately, our Captain Octopus remains very lonely buried at the bottom of the toy basket.
I don't know who likes this more, me or my grandson.  We already had the horse and moose for our other grandson so knew these where great toys.  They are durable, colorful, enjoyable.  Lots of fun here.
Captain Calamari is one of our favorite toys! We don't take a trip in the car or stroller without him! With so many different items hanging off of his legs and his crinkly cap, he keeps our baby entertained for hours. She loves chewing on all of the different items, even his hanging hook! Would definitely recommend!
The Captain is a terrific toy, despite the fact that with eight tentacles it's clearly an octopus.  It is by far my nine month old's favorite toy.  It is big enough to snuggle, it crinkles, it rattles, has a mirror and various toys dangling from its appendages, and is (apparently) a great chew toy. She has multiple similar Lamaze toys, all of which are nice but this is the best one.
I'm a baby toy skeptic but this cute little guy is pretty nifty.  It keeps my 4 month old occupied for 10 minutes or so which is a minor miracle.  Cute and well-made.
I ordered this along with the elephant and the beaver, I am returning this one and the beaver but keeping the elephant.  The reason I ordered 3 is because we have one already I believe it is the butterfly one which my 5 month old loves.  This guy is cute and that is about it, once we got it out of the packaging there really isn't much for the baby to play with, nothing really for him to pull on.  When you attach it to the carseat, crib or stroller all the \"entertainment\" just kind of hangs there and really there isn't much to it.  I was very disappointed with it because it is so cute.  I would definitly reccommend the elephant and the butterfly one becaues they do have things to keep a child entertained.
my baby loves this octopus.... there's a mirror between the legs that he looks at and it is colorful and has lots of different rings and parts for him to play with an explore. we love all the animals in this line (we have the inchworm, dragonfly, and moose too). would definitely recommend.
My infant loves gnawing on the knots the arms have.  I like all the colors.  Dislike the labeled hat, but that one was actually easy to rip out.
This is a wonderful toy for an infant! It was my older daughter's favorite and I'm sure my 5 month old will love it just as much. The legs are perfect for teething babies to chomp on and there is plenty to keep a baby busy. The hat makes crinkly noises, the rings clack together, the ball rattles, there are plenty of legs to chew on, and theres even a little mirror hidden on his underside. I know it says surface wash but we have tossed it in the wash in a lingerie bag on gentle cycle and even dried it on low for a little while and it came out good as new.
I registered for this toy based on great customer reviews and I have not been disappointed! My son is now 8 months old and this toy has kept him busy everyday for long periods of time for the last several months. He loves all the different parts of the toy -the rings, the ball, mirror, and tentacles -its all fun to put in his mouth! I bought this toy for the last baby showers I went to since it is a must-have toy!
We received Freddie the Firefly as a baby shower gift and my baby started playing with it at about 4 weeks old so I decided to buy more Lamaze toys to hang in his playgym.  I purchased Captain Calamari and Logan the Lion.  Captain is clearly the winner as my 8 week old baby spends a lot of time looking at and hitting it.  Logan gets 2-3 minutes of attention, if that.  There is just so much more action to Captain with the crinkly noises, squishy tentacles and noisy rattle. Baby loves the sounds and I love Captain for helping baby with hand-eye coordination as well as giving me at least 30 minutes to have breakfast in peace.
Lots of colors, the little orange piece with the little beads in it to rattle and basically hit things with is a winner with my 9 month old :-)  Lots of different textures and the 2 teething rings get a lot of play as well.  Very nice toy that's easy to take along if need be.
Very colorful and full of texture and noises!!!!Has a mirror and things to grab on.Love this little pirate :)
I gave this as a baby gift, but had many of the Lamaze Early toys for my own daughter when she was a baby. They are colorful and really get the little one's attention. Great for hooking on strollers or car seats.
I have made a habit of ordering Lamaze toys for my daughter. She greatly enjoys this (as an astrological water dragon) but something about it makes it feel of slightly lesser quality than the typical Lamaze. Perhaps developed for another country?
I was so in love withLamaze Play and Grow Rusty the Robot Take Along Toythat I immediately had to buy my baby girl more friends to play with! Dee Dee is so freaking cute with her dorky teeth and colorful body! She is not quite as educational as Rusty but I think Dee Dee will be just as fun for her to grow with and be BFF's with in the end!BTW we now have addedLamaze Early Development Toy, Captain Calamari] and [[ASIN:B000I2MRLK Lamaze Play and Grow Jacques the Peacock Take Along Toyto the crew!!!
This Dragon is very CUTE !!! My baby loves it even i love it too : )  Easy to take along w you ... i even bought Prince Lance, Princess Sophie, and the Story Book for them : )
My daughter was born in The Year of the Dragon, inspiring a dragon theme in her nursery. Because there is not a lot of baby dragon items out there, I purchased this dragon toy to go with the &#34;theme.&#34; At 9 months, she still plays with this toy, as I have it attached to her car seat.
We bought a very large selection of the lamaze developmental clip toys for our son when he was born and Dee Dee was the one he gravitated the most to.  She's a beautiful pink and her wings crinkle loudly.  Her legs are a fuzzy felt and she has a great little rattle.  Her tail has a piece of reflective paper in it but you really can't see anything when you look at it.  She was a great addition to the collection.
Our 6mo baby girl loves her Lamaze dolls, they're the perfect size for her to handle and have all the features she enjoys: they have bright colors, bitable bits, and crinkle when she handles them, this one even has a little mirror on it's tail.
my son loved this toy. He especially loved the rattle ball the dragon is holding. Unfortunately he ripped the ball from the dragon's hand. We kept the rattle ball around for several more months because he still played with it. Now my daughter plays with this toy.
My baby loves this!  He likes all the different textures and colors and will play for ten minutes at a time (that's forever for a six-month-old) with his dragon.  I often worry about fabric toys' stitching but despite being gnawed on for months it is still sound.
Our daughter loves Dee Dee. The crinkle wings and mirror tail keep baby entertained. Also, the attachment ring is great for connecting to plastic rings to use when out with baby.I did have one big issue however. The rattle that is attached to the dragon's right hand is made of rather hard plastic. Also, (as you can see in the pictures) the edges of the rattle are dull, but mirror a 'spiked' rattle. My biggest worry was that like most babies, my daughter would grab this toy and swing it back and forth as she plays and perhaps hit herself in the eye/face/head. I can tell you that the plastic rattle ball attached to Dee Dee is hard enough that if that happened it would definitely leave a mark and cause some tears. I was concerned enough that I actually cut the string attaching the rattle portion to Dee Dee to avoid any possible self inflicted injuries.
I'm not sure what the big deal is with these Lamaze take-along toys. They are pretty cheap looking, and my baby was not particularly interested in it either. She mostly just chewed the mirror, which caused the reflective coating to scratch off. Yuck. There are better toys out there. We prefer lovies or soft books for the car. Tiny Love also makes excellent stroller bars that are way more fun for about the same price.
Not able to find this locally but was shipped from the UK and arrived in 4 days!  My son was born the year of the dragon and loves the other Lamaze toys.  He loves this one as well.  Safe for children under 1.
Too big for car seat - works okay to dangle from a swing. Doesn't jitter or pull down which was the point for me.
I got Dee Dee the Dragon for my daughter for Christmas. She really like it. There are really good sensory features like crinkles, mirrors, rattles etc. and it's also really soft and cute.
This is the first toy that my daughter grabbed and liked. I sort of had to get it at that point. It's really cute, we named him 'Ruffles' because he has ridges on his belly. The only cons about this toy is the ring at the back of his neck is starting to come un-stitched and secondly, this toy is not washable in the washing machine, it's damp cloth wash only. That doesn't exactly help when your daughter projectile vomits up 8oz of formula all over the toy. The felt just doesn't look the same. Overall I'm happy with it because my daughter loves it.
Super cute, not too big, not too small.  Wasn't sure what size to expect when I ordered it, I didn't read the fine print, but this is just the right size for a little one that can start to hold things.  Has the noisy tissue inside the wings, an attached rattle, can be attached to a crib, car seat, etc.  Very nice colors and seems to be me made of high quality material.  I bought this for my not yet born baby girl, it was too cute to pass up....this being the year of the dragon.  She won't get to play with it for some time, but having had other kids, I can safely bet this will be a favorite.
The dragon has a rattle that hangs from the hand....originally I really liked all the features but when baby is shaking the toy vigorously this rattle turns into more of a mace and hits really hard. We had to cut it off for safety reasons. After we cut it off we love the toy. The mirror on the tail is my daughters favorite component....I just feel that I shouldn't have to butcher a toy to make it safe.
I love Lamaze toys in general. I think this company makes high quality and well designed toys and offers them at fair prices. This is how my little one entered the world of toys. We have dee-dee dragon, captan calamari, octopus and various other small soft toys from lamaze. We put them close to my son's bed a few weeks after he was born. You can also attach them to the crib or the stroller using the top white circle which is a plus.It took a month or so for my son to show interest to these colorful toys. This is probably because of the fact that newborns can only see, black-white and red properly until they get a few months old. But after that he really enjoyed playing with this one and the other lamaze toys. There are many different colors and each part feels different to touch (rough, smooth, squeaky or fluffy...) Besides it has a rattle (the purple ball like thing it holds). So it offers audiovisual plus tactile stimulation.For proper brain development, experts recommend offering as many age-appropriate stimulus as you can and that helps smooth integration to the surrounding world too. Apart from the rattle bit and the white circular bit, which is rounded,  there is no hard plastic, so it is very unlikely that a baby can hurt himself while playing with that.It is easy to clean and it should be cleaned often. I have tried surface rubbing with vinegar for routine cleaning and besides that every once in a few months I put it in washing machine (inside a T-shirt or sweater) and I have not experienced any damages at all (I have High efficency machine).There are toys, one would like to keep it as memorabilia of his/her baby's first days, this one can be a good candidate for that spot.
This keeps my little one busy during my thirty minute commute.I love that it clips on the car seat handle and the stroller.
This was so cute.  My daughter loved playing with this.  I would attach it to her carrier. It would be a great gift for a baby shower.
Love all the different textures on this product! I hung it on the play mat and my baby loves to grab and shake it. Received just what I ordered.
Love this product nice size, colorful with a variety of textured for baby to enjoy, crunchy, rattle and comes with a take along clip.
My baby did not start grabbing toys early. We have been waiting while trying to teach him to reach out to a bunch of colorful toys. None of them had him interest enough to really reach out for. This pink little dragon was given at baby shower and it was the one that my baby like the most. He would stop crying when we shake it in front of him in the car. And guess what, it was the first toy he ever had enough interest to reach out and explore (4 months old). I was really glad. After that for days before he started grabbing on other toys solidly. I will buy another Lamaze soft toy today!
Dee Dee is adorable. I love her and my daughter does too! I have the princess and the moose too. All are equally adorable but each are a little different so it's fun to change them up. Easy to take with us and to play with at home. I would highly recommend the dragon!
My 2 month old loves it.  I hang it on her swing and she stares and smiles at it all the time.
She smiles every time she sees her dragons toothy grin. She likes her Sir Prance a Lot, and the Peacock, too, but the Owl wasn't impressive, apparently.  Lamaze toys are the best!
I have a few other lamaze toys and this one is one of her favorites. She loves the mirrored tail and chews on the tail constantly. We did however have to cut the ball off of it, she managed to hurt her eye swinging it around and I didn't want to chance her getting hurt again. Other than that we love it.
The first infant toy we purchased for our son four years ago was Lamaze's Freddie Firefly. He and we loved it so much that Sir Prance A Lot is the first toy we purchased for our new daughter. We also bought some other Lamaze plush toys, and they're all fantastic. Simple, safe, but very novel for infants exploring their senses. Highly recommend
Lots of different textures and sounds. Keeps my son entertained in the car and my older daughter plays with it too!
My 3 1/2 month old loves this toy the best. She loves to grab his feet and put them in her mouth. It isn't too long that it doesn't fit on other play gyms.  THat is a problem I have found with some of the Lamaze toys. I wish there were more like Sir Prance A Lot. Plus I love the name!
My 5 month-old daughter LOVES this toy.  If you hold it from the ring at the top, it can function like a marionette puppet. We also have the firefly and the peacock, but this one is her favorite.  It's a gorgeous, well-constructed, and stimulating toy.
Out of all the very many toys I researched and ordered for my infant grandbaby, this one was the Best! She loved it the most out of all the crib hanging toys. It goes every where baby goes! It's a great toy for crib, car seat, stroller, walker and every place in between. It has been easy to keep clean and sanitize. The toy has held up to alot of usage and still looks new. We have had no safety issues with this toy. I highly recommend it and glad I bought it.
this is great, I have it hooked on the play yard and it gets played with a lot. You can also attach it to a car seat.
My 3mo son has been in love with Sir Prance A Lot since he first laid eyes on it, a few weeks old.Now that he's strong and agile enough to do so, he'll spend 10-15 minutes sitting peacefully, shaking the toy, licking it, eating the crinkly feet, sucking on the helmet feather. We love this toy!
My son loves all of his Lamaze toys - we have Captain Calamari, Stretch, and Sir Prance A Lot.  He is almost 9 months and has been playing with them from the beginning.  I don't know if this is recommended by Lamaze, but I toss them in the washer and let them air dry.  They are super easy to clean which makes them great to take in the car or on trips.  These toys are always much cheaper on Amazon.
My daughter has two Lamaze toys and she loves both of them.  Sir Prance A Lot is very cute and she especially likes the tail rings.
i have no comments that could take away from these Lamaze toys.all of the different sensory points on this one is great - squeaker in the knight, crinkle & stripes in the hooves, jingle in the head, tags all over, and rings that clang together (and according to my baby are wonderful to chew on) make this such a useful developmental toy!we also purchased Jacques the Peacock and Eddie the Elephant who i had hoped my baby would've enjoyed because they were all so cute but this horse was his favorite.
Our 6mo baby girl loves her Lamaze dolls, they're the perfect size for her to handle and have all the features she enjoys: they have bright colors, bitable bits, and crinkle when she handles them, got her a Dragon + Princes + Knight set and she loved them!
After reading such great reviews, I ordered this toy for my 6 month old son.  He initially played with it quite a bit, although mostly chewing on the rings.  After a week, he still plays with it, but not any more than his other toys.  I have to admit, I was hoping he would play with this a lot more.  It's still a nice toy though, very bright colors, and the perfect size for little hands.
My son is very curious and I had hoped something about this would appeal to him but it was very base and he really does not even pay attention to it, unfortunately. It is cute enough and well made but it just does not attract my child.
All Lamaze toys have been fun, colorful and entertaining for our little one.
PURCHASED THIS FOR A LITTLE BOY THAT HAS A COWBOY THEMED NURSERY. HE LOVES THIS TOY. I'M A BIG FAN OF ALL THE LAMAZE TOYS BUT THIS ONE IS SUPER CUTE!!!
My son is just now getting really into toys, and this is one of his favorites! It is so cute and has a lot of entertaining variety - crinkly, different fabrics, the rings on the tail are different textures, the little knight squeaks... He loves it, and it is nice that it travels well and is such good quality!
My 3-month old baby loves looking at this horse, grabbing it, putting it in his mouth.Well made, looks great. We both love it :)
I would love to buy all the Lamaze products, they are great for babies... My son loves it, it's the perfect toy to take
My grandson's favorite toy. Reasonably priced and shipped quickly.
This is one of the best 12 bucks I have ever spent in my life. My baby simply adores this toy. I never thought he will hang on to any toy for so long. It has been 4 months since I got this my baby is 7 months now and this is still his favorite. The designer of the toy has been so thoughtful of the colors, patterns, fabric material etc so well. My baby has got amused with every little thing dangling from the toy even today. He looks at it as if he is looking at it for the very first time. Love it when I see my baby get amused.
This has become my son's absolute favorite toy! He started out with the crinkling feet when he was just a few weeks old and still loves to chew on the rings on the tail now that he's nearly 8 months old. It goes with him everywhere and keeps him entertained on car trips.
Once more, a terrific product from Lazame.  Their baby toys are so colorful and fun for little ones.  They fit to well over the handles of car seats, strollers, carriers.  This one has lots of chewies on the tail and the 'knight' is in a perfect place for a young baby to grab easily.  The feet make crinkly noises which my grandbaby loves and the tags on the saddle entertain him for ages.
I wanted to like this toy, but it's a little disappointing, and my 6 mo old agrees.  It's big and squishy, but the only squeaker is in the knight, and it's really quiet and hard to squeak.  The head has a big hard spot that makes a jingle when you shake it, the body just krinkles like the feet.  There's not enough variety in this toy to be stimulating.  It needs a big squeaker like in Jacque the Peacock.  My baby LOVES that one, which has all that this toy has, and more: Contrast patterns on the back, with bright colors on the front, A good face with big eyes (The horse's eyes are one on each side), a good squeaker, and layers of reinforced krinkle for good chomping.
Love how small this product folds into so it's not such a huge ball to carry around.  Would definitely recommend.
The color of this is so much better than the others out there.  I use it all the time and the quality is great.  I don't recommend drying it, it can shrink a little.  It fits very well on costco carts and every other cart except Target.  It tends to slip off on those but they are really huge.  Easy to use and doesn't look ridiculous when carrying it into the store.  Would have given it five stars but it is really expensive.  Worth it for the style and quality, but pricey.
This cover did not fit the Target carts well. The back of the cover was stretched pretty tight, and one corner kept popping off, which of course my baby decided he needed to investigate. There also isn't very much padding so there's a lot of empty space in the seat area. Fortunately, since my son is only 8mos old and still a little unstable while sitting on his own, my husband and I just take off our coats and nestle him in the center, allowing him to be propped up and not able to reach the exposed cart area. Other than Target, it seems to fit other area store shopping carts well. We haven't used it as a high chair cover yet, but we don't eat out very often. We bought this mostly because our son is still putting everything in his mouth and we didn't want him getting any unnecessary illnesses with this flu epidemic going around. It's still easier to place him in his bucket seat into the shopping cart rather than using the cart cover, but this will come in handy when he's bigger, so we decided to try it out. The most ANNOYING aspect of this product is the crazy way it folds into itself. You will NEVER be able to fold it back the way it was when purchased. Sorry. It's a fact. We've resorted to semi-folding then STUFFING it in and by then, it doesn't make a very small pouch at all.  Overall, not bad, I wouldn't pay full retail price for it though.
I love this cover. I've used it at Target, Publix, and in several high chairs. It has been fabulous for all of them. The material washes really well. I love the loops on which I can hang my son's toys too. The Brown Berry is a perfect gender neutral fabric. I was going to get a Boppy cart cover and couldn't find one that looked non-girly.
This is a perfect shopping cart cover. Easy to use, awesome, sturdy built in seat belt that will grow well with her. The TOY LOOPS are the best part!! Honestly, the only thing I would add would be a teensy extra padding. Although, that would likely make it far to bulky to take to stores and restaurants.
i started looking around for shopping cart/high chair covers as soon as my LO started sitting up well and decided to go with the balboa baby for the nice quality fabric and cute prints. i'll start with the pros...1. the fabric is a really nice quality thick, quilted fabric with really rich colors. the quilting provides a little cushioning as well. i think they found the right balance so it's thick enough to provide some padding but will fold up in a compact enough package.2. i love that it folds up into its own little pouch. it goes inside out so you keep the side that touches your baby away from the side that touches the gross carts. the pouch also has a little carry strap--really really useful when you're carrying a baby and a million other things. i clip the strap of the cart cover onto my diaper bag bc the pouch itself is a bit big to fit inside the diaper bag.3. it has 2 little toy loops so when your LO throws his favorite toy or teether, it won't fall on the dirty floor.4. let's not forget the real reason we all love this cover... the prints are really really cute. i got the stripes--it looks very henri bendel--but the floral prints are very pretty too. they also hide stains pretty well.the cons:1. the wide waist strap is nice but it's really annoying when taking your baby out of the high chair. even when i undid the velcro (which is a really nice quality velcro by the way), the whole cover came off along with my child bc the waist strap got stuck around his legs. my 6 month old can't sit in one spot for a whole meal so i'm constantly picking him up and putting him back in the high chair, so this was a little annoying.2. it's pricey for a shopping cart cover. but i haven't seen any covers that are much less expensive and fold up into its own pouch.it doesnt come with any instructions but it's easy to fold neatly into the pouch:1. flip it inside out so the side touching your baby is inside and fold the cover in half so the 2 elastic ends are aligned. make sure the cover is flat, with the pouch side away from you.2. fold the sides in, a little past the pouch edge. this is going to give you a little extra room to flip the pouch part over the cover.3. the cover should look tall and skinny now. start from the bottom and fold up into thirds (2 folds going up).4. flip inside out into the pouch and close with the velcro.
I love this cover!  We use this cover in shopping carts everywhere and high chairs when out to eat.  It doesn't really pad anything.  So when my son throws himself around the shopping cart seat when he gets sick of sitting, he may bump his head on the cart.  But it at least gives a little cover to the metal or plastic germy cart.  And for me the seat belt on it is useless, but it sometimes gives my son something to play with or chew on.  It's easy to fit on carts and washes up well.
The  shopping cart cover works well and is well made. It does slip off the larger carts but works well on carts at Walmart, etc.
I'm glad I got this color in suri. The color is more aqua than blue which I love because its more gender neutral. I also have Balboa Baby nursing cover and really love the quality that I decided to get the cart cover as well. I got this more for high chairs than for cart and its awesome! The stitching is sturdy, the fabric is great quality, washes well, and all folds into a compact pocket. I use it daily and couldnt be happier with the choice.
Great product. It will take some time to be able to use it with one hand, but it covers the whole seat, and is super cute.
I love this gender neutral print and it works great. I also like that this folds into a bag when you are not using it.
There is no perfect shopping cart cover out there. I've tried a few now.  This one works reasonably well for most of the places we shop at. It works best on the traditional wire grocery carts- the fit is good and the belt can be threaded through the back of the seat. It's also well suited for plastic carts that have a wire seat back- like the ones at Buy Buy Baby or Bed Bath & Beyond.It's ok for the big plastic carts at Target. It's a tight fit, and the elastic on the cover pulls the seat back forward. That said, when my daughter is in a Target cart without the cover, she pulls the seat back forward on her own. I strap her in fairly snug, and she leans forward, pulling the seat back with her. Since this seems to be her preferred way of sitting in the cart she doesn't seem to mind or notice when the elastic on the cover pulls the seat back forward. You can't really use the cover's strap with the Target carts- the velcro is too stiff to let you thread the strap through the plastic mesh of the seat back.I haven't tried it on the Costco carts, but I highly doubt it could stretch that much. Conversely, I haven't tried it as a high chair cover for restaurant high chairs because it will be way too baggy.The biggest feature it has in its favor is that it is relatively easy (compared to other cart covers I've tried) to slip it on the cart with one hand while hanging onto the baby with the other arm. It also washes well and doesn't show dirt very easily- we live in California where the shopping carts are often stored outside the stores, so they can get a bit dusty. This cover does the job of keeping baby's clothes clean and free of that dust.Overall it's not my favorite baby product, but it does its job reasonably well.
The design is as pictured. It fits well over all carts I've used so far. Also, it's small enough to shove in a diaper bag/purse. Only issue is that when I washed it ran onto white onsies and turned them a little pink, so wash seperatly. Washes well. Best part is the velcro. ALL velcro should be like this. It's not scratchy. I encourage you to watch the video or read the instructions about how to use the velcro belt. It's not really self-explanatory.
The seat belt in this cover is half the reason I like it. It seems so much more secure than the ones that come with carts or high chairs because I can fasten it around his lower back instead of down on his thighs. It has fit into every cart and high chair I've tried, although, I will do more shopping (for science!) to test it out. The internal harness is key, it anchors the baby's core to the cart/chair very well. Yes, the fabric cover is nice because those things are filthy and with this, at least it's just our own germs (I'm not going to wash it every day.) For now the velcro seems secure, but the hooks are itty bitty (like a cat tongue) and I have no idea how they manage to hold (but they do)! Magic! I think the fabric looks much nicer in person. The only real bummer is that there's not any padding - and basically you're still dealing with a metal shopping cart covered by a pillowcase... so, when little guy bonks his head on the cart, it's still pretty hard. I shall cram stuffed animals in around him for the time being. I see this being big enough to grow with us. I would buy this for a mom-to-be, even though she won't need it until like 7-8 months. Once you have it, you're glad. It was a relief to find this among the bazillion choices, and for all my research and worrying to be over.
I did some research when looking for a cart cover since there were so many pros and cons on this type of item.  I wanted one that would hold up in washing and also fit a lot of different store carts.  This one came in a wonderful selection of fabrics; other reviews for the Balboa were very favorable and the clincher for me was that it fit the larger carts at a lot of the stores I frequent.  I even managed (with some work) to get it to fit a Sam's Club cart.  I've used it several times now in restaurant high chairs and in shopping carts and I am very pleased. It's easy to use and easy to pack back in it's storage pocket.  I've only washed it once but it appears to hold up well after being washed and dried.  Time will tell.
After looking at so many different shopping cart/high chair covers, we decided to go with the Balboa cover.  Excellent choice!  The cover is really well made, very easy to put on, stays put and comfortable enough for baby to sit on.  There is no padding but the fabric is thick enough to provide adequate comfort while shopping.  We also use the cover at restaurants which has made life so much easier for us.  No need to use a ton of antibacterial wipes to clean high chairs first.  Just put on cover and that's it.  We use it a few times and machine wash it.  The cover folds into a small purse-like shape which is very convenient for storing.  We just keep it in our trunk and use it as needed.
I am very pleased thus far with this cart cover. It is nice construction and seems to fit snug and secure. My little one was very happy to be riding in the card. I received many compliments. I have had this all folded up with a couple of loops on the toy loops with no problem. It makes securing a few toys that much easier as we are on the go. He has loved sitting in the carts and having toys to play with. The only con to this cover in my eyes are the inability to put this on one handed. I have tried several times. Because it will fit so snug and secure, you really need both hands. So this makes it impossible to put on and hold your kiddo. If you are able to grab a cart outside and put it on at your car, then no problems...but if you have to go inside and put it on by yourself...good luck. But all in and all, I really would recommend this cover. I can live with needing the help to get it on....
I watched this item for several months and hesitated ordering it because of the reviews stating that it was to small for Target shopping carts. In March 2012 I noticed some new colors were available so I decided to give it a try. When I received the box it had a sticker on it that read - \"New & Improved Larger Size.\" I brought it to Target and it fit the cart with plenty of room to spare. So far I'm very happy with it.I've posted photos of the box and the cover on a Target shopping cart in the customer photos section.
Way more durable, padded, and attractive than others I have seen. Great purchase for a girl or boy. Also doesn't show dirt or spills.
I LOVE this cover!!!  I got it in Suri and its beautiful!  It fits really well (although, I am still learning how to use it and can't imagine being able to put it one one handed.  Maybe after I'm a pro with it?) and is of good quality.  Fits shopping carts really well.  I've used it on the smaller carts at Whole Foods and the standard size carts at Safeway (curious if it fits the really large carts at Costco??).  I've also tried to use it on high chairs at a couple restaurants but they were the plastic ones and didn't have an open/slotted back so I couldn't fasten the seat strap.  I'm so happy I have this because there have been some recent articles about how there is more fecal matter found on the grocery cart and public high chair than in their bathroom!  Gross!!  Makes sense though.  They never clean them or the straps!! This is a definite MUST HAVE!
I really wanted to like this cover, especially since it was more expensive than most...Pros:- Nice fabric- well made- holds up well with washing- love that it can be used over high chairsCon:- It doesn't fit over most shopping carts (ex. Target, Costco).  When I was sold the product, I was told it would fit, even the costco double carts. We pretty much use it as a high chair cover only now.I recommend going with a different brand.
I am glad that we paid a little more for this cart cover, the Balboa Baby is exactly what we were looking for.  So far it fits all carts including Target, HEB grocery, Wal Mart and Costco.  It fits a bit snug on larger carts but still works well.  We also used it on a restaurant high chair and it worked wonderfully.  I love the design and it definitely lives up to our standards.  Tried and true, baby does not touch the cart at all.I definitely recommend this cover to anyone who is willing to pay a little more for a cart cover.  We love it!
So far, so good. We just got this and have used it a couple of times. It goes on a cart very easily. The strap took me a minute to figure out but once I figured it out it works great...our baby isn't exactly sitting up on his own yet but this props him up nicely. Fabric is cute. I wish there had been some instructions that came with it...like how to fold it back up in it's neat little pouch or how to operate the strap. It would have helped me and saved me some time.
I bought this brand of cart cover specifically for how small it folds up into itself. It is small enough to put in our large diaper bag. The only complaint I have is that there were no instructions on how to fold it up for storage. I looked online and couldn't find anything there either. I would highly recommend that when you receive this, open it up carefully and study the way the manufacturer had it folded up. It fits on all the high chairs in restaurants I have been to and it fits over the shopping carts at Kroger. I am very happy I opted for this cover.
now that baby girl is sitting up, this is exactly what we needed! she is so much happier at the grocery store and in restaurants now that she has a place to sit and can see everything.  and the shopping cart cover makes me happy since it covers up all the germy surfaces.  the toy loops are also genius! i highly recommend this cover.  (note, i haven't tried it at Costco yet, but it's fit my grocery store (publix) & target carts perfectly so far)  great product!UPDATE: fit the cart at costco :)
I feel like I must have read every shopping cart cover review available on Amazon before finally deciding on the Balboa baby shopping cart cover.  Sure they all cover the shopping cart, the differentiating factor I kept looking for was how well they strap baby in to the cart.  We have an Eddie Bauer shopping cart cover with a 5 point harness that looks great. The problem is the harness attaches only to the cover and not securely to the cart.  After watching the little guy slump over (@5 months old) repeatedly I gave up on it.  It certainly wouldn't have been safe once he reached climbing phase.Enter the Balboa Baby Shopping Cart Cover and I love it.  I was immediately impressed with the quality of the fabric.  The material is a heavy duty, quilted fabric yet it is very soft. It looks like it will hold up to years of baby wear and washings.  My favorite part of the Balboa cover is the strap.  It is a T strap that attaches between the leg holes of the cover and then has 2 long sides.  Each end of the strap feeds thru a reinforced slit in the back of the cover, thru the bars at the back of the cart seat and then the ends velcro together.  The strap itself is about 3\" thick so it won't cut into baby's skin.  The velcro is that high quality, newer velcro (I have no idea what it is called) that doesn't fuzz up with repeated use.As some other reviewers have mentioned the elastic banding around the edge is pretty tight and it can even slightly collapse an empty shopping cart seat, but I'm happy with it because that means the little one can't pull the edges off.Overall, great shopping cart cover.  Extremely high quality materials and the safest way to strap baby into the cart that I came across.  It has fit every cart I have used so far - Target, Walmart, grocery stores and even those stores that put an advertisement on the back of the seat.
This is a nice quality material that fits nicely on high chairs and standard shopping carts.  If the maker added a stretchy band of material (in the back maybe?) so it would fit the huge shopping carts of the world it would definitely earn 5 stars.  The 'seatbelt' is very substantial and toy loops and pockets are great additions.  Not sure if it is really worth paying twice as much as other covers but I am happy with
My son is not happy unless he can see what is going on around him. Normally, he is pretty fussy during our shopping trips because he has to lay in his car seat. The BALBOA BABY shopping cart cover solved that problem for us. He just learned to sit up, so he is still a bit wobbly, but with the extra wide safety strap he was able to sit in the cart. He had a great time & didn't make a peep, I was able to get all my shopping done, and the best part is that it was all GERM-FREE!!!!Not only does this product keep your shopping cart germ-free, it also works as a Restaurant High Chair Cover. It is a must have, especially during flu-season, because let's be honest....how many restaurants actually wipe down their high chairs? I don't leave my house without this!! I use it EVERY day. And I get so many compliments on it.I LOVE LOVE LOVE this Cover!!! It is a necessity for anyone who has a baby or toddler!
I LOVE this cover. I take it with me everywhere I go with my son. I was given an Eddie Bauer cover for my shower but it didn't work at all! This one will fit al shopping carts including target and publix. It's also really really great for putting over high chairs. It's not complicated AT ALL. Highly recommended.  Best on the market. Worth the extra money.
I did a lot of research before purchasing a shopping cart/highchair cover.  I wanted one that would do both things and that i wouldn't have to struggle with to get on and off, a difficulty that would be multiplied by having to do it while holding a baby. This cover is easy to use and very cute as well.  I love the pattern and have received many compliments on it.  An added bonus is that using this makes me feel safer as it holds my daughter more securely and comfortably than the straps on the high chairs and shopping carts themselves.  I definitely recommend this item to everyone who has a baby they want to keep clean and safe!
This cover is fabulous! It fits on most shopping carts and high chairs, washes beautifully, and folds into a compact pouch. I'm so happy with this purchase!
i have both the sling and shopping cart cover and no other company compares in quality. This cover has fit every shopping cart with the exception of babies r us, go figure. Belt sits high up on chest/waist and i love that it creates a sort of pod in the center. i was worried when i was shopping around since my son wasnt quite steady sitting up on his own of him falling sideways. The combination of the secure belt and seating area it was never an issue. 4 Stars is because my husband recently threw it in the dryer which i NEVER would do because i love this cover too much to risk it, but of course it shrunk and i was so disappointed it did not fit the Target cart which it always had in the past. So sad.
We have had our cover for nearly a year and a half and it still gets used numerous times each week. We love the fact that it keeps our daughter's hands off of dirty shopping cart handles! Although it took a few times to get the hang of putting the cover on with one hand while holding my daughter in the other, it quickly became second nature. I love that it wraps up and velcroes, making it very convenient to either tuck in the car or the diaper bag. The print is adorable and the cover has held up extremely well. I frequently have people comment on how great this cover looks. The only drawback is that it has no padding and doesn't provide any cushion in the cart basket. When my daughter was little I would simply tuck a blanket around her to help to keep her propped up and provide some cushion. Would definitely buy this cover again.
Just received the cover in the mail and our first stop to use it was Costco. It was easy to figure out how to put it on and I was even happier that it fit the cart well. It was a bit tricky figuring out how to secure him in, but once we did it worked great. Much better than our Eddie Bauer cart cover. Also, must add that the brown and white stripe is much cuter in person. I suggest a print because when you feed him, sometimes the food stained and with the stripes, it hides them.
I love this super cute shopping cover, in the Lola print.  It works great on high chairs and shopping carts.  Best part is it washes really easily and it folds up into a small square for carrying.Bottom line- buy it!
With my twins I had two Eddie Bauer shopping cart covers that tied to the cart and had a harness built in. After a few years of use they were looking very faded, and with our new addition (a little girl) I wanted something pretty and new.  I did a fair bit of research and decided to give the balboa a try. #1 It was beautiful #2 it was much quicker to put on, since I didn't have to tie it on the cart.For the first few months, it was fantastic.  It was clean, cute and quick to put on and gave my daughter a little more freedom as compared to the moby or her infant seat.  As she got more mobile (around 10 months) she started trying to climb out and twist around, causing the sides to constantly pop off, which defeats the purpose of creating a barrier between her and the germy cart.We have used this countless times at restaurants and it has been wonderful.  It is oversized, so even when she twists and wiggles, the sides don't pop off.For now, I wish that I had kept the ugly, but functional eddie bauer harness cover for shopping trips into toddler hood, and use the balboa strictly for restaurants, or when traveling, since it folds up nicely and does provide a barrier some of the time in shopping carts.If you have a wiggly kiddo, unfortunately you really need the harness straps.
Every mom must have this product!  It makes shopping with baby so much easier!  I don't have to worry about the germs.  The fabric is gorgeous and the design is really easy to put on and take off.  I love the built-in belt.  I would say that if you're thinking about buying this product - DO IT!  You'll be glad you did.  I am :)
THIS THING IS AWESOME! So pretty, fits everything and doesn't look to bulky! Lovely fabric and soft enough for little one to lean against. I originally thought it was pricey but now I think its worth every penny!
I read a lot of reviews on cart covers before deciding to purchase this one from Balboa Baby. Sure, it was pricier than others, but I think it's worth it.First of all, it's big enough to fit on Costco carts and yet it still works great in small restaurant high chairs. I also love how it folds easily into itself into a small pouch. So convenient! It's easy to install, I can do it one-handed with a squirmy baby in the other. The loops for toys are great too and the pattern is really pretty.The only negative is the belt strap. It doesn't seem secure enough. The velcro is really weak and my 9-month old can easily bust out of it. However, this can easily be remedied by just using the straps that come with the cart/high chair so I would still recommend this product.
I am a bit of a &#34;germaphob&#34; so I thought I was going to get a lot of use out of this but I really only used it for a short period of time. I used it when my daughter was old enough to sit up in a shopping cart seat but still young enough where she was teething and biting on everything including the cart. This translated into about a few months of use. I just can't be bothered with it now that she's a toddler. It works as expected though and is good quality.
This is just too small for most carts. It works well on small carts (like the ones you find at Trader Joes or smallest size at Whole Foods), but just won't stay on most of the larger (standard size at most stores now) and commonly found carts. But, I love the compact size once it's folded into the pouch and so I keep it in my car to use on restaurant high chairs. It washes well and the pattern is adorable and fabric is high quality. Just doesn't work well on most carts, I much prefer my Buggy Bagg Elite for daily shopping cart use!
I just got this cover last week and already I have used it nearly everyday! It is wonderful and I consider it a must have. My son is 7 1/2 months old and we recently switched him from his infant carrier seat to a convertible car seat because of this I no longer had a clean place to keep him while we are at the store or out to eat. I am a germaphobe so when I saw this product I knew I had to have it. It is great, it covers the shopping cart 360 degrees making it a germ-free, clean place to put my son while we shop. I have also used it twice on highchairs in restaurants within the past week and again I am so happy I have it. I like that it has it's own strap so you don't have to use the dirty ones attached to the shopping cart or highchair. It's pretty easy to put on but I think I still need some practice doing it one-handed, so far I haven't been alone when I've used it so I have had someone who could hold my son while I cover the cart/highchair. My only complaint about the product is that the strap is a bit awkward to tighten, it's really long and there is a lot of excess material just hanging in the back after you tighten it 
I've used this a few times since I bought it and I really like it. Works well with most grocery carts and high chairs. The only cart it didn't work with were the large ones at HEB. But other than that, it held up well in the wash, and I love the little loops to strap in toys. My son loves to sit in the grocery cart, so I feel a little better about him not having direct contact with the dirty cart.
I use this primarily for shopping carts. I've used it at grocery stores, Target, Walmart, Costco, etc and have yet to find a cart that this cover doesn't fit.  My 9 month daughter is comfortable in it, and the hooks for toys are really convenient.  It holds up well in washer/dryer, and folds nicely into itself.  I've received several compliments from fellow shoppers on this product. Highly recommended!
This washes beautifully, it has &#34;safe velcro&#34; that doesn't snag or scratch. The cart cover fits perfectly in every highchair and cart I've used it in (and I can't even begin to count).  It keeps the baby from gnawing on the cart handle (gross!) and most importantly - when we're in a restaurant it keeps her away from touching the highchair - and SAFE from allergens that other children have been eating.
I have been on the quest for a nice well-cushioned cart cover for my 8 month old son.  I tried a much cheaper cover first,Infantino Shop and Play Cart Cover, Monkey Garden, and was disappointed by the lack of cushioning and how there wasn't any sort of stability for the baby.  I kept that one thinking it would work as a back up when my son got older and invested in the Balboa cover which costs more than twice as much.  I was very disappointed that it too lacked padding.  I do like that it completely covers the entire shopping cart and my son seems more secure in it than the Infantino cover.  However, for the extra money I expected a lot more padding.  I am going to return this one and keep looking.
Haven't put this to use yet, but I'm already getting ready to put all useful things in our car for our new addition, considering how many germs are out there and how many people never washes their hands that touch the carts we shop with...this is a NO brainer!!
My 8 month old loves sitting in the cart now. This cover lets me have some piece of mind that he isn't surrounded by grubby handles and filthy high chairs (especially since EVERYTHING is a teether to him). I did expect more padding (-1*) to the quilt but it will suffice. I like the toy tethers, the built-in storage bag and the print is very attractive.
Looked far and wide for the right cart civet and this was it! Beautiful design. Loved the strap to keep her in place when she was just learning to sit in a high chair. Love that it easily folds up in its little pouch. Loop to attach toys were great too. Fit high chairs well and most carts (grocery store, target, etc.) very happy!
First of all I have to commend the packaging job this company did to ship out my nursing pillow. They had it packaged very well so my pillow was not squished or damaged - it arrived in perfect condition as if you would find it on a store shelf. Not to mention it arrived quickly as well.Moving on to the pillow itself, I received the Lola pillow for a review and I absolutely love it. Although we do not have our bundle of joy here yet I definitely intend on using this whenever he or she comes into our family. The pillow features a Contoured design, Lactation Consultant approved, Helps relieve back, neck and shoulder stress, Removable cover and best of all is machine washable. I found my pillow to be made of high quality materials and built to last. I found that supporting the pillow in my lap felt natural and comfortable. The pillow itself is soft and comfortable as well. As you may notice for the time being I had to use a Mr. Bear for photo purposes, but I noticed that it's made to help moms nurse so the design is fully functional and does serve its purpose well.Needless to say I highly recommend the Balboa Baby products. They have tons of colors and styles to choose from to match your personality. The customer service was wonderful and the shipping was outstanding. This should definitely be on the must have list for moms to be!Full review here: [...]
Okay - the picture is TOTALLY incorrect!  If you're after something with a damask-type design, and want something that's simply black & white, this isn't it.  I returned mine because it wasn't ANYTHING like the picture.  It is NOT a plush fabric like the picture shows, and the fabric actually is more of a tan striped or textured color background and has LIME GREEN floral designs mixed in with the black pattern.  I was REALLY disappointed with it and am STILL shopping for a nursing pillow that I like.  Epic fail.
I have enjoyed this pillow with no problems, I like how it positions my baby for nursing. I would buy this again.
This pillow is not functional at all.  I had to add blankets below my baby to prop her up so she could actually reach my breast, and I am very short waisted. The Boppy pillow is much more functional.
This nursing pillow is a waste of money. It may be pretty and look good, but that is as far as the compliments go. The pillow smells terrible--like chemicals. And even washing the cover didn't help, I don't want to smell it, so I'm surely not going to lay my baby's face on it. It doesn't work for breastfeeding at all. It only works if you sit completely upright, otherwise the pillow slides out from underneath the baby and the baby ends up in a hole between you and the pillow. It would have been great if this pillow functioned as well as it looks, but it didn't. I ended up using the boppy again.
I bought this pillow because it was one of the tallest ones out there and I am a very high-waisted person with a very tiny baby.  The problem is that it's tall only on one side (6\" or so) and on the other side (the one closest to your body) it is very short (about 3.5\").  This means the baby just rolls off and then in between the pillow and my body, pushing it out of the way.  There is no way to keep baby on the pillow.  This is the WORST design of any pillow I have tried, including the Boppy, and trust me, I have tried them all!
This was the best nursing pillow when I was nursing my newborn.  I carried it with me everywhere!  Everyone said to get a Boppy but I found this to be both less expensive, trendy, and to work better than the boppy but everyone is different.  If you are overweight or have a big chest this is perfect for you, it really helped make it comfortable for both me and my son.
Pros: it sits higher than Boppy and My Brest Friend (I have all 3 pillows).The print is stylish.It has these contours on the pillow, where baby fits.Cons:There's nothing securing the pillow to your body. The Boppy curves around you and you can use the ends to &#34;clamp&#34; it on t least one side of your waist.  The first few days postpartum, still with a very round belly, this Balboa pillow would not stay put close to me. You'd have to be really skinny or wait until a few weeks postpartum to use it. Would be nice if they added a Velcro strap like My Brest Friend. Would be the perfect recombination of body fit and height.All that said, I do use it while on the glider chair. I prop the sides up with blankets to &#34;incline&#34;/angle it a few degrees towards me, and nurse baby this way. I do always have the feeling it's going to slip away down my thighs.Boppy is more adjustable precisely because it isn't as firm or tall, although you will have to also prop it up to nurse baby without straining your back leaning forward. My bottom line: there is no perfect nursing pillow yet (for me, at least), you'll have to experiment and see what fits your needs. Different pillows seem to fit different nursing situations: sitting in bed, on a recliner or glider chair, etc.
This nursing pillow is great! It's firm but still soft.  The fabric is really nice.  The prints are gorgeous.  And the shape makes nursing really comfortable.  I would totally buy this product again!
Just not sure what the advantage of this pillow is over a regular one. It is incredibly stiff, and doesn't seem to allow for flexibililty or size of baby. My daughter is still quite small, so she fits well for now, but I can't imagine that larger babies do. I wish I would have the saved the $, and just used a plain pillow.
I love how soft this sleep sack is! I can't wait to snuggle with my baby in Feb! I gave it a 4, because it is much smaller than other brands. If you are wondering about what size to go with, I would size up.
Holy crap, this thing is so soft... I have several types of sleep sacks (Halo, Adin & Anais, Summer Infant, etc), but this is by far our favorite.  It has a higher TOG rating than the others, which I appreciate for winter (our temps overnight inside dip to about 64).  The 6-12 month size is very accurate (our 9 month old fits perfectly and I see no reason she will outgrow it before it warms up).  I like the fact that the zipper can be done from the top (good for getting her in it) and the bottom (good for middle of the night diaper changes) as well as the fact that both are covered by a soft snap tab (so little fingers don't unzip it or have a zipper rubbing against sensitive skin).  The color is muted and gender neutral.  Everything about this is great... right down to the satin piping on the edges.  Really, I couldn't think of a way to improve it!  My husband literally exclaimed that he wishes he could have one the first time he saw/held it... it's that soft and cozy.
While this is smaller than other sleep sacks, this is intentional and there is no need to size up.  If you size up, the neck and arm holes will be too big and your baby will be lost in the sack.This is my favorite sleep sack partially because it is designed to fit babies more snugly ... not so much extra (and unnecessary) fabric for the baby to tangle in.The main reason this sack is my favorite, though, is because it has a two-way zipper that makes dressing and diapering my daughter a DREAM compared with the regular top-down only zipper sacks (all the other brands, from what I can tell ... I've got 2 other brands).  With a top-down only zipper, getting my fussy baby into this thing before bed is a challenge, to say the least.  With this, though, No Problem!Of course, the fact that this is so soft and snuggly doesn't hurt any.  I wouldn't mind having one of these in my size!  :)The only drawback I found to this sack is that the neck hole isn't V-ed at all to keep the bulky fabric away from the baby's face area.  I was worried that this might get in the way of our daughter's mouth while she was little tiny, so I didn't start using this until she was 3+ months old.  Now that she's a bit larger and has more control of her neck I feel okay leaving her in it.  Anyway, this is partially why you would definitely not want to size up on this sack ... you want the sack to be pretty well fitted around the neck and shoulders.The lack of a V neck-line is the only reason I give this 4 stars instead of 5.  I love it!!
I loved the SwaddleDesigns zzZipMe sacks up to the 6-12 month size so much that I ordered the 12-18 size as well.  The sizing is COMPLETELY OFF.  I actually had my 4 year old (who is 42 inches tall) step in it to see if it would fit him, and it did.  Definitely not made for a 12-18 month old baby... this item is a fail.
These sleep sacks are sooo soft but not too heavy.  I love that the zipper unzips to the bottom but the zipper doesn't come completely apart (no fumbling to put the zipper back together in the dark of night).  Love these!
Not only does this vinyl cover help while my baby is in the crib it is also a great storage bag for the mattress .  It helps keep the mattress clean  in the crib or in storage until the second baby arrives.Would purchase again and would reommend
Vinyl is being phased out by the U.S. government due to its lack of safety. These items, including mattresses, mattress pad covers, and old bath books made of vinyl off-gas (as in, leak toxic gases) and children can breath them in. I would not recommend this product.
Seems like a fairly good quality cover, especially for the price. Received much sooner than the expected shipping date, so that's a plus. Am happy with it so far, we'll see how it holds up.
I was expecting something a little thicker and this is very thin material, also the zipper broke when I put it in the mattress, I was disapponted.
I was looking at a very similar item at another retailer for a few dollars more, and then another one online for ALOT more.  I decided that I would order this one just to try it and I am so glad I did.  The listing said it would ship in 2-4 weeks but it arrived about 10 days later.  The vinyl seems a bit thin to start with, but it's just a waterproof layer so how thick does it really need to be?  I washed it and put it on the crib mattress with no problems at all.  Then I layered a mattress pad and put on a sheet and put the mattress back in the crib.  I am very happy with it, I don't know why other reviewers were saying that it's cheap or won't hold up.  It is the EXACT same quality as the one sold for a few dollare more at a very popular baby store.
I like these because I always save tons of little things of my kid's. This one's pretty but the second I took it out of the Amazon box the front photo frame fell off. I glued it back on with a hot glue gun but probably shoudn't have happened to something I paid almost thirty dollars for.
These chests are beautiful.  I bought 2 for my kids and did not expect much for this price.  What a surprise!  They are very well made and fit all of the baby's keepsakes in one place.  I recommend this.
I purchased one for my firstborn in 2009 from Babies R Us, and when I had my second baby, I insisted on getting one for him as well.  And since there isn't a Babies R Us nearby, I was so happy to find them on Amazon.  I love them!  These keepsake chests are so cute and very durable!  I love the different compartments and the cover lifts as well.  It holds everything, from baby's first outfit, first pair of shoes, to his first lock of hair from his first hair cut!The only thing I wasn't happy about was when Amazon delivered it, there was a dent in one corner where it looked like it'd be dropped.  It doesn't detract from 
I bought this keepsake chest for a shower gift and my niece loved it!  It's well made and has all the necessary compartments & space for those special baby keepsakes!  The design was very cute as well!
I love this product.  I was looking for a place to store my child's keepsakes from the hospital and this is perfect for it!  Not only does it give plenty of room for these keepsakes, it also fits her baby book perfect in the bottom.  Would highly recommend.
very nice.  love this.  holds the matching calendar and memory book perfectly.  lots of room for lots of stuff.  love the little drawer to hold hospital bracelets and such..  nice quality.
I love this keepsake box, it is well made and the design and colors are beautiful.  It is a good size, it holds everything i have wanted to put in it, and i have all my little keepsakes as well as all the professional pictures that i have had taken of my daughter.  I know that this will hold up through time and that my daughter will enjoy it in the years to come!  I definitely recommend this and the other CR Gibson items!
I don't know if it was the was it was packaged or if the company who delivered just was careless and the keepsake box got smashed in on the corner it was intending as a gift for this weekend I hate to give it as is but so close to the time of party no time to return I just hope no one else has this problem
This is much better than the box I had saved to store away keepsakes for my daughter. I also ordered the loose-leafed baby book as well. The print is beautiful and just enough pink for a girl without being overwhelming. My husband and I purposely didn't want everything to be pink in her room as there are so many other colors in the world to enjoy.The box has a top flap I'm hoping will fit the book when I get it, though it might be more suited for the bound version. I will make sure to update on that. It also has one sectioned and one large drawer to store all sorts of goodies. My daughter's room is mainly greens, tans, and panda's but this goes nicely along with it. ^_^
I knew I wouldn't keep up a &#34;baby book,&#34; so I have one for each of my girls.  Love being able to collect small items easily.
I received a similar box as a gift when I had my son 12 years ago and it worked perfect for storing things, so I wanted to find one when I had my daughter this year.  The cardboard on this is very sturdy like I was hoping for.  The top opens up to store a baby book.  I am planning on putting in her baptism and taking home from the hospital outfits, her hospital bracelets, a few pictures, the newspaper from the day of her birth, and a few other mementos in here.  Will be nice to share with her someday when she grows up.
I got this to go with the baby book I am giving my daughter and I think it is just sweet. perfect for all those little things you want to keep and not sure where to put them.
Super cute keepsake box!! Both of my kids have this one & it's perfect for storing all sorts of memoirs! I love it
I love my kokopax city carrier. I am a mom of 3. My two youngest are 2 and 5 months. I have a couple of pouch slings, but those aren't practical for cooking, housework, or other things that require both arms to be free. We have multiple strollers, one of which includes a double side by side stroller that we love, however, it's not always practical to use a stroller. Take for example, the trips I was making to the grocery store prior to getting the Kokopax. My older son would be on the seat in the cart and my infant would be in his car seat taking up the entire cart space. I'd have to pile groceries underneath the cart. Or, trips to the park with my 2 year old who wants to run everywhere. Dragging a stroller through the sand/tanbark was horrible, and holding the baby in my arms or in the sling wasn't practical because I often need my hands/arms to help my son around the playground and getting in and out of those bucket swings. I really didn't want a hiking backpack because I just don't need all of those darn straps, pockets, zippers, etc. The things I love the Kokopax City Carrier are:baby loves being able to look aroundlightweightno waist strapminimal pockets (just one that the straps feed into. Also good for maybe 1 diaper, keys)looks goodbaby is comfortableI've had many mothers either looking at it or coming up to me asking where I got it. I use it nearly every day.My only complaint is that the fabric covering the padding on the lumbar support seems to be rubbing on my clothing and it is wrecking some of my clothing. This happened the very first time I used it. My daughter came up and asked what was all over the lumbar padding. I have one of those nylon, super stretchy tank tops that I wear under some t-shirts because I like the length and the layered look, but it really messed that tank top up in the spot where it rests against the Kokopax. It is pilling nearly all of my clothing. The padding now has multiple colors of pills from the various shirts that I have worn with it. If I didn't LOVE this carrier so much, that would have turned me away from the product. There has got to be a different fabric that can be used that won't do this to clothing when there is friction. Because I love the carrier, I am going to try and find a way to cover that pad with another material. Maybe one that is less coarse.
That's the best way to carry a baby when they are over 6 months old. I had one like this one when I was raising my kids, it was wonderful. Now that I'm taking care of my granddaughter, I was desperately seeking for a similar baby backpack until I found this one. Absolutely the best! They peek everything you do so they don't get bored. They are comfortable, enjoying and even interacting with the environment, safely. The waist belt is a must for the wearer, for an evenly distribution of the baby's weight, so that your shoulders don't get hurt. I bought this one because it was extremely cheap, compared to the ones with a waist band, but ordered separately a back pack replacement waist band that fit it.
We received this as a gift in preparation for an upcoming vacation.  We are not going to be able to take our 10 month daughter everywhere we want to go via a stroller, and I don't like using the front carriers we have for very long (feel free to read that review here:Infantino Swift Carrier,) so the hope is this will fit our needs.We did some test runs with this carrier over the weekend by using it for some shopping errands as well as a 3 mile walk.  Here are my impressions:Pros:- She liked being in the carrier.  As we walked along, she was all smiles as she was taking in the sights.  She does have to lean to one side or the other to see around my head, but she seemed to think that was funny.- My back didn't bother me.  I'm 6'2\" and I had the lumbar adjustment down as far as it goes, and I thought it was just enough.  So that might be a point of caution if you are taller than me.  Anyway, despite all the various straps these carriers sometimes come with, I didn't need them.  It was just like wearing a backpack in school...  actually our daughter probably weighs less than those books did.- The kickstand feature was useful.  It made it very helpful to get her in and out. We even stopped and got a bite to eat, and just flipped the kickstand down and let her stay in it.  I wouldn't walk away with her in it, here toes were just able to touch the floor, but she was content to sit there while we ate.- She was secure and comfortable.  The harness keeps her in place and the over all design supports her weight well.Cons:- As with all things with shoulder straps, they are rough and can irritate baby's neck.  Invest in some strap covers (like these:Munchkin Reversible Strap Covers,Colors May Vary,) you'll use them for all sorts of products, including this one.- A spotter while not necessary, is really helpful.  I can basically get her in and flipped on my back with no problem on my own.  My problem comes with retracting the kickstand.  I'm always afraid i'm going to crush her legs, so I like a second person to help with that step.- Still not for indefinite use.  Maybe it's only my daughter, but I could push her all day in a stroller, but these carriers all have a time limit.  That said, this was the longest she seemed happy in a carrier.  We were almost home from our 3 mile walk when she started to fuss to get out.  Still, I thought that was pretty good range.- It can be difficult to get to the harness clasps that are fairly deep in the carrier.  My advice is to check out how the clasps work prior to putting the baby in it.  This way you will be able to do it by feel.- Not the carrier's fault, but she's in prime hair pulling position, and she took full advantage.Overall:I am pretty pleased with this carrier, and think it will serve us well on our trip and beyond.
My baby is super active. She wants constant attention and to GO, GO, GO all the time. I cannot sit her in an activity seat, pack n play, or anything like that for more than a few minutes or she is bored. I also have a Dr Sears Balboa sling & an Infantino carrier. She doesn't like sitting on the ground in a seat for too long where she can't be \"involved\" and most of the carriers hurt my back. Therefore, the laundry & dishes were piling up and I was starving since I couldn't even make lunch without her yelling at me (or grabbing my plate, fork, food, etc).I finally saw the Kokopax City Carrier on Ellen's talk show and thought \"I've spent so much money already, what's one more thing that probably won't work?\"IT IS AMAZING! It fits like a backpack except easier to carry. I have less trouble carrying a 17 lb baby in this than using a backpack with 2 or 3 books (and I am a 5' tall weakling). It is made well, and it has a harness (kinda like a car seat). It even has a hook to put a toy on. Not to mention it is the cutest thing ever. I got the brown one with the little owls on it. I just sit it on the couch, put her in, and sit down in front of her & put the straps over my shoulders. So easy. It looks huge in the picture but once you get it on and collapse the kickstand, it is not that big. I easily get around in my little house in it. The best part is it adjusts not only at the straps but the frame too so my husband and I can take turns using it. Everything else took too long to switch back and forth (since he is a whole foot taller than me).My little girl LOVES it. I can finally clean the kitchen, make breakfast & lunch, go for walks, etc. I am thinking I am going to use this for the grocery/mall too so I don't have to put her in the icky carts. I can even walk the dogs now! So far, I have had her in it for at least an hour at a time. It does not hurt my back!!!! I would say this is my favorite investment other than the necessities like the breast pump & pack n play. We still use the pack n play for napping and her activity seat for when I take a shower but this backpack has been a lifesaver. It is for babies who can sit up and weight of 16 to 35 lbs. We will be using this for quite a while.
My 8 month old son HATED this carrier, sadly. We'd had high hopes based on the reviews.  But he didn't seem to feel secure in it.  Because of the way the carrier is positioned, he was able to push against my back with his feet and try to stand up, and the unpadded straps holding him into the backpack would cut into his neck and leave horrible marks.  We had a difficult time getting him in and out, because the clasp for the straps that secure him are placed very low in the carrier, and the carrier is very narrow, and we couldn't see the release buttons to get him out.  We also had a diffult time with the very stiff metal stand -- it's hard to put your kid down when you can't get the stand to release behind you!  Finally, the lack of any type of chest or waist strap was a big problem from an ergonomic perspective, and our kid is only 17lbs.  I can't imagine have a much heavier one in there.It arrived yesterday, and is being returned in the morning.  You get what you pay for, I guess....
Works great would have given it 5 stars but only works on a flat tank. If the tank is curved it won't work. Keep that in mind before ordering.
With the toilet seat up, make sure you have close to two inches between the center of the toilet lid and toilet. Otherwise this will take up to much space between the lid and toilet, and the lid will not stay up. When closed, the bottom of my toilet seat is 3.5 inches from the upper tankIt worked just fine on my toilet. And it distracts my kid from putting his fingers in the gap between the seat and lid when the toilet is closed.Other devices clamp over the lid and seat and will actually attract your kid to put his or her fingers all over it. And then the next thing you know your kid is licking the toilet. With this he's more interested in the arm that's on top of the seat.Good luck. Being a parent can get crazy, but you learn so much!
The installation consists of sticking the holder on the tank with the sticky tape provided. However, the tape came with barely any sticking power at all! Less than 10 seconds after I stuck it on according to the instructions, it was slowly slipping down the tank. I attempted to reapply it several times, and same story each time--fell right off in less than 30 seconds.I will be returning this to the retail store where it was purchased.
I find this product to work well.  I had no issues with installation and it has remained securely installed for 6 months now.  It is the safest toilet lock I could find because you can't forget to lock it.  When you close the lid, it locks automatically.  I did knock off one star because, as another reviewer mentioned, the device may prevent you from opening the lid all the way and resting it against the tank.  In my application, the lid will remain open, but it is perfectly upright.  This means the seat doesn't quite open to an upright position and will fall closed when you let go.  But, it's only the seat.  Guys, you just need to hold the seat up when you go!  Not a big deal!  The added security is worth it in my opinion.  The other clip style locks are flimsy and easier for the little ones to manipulate, whereas this product requires a combination press/slide to release the lever.  We are just adding another bathroom and I will be installing this lock on the new toilet as well.Update 1/5/12:  The lock is just now starting to stick open and must be manually closed.  Two years of heavy use for under $10...not bad!
This works perfectly, is *super* easy to install, and it's the only one I saw that sits in back, not at the side, so it doesn't run the risk of getting grimy (and worse!). Best on the market in my opinion.
I had another (horrible!) lock before I bought this at a store. My husband installed it and said it was super easy to install, even though there was something he missed.I love the automatic locking (although ours does not always snap into place, anytime LO plays with it she promptly locks herself out of the toilet. We also have a slow closing lid which seems to play a part in that.)My favorite part is that while it is a complicated enough lock that my daughter, now 14 mo, wont be able to figure it out for a long, long, time, I can open it with one hand when I need to rinse out a cloth diaper.
the Safety 1st Swing Shut Toilet Lock works really good it keep the toilette safe from kids. it is good
I bought 2 different types of locks to try out to find which one worked the best. This one looks like a giant preganancy test, and even though I thought this lid lock worked okay my husband isn't fond of it. His complaint is he cannot use the toilet without the lid trying to shut (b/c of the bulkiness of the lock making the seat not stay up fully). So, husbands may not like the acrobatics involved with trying to pee and hold up the lids. Maybe this is just b/c of our toilet design although it's a pretty basic toilet lid. It's flat, not curved. Anyway, I want our baby-proofing accessories to be painless and not protested.
Difficult for guests to figure out, but easy to use once you know how.  I've had at least 10 different guests break it off.  After parties, when I go in to the bathroom and find the lock broken off the toilet, lying on the counter or floor or windowsill, I can't help but envision my poor friends looking at the device befuddled, bladder over capacity, finally ripping it off in desperation.  Be a better host than me and post instructions or teach your guests when they arrive how to access the toilet.I didn't want my baby in the toilet.  This has effectively prevented my toddler-toilet nightmares from being made manifest.  I'd buy it again in a heartbeat.  But I haven't had to.  When it falls off, I just stick it back on.  Voila!Easy to install.  Easy to remove, comes off clean.
I had major issues with my son getting into the toilet until I got this.  I mean, at first it was little things-like I had to instruct everyone that entered my house not to leave the toilet seat up.  Then I tried keeping him out of the bathroom, but that didn't work.  So I was left with my son constantly going straight for the toilet, and throwing in whatever he could find, or that he thought needed a &#34;bath.&#34;Unfortunately, there were many times when I caught him &#34;too late&#34; and wasn't sure how much he had &#34;played&#34; in the potty, so he also immediately got a bath.  Needless to say, I was more than ready for an end to the toilet playing....After hours (and boy do I mean hours...) of researching, I finally decided on this.  I had read reviews on another toilet lock that actually went into the toilet-and that just didn't seem like the kind of lock I wanted.  After ordering, I tracked this package, and waited (im)patiently for this to arrive.  As soon as it did, I tore open the package, read the directions, and began putting it on.  All you need is a clean toilet lid.  I made sure that I had enough room to comfortably move the latch when in use, and that it was placed in the middle of the seat.Setup literally took less than a minute, and has saved me countless hours of digging items out of the toilet, washing off my 20 month old son, and there is no telling how much it has saved me in not having to replace phones or other valuable items that he thought needed to be in the toilet.It should be noted that if you are using this, you will NOT be able to use a toilet seat cover, unless you want to make a huge cut in this item.  I did order this a few months ago, and the adhesive is still holding strong, and I have absolutely ZERO complaints whatsoever!I was so excited (as another reviewer was) to receive this and see it in action-and it did not disappoint!!!  I watched my son enter the bathroom, and immediately head for the toilet.  The pushed and pulled the lever, and did the same thing with the toilet seat...to no avail.  I may or may not have stifled a laugh, and finally felt that I could breathe just a little bit easier in my house.Would DEFINITELY purchase again, if needed!Hannah Booth
This is the only lock that fits our fancy schmancy odd sized toilet.I like the high tech buttons you need to press to release it, and I like the ultra sticky tape (it's very important to have super strong sticky tape.  Toddlers are smarter and stronger than you think).What I don't like is we always always forget to NOT slam our toilet lid down.  You must remember to lift up the latch before putting your seat down.  In our master bathroom, we've taken the latch off because it's flown off way too many times by our slamming the lid down.  Now we just keep the door to the master bath closed.Works well, just don't forget it's attached to the lid!!
It keeps my lo out of the toilet.  He has figure out how to pull it off but never has the time before we figure out his plan.
We bought this lock at a local store.  This was the only toilet lock they had in stock so we bought it.Pros:Keeps lid closed down.  My daughter hasn't figured out how to open the lid yet.Easy to install.Sanitary, no touching toilet parts.Cons:Not for the type of toilet we have.  Our tank has a curved bottom rather than a squarish bottom.  This made the swing-arm get stuck under the tank every time it is opened.  It pops off every single time the toilet seat is closed.  I tried a different, stronger tape...nope...still pops off.  The only way I can get the lid shut without it popping off is to manually move the swing-arm back into place.I'm shopping for a new toilet lock today.  Pretty mad that I wasted money on this thing.
There are adults that can't figure it out, so my two year old still can't figure it out! I bought three from babies r us last year and they still work great! Very good purchase. Sorry dome people got faulty ones, that happens sometimes.
Have a menacing toddler that likes to get into everything? Well then this is perfect for you! Not only does it keep toddlers out, but also the dim whited person that may really need to take a pee. It is quite humorous having to open the toilet for adults who 'can't figure the damn thing out' but it truly does serve it's purpose!
At first, I LOVED this toilet lock.  It was easy to install and worked perfectly.  Best of all, it was impossible to forget about.  (After all, how good is baby proofing if you forget to use the stuff!) Unfortunately, not more than two months after I installed it it is broken!  The swinging arm just snapped off the base.  Are you kidding me??My mother-in-law almost wet her pants trying to operate this thing while she was babysitting so I thought it was pretty secure.  Apparently not very durable, though.
Awesome. After purchasing so many fails when it comes to child proofing, this product was refreshing. Easy to install works perfectly well and so far my 18 month old hasn't managed to do anything to if.
Totally does the job I needed it to. Son hasn't figured out to hold both buttons down...yet. Kind of awkward for moms and dads in middle of the night though, and for grandparents visiting who can't figure anything out
Not bad compared to the other toilet seat lock that I purchased that didnt work at all, the issue I have with this lock is that once its installed ( installation is easy) it doesn't allow the lid to lift all the way up when you're using the toilet.  The back piece that attaches to the tank also slipped out of place a couple times. Overall it gets the job done.
Bought two of these nearly two years ago. The adhesive is still strong, the latch still locks, 
I have wasted more money on baby safety products than I even care to talk about.  This is the ONLY one I have found yet that truly works.  Once you stick it down, it stays there.  I'm ot sure how I'm going to get these off the toilets when I move, but they work well!!
This did not work for us. The mount did not stick well and out 10 month old could easily pull the whole thing off the toilet. We just found it easier being diligent about closing the door.
My daughter is in that fun stage where she is fascinated by the toilet so we had to break down and get a toilet lock.  After doing alot of research online I decided on this one mainly because of the fact that it doesn't attach to the bowl itself.  There was something about having it down on the boil that grossed me out!  I didn't want to have to worry about cleaning it all the time and this one is out of the way and easy to clean when you wipe down the toilet lid, etc.I read a lot of reviews of people indicating that it didn't latch automatically when the lid was closed and that it prevented the lid from staying upright etc.  But this was NOT the case for us.  It says in the directions that you have to make sure that you leave a little space between the arm and the catch bracket on the tank, otherwise it won't close properly.  We did that and it works great!  It is easy to open (requires two hands though...so keep that in mind) and the arm swings out of the way and the lid stays open until we lower it back down.  Once you put the lid down the arm swings back automatically and locks into place.  Perfect!  Very happy with this product!
This thing is so strong and durable. I have had mine on for a week and it has taken a huge beating from several people yanking on it pulling it and so on and its still on tight. The only thing that stinks is that you cant use a seat cover w it on. But fashion over safety is pointless.
I really like this lock.  It wasn't difficult to install, the toilet lid stays up when unlocked/in use, and you can't forget to lock it because it does so automatically when you put the lid down.The only drawback is that if you have to change the toilet seat/lid for any reason (or if you want to take the lock off between kids to accommodate a potty training seat) you'll have to buy a new lock, as there is no replacement adhesive available and it doesn't stay sticky enough to use a second time.  I wish the lock came with a set of replacement adhesive that works like the 3M stretchy-type adhesives that I use for Christmas decorations.I thought it might be overkill to get a toilet lock (meaning, we can just watch LO, right?).  But LO has gotten very fast and her favorite thing is to make a beeline for the bathroom and flush the toilet, bang on the seat, etc.  I feel better knowing that the most she can do is flush the toilet before I make it in there to retrieve her.
We have had this on our toilet for a few months without issue.  It's easy to use, and keeps little hands out of the toilet.  It's pretty resilient, does its job, and is easy for guests to figure out.
It didn't work. I opened and immediately had to return it because doesn't fits the stroller I had. It falls over my baby head and also didn't gave enough shadow to the legs.
Thanks to a certain airline which shall remain nameless, the canopy of our Kolcraft Tour Sport umbrella stroller (or lightweight stroller) was lost during an East coast trip.  A big floppy hat was the solution until I spotted this replacement, which has turned out to be a bit of a bust.Although it's nice and big, and does create a Conestoga-wagon-like tunnel of shade when attached to our stroller, it's really meant to extend an existing canopy, more than substitute for one, because of its size and shape.  It has an array of Velcro and tie straps that we sort out every time, and have to deal with when we fold the stroller, and the only way to really make a shade for our boy is to tie it through the side bars of the stroller, encroaching on his already pretty limited space.  These ties and the rather floppy (albeit framed) construction of the canopy itself are magnets for those curious little fingers, so the boy is constantly pulling at something or bending it or ducking under it, sitting on it, rolling over it, etc.  It makes keeping him shaded rather a challenge.This thing is, basically, a good concept but not quite adequately executed, if what you're looking for is a replacement canopy and not an extension.
This works great with our compact (Graco Mosaic) stroller. I can't imagine it not working with most all strollers.  I wish I could have found this product sooner.  I LOVE it!!!  It does not hinder my little boy's view, yet shields him from the bright, hot sun. I don't know why strollers aren't made with larger shades to begin with...
I should have paid attention to the reviewer that said this product needed a canopy already to work.  The Amazon description says it works with any stroller with or without canopy, but yes the product directions state it needs a canopy.This product picture is poor also- it makes it look like a self-sustaining frame, but it's really just as flimsy as the Summer Infant/Kiddopotamus brand shade that I bought in a store.Anyway, I did manage to make it work with my stroller- I have a Baby Trend Sit N Stand double stroller that I got on consignment and it was missing the canopies.  I can make this work with the front seat, I just tie it down on the stroller parts.  It works on the back seat too, if I cover up the drink holders and use them as a support.  I can't see this working with an umbrella stroller that doesn't have a canopy, though I haven't tried it with mine.In summary, this product probably works great for a stroller already with a canopy, and it can \"make do\" for some strollers without one.
One of they key features of super pricey strollers is the complete shade of a large canopy, this is that feature only portable!It's quick and easy and gives great shade for hot summer days, I use it on both my full size jogger and my umbrella stroller with ease!
It is too sunny outside, my chicco cortina stroller has a short canopy. This can be easily adjusted, I pull it a little bit forward or backward to adjust amount of light, fine. The only small difficulty is to keep it all the way to the back when shade is not needed.
I originally ordered the RayShade for my larger stroller, and I thought I could get by with just one because I could easily switch it from that to my compact stroller.  Turns out I'd always forget to switch it, so my baby was left without shade.  The RayShade is awesome, and can stretch to cover everything, including her feet.  Since we live in Houston, pants/socks are not viable options in the summer, so a large stroller shade is necessary.I ordered the Sunshine Kids Shade Maker because it was cheaper, and I thought, \"How different can it be??\"  Well...1. It is SMALL.  Even on my tiny compact stroller (The First Years Jet), it doesn't provide more than a few inches of extra shade.  It's no larger than the shade the stroller comes with.  And your stroller MUST have a shade already for this to work (it provides the support).2. It is actually hard to put on.  I mean, you'd think it looks easy, but when I compare it to the RayShade, it's ridiculous.  Where you are supposed to tie all the little straps is not intuitive at all.3. Did I mention is provides little to no extra shade??The only positive thing I have to say about the shade it that it looks like it's good quality and has pockets on the side.  If you want a few extra pockets, then it's what you want.  Otherwise spend the extra $5 and order the RayShade UV Protective Stroller Shade Improves Sun Protection for Strollers, Joggers and Prams Black.
I have a city mini GT stroller. This shade didn't seem to work with it so I had to return it.
Horrible!!! It ripped at the seams the first time i tried to use it. Disappointing!Manito sun shade is perfect tho...
This is a very usefull and convenient product.  Provides plenty of shade and was easy to put on.two relatively small downsides--there is no easy way to pull back the shade-there is no \"peep hole\" to see your kid, unlike other shades that have a small clear plastic square
I just bought a Graco Twin IPO stroller, and I needed the extra shade, but I didn't want to spend 55.00 on one shade. I bought 2 of these and they fit just fine side by side. I haven't had them in the sun yet, but I know they will keep a lot more sun off my girls than the shades it came with. They were cheaper too. It also helps keep them a little more separated, since from time to time my 14 month old likes to bug my 3 yo. Since we are going to Dollywood in about a month, I couldn't wait 6-8 weeks for these shades, so after a lot of searching, I found them at [...]. Everywhere else they were out of stock or backordered.
The shade maker is very useful once it's fully set up, but if you have to take it off and put it back on for every use, it's quite a hassle. It's not all that difficult, but it is finicky and time consuming, two things that are problematic with a baby or toddler in the area.
A friend donated an old jogging stroller to me, one that didn't have any kind of sun shade, so I took a risk and bought this one to use for that purpose. Sadly, this cover requires some kind of structure underneath to hold it up, so it didn't work for it's intended purpose. However, this shade is still fantastic! We use it on our regular stroller whenever we go out during the summer. It covers much more than the stroller shade and comes down much further, even making it possible to skip the sunscreen on my munchkin. I highly recommend this shade, just know that it requires an existing structure to lay on top of.
We got this in pink and my daughter loves it. She uses it every car ride even if shes not tired so I know she finds it very comfortable.. It doesnt get in the way of the safety of the belt either.
We recently transferred my DD from a convertible car seat to a booster and knew I needed this item right away. She naps a lot in the car and this cushioned her head just like a regular pillow. We recently went to Florida and drove from Orlando to the Keys and this pillow was a life saver. I had to adjust her head a bit so that it was laying on the pillow because her head kept wanting to go forward. Overall, this is a good product. B
Bought for 5 yr old in belt positioning booster seat for two day drive.  He liked it a lot, allowed him to rest his head while watching DVD or sleeping.  Haven't tried to clean it yet but pillow insert comes out of fabric cover for cleaning and I think will be easy. Good buy.
I bought it for my wife since we travel a lot in our car.  Although she naps here and there, she didn't find this really useful.  Then again she didnt' really give it a try.  Once my son gets bit older i'll try and see if he'll like it.
It doesn't work if you have booster seat with the back, because of the shoulder belt's position correction point. You can only move it above or below that point. To be honest, it doesn't work even without the buster seat.  It prevents the belt from pulling out and in, too bulky and not comfortable to have it attached all the time and doesn't really holds the head. Now I just have it in the back seat pocket just in case one day we will be able to use it during the long trip.
It's definitely smaller than it appears in the picture, but I searched extensively for an alternative and couldn't find one. Also if your child uses a high-back booster seat the seatbelt loops can interfere with correct placement of the pillow (in our booster it sets it too low).
MI NENA DE 3 A&Ntilde;OS LO USA Y LE ENCANTA APOYARSE PARA DORMIRSE UNA MINI SIESTA EN EL AUTO.ES SUPER MULLIDO Y FACIL DE LAVAR, LO METES EN EL LAVARROPAS Y LISTO.
My wife and I got this because we were tired of going to the mall or another store with our travel system stroller that was really big and too difficult to navigate. We got this when our son was about 5 months as he was able to sit up on for longer periods of time and didn't need to be in a car seat attached to the stroller.The travel system stroller was too bulky for my wife and it was very annoying and difficult to navigate with in many stores as there is just not enough room between clothes racks or aisles with other people. So we were looking at strollers like this and saw a bunch that were $20-$30 but felt they were low quality and cheap. So we ordered this for our son and he loves it, and more than that, we love it. It is a really nice product, and it uses quality materials that after a whole summer of use, none of the threading came undone, no dents in the metal, and the wheels are still working perfectly, even with us using it on regular roads on evening walks.I would recommend paying a bit more for this compared to cheaper alternatives as this is a product that can be used for a few years. It looks great, has good color choices for both boys and girls, and it is a great ride for the baby strapped in. I'll admit I like to move pretty quickly and let the wind blow through my son's hair and face and give him a great ride and never once do I really worry about this stroller breaking.
We held onto this for a week or so, and used it briefly.  And, I've finally decided to return it for 2 reasons:  1) it's too short.  I'm 5'8&#34; and I am often kicking the wheels, even walking barefoot, slowly.  This is a bummer.  And, 2) it's impossible to fold the stroller up with the canopy attached.  What a nuisance, having to have the canopy separate and haul it around.Aside from these things, this seems to be a pretty decent stroller, especially for the price.  But, I'm returning it and then I'll buy the First Years Ignite Stroller, based on reviews I've read indicating it's features.
The hubs and I were looking for a stroller to replace (or supplement) the Graco travel system we have.  The Graco's seat did support our son fully and we wanted something that would allow him to relax, yet sit up nicely.This umbrella style stroller definitely does that. The seat is deep, allowing baby to sit back, but it's upright enough that the child can easily relax back and still fill as though they're sitting up and seeing the world.There's \"some assembly required\" when it comes out of the box, but my husband did the putting together in approximately 2 minutes.  The frame is sturdy, but the stroller is light. I can easily (even with horrible back and hip issues) carry the stroller down our stairs to get it outside. The basket underneath is perfect for storing a purse or other not-huge items, and there's a nylon compartment for keys, phones, bottles, what-have-you suspended between the handles that is incredibly useful.Added to all that, the price is right (hey, it's only $25 more than simpler, wobblier versions at a certain Baby Store).We love it.
Easy to use, heavy duty and light weight. The five point harness was a must. Can lift folded into my trunk with one hand.
There are some cheaply made umbrella strollers out there. This stroller is not one of them. The First Years stroller has nice size plastic tires on it. A lot of the other umbrella strollers have ity bity tires that make it hard to maneuver. This stroller is easy to push. It just glides. It is easy to open and close, and it has a lock that is very convenient. Both tires can be locked also. The stroller is very light. I use it at the airport all of the time. The shade can be snapped on pretty much where ever you want it. My 10 month old needs the shade to be placed closer to her head to provide sun protection. I like that it can be moved and is not stationary. There are 4 cup holders and a zippered bag attached to the top of the stroller. There is a small area for storage underneath. I would buy it again.
This is the best stroller it not only is a very compact size it holds and supports our baby so well with the shoulder harness.  It is a wonderful price and a great quality.  The front wheel was a bit off till it got broke a bit, but works wonderful now.
We have the bid exspensive travel system and a light weight cheap umbrella stroller... the travel system is big bulky and heavy and the umbrella stroller does not have a canopy/visor and is to low for me to push without hurting my back. This is just right, the weight is not to light or heavy, it's not to low or high and it folds up to be compact! the only down side is the basket underneith noed not hold much. Well worth the $!!!
There's so many things I liked about this stroller (the size, color options, 5 point harness, parent console, etc), but ultimately I can't stand this stroller. If I turn the stroller (which seems reasonable), the front wheels just drag. They get stuck, and I'm basically just pushing the stuck wheels across the floor. It's impossible to steer, period...let alone with one hand, which is often a need. I wish I hadn't bought this stroller. I pushed around a cheapo umbrella stroller the other day and it was so easy to steer. I should probably just get a $20 stroller and rip the parent console off this one and somehow attach it to a cheapo one.
Tough stroller, well built, light, opens and closes easily!!!  Well recommended for the price.  Not the Walmart  $25.  quality,  this one is sturdier and feels stronger and safer.  Wheels work perfect on grass, sidewalk and rougher terrain too!  You get your monies worth for the additional few dollars.
It is a nice stroller for shopping and other indoor activities. We have red/black version. It folds fairly easily, has a parent tray. The basket underneath is pretty much useless, maybe you can squeeze a baby jacket in there. We have a large canvas bag with a single wide shoulder strap that hangs over the bars kind of in the way diaper bags are usually attached to strollers, and fits diaper bag plus other stuff.There was a bunch of these strollers on Amazon, with slightly varying prices. As I found out later, the difference is not only in color. Some of the strollers are newer models and have some improvements compared to the red and black model which is older. For example, newer ones have a cup holder, shoulder strap to carry the stroller. We don't. So research before you buy. No regrets for us - we like the red color for our baby girl.
Out of the 1,2,3,4,5,6 strollers that I own, this one is my favorite. My go-to stroller, the one that I keep with me at all times.We got it for a vacation that was going to involve some public transportation use. I was attracted to the price and the reviews.It is light, and comfortable.However, the cup holder/organizer has begun to unravel. I just need to take it inside and stitch it closed. It should be a simple repair.I gave it 3 stars instead of 5 because of the stitching need. Also, because my friend got the same stroller and the entire side came un-stitched and does not look like it will be an easy repair.
I bought this as a travel stroller two years ago, to save room in the car when traveling/running errand. It worked great! It has many miles on it. Compact fold, reclines just enough for child to nap in. It has a great parent \"bag\" by the handle, that zips. The under neath storage is useless. The wheels did squeak about 6m after I started using it, I was told to use lithium grease, and it took the squeak away. My biggest complaint is, ours broke while away on vacation. The rivet gave away on the bottom \"X\" fold of stroller. I contacted company, (they have fast and friendly service) they told me there is only a one year warranty on it. So I decided to run a screw through it to hold it together, I hope we are able to use it for a little while longer. I really like this stroller.
This is good for taller people in that the handles are high.  However, I still had a problem with kicking the wheels as I walked.  You absolutely have to have both hands on the handles to steer it, which makes it hard going through doors, etc.  Plus, I took this brand new to Paris.  After 4 days of cobblestone streets, bumps and stairs, the wheels got very wobbly and it got to be much harder to steer.  So in summary, I think this will probably work well if you're not going to take it over too many bumps.  I kind of think you get what you pay for.  I recently got a used MacLaren Volo which is way more expensive that this -- but it also works much better, is a smooth ride, has tall handles and I don't kick the wheels when walking.
It's not quite tall enough for my 6'1 husband, but lightweight, folds small,and works great so far. For $40, I'm very happy.
We were looking to purchase cheap umbrella stroller for our upcoming trip. Amazon was offering great discount on Pickupstick model (40% off) + free shipping, so we ordered it. It was during Christmas time, and I was shocked to receive it within 36 hours of placing my order! Truly great servic!As for the stroller... well.. I expected something a little better.There is no recline. At least, I wouldn't call those 1,2 inches as a recline option.It's pretty heavy - weights exactly as our MetroLite by Graco stroller (11 lb), but has waaay less features.The bin under the seat is a joke. It's hard to use mainly becuase you can't put anything into it due to limited access space.However I really like that parent \"tray\" and the stroller tides very smoothly.Oh, and it's taller as any other strollers! (But I still couldn't walk without stepping on it even though I am not a tall person).To conclude my review, it's a great stroller for under $30 price range. I am glad we have it as our travel stroller! And the color is nice too! ;)
We used to use this a lot.  But we left it sitting on our back porch over the summer.  It became covered in mildew and there is no way to clean it so we had to throw it out.
I just got this stroller today at Burlington Coat Factory for pretty much the same price. I wanted something light weight but not too small like a regular umbrella stroller. I wanted it to have a basket and be able to hold a child up to 50lbs. This pretty much matched what I was looking for. I love that I can take off the cup holder part and able to wash it when it gets dirty. I love that I can move the sunshade part on and off the stroller to have it a little higher or lower. Maybe would've liked it a little bigger but non the less still works nicely. My 23 month old son was already climbing in it and I noticed when sitting in it he looked very comfortable. I noticed that in the back their is a rope/string you can tighten to make the back sit up more just a little bit. When not tightened it does look like my son will still be able to sleep well in it without his head going forward or hitting the bar on the side. Only negatives I would say is not having a cup holder in front of the child and the sunshade not being a little bigger. The material seems like it should last long and is pretty strong too. It doesn't seem like it is too cheap of material. It was more in my price range and I wanted something that wasn't too cheap or something that was too expensive and that would last a good amount of time. So this is pretty much what I expected for it!
I don't have the same problems as others with feet hitting the wheels, but I do hate how small the umbrella on this is. Don't get me wrong, I knew that when I bought it, but I didn't realize just how USELESS it is. I ended up just taking it off. It does not cover any bit of my LO from the sun. My little one is better off with sunblock and a hat on. I also don't find it easy to put ANYTHING in the basket, the bars that crisscross take up so much room. Overall I still like it though.
This is a great lightweight stroller! It folds up/down easily, is light and easy to carry, and fits easily into the trunk of our car. It doesn't have a lot of storage space under the seat, but so far that hasn't been a problem for us. My feet don't hit the wheels when we go on walks and I don't have to bend over to walk with it, either. My only complaints with the stroller are that the \"umbrella\" only provides shade when the sun is in a specific position in the sky, otherwise it's useless and the tires/wheels aren't that great. They move very smoothly and all, but they are more rubbery/plastic than actual tires. I noticed after we purchased this stroller that The First Years makes another model with better wheels for a little bit more; if I had known before I purchased I might have paid a little more for the better wheels. Next time I will be more thorough, I guess. Otherwise, this has been a great stroller and we plan on using it for many years to come.
We purchased this stroller for a family trip to Six Flags mainly because it would fit nicely in the back seat of my oldest sons truck and it's a nice light weight stroller. It's a great stroller, only down fall is it's not as great for taller people as they say it is and the basket is smaller than it looks in the photo. My hubby is 6ft2 and this stroller bothers his back to push. The 5 point harness is great because my baby is just like his older brother was and tries to wiggle out. I only wish this was available 16 years ago when my oldest was in a stroller!! My son seems extremely comfortable when he's in it.Still LOVING this stroller!! It still gets used regularly and am not having any of the wheel problems I've read about in other posts. Just the foam torn on the handle from normal use. In fact we need to purchase a second one for our new daughter! We have a tandem stroller, but would much rather use this one in certain places.
We use this thing ALL the time. Held up perfect, still looks brand new. It folds up very nice, and when my son is in it, he seems comfortable, and still can see everything.
this stroller works well.  ONly complaint is that the umbrella is pretty much useless.  Its way too small and it doesnt stay in place.  The umbrella also makes it hard to fold the stroller cause it can get in the way.  I eventually took off the umbrella.  I got the green and black color and it looks great.  The basket underneath is very small but it can hold the essentials.  This stroller is worth the $40 I paid for it.  Did not want to spend anymore for and expensive one, plus I have a double stroller I use more frequently for my twins.Update: September 11, 2013.  I've been using this stroller for over two years.  Got it when my twin boys were 1 1/2 and now they are 4.  They're your average size 4 year old and this stroller still fits them.  They don't sit in a stroller much, but I bring it on trips that I know will eventually tire them of walking; such as the fair, or amusement parks.  Definitely worth the $40 I paid for it, and gotten many use out of it.  Still in great condition, just run it through with a water house from time to time.  I gave it an extra star for lasting so long and I will be able to use it still when I plan to have another child.
I like this stroller because of the weight limit is nice and it's not cheaply made or flimsy like the ones you can buy anywhere for 12 bucks. This is a nice sturdy stroller. My daughter is petite but she likes it, doesn't complain like she does in her big E. B. stroller. The only down fall so are is the sunshade, it's not very big, but it's not a deal breaker. The basket on the bottom is nice to have also, it's not large but it can fit a baby carrier, a small bag and maybe a small purse. I also like the small pockets by the handles. It has a closed pocket, and 1 large and 2 small small pockets. This is great for snacks and sippy cups. I'm 5'1 and feel that the handles are a little high up for me, but my husband feels comfy pushing it. It's nice a light weight, which is another plus when you have to put it in your car. This is great!
This stroller is excellent, especially for the low price. The higher handles are perfect for me and my husband (6'2\"). Sturdy construction with a slightly padded seat. Folds up easily and is lightweight. Five-point harness is wonderful. It handles very well and is much smaller than the travel system strollers, but is plenty big for our 10 month old. Only negative so far: You have to take off the canopy and put it back on each time since it doesn't stay connected when the stroller is folded up. All things considered, it is a great umbrella stroller!
I got this stroller on a lightning deal for $38 and so far am really pleased with my purchase.Pros:It is extremely light weight and takes up very little space when folded.  Easy to carry one handed which is important to me while wrangling a one year old.  My son seems very comfortable in it and will continue to sit in it at home after our walks.  Generally easy to maneuver, a little difficult with one hand, but not terrible and I am not often pushing it with one hand anyway.  The parents storage area has enough room for my phone, water bottle, and keys.  Definitely a lot smaller and easier to maneuver in stores than the stroller we had previously (Chicco Cortina).  One of my other apprehensions with a cheaper umbrella stroller was always the fear that the handles would be too short.  I am 5'9&#34; and have no troubles pushing this stroller.  I don't feel hunched over.  There is a small storage area under the seat as well, not big by any means... but still a bonus.Cons:  I can't fold it up easily with one hand.  The locking mechanism on the bottom is supposed to be able to hit with your foot and then able to be folded.  I'm in Florida and an avid flip flop enthusiast and I can't do it in my flip flops.  Granted, this is not a product flaw because if I wore tennis shoes it wouldn't be an issue, but it is still a minor annoyance for me.  Occasionally I will kick the wheels while walking.  Especially if we're going faster than normal.Over all, I really like it.  Especially for only $40ish.
Love the color scheme of this black and green stroller.  It's very light weight and folds up very easily and compactly. The only reason I did not give it 5 stars was because for me and my husband (5' 8\" and 6' 1\") we need the handle bars to extend further. When typically have to walk to the side of it so we aren't kicking the stroller as we walk. Additionally, the basket below is pretty hard to access if you have a larger object you are wanting to store. Despite the two negatives, I would recommend this product based on it's mere value.
I just ordered this a few weeks ago for my little girl. We had a bigger stroller and wanted to down size to something a little smaller and more convenient. I knew a few people who had this one and really liked it so we got it too. Its SUPER easy to open and fold back up.
I really wanted to LOVE this stroller.  If it wasn't for the problem I had with the front left wheel wobbling every time I would go over a crack in a sidewalk when I first purchased it, I would have been a very happy camper.I will say this...their customer service is excellent.  I called and they offered to send a replacement wheel.  Strangely, by the time it arrived the stroller had miraculously fixed itself.  Perhaps I had not snapped it in enough?  Sometimes though when I back the stroller up and then try to go forward it takes me a few tries before the wheels properly align so that I can move forward.  I never experienced this before.The only other issue I have is with the length of the straps for the upper part of the five point harness.  My son is 2 1/2 years old and it is too snug on him.  I expected more from a stroller that claims it has a 50 lb requirement.  The reason I sold my Chicco Capri was because of this very reason, the straps were too snug for him.  That aside, the bottom part of the strap, the three point harness is a good size and width so it is sufficient.Now the pros....now that the wheels are working it really is a smooth ride.  I used to have a Maclaren and hated it because of how bumpy the ride was going over crevices in the sidewalk, etc.  So I'm really pleased with this.  Also the built in parent console is awesome.  I don't mind that the size of the canopy is fairly small because I have a sun visor that I slip on it and I get full coverage.  Don't expect much from the basket...it's really small.Overall not bad for the price you pay and my son seems very comfortable in it.  It's also nice and light which is what I needed.I would recommend this to my friends, with a little warning about the wheels.  Not everyone experiences this issue, but I do know a couple of other reviewers who did.  The excellent customer service compensates for this issue though.
I have been looking for a while for just this stroller. I was looking for something to put in the back of the car for mall and short grocery shopping. Also I didn't want it to look cheap, it needed a sun shade and needed to fit my skinny one year old. And something under $40. Finally, this fits the bill.The stroller was tightly packaged and all the end parts were covered with foam. The 4 sets of wheels were easy to pop on, though I probably should have turned the lights on to see the direction arrow because I ended up putting the first one on upside down. No problem, though, it was easy to follow their instructions to push a button and pop it off. It took me 10 minutes to put together with a toddler crawling all over me and it, which I categorize as a success.Cons: the back is not breathable, so summers might be a little rough with back-sweat. Also, it claims to have recline, and although it does, it probably only reclines about 2 inches at best. I would not get this for that feature, it's pretty lame actually.I got it in all black because I didn't want it to look dirty after a while. The stroller is good for up to 50 pounds, though honestly if my child still wants to be in a stroller when he's 7, we've got issues.
The perfect secondary stroller! We keep this stroller at our house (grandparents) so we don't have to bring our granddaughter's heavier, albeit  much nicer stroller every time she comes over (4 days/week).  This one is extremely lightweight, a plus for me since I have shoulder problems and is comfortable for her. The recline is so slight as to be non-existent, but is sufficient for our purposes.  We take short strolls around the neighborhood and around the mall.
When my babies get older I love the lightweight convenience of an umbrella stroller, but hate losing the extra features of a full size stroller.  This one solves that problem.  You still have storage and cup holder areas for the parent and storage underneath the seat.  It's not a huge amount of space, but enough and definitely better than nothing.
We wanted a very light second stroller for the car, 11 lbs or under.  I folded and lifted many strollers between 10 and 16 lbs and those few extra pounds really make a difference when you have a chunky toddler on your hip. I strongly considered a $20 Kolcraft umbrella stroller (only 7 lbs!) but then decided that I really wanted a sun canopy and a basket (even if small) and wanted our 36-lb 4-old year old to be able to use it in a pinch.After a ton of online research and several hours in 3 big box baby stores testing strollers with the help of my 4-year-old, I settled on the Jet.  At the risk of repeating the existing reviews, I'll try to summarize my findings in case they can be helpful:Jet:  Good height and maneuverability.  Love that it comes with a parent organizer.  Compact fold and light weight.  The seat back stopped short of my daughter's head but she said it was comfy anyway and showed me that she could rest by leaning her head to the side.  Not a huge issue for me as my 1-year-old will be the primary occupant and he very seldom naps in strollers.  As others have said, the canopy is a joke but it sounds like many have had success with the inexpensive Summer Infant canopy extender so I'll likely give that a try.  Fold locking mechanism is stiff and annoying, and the basket is definitely not easy to access but I can live with those minor inconveniences.  I am a little concerned about durability based on the reviews, but at this price, that's a chance I am willing to take.C6:  By far the most comfortable and substantial seat with nice padding on the straps, and love that it comes with a carrying bag, but compared to the Jet, it felt flimsy.  Way too much flex in the frame when pushing my 4-year-old.  (I would note that the one I tested at Burlington Coat Factory must have been an older model because the crotch strap was at the edge of the seat, not the middle as many have noted with newer models.  The harness fit her very comfortably.  I also looked at the current model with the crotch strap fixed in the middle of the seat and it appears that it would be nearly impossible to squeeze a larger baby/toddler in).Volo:  Clearly a superior product in every way.  What sets the Volo apart from the others I tested:  quality fabric, removable/washable seat, better canopy, step on/step off linked brakes, much easier to operate the fold locking feature, better basket access, attached carrying strap.  Lightest of the bunch--8.8 lbs, they say. Note, though, that the Volo seat is exactly the same height as the Jet's.  The Volo was  also by far the tippiest of the strollers I tried.  As in, you lay a finger on the handle of the empty stroller and the thing starts to tip back.  I think this is because the handles are angled back further which decreases your chance of kicking the wheels--so it's a trade off.  If I were going to be using my lightweight stroller frequently and taking it on/off public transportation, I'd definitely go with the Volo or, finances permitting, an Uppababy G-Lite.BRU Deluxe Umbrella:  seems to fit in this class of strollers, although it's a little heavier at about 13 lbs.  It had some nice features like a pretty good canopy and nice padding on the harness, but the seat back seemed flimsy and to offer very little support. Like the Jet, the \"recline\" is only a inch or two.  Handles were shorter than the Jet/Volo.  The folding release levers are at hand level, right beneath the handles. Not sure whether that's good or bad, just different from the others.Happy strolling!
We like this stroller because it is light weight and easy to fold up and store. Perfect for traveling! What we don't like is the sun shade-it falls down a lot, hitting my son (lightly) on the arms. The bottom basket is really small but we didn't expect anything large. You won't be able to fit your baby bag anywhere on this stroller. However the top bottle holders and little pocket area for keys/phone etc. is great. The 5 point harness is nice and easy to close and open. Overall a great buy!
We keep this stroller in our trunk and have used it several times. It's easy to fold, the harness is comfortable for our son, and the tan seat doesn't get too hot in the sun.
Bought this for traveling and it works great! Easy to fold up and unfold and light weight. Only issue I have is that the storage bin underneath is a bit small but that is to be expected with a stroller this size. Love that it has a cup holder and it holds a lot! I had a coffee, juice and a water cup in it at the airport. Seat seems comfortable for my toddler too. Nice stroller for traveling!
I bought this to replace a larger Jeep stroller that I had for many years. I wanted something lightweight and portable because I travel, but also sturdy enough with good storage. This fit the bill for me. Some things to note, it does not recline very far. I mean it barely reclines. It doesn't bother me, my little one sleeps just fine anyway. The basket underneath can be tricky to get into. The stroller doesn't have a cupholder but it has a fabric storage bag that is kinda cool. It does hold cups, but because it is fabric it isn't very shockproof. So, make sure you have a lid, or something that closes. The shade pops on and off, and I learned that you cannot fold the stroller without it popping off on one side. So I take it off. I am short, 5 ft 2, so it is a good height for me. The brakes are easy to use. The hippo print is cute. It folds easily and is lightweight. Much better than a cheapo umbrella stroller! I would have liked a bigger storage area, and hard plastic cupholder.
I got this quickly and it looks like it will be wonderful for our trip to Disney World, but I did want to let you know the back of it isn't satin-y material, its cream with pink designs on it.  Its still super cute, so I'm happy with it, but it doesn't look like the picture for sure.
LOVE this stroller. It's the perfect umbrella stroller. I actually like it better than out big fancy strollers since it's nice and light and I can just leave it in the car all the time without it taking up my whole trunk. Just purchased my 3rd one I like them so much!  I think we will bring two of these to Disney instead of our big double stroller.
I gave this three stars because the price was not exorbitant, so I figure I got what I paid for.  This is a functional stroller, but I guess I was hoping for more.My son is 30 pounds and this stroller is supposed to hold up to 50 pounds.  I would say that 30 pounds is probably the max you would want to put in here.  Luckily he is shaped tall and thin, so he fit within the narrow seat, though when I put his winter jacket on him, he puffs over the sides.  After one month of use (2-3 times per week for short distances), the wheels are sort of rickety.  We mainly use the stroller on city streets, so it is not a clean indoor mall type setting, but it is also not like off-roading.  The stroller operates like we tried to mountain bike with it, and my son is well within the advertised weight limit so I am not thrilled with the quality.One of the main reasons I got this stroller was for the recline function.  This stroller really does not recline.  There is a string you can pull to make the material tighter or looser, but the child can only recline about two inches.I would probably buy a cheaper umbrella stroller if I were going to do it all over, because that is what this is--an average umbrella stroller.
I am 5'10 and my husband is 6'4 and I've been looking for a lightweight stroller for a long time - my son is now a year and a half old. I really like the height - its still a bit short and I do kick the wheels on occasion, but not nearly as bad as the other half dozen I've tried. I like that I can steer it with one hand, and the cup holder at the top is amazingly convenient. It folds easily, though the latch to hold it together gets caught 9/10 times and I have to reopen it to pull the red latch and reclose. The plastic wheels seem like they could break easily and they don't always ride evenly on the ground, but they have not caught or pulled funny yet.As for the way my son sits in it, I don't buckle the shoulder straps, only at the waist, but I think these would be short on him if I tried, and they tell me he is short for his age. The bottom of the seat is quite long, so it should be more comfortable as he gets older and bigger, but when I first put him in, his legs stuck straight out. I feel like he still slouches a bit to be able to bend his knees properly.The underneath compartment is roomier than I anticipated after reading the reviews, but it is very hard to get to. You have to wedge the items in on the side or inbetween the metal crossbars in the back. So no huge diaper bag, but definitely large enough to hold several essential items, even if you have to pull them out one at a time.I would probably buy it again, simply for the height factor at this price level.
The canopy is useless, you can't position it, it's either directly above the baby or covering their face, zero sun protection and it doesn't collapse nicely with the rest of the stroller so I just removed it entirely. The cup holder pouch ripped on the first use. This stroller is not worth more $10 if you asked me!
I love this stroller. I use it everywhere I go. I even take it with me when I go for a walk with my daughter everyday. Easy to set up and take apart.
Fantastic as it moves well generally, is small but plenty tall w/ storage... it stays in my vehicle and I travel with it too!  Only problem is the sunshield does not adjust down or up so you have to come up with your own system to shade eyes depending on sun angle...
The rubber bar across the bottom was ripped nearly in two when we received the product. That isn't Amazon's fault, yet they took it back immediately and refunded my money.The recline is awful and I wouldn't recommend this product to anyone with a child who cannot REALLY hold himself/herself up. My 8 month old did fine, but I was hoping to have enough recline that he could fall asleep when we were out & about. Not so much.I docked 1 star for the \"recline\" feature being anything but.I docked another star for the rubber bar being ripped upon receiving.I would have kept the product if the bar had not been ripped almost in half.
This is a good stroller but not great. I needed it for international travel and after trying it out I returned it as I was afraid it might break while away on my trip. I ended up splurging on the uppababy glite and am so happy!
We have owned this stroller for 20 months now, and have been using it exclusively for about 15 months.  We have the green/black stroller.Pros:-Very lightweight, easy to lift in and out of the car-Comfortable for the child-5 point harness keeps the child in her seat!-Handles are in a nice, comfortable position for pushing-Green/black doesn't show dirt or stains very easily.-Basket is easy to access and holds small bags or items.Cons:-Clip to lock the stroller in the folded position gets stuck behind the frame easily during folding and then can't be unstuck without unfolding the stroller again.-Lack of recline; it does recline a little but not enough to use with an infant or for a sleeping child.  If it reclined more, I would have given it 5 stars because I do love using this stroller but hesitate on long outings since it's hard to sleep in.-Green/black is not really a pretty color.  The green is more neon lime green/yellowish.  It's not a pretty spring green like it seems in the picture.-Basket doesn't hold a full, full-sized diaper bag.  I can fit a smaller bag or use the full sized bag but only if the full sized bag is packed lightly for a quick outing, not for a long all day outing.  Then I just have to carry the bag.Overall I have been very pleased with this stroller, and I wish that First Years made a double stroller identical to this one, just with two side-by-side seats!  I would buy it in a heartbeat, now that we have two kids.  If they added more recline to the stroller, I would even be willing to pay slightly more for another one seater!
It's light but for going out very quickly. But if  the baby need to nap, it's not useful. My baby still naps during day.
Title says it all.  This is the perfect umbrella stroller but not a piece of junk you get at the local baby store.  For an extra $15, it's totally worth it.  It's not an all-terrain stroller but if you are looking for something light, with a cup holder, to just grab and go, this works great.  Can easily fold and lift with one hand and not break your back in the process.  Sun-shade is pretty marginal but considering how the stroller folds, not sure how you get a great sun-shade.  Plus, when we use this stroller, we aren't on long walks in the sun.  This is more for running errands.
We bought another one to stay at our parents' and the newer model seems to be roomier. Found it to be excellent value. We didn't want to spend much but wanted a good quality umbrella that we can use for hopefully as long as the kids need (not just one summer). We've brought our old one on several plane rides and countless long road trips. It's our go to stroller and we've used it for at least 2.5 years.The only complaint is that the handle grips eventually wear out. We have replacement ones on them and that's ok but still not as good as the nice snug grips it came with.Easy to fold up and fairly light weight for a petite mom (5'3\"). Wheels don't seem to get stuck in a position like I find some of the other umbrellas do. Canopy doesn't exactly block much sun but is extremely useful for using a rain cover on (use generic Jolly Jumper one). I just use regular clips on the bottom pockets to hold the rain cover in place so it doesn't flap around or smush my babe's face. Enough room in the basket for a few groceries and diaper changing pad. Can clip massive diaper bag on, just make sure you weight the bottom too, otherwise when kid jumps out, down goes your stroller!
I am posting this review because after receiving my jet I was disappointed that it was not more like my ignite even though the descriptions are the same and I got no decent response from the First years when I emailed!!  I really wanted a boy blue stroller!I have both.......we have the pink dot ignite and navy jet......unfortunately I owned the igngite first, so I was spoiled. But the jet is a nice stroller and better than a small umbrella stroller or the evenflo xsport we had.The Ignite has much sturdier fab
The canopy on ours is like off center.  It's not a big deal but it came like this probably due to shipping.  So it kinda juts out like 10-15 degrees to the side.  It's more of an annoyance than anything else.Other than that I like this stroller.  We have an Uppababy Vista that we use for the more heavy duty trips, but sometimes we just want something light and easy to bring around and not take up so much real estate.  This is pretty maneuverable and works well for an umbrella stroller.  It's a little more expensive than the cheapos, but it's also better quality.  A little more space to place things would be nice, but that's probably something that exists on any umbrella stroller.
We got this as a replacement for a Cosco piece of junk that came from target. This one has taller handles, which is great because I'm a 6'5&#34; Dad, and no bar across the back wheels for me to kick with my size 13's. Overall it works just fine and we are pleased with it!
Bought this for Grandma's house. She loves it, and my 5 mo old son does too. No frills stroller, gets the job done. However, I had to purchase a seperate sun shade. As other reviews state the shade that comes with it is worthless. It was between this one and the Ignite. I chose this due the lower price. Even with the extra purchase of the sun shade, still came out cheaper and probably still would have had to purchase a seperate shade for the Ignite to achieve the amount of shade I perfer. The pros on this that really worked for us is that it is lightweight and super easy to fold and unfold. Which is perfect for Grandma. I wouldn't purchase until your child can hold his head up well, the recline is nothing to write home about. But, my boy likes sitting up all the time to see what is going on. If you want to spend more $$ and want something nicer, I suggest the Chicco Liteway. We have this and LOVE it. Feels like a luxury stoller. Great recline, goes over uneven sidewalks and grass easily. And the sun shade on the Liteway is wonderful. My son loves it, and ussually ends up falling asleep in it at the end of our walks. I can put the recline down easily and not wake him up.
Exactly what I was looking for. Perfect for my 5'7&#34; height too. Colors are awesome. Only complaint is the sunshade is too small.
I LOVE IT! If you're looking for a cheap, light weight, and easy-to-fold stroller, you just found it!PROS:- It's light weight. I can easily carry my 20 pound baby in the stroller down the stairs.- The parent &#34;tray&#34; is really convenient. It holds my phone, a water bottle, my son's bottle, keys...- It's easy to assemble. It took me less than 5 minutes to set up.- It's easy to fold, it takes about 10 seconds.- It's easy to push.- It's sturdy, not cheap looking or feeling at all.- I like the style of this stroller a lot, it looks good.CONS:- The back is not breathable, so my baby's back get sweaty pretty quickly in the summer.- The umbrella/sun shade is small.I would highly recommend buying this stroller
Nice and easy to use. Needed an extra light weight stroller for my husbands car and it's been great.  Taller handles so its comfortable for my husband and it's way more durable than the $29 umbrollas.  The wheels arent as smooth but not terrible and the \"canopy\" is good for nothing. again, does the job as a quick and easy stroller.
I debated long and hard between this and the other First Years stroller. I am certain I made the right decision here. The stroller arrived today and as I was assembling the first thing that I noticed is that it doesn't have those cheap, hard plastic wheels that crack and break easily. They aren't the heavy-duty rubber wheels but rather a soft plastic/rubber. I hope this means that they will be more durable and last a little longer. It's smaller than I expected but I really like the compact design. The storage area isn't huge but I like the beverage/item holder on the back. The color is great (we got the teal one) and I am very excited to start using it!
There are a lot of good things about this stroller.  It folds into a umbrella stroller-like compactness, but yet seems very solid and usable.  The 5 point harness is great and easy to use.  And the cup holders are certainly an added bonus.  The handles are certainly longer than on a typical umbrella stroller, but I still have to be careful not to kick the wheels when I walk (I'm 6'0&#34;).  The only other issue I have is that it doesn't seem to turn very well.  When I'm pushing my 6 month daughter on a slick floor like in a mall, sometimes the front wheels don't turn enough and they end up sliding.  While on a more grippy floor it works much better.  I am hoping that the wheels just need to break in some, because I had tried out this stroller at a local store first and did not feel this issue.
It's very inexpensive and worked just fine for about a year, but it's just too flimsy. One of the wheels is constantly rotating all over the place, the shade is completely bent and the storage area is much too small. Also, the handlebar is really low. I liked this stroller just fine, but considering we will use it for a few years I regret not just putting the money down for a really quality stroller that will last and also meet all of our needs.Okay.
I bought this because our other umbrella stroller did not have the shoulder straps. I wanted them so I did not have to worry about my 9 month old daughter falling forward out of it in the airport. The straps were very easy to adjust and it folds up very easily. The handles did get slightly ripped during handling when we gate checked the stroller. Not much we could do to avoid that. It handles well and it is tall enough that toy don't feel like you are bending over to push it. I recommend it over the Jeep umbrella stroller that we have (we mostly chose that one because of the mesh back since we live in AZ), which only has the waist strap. The Jet also has a very slight recline. It is enough to feel like your baby isn't sitting up too straight, but not enough for a child to lay down for a nap. Highly recommend this stroller.
I give this stroller a five-star as a second stroller. As a main stroller, this would be like a 2-star stroller. It is a simple, affordable, umbrella stroller and doesn't have all the luxury of a more expensive stroller, but I just wanted something light and simple for a second stroller and this is perfect. (I also have a video review on this stroller [...])PROS:-Light-weight (11 lbs).-Very easy to open and fold.-Folds very compact. Fits any trunk.-Pretty easy to maneuver.-Does not tip over when I hang my diaper bag from the handle. (If you put enough weight, it will tip over.)-Five point harness.(This was an important feature to me that cheaper umbrella strollers didn't have. My baby's 7-month and still kind of wobbly when sitting up, so 3-point harness just didn't seem safe.)-Parents storage for cups and small items like keys, cell phone, and wallet.-Small basket underneath (Cannot hold a full-size diaper bag, but can hold some stuff like a couple of water bottles, light blanket, and a jacket.)-Tall handles for an umbrella stroller. No hunching over.-High weight capacity of 50lbs. Although the seat back is pretty short.CONS:-Canopy does not provide a lot of shade (More about the canopy below)-Front wheels do not lock straight-Seat recline is minimum (You could say it's non-existent)-No baby bumper bar-Manual lock instead of automatic lock for keeping it folded.-Baby's feet dangle in the air (There is a foot rest for a toddler)Obviously, this is not a good stroller if you want your child to nap in it, or want to go on bumpy roads. And you will probably need a canopy extension like Protect-a-bub or Ray Shade if you're going to be out in the sun for a long time. Also, because it doesn't recline much at all and does not accept an infant car seat, you can't use it for a young baby who can't support their upper body yet.But I bought this as a second stroller to always keep in my trunk to use for quick trips, and this does the job very well. We also plan to use this one for air travel because last time we flew with United, we gate-checked our main stroller (Zooper Waltz 2011) and it got dirty and scratched up.A lot of people are complaining about the canopy being useless. I agree that it is a pretty small canopy, but I found that if you attach it really low on the frame, you can actually get a pretty decent shade for smaller babies too. The canopy has two clips that go on the frame and velcro straps to attach the back, and you can attach it to pretty much anywhere on the frame. For my 7-month-old, I attached it way down low so that the clips go right above the red plastic piece to lock the stroller folded. It's still not enough a lot of times, but  it's not completely useless. Even when the canopy is attached all the way down like that, I can still fold the stroller no problem. I tried attaching it at different heights and some heights make it hard to fold the stroller, but it works pretty well at most points.Also, some people are complaining that you can't fold the stroller with the canopy on. I think they must have forgotten to retract the canopy.I got this for $40 on Amazon and I think that's a great price for the value. It totally beats Maclaren Volo which is pretty much the same thing and costs over $100.
Really comfortable and convenient for young children. Very lightweight, easy to clean and good quality material. It was very good acquisition!
As far as umbrella strollers go, this one is good, but the product description says that reclines.  It does not. The adjustable reclining seat only lays back maybe two inches. I wanted something that would actually lay down but was still light weight. Chicco makes one, but it was too pricey for me. Despite my disappointment, I did keep this stroller, but if your looking for something that truly does recline, this isn't the stroller for you.
I just purchased my second The First Years Jet stroller to keep at my family's vacation home and think that this is a great stroller for short walks and errands.  I keep one in my car at home for errands too.  The under-seat storage basket is a decent size (though you may end up having to lift your child up a bit to access things in the basket).  The organizer that comes with the stroller is great for an adult cup, a kid-sized cup, keys, a phone, toys, etc., as it is quite large and fairly sturdy.  I am 5'4&#34; and have had no issues with my stride while walking with this stroller.  Other family members (5'7&#34; and 6') did notice that they kicked the wheels at times when walking with this stroller, or thought that the handles didn't come up high enough for them (the 6' person said this latter comment).  I've used my home stroller for about a year and the wheels have just started to squeak, but a little WD-40 fixed that problem in a few seconds.  The seat seems nice and comfortable for my 18 month old, and she enjoys riding in this stroller.  I use straps to attach toys/sippy cups/snack cups to the stroller since there is no tray.
I bought this as a secondary stroller for a short walk around the house. The shade is absolutely useless and it might as well not be there. The maneuver is not too bad but the seat is comfy. So, for my purposes it works well. It folds very small and is light to carry around.
Before my husband and I went on our road trip with our 9 month old we decided to look for a lightweight stroller to pack for the trip instead of our bulky big one. After reading many reviews we decided on the Jet and we're so glad we did!On our trip we decided to take our baby for a walk in a park but didn't realize that halfway through the walking path it turned to gravel and rock. We were worried that the stroller couldn't handle it but it did. It might have been a bumpy ride for our baby but she didn't mind. Another day we took the stroller in town and it was all cobble stone, once again the stroller held strong and we were so impressed! The shade was also very nice for the sunny days, which at first I was upset that it was up so high, but then realized that you can adjust the height of it to fit your child, very convenient.A few things I wish were different are that my 9 month old looked hunched over a bit and the recline is pretty ridiculous. There is very little difference when you recline it or have it upright all the way. I also wish there was a strap to carry the stroller over your shoulder when you have it folded it. My husband also said that he wished the handle bars could be a bit higher, but this wasn't a problem for me.Pros:Easy to assembleCan withstand multiple types of groundAdjustable shadeLightweightCons:The back makes a smaller child slump downNo strap to carry when folded up
We got this to travel with. It's been on several flights, and it's held up well being gate checked in a bag. Our only other stroller is a BOB Jogging Stroller. Compared to the BOB it's a real pain to push because two hands are needed... but that's just in comparison to a super smooth, three-wheeled beast of a stroller. For what this is, it's great.
I got this, being a 'goth mom', I  was so excited to find a stroller that was black and red AND had skulls on it! It is compact (to fit in my MINI Cooper too). The skulls are only on the 'sun screen&#34;  But thats OK. The stroller is also a decent stroller to use too. I didn't know that the canvas 'caddy' on the back also came with it.Nice for a bottle of water and your smart phone. There is a small basket underneath. Not very deep, but I wasn't expecting it. I could fit a blanket and my purse under there. And it was tall enough for my 6'2 husband to use without hunching (which i thought would be a problem with most umbrella strollers)
My title pretty much sums it up. This stroller is just &#34;fine&#34;. It's lightweight, easily foldable, and no-nonsense.My problem is the wheels' inability to handle slicker flooring (think: flooring at Old Navy, Buy Buy Baby, Target, etc.). You know how those stores have that slick, white tile? Well, my tires will not turn/rotate on those flooring surfaces. So, it's like pushing a flimsy, fixed-wheel stroller. If my daughter (2.5 years, 28lbs) leans forward, the weight distribution makes it even more awkward to push. So, it's really more uncomfortable to push that it is a &#34;quick means of running into a store with a child.&#34; It's kinda difficult to explain in a review, but to put it plainly, what should be a life-saver is actually a slightly bigger pain in the rear than it's designed to be.
This stroller was a great deal. It is sturdy and durable. I have a Chicco stroller system I love, but was looking for an umbrella-style stroller that could be taken on family trips and didn't take up so much room. This stroller is perfect and so much more than I was expecting. I had looked at some umbrella-style strollers at a baby dept. store and they were so cheaply made and flimsy, that that was what I was expecting when I opened the box -- I figured unless you spent lots of money all umbrella strollers were all the same sort of quality. This stroller was about the same price as the dept store models and is so much better than those other versions.
I purchased this stroller to replace a Kmart a compact stroller that was TERRIBLE! I have a bigger graco stroller but wanted something to be able to take into stores that did not fit my big graco stroller. This is perfect for taller people. Im 5'9 and my husband is 6'1 and its perfect! It drives like a dream and fits my 20 month old (who is 28lbs and wears 2t-3t clothes) I think she is alot more comfortable in this one than the bargain K-mart one. Plus there is a good amount of storage and nice sun shade packed into such a small compack stroller!! Get this one!!!! You wont be let down!
The basket is very small...you can't fit anything in it...ok...you can maybe fit a towel in it...a small towel...nicely folded. The &#34;sun shade&#34; also does basically nothing...it takes up a small amount of space in your trunk and at 11lbs it's light-ish but not as light as I expected...I would say, save your money and get a cheap-o one at babies'r'us...the only difference between this one and the 20$ ones they have there is the basically non-exsistant basket. Definitely feeling some buyers remorse about this purchase.
I did a lot of research before deciding on this umbrella stroller. After my lil' one had outgrown her infant carrier, I didn't feel like lugging the clunky travel system type stroller on quick shopping trips anymore. I didn't want to spend the money on a Maclaren or something like that, so in this price range (under $50), this stroller wins! It has a nice storage basket (accessible from the sides), and the parent \"console\" is very cool... It holds my drink, a sippy, snack cup, sunglasses and keys easily (it actually holds more than my full size stroller!) I got it in City Chic (all black) and I think it gives it a nicer, high-end look...and it hides dirt well I guess too! The wheel locks work great. The padded handles are nice and it's a good height for me (5'2\"), as well as my 6'+ husband. The sun shade is pretty nice size for an umbrella stroller too. Daughter loves riding around in it and seems very comfortable... It doesn't get hot in the seat like our highly-padded Chicco. It folds easily (though not really one-handed) and takes up minimal space in the trunk. I would use the full size stroller if we were doing a full day at an amusement park, for example, but this is definitely our everyday go-to! Love it.
Purchased to take traveling by plane because I didn't want to dare ruin my City Mini with the careless baggage handlers.  The wheels on this are slightly big and after our first flight from IAH to LAX the rear right wheel was already bent up.  My sister bought a cheapy umbrella stroller from babies r us with smaller sized wheels and that thing lasted 4 trips to Hawaii.  Bummed it only took one leg of our trip to mess the wheel up. Rides okay, although I find myself backing up and moving forward a lot to align the wheels. Wouldn't purchase again.
I bought this stroller when my son was 6 weeks old. (owned it for 4 months now). I couldn't stand the big jogging stroller travel system I had. It was TOO BIG! I needed something small to push my son around in stores and quick trips, and this is PERFECT! The seat is deeper so he sits further back in it, which is the big difference between this stroller and a cheap umbrella stroller.  When he was 2 months old and very small, I would buckle him in and then put some receiving blankets rolled up behind his arms to \"squish\" him in, and it worked perfect!  He must have been comfy because he feel asleep all the time. Now that he's 5 months old, he fits into it fine without any blankets.  We've brought this stroller on the plane and it's awesome. I felt so bad for those moms that had brought their big strollers and were holding their kids while trying to fold down those huge strollers.There are just a few things I would change (thus the 4 star rating). I wish it was taller. I went searching for reviews for a stroller for taller people and read that this was good for that, but it's not. I'm 5'9 and it's not quite tall enough to be comfortable to push. The basket underneath is also useless. It's so shallow, especially once your child is in the seat. You could throw some toys under there, but that's about it. There is a cloth holder on top for a drink and some items, and this is great. I can fit a drink, keys, phone, and burp rags all in there. If you want to hang your bag from this, you'll need to buy those stroller clips. All in all, I'm pleased with this purchase!
First of all, this stroller does not recline an inch. The canopy is super small and useless. The only good thing about this is that its light and cheap.
I would not use this stroller in the street or in the woods.  But it got me through a day at the zoo.  It is a little short for me, 6'2'', but perfect for my wife, 5'4''.  It has cup holder built in, and it has a small storage pocket between the handles.  It rolls smooth, and collapses just fine.
We bought this for our daughter when she was 4 months old. She has always loved this stroller, and we do too. The strap height is adjustable and has grown with her. Now she's 2.5 and she still loves it. This has been a fantastic stroller to grow with her. She's 35\" and 29lbs, and she still has lots of room left to grow before she's too big.
Pros-Great colors-Folds relatively small-Padding makes sure kid is comfortable rather then sitting in a canopy where you can feel the under bar sticking through-Comfortable height for the average mom-The little compartments for things such as bottles, phones, and keys between the handlesCons-Doesn't turn very well-The Canopy is so small it's practically useless-The buckles can be a bit of a pain to get on with a squirming kid-The basket can be hard to get things in and out of because the seat sits so close to it (don't even think about trying to fit a full diaper bag)-No latch to keep the stroller folded once you fold it (edit: apparently there is a hinge lock that you can snap on and off, my husband took it off because it doesn't autolock like our Graco)-It wasn't very clear that you have to pull the red lever on the back towards you and then up to get the stroller to foldAll in all, I bought this when it went on sale ($35-$40 I think) and

I opted to buy this for vacations with my toddler grandson because last time I took my big jog stroller which is ideal but he was damaged at gate check and hard to fit into a rental car.  This does exactly what it claims.  I would not want to use this is my main stroller.  It is not easy to push in a straight line and the visor doesn't really cover the kids head or face. It is much nicer than the cheaper umbrella strollers though and also has a small basket underneath which will fit a few small items.  It is not easy to access but do-able.  It also has a place for drinks and a pouch for cell phone, etc.I am not disappointed because I knew what I was getting.  It will hang in the garage until our next trip.
Wonderful stroller!  Not sure why some people were saying it didn't stroll - perhaps they didn't put the wheels on correctly, because it strolls beautifully.  A very smooth ride.  It even goes over bumps smoother than my full size stroller.The handle height is GREAT (I'm 5'8 & we have a 6'2&#34; user as well).  It is SUPER easy to assemble.  All you have to do is pop on the wheels.My baby loves strollin' in this.
Read a lot of reviews and decided to get it anyway, oh what a mistake. My son is a small 2 year old child 32&#34; and 27 pounds. He barely fit! His head stuck out trumendously from the top. The stroller is not very sturdy, the concept is good but lacks in a lot of compartments. Price range is good though but simply not worth it for me. Send it back the next day! Also NO recline maybe an inch at that.! I do not recommend this product.
... that it requires two hands to steer it.  There is nothing one-handed about this thing.  My husband complains about it's poor handling all the time.  I didn't mind it so much at first, but as time goes by, I become more and more annoyed with it.  It is impossible to enjoy a nice cup of coffee and push this stroller.  I tried today, and it sloshed all over myself, the stroller, and the baby multiple times.  First-world problems, you say?  Well, sure.  Annoying as hell?  You betcha.  This review is for those other first-worlders who might actually want to be able to push a stroller and enjoy a cup of coffee / carry groceries / pull a suitcase (good luck with that last one, btw... I tried that on a recent trip, and it's impossible.  Plan to travel with someone else, even if it's just to get them to pull your suitcase around the airport for you).It's definitely compact and lightweight, so 3 stars for that.  The handling sucks, though.
I love this stroller it's not heavy at all, I also like the fact that the handles are high enough for my husband and short enough for me, I'm 5' and he's 5'11. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because the sun shade serves no purpose really, it is so short! 
I got this stroller after much research. I was hoping to find a not-too-expensive umbrella-style stroller that I'd feel comfortable pushing.  I am 5'8&#34; and have a hard time feeling comfortable pushing this around.  My feet kick the wheels constantly, I have to hunch over.  The handles need to be about 5 inches longer.  My husband who is several inches taller feels uncomfortable pushing it.  My toddler doesn't ride much in strollers so I have kept it.  It's ok for the once in a while trip somewhere.  If I had more $$ to spend on a stroller I would have returned it for a different one.
Don't recommend this product -- very expensive, basic umbrella stroller.  While it is lightweight, the canopy is a joke -- way too small to provide sun protection for my granddaughter and it doesn't recline at all.  There are a lot of better strollers out there. Keep looking!!!
This item got such good reviews and it was affordable so I gave it a try... Bad move!Not only is this thing hard to close (and lock with the plastic red hook), I kick the tires while walking and I can't seem to get used to it.  The overhead cover is too short to actually do anything, so you might as well take it off.  Also, no rain cover is included or sold by this brand. The underside basket is so small it's practically useless.I should have spent a little more and purchased a higher quality product.The only positive is that it comes with a built-in cup holder.Save your  money and buy something else.
This is very light, but still very sturdy.  It's easy to fold and cart around.  I bought it for airline travel but have ended up using it to do my around-town errands as well because it's so much easier to get in and out of the car.  That being said it is still an umbrella stroller and has limitations.  It's not great over uneven terrain (fine for sidewalks, horrible for grass.)  The sun shade is pretty much useless.  It doesn't have adjustable height handles so my husband (6'5&#34; and myself 5'6&#34;) have to be careful not to kick the wheels when we push it.  But the 5 point harness is great because my son is always trying to escape.  The recline feature doesn't really go back more than a couple of inches and so is also pretty useless.
Rather flimsy, I sold this one and purchased one from Sears instead. My biggest pet peeve was the canopy - downright useless.
Love this stroller.  The color is def. darker than what is picture, but its a great gender neutral color! I also love that you dont kick the wheels while you are walking.
This is a great stroller, but a couple of the wheels broke under normal use in the first week. Hopefully they won't be a pain about replacing them.
I scored this Jet stroller for only $36 with free shipping on Amazon. I kept watching until they lowered the price one day and then I nabbed it! I love it! It's very easy to open and close and the seat is very comfy. My daughter is 13 months and has plenty of room. I love the harness straps and they easily snap in place. The best thing about this stroller is the cup holder. It's soft canvas but still holds two cups easily, plus it has an area in the middle for keys, pacifier, wipes, whatever. The only downside to this is the rain canopy. It doesn't go very far over the child's head and it doesn't block the sun or the rain AT ALL! I just took it off, because when you fold it, the wheels touch it and make it dirty, so it's better with it off. The handles are comfy and easy to hold and it pushes like a dream, and it's a nice size so that my feet don't kick it when I walk. I'm 5'5. I always had the super cheap umbrella strollers with no shoulder straps, just the waist strap and no cup holders. Now that I have this stroller, I'll never buy a cheap one again!
We didn't want to bring our bulky stroller on vacation, so we picked this up to help manage our toddler in the airport - super helpful to have! It's very basic, but it worked great for us.  It's inexpensive enough that I wasn't worried about baggage handlers tossing it around.
I bought this because I wanted a small stroller in case I didn't want to lug my jogging stroller around and this has been perfect.  I like it because I'm pretty tall (5' 10&#34;) and I don't have to bend over to use this like every other umbrella stroller I've looked at.  The basket underneath is difficult to get into so we rarely use that for anything other that jackets but the parents tray is very handy and what I think is a very smart design.  My only complaints are it is difficult to steer, the front wheels kind of have a mind of their own and the clip to keep it all closed when it's not being used doesn't line up properly so I have never been able to use it.  Other than that, this has worked for us since my son could sit up on his own at 6 months until now when he's almost 2.  Knowing what I know about it now, I would still buy it again in a heartbeat.
I ordered this to use and leave at my parent's house with my 22 lb toddler. That was 5 months ago and looking at the picture now I realize I didn't get a shade! I thought it was weird I would order a stroller without a shade! Well, it was fine for the short trip, I did like the parent organizer it came with. The underseat basket was very hard to get to.
Wheels are narrow, husband constantly tripping over wheels, fit me (5'6&#34;) perfect...makes me walk like a model....lol! The back seems more like a sling....not a lot if support....lo seems to always be slouching. Easily compacts and stores in my wagon. Love the strapping. Dislike the adjustment for backing, always leave at what is supposed to be recline, but its really not.
This was a great get!!  I have a beautiful new granddaughter who deserves only nice things.  She came into the world almost 2 months early and will probably be released from the hospital the end of this month.  This stroller has double wheels which guarantee stability on our rough terrain from my front door to the sidewalk.  It is a very nice stroller, very compact when folded for storage, very easy to open using only one hand.....Thanks to the producers!
I love how light this stroller is and I think this will be great for trips/vacations we have coming up.  I don't like how small the canopy is (and had to buy a larger one - the Summer Infant RayShade UV Protective Stroller Shade) and its not that easy to fold down - you have to pull the latch out and then up and I'm not able to use my foot because it just down right hurts as the latch is stiff.  The storage compartment is small but that's a trade off given the over all light weight of the stroller.  It's not my favorite and I may have opted for a different one had I tried it in the store and compared it to others.  But I did like it enough that I purchased a second as a gift.
lightweight and easy to use
I loved the 'extras' of this stroller (reclines, padded, extra room, canopy, taller, 5 pt harness, etc.) but unfortunately it came damaged.  The canopy was bent and curved to the left, and one of the wheels had a broken piece inside of it, resulting in an annoying sound as the wheel turned over and over.  Not fun.  They are however, sending me a new one with free return shipping.  Hopefully the 2nd one will be fully functional.  If so, I'm sure it's a great stroller.
I thought that I was jaded against this stroller because my other stroller was a BOB Stroller Strides $599 stroller.  My mom bought a cheap umbrella stroller to use at her house out of town for $10 less than we paid for this one:DK Innovations Inc Heavenly Strollercalled the heavenly stroller also sold on amazon.  Buy the Heavenly Stroller.  Don't buy this one.So we read the reviews on how this First Year's stroller was great for tall parents.  It's okay...but steering it is almost impossible.  Forget steering it with one hand.  Forget navigating city streets.  You may as well start crying now if you think you're going to navigate a dog on a leash and your kid in this stroller.  This is not a viable lightweight alternative to a running stroller.  It's truly a really cute looking piece of garbage.  I'm either going to give this or throw this away.So the Heavenly Stroller is fantastic for tall parents.  It turns easily, with one hand and navigates city streets, including old brick sidewalks and slate sidewalks very well--or as well as can be expected without a suspension system.  It is a little fuss, no muss stroller that we all prefer (Mom, Dad, Nanny).  I wish the Heavenly Stroller came in cute prints...but it's perfect otherwise, especially for the price.
I like this stroller a lot. It is easy to fold up and is very sturdy for how small it is. I think I will be able to get a couple of years of use out of it.
Excellent value for price. It's an umbrella stroller that works and is sturdy for super cheap. Don't expect the moon and you will not be disappointed.  This one lives at Grandma's for occasional use and is worth every penny.
I first bought a $15 Costco stroller and realized it was far too cheap for what I wanted... it had no cup holders, basket, or shade, and the harness was just around the babies waist and he could throw himself out of it.  Then I bought a little nice Jeep umbrella stroller so I could have a shade for the baby; and it also came with a little clip on cup holder and tiny basket.  But the harness was still just around the waist and the way it pushed felt flimsy.I ordered this stroller hoping for a little nicer product and it turned out to be totally worth the money!  For the amount of money I wasted on the first two strollers I could've just bought the First Years Jet Stroller and gotten everything I wanted.  It has a 5 point harness so the baby is leaning forward and falling out of it, it has a really nice double cup holder and pocket for other items, it has a fairly large basket underneath, and it just feels much sturdier than the other umbrella strollers I've tried. Plus, I think the baby has a little more room to lean back in it, making him feel more comfortable as well.I would 100% recommend this product to anyone wanting an umbrella stroller!
I like this stroller because it is very light. If you need a stroller umbrella type but stronger  this is the solution.
Once we started using this stroller, we put away our bulky full-size one and haven't touched it since. It's super light, folds up so easily, and seems to be pretty durable. At first, I had trouble with hitting the wheels with my feet as I walked. But it's pretty simple to just make sure you step back a little further from it. The recline on this is very minimal, but enough to keep a kid comfortable. The storage space on the bottom is also pretty minimal, but enough room to slide in a jacket, diapers, small toys, maybe a small purse by itself. The bars limit the size of things you can get into the basket but, then again, cheap umbrella strollers have NO storage so this is not really a complaint as just an fyi. I've used this on grass and gravel and it works just fine. Also, we've been using this for a year and the handle covers are still intact and the canopy still works like new. The caddy that hangs from the handles is great for fitting lots of stuff and includes multiple cup holders. We got this in \"city chic\" style, and it's a nice, black, gender-neutral look. And I must add, I use this stroller with my two year old and I'm currently in my third trimester with baby #2; I can fold this stroller with one hand while I hold my toddler's hand with the other. Then I can easily lift it with one hand and toss it into the back of my SUV, no problem. Some reviewers say this can't be folded with the canopy on, but that isn't true. You just have to make sure the canopy joints are collapsed before folding the stroller.
I have to send this stroller back, because of major problems I had with it.Firsts of all my 7 month old son fills the sit and he is 28 inches tall and 19 lb.Secondly sun shade is a joke! Doesn't give much protection and when I adjust it to the front it falls down but itself. I also purchased the additional shade, but here it goes third flow- it is ok for me to push stroller, I am 5'6\". My husband is 5'11\" and he hits the back wheels with every step he takes, because they not spaced far enough apart (seriously- only 8 3/4\" space between the back wheels).Overall stroller seems durable, but I better spend more money and go something we both can use.
Definitely more comfortable for my son than the cheap umbrella strollers at KMart or Walmart.  As a second stroller for travel (which is why we got it), it definitely does the job.  We've flown with it now once, and taken it out shopping, and it's much lighter and easier to manage than our giant Baby Jogger Summit jogging stroller (which I love for walks and jogs!!).  I'm not sure that it is big or sturdy enough to be your primary stroller if you plan on going on many walks outside - my son, who weighs 25 lb at 15 months, is already starting to get a bit crowded in it.  But I would absolutely get this in place of a Maclaren or some other overpriced umbrella stroller.
I use this around the house and have a separate more decked out one in the car. My lil one is a year and  still not walking yet which is fine with me I still have to start rearranging some things on the top shelf but I have been using this since he was 3 months old around the house of course I used a neck support but now he doesn't need that and i just pop him in it and go. Great value stroller.
I bought this to take on a trip to Puerto Rico, but i have been using it around the house to keep my daughter in the same room with me.  She likes it and always falls asleep while strolling around in it,  the only thing is that she is so long that i dont think she will fit in it when she's close to 50 lbs as her feet will probably be dragging on the floor! She's only 1 and a half years old and her head already reaches the top, but she is long for her age.
I tried keeping my 7 month old in it but he hated it initially. But now at 9 months he seems comfortable.. It could have been better in terms of reclining etc. but those are the luxuries you have to forfeit for the price.. I had a chico and it would take all my car trunk space.. So got this one for the short trips and it serves the purpose..
Love this stroller. It is small and compact so it fits easily into the car. It is very easy to fold and unfold, and my baby loved it from day one. She never fussed once strolling along in this. Great buy. And much cheaper than similar Chicco strollers I had originally looked at.
I purchased this stroller to use on our trip to Disney World (I'm actually writing this review from Disney World), and it's been great. My son is 3 1/2 and never uses a stroller at home anymore, but I knew he would need one here since there's so much walking. Our regular stroller was bigger and folded up wide...a nightmare when getting on and off trams and monorails.This stroller was an excellent price and has been perfect for our needs. I removed most of the straps since my son doesn't need them. He can get in and out very easily on his own. For how small this stroller is, there's actually decent storage behind and underneath. I have a large bag that I bring to all the parks and this just fits in the storage space. The drink caddy and storage that are attached between the handles has been very helpful. It holds 4 drinks and there's a zippered compartment in-between where the drinks go, as well as some netted pockets on the outside. The main thing though is how slim this folds up. It's simple to just kick up the bar and fold this up in a hurry. You can easily carry it in one hand too.My only complaint is the visor/shade. The one that's attached to this stroller is pretty much useless. It offers nothing in the way of shade, so if your child is going to be spending a decent amount of time in this, I recommend spraying them down with sunscreen.Overall, I'm very happy with this purchase. We've been using this stroller everyday for almost two weeks now and I am very happy with it. It's light yet sturdy, easy to use, comfortable for my son (32 lbs 42\" tall), and was an awesome price. Can't beat that!
I really like this stroller! It's light, easy to open and close and my daughter (9 months old, 19lbs, 29\") seems to be comfortable in it. There are only 2 cons I would point out: 1) the basket under the seat is really tiny and hard to access, but for me it's not a big deal. I just bought a mesh bag and attached to the handles and it works out fine to carry small items. 2) When you close it, the front wheels touch the inner side of the canopy and makes it dirty. That's a design flaw I guess... But still like the stroller very much and  highly recommend it!
This is our third stroller and we purchased it for travel.  We live in a large city, have a one child (young toddler), and travel with some frequency.  We also own: 1) City Mini GT, which is our regular stroller and 2) Bob Ironman running stroller.  We were looking for a stroller to take on trips, including plane flights now that our son is out of the infant car seat (so it can't be used with the stroller) and car trips that won't require prolonged stroller use.  We didn't want to spend a ton of money but I looked at lightweight strollers up to $200.  Mom is 5'9&#34; and Dad is 5'11&#34; so handle height was a concern.When it arrived, we actually almost returned it because it seemed like one of the wheels was kind of hovering about the ground.  We kept the stroller and it has not been an issue.Key points:1) This stroller is not as good as our City Mini GT but gets the job done.  It requires 2 hands to push, leaves us a bit hunched over, has a very small &#34;stuff&#34; compartment, and doesn't ride as smoothly as the City Mini GT.  However, it is not unbearable.  We traded off pushing, but ended up walking 8 miles with it today around a path/sidewalk environment.  I wasn't ever frustrated by pushing it or wishing I could ditch it.Although it would be ideal, I don't think it would be possible to have taller handles than this without compromising the &#34;packability&#34; of the stroller.  I think this is about the best you'll get in this type of stroller.  Do NOT get a shorter one if you are as tall as us.  We didn't have a problem kicking the wheels.We stopped and got a few groceries and a small pack of diapers.  We could fit the berries, bananas, etc. under the seat but the diapers didn't fit.  There's no way we could fit our diaper bag under/behind the seat.2) It's cheap and light.  We have strollers for other purposes but it was hard for me to read bad reviews and wonder whether I'd regret the purchase.  I have no idea what a $200 lightweight stroller is like, but I'm glad I don't.  This doesn't leave me wishing for a different travel-use stroller.  If this isn't going to be your regular-use stroller, do yourself a favor and don't give into the temptation.  You probably don't need the fancy name brand stroller, even though all your friends have one.3) There are some nice features that were worth the extra money to upgrade from the cheapo umbrella stroller.  I like the parent console that's included and the 5-point restraint system (this seems more important than I imagined after using it today).  The handles themselves are also nicely padded with foam stuff, which is comfortable when pushing for long distances.4) It seems durable enough.  I packed this in a big duffle bag and checked it for the first leg of our trip.  It survived (I was a little worried that it would snap or something).  It doesn't seem like it's about to fall apart.  We grabbed various parts of it to tandem-carry it up stairs and I didn't ever worry it would just break apart mid-carry.  I'll update my review if it does.Hope this helps!
I bought this stroller for my mom to use because she keeps my daughter every day.  It's not as good as my UppaBaby G-Luxe umbrella stroller, but it's the best deal out there for the price, no doubt.
We use this stroller almost daily. Super affordable. Hot glued some cute patches on the shade/hood to customize. Daddy appreciates its sleek black styling better than traditional cartoon patterns. Started using when our baby was just a week old and still going strong 5 months later. Holds up to 50 lbs! Only complaint is that the hood doesn't completely shade baby's face and doesn't seem to be adjustable downward.
I have a full-sized stroller (Chicco Cortina) which I feel is too big to take some places.  I decided to pick this up based on the good reviews because my husband and I are too tall for most umbrella strollers.  We took our son to the museum last weekend and used this.While I wouldn't use this for our summer strolls outside on the sidewalk, it worked well for the museum.  It is a little harder to boost the front wheels over sidewalk cracks.  It's true that I don't kick the wheels when I push it, but my one complaint is that once you have the kid in the stroller, it is really hard to access the storage space in the back because of the metal bars in the way.  It's fairly easy to turn but not as much as our larger stroller.  My favorite part of the stroller is that it does not have flame retardant chemicals, if you are looking to avoid those.Overall this fits the bill for a smaller stroller that fits into smaller spaces and is lightweight.  The sunshade is pretty flimsy, but I still recommend it as an inexpensive option and better than most umbrella strollers.
Great lightweight umbrella stroller, better than the average lightweight stroller, affordable, and easy to use. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because I keep kicking the back when I walked, if I wasn't careful
At 14 weeks pregnant I was required to get an umbrella stroller becuase of a hemorage. My OB would not let me lift our other 2 strollers. I really didn't want an umbrella stroller because they just don't look comfortable. This one really isn't that bad. My son is 14 months old and tall, but very lean. He's 32 1/2 inches and weighs 22lbs. He fits fine. Well worth the cheap price!This umbrella stroller has many great features for such a small stroller. First, the basket is functional. We have a BOB and a Perego, both have large baskets. This basket isn't that large, but it is big enough to carry things and is useful. Second, the stroller comes with a handle bar console. This is something you usually have to buy separate, as we did with the BOB. It's big, has 1 large drink pocket, 2 bottle pockets, and a covered center pocket for keys, wallet, etc. Very useful. Third, it's really light and easy to open and close. Forth, it doesn't recline a lot, but it's okay for short term (ie: Store, walks, Disneyland for a couple of hours). Fifth, make sure to buy the extra sun shade because the one with it is REALLY small. We bought the Ray Shade UV Protector sun shade. Works great and fits perfect.
This stroller is lightweight, sturdy and does its job.  My only complaint is that folding it with the hinge at the bottom back is a little harder than I'd like and I wish it could be done with the foot.
I have a 2 and 4 year old and never had my kids been ones to sit in a stroller but every once in a while when we go for walks 1 will get tired and sit in one. I hated a double because it was so heavy. We bought an umbrella stroller that you can buy at any store and why do they even make these things? The wheels stick and let's face it, it's not comfortable to push unless you are 4 feet tall. I don't understand why they make strollers like that! Pretty much for $10 more you can upgrade to this one. First off, the handles are a normal height! Me and my husband do not have problems pushing this. I also love that it has a basket underneath and cup holders. No it's nothing fancy but if you are looking for a light weight stroller with basic attachments, this is for you!
I needed an inexpensive umbrella stroller for a weekend trip to the Big City.  This is the perfect umbrella stroller except for the canopy.  It really shouldn't even be called a canopy as it covers and shades abolutely nothing.  But aside from that it's easy to open and close, my child was comfortable and it steers smoothly.  The front console is wonderful!  It holds drinks, sippy cups, keys, cell phones, boarding passes, everything!  And the little underneath basket is handy!
Nice product very helpfully and strong frame, very comftable. We believe in this products if we need more we do not hesitate to buy another one.
Not the best umbrella stroller you can ever buy, but for the price is excellent.  I needed something quick, cheap, and easy to use to transport 2 year old through airports. This is perfect.  It doesn't cost a lot so if it gets damaged no one is gonna cry about it. Its very sturdy, holds up to 50 lbs, and easy to open/close with one hand.  Very safe, 5 point harness too.
We got this buggy stroller, because my 1 year old is getting too heavy to wear in a carrier is now walking.- The stroller folds easily and has a little lock that keeps it in place, it is so small that I even fit it into the small trunk of my mother convertable.- The basket has a nice size, although it can be a little hard to reach, when the child is sitting in the stroller.- My son is comfortable and can also sleep in it, although the &#34;multi position recline&#34; really doesn't do much at all.- The &#34;parent console&#34; is really handy and easy to use. It's made of fabric, so it's not as sturdy as a hard plastic one.- The stroller rolls fairly easily, but sometimes the wheels lock in place for a moment. I've oiled them a few times which helps.- The handles are tallish, however, I'm 5.11 and would prefer them to be even taller, because my feet frequently run into the wheels. I sometimes walk on the side of it and use only one hand to push, but this makes its direction under control. Personally, I'm just not a fan of having to push any stroller though.- It's easy to carry. I just hand the handles over my arm and it's actually really comfortable and light weight.Overall a very handy gadget, good value-for-money ratio. I've flown across the globe with it and have it in the car at all times. It even holds several shopping bags without falling backwards when I''m at the mall! :)
This stroller is great for the price! Top pouch fits everything you need & bottom bag is sufficient. Its a small quick stroller, so you wont be putting lots in the bottom anyway. Wheels work over various types of terrain. The 1 thing I would change is the canopy. Its pretty much useless. We use this stroller mostly for quick shopping trips. I plan on getting a larger sunshade to attach instead.
Bought to travel airlines with.. My son was 3.5 months old so I couldn't put him in a regular umbrella stroller and I wasn't going to risk my $300 home stroller getting damaged. This was a great compromise! It's easy, light, and has a harness.
I loved this stroller. My daughter is 3 now and we occasionally still use it on outings when walking long distance.
Obviously, the price is great and if you really just need a light weight stroller that you don't have to use frequently or for performance - this will do the job. It serves the basic stroller function of not having to carry your child.Pros: lightweight, easy to set up, price and quality of the fabric, wheels etc... seems fine.Cons: Sun shade is useless (doesn't actually provide any shade), tiny storage space (don't plan on putting anything bigger than a wallet and bottle of water in there). I generally expected these first two, but the con that has been the most problematic for me is that you can't steer this with one hand. Rarely do I have both hands free walking through the store/mall or airport and you can't really hang much on the handle bars.Overall, not a bad product - but I wouldn't want to use it everyday/for long periods of time or if I needed my child to nap/rest in there.
This is not a great stroller for taking walks especially long ones. However, for a light weight product it is very compact and takes almost no space in the trunk. Highly recommended for airports, malls etc!
The handlebars are too low for my husband. He ends up kicking the wheels when he pushes the stroller. Best used on a smooth surface such as in a mall. This doesn't do well on our sidewalks or street. I don't bother using the sunshade since it is so small. Easy to fold and store. Great for babies who can't sit up on own yet since it has 5point harness. Light weight so easy to carry. We won't use this often but will be good for travel or shopping.
I bought this a year ago and honestly now I wish I had invested a little more on an umbrella stroller.Pros:1.Reasonable price2.Not so flimsy and cheap like some of the others i have seen.Its reasonably heavy.3.I've taken it through different kind of terrains-grass,uneven concrete surfaces etc. and its served me well.4.Doesn't take up much space when folded up.5.The belts are good to keep my baby back and so I could use it right from when he was 5 months and now he is almost 1and half years old.Cons:1.Sunshade is useless.So I cant even put the weather shield on it to protect my baby on windy days(I then have to take the bigger heavy Graco out).2.Cupholder is not reliable.3.Storage space is not very usable because of the bar in front of it that blocks it.4.The cushion material on the handles have worn off.5.Doesn't recline much so my baby's head would flop forward when he'd fall asleep.Overall, I say its not too bad as it has served me for so long without too many serious issues.
we had a cheapy umbrella stroller from babies r us and decided to get this one when our daughter was older (~2).  we love it, she loved it.  it's very well made, sturdy, and a nice step up without being too expensive.  highly recommend.
I replaced my old umbrella stroller with this one and very happy with purchase. Compare to the old one, this stroller is significantly higher (important because I am tall), has many pockets and holds baby up to 50 lbs (vs up to 35 lbs in my old one). Easy to maneuver. Perfect stroller!
Perfect for quick trips, light weight for the city and busy crowded areas, and still has enough features to store a bag and have a bottle or sippy cup for quick access.
I bought this on sale thinking that it would be nice to have a easy to use stroller to keep in the trunk of the car. We love the hippo pattern because it's neutral and fun.I do agree with other comments that the back seems a bit short, but since the baby is only 12 months, he's fine in it. I do like the little console. I find it handy for a small snack container and items like keys and tissues. I initially was very excited about the basket. It can be good for storing slightly larger items. The only problem is that I find it hard to access once my 22 pounder is strapped in. There isn't much space between his back on the stroller frame to slip in a petite shopping bag. The basket size is fine, you just can't get to it. It's really only good for things like a kid's jacket or soda can.The wheels are decent. One of side doesn't quite come in contact with the ground unless there's enough weight in the stroller. It rides smoothly and feels comfortable to grip.We're glad to have it and prefer it for quick shopping trips for its compact size and weight. I know everyone loves Maclarens but I'm just not ready yet to fork out over $100.
the perfect umbrella stroller. handles are a nice height (not too short for my 6'2&#34; husband). it's lightweight, good looking, and has places for toys, snacks... so glad we got this for our beach trip. big bang for your buck.
I got this stroller to keep in my trunk to have something small and light to use as a spare. Within a few weeks of minimal use the front wheels of this stroller don't roll or turn well and squeak pretty much all of the time.  It has become quite difficult to maneuver or even roll in a straight line without a lot of fighting. I definitely don't recommend it.  It's just not worth the trouble.
Really easy to expand and collapse. Few bells and whistles, but it's an umbrella stroller! Seems comfy for the little one, I hear no complaints like I do with the stroller that faces backward.
If you have the expectations of getting an umbrella stroller for travel, this will exceed those expectations. If you want a travel stroller that has everything, this one will disappoint.Pros: Price, maneuverability, weight, size when folded downCons: Sunshade is pointless, basket can't carry much (both in volume and weight)The stroller also isn't for tall children whose heads will probably not get the headrest you'll need for sleeping in, so have your child test it out before you buy it to check height. Overall, when it comes to strollers, I believe investing a little more is worth the comfort for you and your child for something you'll use everywhere.If you want the low down on strollers and the key features you should look for, visit the website, AllMomsArePerfect.com and search for the stroller shopping article. It's under the Baby Essentials category. It covers all the essentials from a mom who does a ton of research so you don't have to. Good luck!
We had purchased another light stroller (See my review for the Cosco umbrella stroller) before an international trip. 2 days before the trip we tested it and realized that the darn wheels kept locking on it. At the last minute, we relied on good old Amazon with its its awesome reviewers, and we purchased the First Years Jet stroller. Turned out to be a great buy. Very sturdy. At 11lbs or so, not super light, but whats the point of an 7lb stroller that doesnt work?Also, its basket, and the parent console are very handy for storing a few small items when you are out on a walk.
Like most reviewers, I bought this stroller mainly because I was trying to stay away from those cheap looking umbrella stroller.  We needed it for our trip to Disneyland for Christmas eve/day (by the way, I highly do not recommend doing that...it's insanely crowded).  It did put this stroller through it's paces though.Assembly:Very easy.  I was able to do it in 10 minutes and no tools are needed.  You just fit the pieces together.  They snap together and if you make a mistake you can snap them apart again.Ease of use:This thing folds down quickly.  This was the best feature of all.  We needed to quickly go from car, fold the stroller as we go down the escalator, unfold it while we stroll to the tram, then refold as we ride the tram, and finally unfold for the park.  It can get hectic when you have what seems about a million people walking all around you trying to get into the park as well but this thing didn't give us any trouble and worked beautifullyDurability and other feature:When you have 1 stroller and 6 adults somehow all the coats, drinks, little nicknacks ends up being slung around the stroller.  This is when the undercarriage compartment comes in handy along with the cup holder/pocket on top.  All 4 cup holders had water bottles in them, bottom compartment was stuffed with blankets/coats and around the handles were purses and backpack.  Who knew the stroller was going to be used mostly by the adults rather than the baby?  The stroller worked very well even being burden in unexpected places.Baby:My 19 mo. old daughter loves this stroller.  When I first put it together she wanted to get on it for a ride around the house.  By the way this is the first time I've used a lightweight stroller and love how it can turn on a dime.  During our vacation boot camp she fell asleep in it several times.  The back of the seat hugs her and caves around her weight so her head didn't really roll over too much and hit the metal frame (my fear).  She was able to nap over an hour and a half in this thing while we were moving about so I can only assume she was pretty comfortable.I now use this stroller for quick trips when running errands.  It is so convenient and a great buy.  I highly recommend this stroller.
Only problem is that the back part of the stroller has metal frames where blocking the access to the basket. Only way to fit your bag is from the side, so not so big thing can go in there although the size of the basket itself is normal. otherwise, i'm happy with it's functions and colors, it does the job for the cheap price.
i love this stroller! its just perfect for everthing, wheels are big and sturdy and it is perfect for travel we flew from florida to cali and it was worth the price! does the job! buy this if you need a umbrella joint.
I was so excited to purchase this stroller! It was exactly what I was looking for, and after reading the reviews, there was no doubt that I was going to buy this. After researching many umbrella strollers, this has everything you need, and the price is unbeatable! Many umbrella strollers do not come with the parent console on top. This one does. It also has a small storage basket underneath the seat. It has nice tall handles, and it's super lightweight at only 11 pounds. It's also super easy to assemble, which I did myself. All you need to do is attach the wheels and the canopy. That's it! I bought this stroller because I am going away, so it was important for me to have all of the features that I mentioned above. I raved about this stroller to my sister in law, who I am going away with, and she bought it too. Some people complained about the reclining feature. It does recline, but only a few inches. I wouldn't complain about it though. It DOES recline, and what do you expect, it's an umbrella stroller! I definitely recommend this stroller if your looking for a lightweight stroller for travel or everyday errands. You don't always need to purchase the expensive brands to get good quality.
Very happy with this stroller. It folds to almost the size of an umbrella stroller. The only thing I don't like is that there is no cup holder for my son to use. I bought the BRICA Deluxe Snack Pod Stroller Drink and Snack Holder and it works perfectly.
Just recieved this last week, so far, so good! Pros: great steering, seems very comfortable for my 30 lb. kid, I like the washable cup holder, easy to fold, very light weight. The handles are taller than our cheap-o umbrella stroller which is nice, my hubby and I are both tall people, and it's comfortable to push.  Cons: The umbrella thing is dinky, and doesn't keep any sun of the kid. Also, when you shut the stroller with the umbrella attached, it bends funny then gets a strange shape. Colors are nice and neutral. Great price. Overall, very happy with the purchase!
We bought this for an upcoming trip to NY, and so far we really like it. It's easy to maneuver, folds up easily (and folds out easily), and the sun shade can be adjusted to block the sun. Granted it only adjusts to two positions: above the baby's head (as seen in the picture) and in the baby's lap. It's a bit awkward when it's in your child's lap, but it does a great job of blocking the sun. The recline isn't all that great, but realize you're buying an umbrella stroller, not a full-size, all-the-bells-and-whistles stroller. The basket is difficult to get to, and you'll definitely want to stash stuff PRIOR to putting your child in the stroller (and don't expect to get to anything while the child is seated), but there is a storage area on the handles where you can keep your keys, phone, wallet, etc. So far we have no complaints.
I absolutely love this stroller.  Good compartment size for a lightweight, safe and easily adjustable straps.  Easily steered and my daughter always seems comfortable in it.  Folds very easily, which is great for travel or places like amusement parks where you might have to fold/unfold quickly.  This went to Disney with us and performed beautifully!
(Scroll down for an update) We bought this stroller for a trip to Florida involving a plane ride with our 6-month-old and two older kids.  We didn't want to lug around our heavy stroller, but our baby wasn't quite old enough to support himself in an umbrella stroller with just a lap belt.  We love that this stroller has a five-point harness, which is great for younger infants that can't support themselves upright well, and also for older infants that squirm and try to get out of the stroller.The Jet stroller is easy to maneuver.  We even took it to the beach and had no trouble pushing it through the sand.  My only complaint is that the stroller really does not recline.  The \"recline\" function gives more slack in the back of the seat by loosening a belt.  The top of the seat stays fixed in the same place, so the result is that the seat back becomes concave, which is not comfortable for baby.This stroller has a 50 lb weight limit, so we will be using it until the baby outgrows the straps.If you are looking for a compact RECLINING stroller, then this one is probably not for you.  But if you don't care if it really reclines or not, then it is otherwise a 5-star product.*****UPDATE***** The baby is 14 months old and 27 lbs.  We now HATE this stroller.  The wheels stick and swing out to the sides.  I call BS on the 50 lb weight limit on this stroller.  The back wheels literally get stuck and don't turn because of the baby's weight.  Forget about putting anything in the storage bin, or hanging a diaper bag on the handles.  It was a great stroller for a small baby who needed a 5 point harness, but I think it's time to graduate to a sturdier lightweight stroller this summer.
This stroller arrived today and my 13 month old son fell in love.  Normally I carry my children in a sling, but my son seems to prefer to be pushed in a stroller.  I wanted a stroller that would work at the local children's museum, the zoo, fairytale town, the hospital, airports, and could be carried easily in my very small vehicle (Toyota yaris).  For long trips, long walks and jogs I use a Bob Iornman stroller, which is wonderful for running.  This lightweight stroller is attractive and comes with some features I did not expect.  It has a storage bag for diapers and what not under the seat (I did not realize that from the pictures) and it comes with a parent bar wich can hold two bottles, a travel coffee mug and a sippy cut, as well as a few other small things.  It is easy to manuever with two hands but the stroller is small, my little son's head comes to the top of the backrest.  I can manuever the stroller with one hand, but even with a mere 21 pound baby it is difficult.  The weight limit on this stroller is 50 pounds (the weight limit on my running stroller is 100 pounds).  I had my nearly six year old daughter who is 50 pounds sit in the stroller.  It would be very difficult to push a 50 pound child with this stroller, but it can be done.  I am very tall (slightly over six feet) but I could push this stroller without hunching over.  My arms were fully extended however.  Also, my feet tend to hit the wheels if I walk fast. The sun shade is not that great for California, but I was not expecting anything fantastic in that department anyway.  It did not come with a stroller bag for airport travel and it does not have a shoulder strap (like a combi I once owned did).  However it is much sturdier then the combi I previously owned.  The pattern for the happy hippo is very light, so I expect that it will get dirty quickly.  I intend to use a baby bunting that I can launder to help with that issue.  All in all this stroller is much cheaper then other models with similar features, and it seems to work wonderful.  If I had not purchased this I would have purchased a Joovy City Stroller, which was on sale for almost twice as much.  I am happy with this one.
we use our heavy duty stroller frequently but it was getting to be quite a pain to pack it into my trunk.  we borrowed a friends' cosco umbrella stroller that was such a piece of crap so i knew i would have to shell out a few extra bucks for something that would actually roll properly.  i also wanted it to have similar features of our larger stroller. this certainly fit the bill with the 5-point harness, storage pouches near the handles and underneath and also has a canopy.  another good feature is the higher handles...my husband is over 6' tall and was hunched over with the cosco stroller, but not this one.  it is also quite stylish, which is an added bonus.
It's not top of the line, but it works.  We bought this specifically because it's lightweight, and needed something for travel.  With that said, after 1 RT, the canopy had hole in it - partially in part to the baggage handlers and well, the nylon being rather thin. It's fine considering we didn't pay a lot for it, and it works for what we bought it for.  I'm not to impressed with the \"reclining\" capabilities. It's really a drawstring that will only change the incline very slightly. I do like the basket at the bottom. Always nice to have extra storage capacity for small items when on the go.
I have owned a few umbrella strollers and this one has been my favorite.  The handles are high enough, it is easy to push and steer, and the basket is a decent size.  The recline feature is awesome and the extended weight limit is as well!  For a medium priced umbrella stroller this is the one to choose.
We got this for our 9 month old (light-average weight) and loved it. Perfect for traveling to Mexico, and did a remarkable job getting us where we wanted to go without the best roads or sidewalks. However, once our daughter got a little bigger, probably around 15 months (I don't remember her weight but she's always been light to average), the stroller pretty much became useless. The wheels would twist and not move forward. Simply could not maneuver.We had been trying to avoid all those overpriced and overwrought strollers out there. But in this case, we got what we paid for. I will say the quality is very good, the sun shade is useless, but again, don't count on it for kids above, say, 22 pounds or so.
We bought this stroller to have at Grandma's house, and used it for about a month during our visit. It is very easy to fold and unfold. The shade is kind of narrow, so we bought a separate UV sunshade to fit over it (on amazon). The basket below is a good size. There's a nice compartment built in between the handlebars for keys/wallet/ and cup.  My 10 month old was comfortable in it and I can see us using it for another year or so during our visits. I'm 5'-6&#34; and my feet do hit the stroller while I walk. It's a great backup/ travel stroller for the price, but don't get this as your everyday stroller.
I see I am not the only reviewer having this problem. I was excited when we first took the stroller out of the package because the print is great, the height of the handles is a little better than most umbrella strollers, the canopy is nice and there is a little zipper storage bag and basket big enough for a small diaper bag. However, once I took it outside, the front wheels immediately started shaking every few feet. I couldn't cross the street with it as it became dangerous having to stop in the middle. I tried it on flat indoor floors at the mall and it still shook. I sent an email to the company's customer service and they have not responded. I am calling them tomorrow and if they won't replace the wheels, I will be sending this back to Amazon and will never buy anything from First Years again.
What a great stroller!  I was looking for a stroller that would be easy to travel with on a plane, and this stroller was perfect!
This is lightweight and fairly small but has 0 space for any diaper bag underneath, almost 0 space actually. Also, I am 6'1 and 230lbs, I was car shopping and did not see the stroller, stepped on the wheel and bent it, it is not broken.I only paid 39.99. For what it is, it is worth it (other than wheel bending) the ride is harsh and by no means is it a great stroller. I bought it because I needed space and compared to the huge one that I had that fit the car seat, its a joke BUT for what I need/used it for, I was satisfied.HOWEVER, at this price of 50+ that I now see, I will not be buying a replacment and I would not spend that kind of money on this.
LOVE this stroller! I had been using a much larger jogging stroller for basic shopping mall trips, and it was just too heavy and big. I wanted something small and easy to port around - this thing is perfect. It's affordable yet well made - definitely would recommend!
This stroller really is a great on the go Umbrella stroller, lightweight, folds up nice and small, parent tray is great. basket is small but does the job if you just want to take a couple items with you. Definitely better than your standard umbrella stroller! Now onto the wheels issue. I saw a lot of reviews about this, and it concerned before I purchased mine, 
This stroller is lightweight, strong compact, durable, and easy to set up. It rolls great, even on grass and up hills. My baby loves it!
I really love this stroller!  It is perfect for my height (5'6\"), as others I have tried are too short.  It is fashionable; I really love the colors!  I absolutely love the little caddy part up by the handles.  I am frequently able to avoid even having to carry a diaper bag b/c of this thing.  It has a small basket underneath, which can hold a few things also.  It seems very durable and so easy to steer.  The only con I can even begin to think of is that when walking, my feet often hit the wheels.  I have to make sure to take smaller steps to avoid this.  Everything else I love about this stroller makes this worth it!
Just the other day I was in Babies R us shopping and this lady was asking about my sons stroller! She had been looking for a lightweight stroller and I told her this was the best deal for quality product and we just love it!! The color is great and it's very easy to manage with one hand. lot's of storage and our son loves it! We like the detachable head cover too! Our son had an accident and peed on the seat but I just unscrewed the seat cushion and washed it!! I air dried it and it looks just great!!
We use this stroller when traveling, my husband is tall and has found that this stroller is much more comfortable to push than other umbrella strollers.  The lower basket is too small to be very functional however the parent cup holder works great.  Now that we have used this stroller for a while the wheels squeak - I plan to grease them up and I'm sure that will remedy the situation.  Larget wheels than other umbrella stroller and comfy handles.  My daughter is 3 1/2 and can still ride in the stroller.Update:  We've actually purchased an additional one of these for a recent trip with my 1 and 4 year old, we needed a double umbrella stroller for airline travel and we these used with the munchkin stroller links.I've had to contact the company twice to get new wheels, they do get beat up fast and one was damaged on the airplane. Seems like there is a quality issue with the wheels but the company did sent me more both times at no charge.
I opted to get this one among all others because it said it was lightweight, well, it is! and I like the fact the frame itself is thick and sturdy unlike your traditional umbrella stroller that after a few uses you have to get rid of. Overall we love it and the price was very good too.
We do have a very expensive Quinny stroller for our son but that thing also takes up a lot of space in the car, is unhandy and rather heavy. We went looking for a \"cheap\" umbrella stroller that can easily be stored in a corner, is light and still somewhat good and comfortable.We came across a lot of very cheap and flimsy ones until we spottet the Jet stroller. It is exactly what you should expect when you buy a stroller in this price category. You get a lightweight stroller, folds easy, can be stored in the smallest corner, has a compartment under the seat to conveniently store the diaper bag, has a cup holder, double wheels, adjustable sun cover, 5 point harness and a reclining seat.This was everything I was looking for.It is not remotely as high tech or comfortable as our Quinny stroller but it is light, easy to store and comfortable enough for a day trip to the zoo or the museum. I am sure some people have given this stroller bad ratings but you just don't get a Rolls Royce if you pay for a Hyundai...Good buy(p.s.: you can get this stroller at e-bay for only $39.99 plus $4.99 s&h;)
Lightweight, easy to fold and open up.The canopy does not actually offer any real protection from the sun, 
It had most everything we were looking for in a stroller to stash in the trunk and take on trips.Pros:-Lightweight-Folds easily-inexpensive-fairly sturdy-tall handles-seems comfy for our 1 year old-cup holder and storage area underneath-easy to use harnessCons:-Shade canopy is worthless (we may buy an extender - we live in sunny CA)-doesn't reclineWe are pretty happy with it, considering the price!
I bought this when my cheap-o umbrella stroller became to hard to push as my preschoolers and toddler surpassed 30 pounds.  This stroller rolls well even with a 40 pound child in it and can be steered with 1 hand (but needs 2 for tight turns).  Wheels are heavy duty and have not warped or gotten flat sides in nearly a year of use.
The only thing I might count some points off is the wheels. I walk a lot with this and the wheels are pierced by rocks and branches and pretty much anything on the ground. It is some sort of foam-covered wheels, which makes a lot of noise when pierced, and it is way too easily pierced. On the plus side, it doesn't pop the tires.I can really only compare it to the cheaper ($16) cosco stroller from walmart. I had one and hated it very much. This unit works so much better, the wheels are smooth and quickly, easily move to the direction you want it to go to.Loving the little carry bag underneath (not as roomy as larger strollers but still better than that other smaller umbrella stroller). Also the handlebar organizer is awesome! Like how the middle &#34;wipes&#34; bag can be a discrete wallet. Plenty of good things to say about this.The canopy is not one of them. The canopy is zero effective as far as I can tell, and in my own use. I might be spoiled and and used to my nice large jogging stroller but this as an umbrella stroller is not really great canopy. It may protect the child's head from the rain, I'll see later. I'll keep the stroller, but if you're looking for some serious rain protection there is probably some sort of rain cover though. It's double the price of the cheap one I had, but I think this one was worth it.
I wanted a simple but chic umbrella stroller, and this black is perfect for urban style, folds easily, but there are two problem: first the basket, I cannot use it, because the shape in X of the bars behind the stroller dont let me reach the basket, and second the handles, so soft that chipped on the first week of use, 
This is a great lightweight stroller.  I love that it has a basket on the bottom and a little pack on top to put stuff in.  It is surprisingly hearty, I have taken it out on some rough terrain and it did great.  The sun visor isn't great, but other than that this is perfect second stroller of you don't feel like lugging around a big one.
I absolutely love this product. It is by far the easiest light weight stroller to use. It is still insanely effective--it gives my daughter the independence she hoped for once she turned a year old and is still great to have as a toddler (she's now 18 months). It is extremely easy to put together when it arrives (and to use and breakdown after use), easily stored (very thin when folded), and has great storage available underneath and up top for drinks and snacks when in use. The canopy is okay (it's not the best), but expected for such a small stroller--literally the only complaint I have!
This is a really nice compromise between a cheapie umbrella stroller and an expensive lightweight.  I bought it for travel becuase I didn't want my nice stroller beat up by the airlines.  The stroller seat seemed comfortable for baby.  The seatbelt is very easy to use, and quick to unlatch.  I really liked having the parent tray, most fold up strollers don't have one.  The basket underneath is small, but still nice to have.  I wish the sunshade was a little bigger, 
Easy to fold, light, and durable after many plane rides and gate checks. I would highly recommend it for the price.
Bought this as a travel stroller and am very pleased with it considering how cheap it is. The shade is very small, but u can tilt it. It was very comfortable at 7 months and now at 20 months. Folds easily, wheels aren't the highest quality but good enough. We have definitely got our money's worth!
We were planning a vacation with our young toddler. We searched online and found some strollers to consider. After reviewing all the comments, I decided to give this stroller a try since the color I chose only cost me 40 bucks ( I dont really care the color ;) ) . Now we've back from the vacation. I have to say this stroller worth every penny I paid.It's very light weighted. The handlers are perfect height for us since we both are kind of tall. The swirl of the front wheel is smooth enough to turn any directions. And after its folded, The size is very small. Its very convenient/handy in the airport and in the park.For this price I cannot think of any shortcome. Absolutely love this stroller!
This is perfect what I needed it for. I bought this to use for our flight instead of our big stroller. It folds up super small and is light weight. The only thing I find a bummer is that it's not that wide, so my feet kick the wheels when pushing it, and the basket underneath is maybe big enough for a small to medium purse. It'll no way fit my diaper bag. So I'll have to carry that on my back.
I have a nice Chicco stroller that came as a travel system.  And, while that stroller is awesome, it's big, heavy and cumbersome to get in/out of the trunk of my Ford Fusion.  I was looking for something smaller and lightweight for the many quick trips in/out of the car.  So, after reading hundreds of reviews, I bought the First Years Jet stroller.  However, I realized very quickly that at 5'8&#34; tall I was kicking the wheels - often.  Now, my hubbie will say I walk like a spaz, always in a hurry, but even when I made a point to slow my roll and take my time, I was kicking the darn wheels.  So, I returned it and bought the First Years Ignite stroller.  The greatest part is that no matter how briskly I walk, I don't kick the wheels!Pros:Easy assembly.Tall and wide seat for my baby (better than the Jet by far)Compact when folded upReclines a good amount for an umbrella strollerCons:It's lightweight, but not as lightweight as I was hoping.A bit difficult to close it with the canopy on.  The red hook has to go under the canopy.  Hopefully it'll get easier with practice.The basket underneath is hard to get in, but the fact it has a basket at all is nice.Overall, for the money, I am very pleased with the stroller.
This is a great light weight well made stroller.  Easy to collapse.  I give it 4/5 stars.The only reason for four not five?I imagined that when collapsed, I could hang the stroller by the umbrella hooks, but when collapsed, the wheels get in the way of hooking it by the umbrella handle hooks.Also, the canopy only shades at noon.  Any other time it doesn't do much.  I wish the design allowed it to rotate forward.  Currently it is stationary.Otherwise, a well designed light weight stroller.
I hesitated a long time before finally choosing this umbrella stroller.I think for the price it's a good quality, the handle are definitly taller than they are on other brand of umbrella stroller, and that good because I'm 5'9:-)There are some storage which is a good thing too, and pretty rare on umbrella stroller at this price.The 5 points harness is a good feature too.My only concern are maybe the wheels, they seems not really good, but we'll see.Overall I think it's a good quality/price buy!
We are so happy with our First Years stroller. Our BOB is great for our daily walks and weekend hikes, but too big for shopping and travel. We looked for a while to find the right one. This meets all our requirements: a well made, attractive, folding stroller with sturdy wheels, a canopy, and a basket for storage. This also came with a great cup holder/pouch between the handles. My husband is 6' and I am 5'6&#34; and the handles are long enough that we don't have to bend over to push. I love that the seat can recline a bit, which provide for much more comfortable napping than the traditional umbrella strollers. The basket below has plenty of space. I am so happy with this purchase and the price was great.
I recently purchased the First Years Ignite (Black/Green) for a trip across the country (Boston to Los Angeles). I currently own the Chicco Keyfit 30 Travel System and like that stroller very much, but it definitely is not appropriate for traveling on a plane.The price of the Ignite is not too bad for a travel/umbrella stroller. I was willing to splurge more on a second stroller that wouldn't kill my back, as many cheap $20 umbrella strollers tend to do. The height of the Ignite is great - I'm 5'10\" and my husband is 6'2\" and we both were able to push the stroller without hitting our feet on the wheels. The 'basket' is minimal but held some basic items. I usually draped my diaper bag over the handles but had to remember to take it off before taking out my son or it would tip.My son is 10 months, 20 lbs and 30\" and he fit in this stroller very well with *plenty* of room to spare. He didn't seem as comfortable as he usually does in the Chicco, but unfortunately some comfort is sacrificed for both price and the ease of travel. He liked to play with the shade a lot, and we usually clipped some toys onto the straps to keep him entertained.Speaking of the shade, it's minimal. We were on the Santa Monica Pier during his second nap and unfortunately this stroller did nothing to help him get out of the sun. We resorted to taking a jacket and draping it over the front so he could sleep. I've read that there are shade-extenders that you can buy but unfortunately I didn't get one. The reclining seat - nothing fancy. Simply a drawstring that moves maybe 6 inches allowing for a reclined position. The cup holder and pouch by the handles - again, nothing fancy but definitely convenient. Can hold your phone and keys and a large drink.When traveling on an airplane, we took the stroller through security (it has to go through the scanner on the belt but its folds up very easily and has no problem fitting) and then checked it at the gate. I purchased theJL Childress Gate Check Bag for Car Seats, Redafter previously usingJ.L. Childress Gate Check Bag For Standard and Double Strollers, Redand having it hold up well. Again, this bag was great at keeping the stroller clean and allowing us to easily find it amongst other bags.Overall, I would recommend this stroller to everyone looking for a mid-range travel stroller, especially if you are tall.
This is a Great, cheap and convenient stroller. My son loves it and I have no major issues with it. The shade could have been a little bigger and the back abut more vertical but it does exactly what it says. Best for the price.
We bought $10.00 umbrella strollers thinking we just wanted something light and easy to go around in, but found the cheaper the stroller, the harder and less useful they are. We have twins, so the standard umbrella stroller didn't work for our needs of more cargo to haul. This stroller had everything we needed and is still light enough and simple enough to be the type of umbrella stroller we were looking for. It has a top caddy for keys, phone, and fits at least a 32 ounce drink (with tapered type cup bottom). It also has a basket underneath. It doesn't hold our diaper bag, but a purse or a couple of shopping bags will fit just fine. We just adjust our diaper bag so that the straps fit across the handles. The sunshade is somewhat awkward. It has kind of an odd, oval-ish shape, so I wish it would provide a bit more shade. The wheels are larger and more rugged than the standard stroller and we had ease of movement everywhere we took it. Overall, we are happy with this product, but know it it a bit more expensive than the standard umbrella.
LOVE THIS STROLLER!!! It was on the cheap end of the group I was looking at and works wonderfully! It's the perfect height for me, we haven't tried adjusting the handles- haven't needed to. I'm 5'6\" and hubby's 5'10'. The seat reclines just enough to keep DSs head from bobbing forward when he falls asleep. The parent tray is a very nice touch. Be careful when you install the front wheels...I got them in upside down and they fell off on our first walk! (Didn't come with any instructions.) But it was an easy enough fix. The only change I would make would be for the sun shade to fully tilt foward over the baby for when the sun is low in the sky. Often it doesn't do any good.
I've been using this stroller for the past few months, it's lightweight and easy to get in and out of the trunk. It sits up nice and straight, which my daughter loves, so she can see what's going on. Bottom basket is hard to access, but that happens with most of these umbrella strollers. Sunshade is pretty useless, but my daughter prefers a good view anyway. The ease of use of this stroller outweighs the minor issues.
We bought two of these for our twins. They are so easy to navigate around and are lightweight. I like that the handles are taller so you don't have to hunch over to push them. The kids enjoy them and are comfortable, the straps are easy to change sizes. It is difficult to use the storage basket underneath if the seat is reclined all the way back and it doesn't hold much. But we hook grocery bags on the handles and that works just as well when we go to the store.
I bought this because I didn't want a bulky stroller... my child was 4 months and sat up and even fell asleep in it right away.  It folds up easily, and it is fairly compact (it fits into the trunk of my smaller car quite well).  I like the wheels on it... the only downside is that the seat doesn't recline a little more, but other than that, it works perfectly.
We bought this stroller to replace the heavy, bulky and space consuming Graco stroller that came with a travel system. The Graco was great and never gave us problems but now that my son is 15 months and requires a bit less when we are out (no bottles, blankets, 20 diapers, etc) we figured we could downsize. Here's what we found:PRO's*The colors are very nice, not washed out like the are in some strollers. However, the \"red stripe\" is really more burgundy. We don't care but it could be a problem for some.* Light, light, light!* Easy to fold and unfold. I can't fold it with one hand but that wasn't a problem for me - I always put my kid in the carseat before I put up the stroller anyway.* Great steering! I had no idea how hard our Graco was to steer till we tried this. Talk about tight corners! No more backing up the aisles in stores because the stroller can't turn! This stroller can do it with no problem!* I'm short (5'0) but it was comfortable for me to steer as well as my husband (5'10).* Odd parent tray (it's squashy material rather than a rigid plastic) but it held everything we needed and collapsed well. Plus there was a cool little zipper pocket to hold things like germ-x, keys, etc.CON's* No snack tray for the kid. Yes, you can buy attachments like sunshine kids but they don't tend to have good reviews.* The cupholder for the kid is way over on the side and impossible for them to reach - especially if they're buckled in. I was surprised other reviewers didn't mention this but I find it annoying to constantly be handing my kid his cup and then taking it back when he's done. Again, an attachment could solve this but they don't get good reviews. Plus, after dropping $60 on the stroller who wants to shell out another $20 for an attachment?* Forget getting into the storage basket. The criss-cross bars in the back mean you have to access the basket from the sides. It wouldn't be a big deal but that opening from that way is pretty small, too. As in it was easier to just hang items from the handles than it was to get in and out of the basket. If you plan on using it to hold items like toys, snacks, etc this is NOT the stroller for you.* Narrow (when folded, which was great) but LONG. We have a Honda CR-V and the stroller wouldn't fit in the trunk area from seat to hatchback door. It had to go lengthwise against the door (yes, it's too long to fit lengthwise shoved against the backseat). Huge downside for us as half the reason we wanted a smaller stroller was to save trunk space.In the end, we exchanged it for the Jeep Cherokee Sport stroller. Same price, great steering, and folds up shorter than this one. Easily accessible storage basket and an attaching kids' tray. The color was dull but hey, function over appearance, right?
This is a great stroller to keep in the car for quick trips to the store or mall. It is compact and easy to fold and unfold with 1 hand. The storage basket below is rather small and kind of awkward to get to but for quick trips around town it is very convenient and my 1yr old fits perfectly in it.
This stroller is working out wonderfully! I bought it as I have a 3 y/o and a 2 y/o and they were getting too heavy to push in a double stroller.  Both my kids are in the 98% for height and fit comfortably in this.  My son (the 3.5 y/o can drag his feet on the ground if he doesnt put them up on the footrest)I took this to NYC with me for the day and it easily went up and over curbs.  Could quickly be folded up and tossed in the trunk of a cab (It actually fit in the front seat of the cab with me at one point!)  Super light and easy to push.  Also I'm just about 5'10&#34; and my husband is 6'2&#34; and we can push this comfortably.
It is tall!  I am 5'7&#34; and it is great, no kicking the wheels no bending.  My 6 month old loves it.  Love that it reclines.  I know there is complaint about the sunshade, its fine, nothing is perfect.  I put a hat on my little man anyway.  I bought this as a second stroller post not wanting to be in the baby seat and not always using the bulky double stroller when the 4yo wasn't with me.  It's light as far as strollers go and folds in a snap.  Love the 5 point harness for my little guy now and the squirmer later, goes to 50 lbs, bonus! Can't beat the quality for the price.  I would buy it again.
This stroller has been through a lot with us. We've all but destroyed it on rocky trails and lugging it around town. The wheels have held up. The canopy has held up. The straps have held up. It's a great buy. Wish it were SLIGHTLY easier to fold up (no one handed action here) but we didn't pay the premium for a stroller like that. I'd recommend this to friends and family alike.
A very affordable and attractive stroller, this unit folds well and is perfect to have on hand for car to store shopping trips, quick walks, and visiting.It maneuvers well and has adequate storage for short trips.  Harness secures well.It would have earned another star if the hood truly protected the baby or toddler from the sun or wind.  There is no adjustment here.  First Years might work on this aspect as it would be a vital plus.
We got this to transition our son from his big infant stroller. We had already owned a jet for quick trips in and out of stores and for walks and this is definitely an upgrade. The angle is perfect and you do not kick the wheels at all, unlike the Jet. It is wider and roomier for my little guy and has more of an incline if he falls asleep. The latch to close it is much easier to use than the Jet as well. And trust me, that is a big deal!I do miss the tray on my infant stroller for snacks and drinks and the basket below is a bit silly since you don't get much access to it with the back cross bar but it is, after all, an umbrella stroller :)
My husband is 6' 2&#34; and struggles with most strollers that we found - the handles are too low and he has to bend down to push.  Needless to say, buying this stroller was as much for me as it was for him...now he can share in pushing the stroller around with me!  We love this stroller!
we took this thing all over on vacation with our 3ft 31lb 2 yr oldshe was so comfy in it - she loved itit's tall and easy to steerthe basket is plenty big to put things in (for an umbrella - dont go overboard here)its super light weight and folds up really nice & compacti do wish that the umbrella tilted a bit but hey...cant have everythingthe little storage thing at the handles rocks - its much bigger than i anticipated - holds a water, keys, phone, sunglasses, chapstick...all with room to sparehad NO problems with it going &#34;offroad&#34;felt very sturdywe were given an umbrella for free after paying for this one and decided we would just return this one and get our $ back but we changed our minds when we got it and saw it - this thing is worth every penny!!!
We purchased the Ignite stroller to take the place of our more bulky full size stroller on short, quick trips. Particularly in preparation for our upcoming vacation. Our 15 month old daughter seems to like it, though I think she misses the cup holders from her full size stroller.Overall here are my thoughts/observations after about a month of use:- Light and easy to push. I'm 5'9&#34; and my husband is 6'2&#34;, neither of us have back issues pushing it.- Does well on pavement, grass and gravel- Very agile. Can push fairly straight with one hand.- Seems to be well-made and durableAs others have mentioned, the hood is very short and doesn't provide as much shade as I'd like. Though, my daughter doesn't seem to mind. I also learned the hard way that it can easily tip over. My daughter was not in the stroller at the time and we had our diaper bag hung over the back, so the weight was certainly not balanced, however I do get the feeling that it could easily tip with my 23 lb. daughter in at as well. Not a huge concern, just something to be mindful of while you're using it. I would recommend &#34;off-roading.&#34;
The Ignite is heavier than our other stroller, but the benefit of the taller handles exceeds the cost of the weight. My husband (6'2&#34;) can push the stroller without kicking the wheels, which is a problem that even I have (5'7&#34;) with the Britax B-Agile. The Ignite takes up less space in the car, so it's great for travel when the car is stuffed with the travel playpen, extra diapers, 20 changes of clothes, toys, food, etc. The Ignite fits nicely on the floor of the backseat, leaving room in the trunk of our SUV for other things. Be careful not to try and open/close the Ignite without proper footwear (ie not barefoot or sandals, flimsy shoes, etc). You need to step down on the metal bar in the back to lock it in place, and to release (when you're closing it), you need to push up on a metal hinge. The sun shade leaves a little to be desired, but since for a toddler, it's acceptable. I wouldn't use this for young babies without having a swaddle or something to provide sun cover. Overall, decent for the price, although I saw a comparable stroller for sale at BuyBuyBaby, where you can use coupons.
I bought two of these when my twins were six months old. They are two years old now. They are durable and very light. I also bought clips to attach them together, they stroll great together. I love that their are multiple patterns to choose from, my twins are boy and girl. Only negative thing to say is, you can't take fabric off and throw in the wash. Have to hand wash these.
I LOVE this stroller. I had high hopes for this stroller from reading the reviews and it met all my expectations. I bought the khaki color and it looks great.PROS-lightweight and easy to fold-TALL! this stroller is taller than any other light weight stroller I have seen. It's perfect!-Great recline-parent tray is not hard plastic, but soft fabric with a cup holder and a zip part. This makes it s much easier to fold and you don;t have a big plastic part you have to remove for easy strorage-5 point harness-holds up to 50 pounds-easy to assemble- I had it together within 10 mins. of it being delivered!-Great price-worth the money-Strolls great!CONS-no snack tray for baby, but i knew that when i bought it and this is really a mute point with all the great things about it.
I am totally in love with this umbrella stroller! Tires are amazingly maneuvers, easy to roll! Having attached cup holder, and zippered pocket is a plus! The only reason I am giving 4 star the basket is not functional! You barely put stuff there because of the metal frame is blocking the acces to the basket. But I bought the stroller hooks and I hang my stuff there! It folds and unfolds very easily!
I have only used this stroller a handful of times but I love it!  It has the \"frills\" of the travel system stroller (basket underneath, sun shade, cup holder and higher handles) but is lightweight and folds up small like an umbrella stroller!  This is exactly what I wanted and in my price range.I would of given it a full 5 star ratings IF it wasn't next to impossible to get in and out of the basket underneath when the seat is in it's reclined position.  This is a design flaw that I can live with tho.  Also, the sunshade is not all that big but again, I can live with it (and I think you can purchase a universal one that would give more coverage).  It also does not have the tray for the child but I just purchased a universal cup holder that attaches to the side.  This is great since we can use it in other places if needed.Overall I am VERY happy with this stroller for the price!
This is the second one we bought. We love this stroller. Its very small & compact. It doesn't recline far but it goes back far enough for them to be comfortable
This is so worth the money. The bigger wheels make is so much easier to turn and my son loves it. Only compliant is how difficult it is to get into the basket and the size of the canopy that does not move.
We ordered the First Years Ignite Stroller in red, and then came back to order a second in teal. One for Grandma and one for ourselves. It's a great stroller.It's tall, this is one of the most super important pieces of information about this stroller. My husband is over 6' so it was important that he didn't have to stoop over to push the stroller.It collapses all directions. Another important point if you don't have a ton of trunk space. It's light and easily fits into small trunk space.The price is great, I mean really great compared to other compact strollers that aren't as tall.So why 4 stars? Cargo space. Teeny tiny cargo space with the cross bars blocking the entry point. But then again, it's a lightweight compact stroller, so the fact that there is cargo space is pretty awesome.Bottom line, Awesome stroller.
We bought this stroller specifically for a vacation to Italy. It was perfect!  It handled all the cobblestones of Italy very well - just like another reviewer mentioned.  It folds up easily  and weighs very little, so it was great to travel with.  Airlines let us check it at the gate since it's still an umbrella stroller.  We also spent a good amount of time having to carry it up large flights of stairs on vacation, and it's light-weight enough that you can do that.Also, while the storage basket is limited, we found that it fit everything we needed for a day out thus eliminating the need to carry around a heavy diaper bag.  We were able to fit diapers, wipes, a bib, sunblock, a couple sippy cups, and a baby jacket in the basket.I would highly recommend this stroller.  We're even using it now in place of our regular stroller just because it's faster and easier to carry around.
This stroller would have been an easy 5 stars if it weren't for the sun shade.Pros--Super light & easy to fold/ carry-Steers wonderfully-Back of the seat is more firm than others, allows younger babies to sit easier without slouching over.-I actually ended up loving the pull string recline because it allows you to pick the exact recline position you want, instead of just picking bt 1 or 2 like most umbrellas.-Parent caddy is a good plus-Sturdy & hold up (we have had ours almost 2 years).Cons--Really the only con is unfortunatley a big one... The sun shade. It doesn't rotate forward or back like other shades I've seen so if the sun is in the front I have a screaming baby :( we did but a sun shade extender which helped, but it's a pain to have to take on & off.This would be the best stroller for the price if it weren't for the sun shade, but other than that I love everything about it.
My wife and I love this stroller. We had been hesitant to switch the baby from the all-in-one car seat stroller, to a real stroller, such as this. We tried the stroller that holds the car seat, as a stroller only, but it was heavy, and the baby seemed to be lost in it's oversized seat area.This stroller is the perfect size, it is very light weight, easy to push, steer, and quick to pack up an throw in the car.Like other reviews have mentioned, the sun visor part is mostly useless, so we ordered a larger one.We have absolutely no complaints with this product. Every time that we go for a walk, we talk about how we are so happy that we decided to make the purchase.
If you need a light stroller but don't want to spend a lot of money.....THIS IS THE STROLLER YOU SHOULD BUY!...Here on Amazon :) I never seen it in stores so, I just had to go off of the reviews here.  The colors are much nicer in person then in the pictures and can be used for a boy or girl.  I'm 5'0 and my husband is 6'0 and neither of us have a problem with pushing the stroller or kicking the stroller as we walk.  The stroller rolls very smooth and the brakes work great.  I love the parent pocket and cup holder. Now when I am running into the store for a few items I don't have to carry my purse.  I just put everything in the pocket.  The basket underneath is small yet hold more than I thought it would.  The straps are very quick and simple to adjust and snap.  The canopy can go back and forward and lock in the forward position.  The seat reclines a little bit with a draw string, which is great for a baby 9 months and up.  The stroller is easy to set up and take down. As soon as I put my 12 month old in the seat, he loved it and didn't want to get out.  When we are out, my son is very comfortable and doesn't cry to get out like he did with his big combo stroller.  There are several nice expensive light weight strollers, but why spend the extra $$$ if you can buy this stroller which is the same for way less money?  I will be buying this same stroller for baby #2 that is on the way.  I will also purchase theStroller Connectorsby Prince Lionheart.  That way I can create a double stroller without having to buy a heavy, bulky double stroller.
I bought this with the idea of the compact size and light weight design. Did not want the cheap umbrella strollers due to no support and absolutely no compartments for bags or diapers. This is a great purchase for a lightweight stroller.
I can't say enough about how much I love this stroller.  i love it more than my over $100 stroller.  It folds up nice and small its comfy for my son.  The handles are high enough for my 6'6 husband to push comfortably, unlike those cheap umbrella strollers.  It rolls nicely just like the expensive ones.  I recommend this stroller
i have always been against umbrella strollers, I am 5'10&#34; and my hubby is 6'5&#34; and we don't like to bend over to push a stroller. We also don't like flimsy. This is a STURDY stroller and super compact it also leaves both my husband and I with a little bend in our elbow when pushing. It is sturdy enough to hold my tall 5 year old comfortably as well as my 2 year old. Its very light and super mobile. The little storage underneath is great as well and holds a lot more then you would think. We got this for disneyland and it has been our new go to stroller for EVERYTHING! We even sold our old large stroller because this is a fantastic buy!
We hadn't used a stroller for about 6 months and I'll admit I agonized about which one to replace my Graco with.  Due to a trip alone with my 2 year old pushed me to make a decision and I've been very happy with this purchase.PROS:-Lightweight, super easy to open and close (essential for transiting airport security without hassle)-The treaded tires are great for less than smooth surfaces-5 point harness: my child is secure, but it's still very quick to strap her in-The carry/parent pouch: didn't think this was of importance until I got it, but now I love it and use it all the time.  It's actually pretty large, can hold keys, medium wallet, bag of snacks and a juice box no problem.  The water bottle slot holds about a 16.9 oz or a soda can.-Handle height: I'm 5'9&#34; and have a very long stride.  I have bumped my feet a couple of times, but other than that it's very comfortable.-Recline.  I knew from other reviews that this didn't recline very far, but it's plenty far enough that if my child is tired, she can lay her head down without it flopping forward or anything.CONS:-Depth of seat.  My daughter is a little tall for her age and while she can sit comfortably now, I think she won't sit very far back easily too much longer.  Well before she reaches the weight limit.-Foot rest.  It's not bad, and this is really just because it's an umbrella stroller, but because the foot rest is flexible and narrow, my child gets uncomfortable keeping her feet there for a long time (her knees are up a little high).Basically, taller kids may have less use or dislike using it for long periods of time.-Length.  As I said, first use of this was on a trip and it didn't fit in the trunk of the rental (Ford Focus hatchback).  My home vehicle is much larger so it was no problem there, but just be aware if you drive a smaller vehicle, it may not fit in the trunk.Overall, this stroller has exceeded my expectations, especially because I couldn't spend more than $75 for one.  I considered about five others included the Jet, Graco Ipo and a Jeep one but this has worked out perfectly for our needs.
It's a pretty nice banana stroller, sturdier than others. Even though it becomes super skinny when folded it is long. The shade cover isn't big enough and the basket from under is a bit hard to reach because of the metal bars from the frame cross right in front of it.
Great, simple stroller. Folds easily, fits in the back of my not-very-roomy hatchback. As for comfort, I'm 5'11&#34; and find it pretty perfect, but my husband is 6'3&#34; and can only put up with it for short distances. The storage area under the seat doesn't hold much, but then if I wanted to carry a lot of stuff around I wouldn't have gotten an umbrella stroller in the first place.
Best stroller I've owned yet.  Light and sturdy.  Gets the job done!  Not the stroller for rough terrain, however.  Pneumatic tires are needed for that!
What a perfect stroller! My son is 13 months old and I've been using the original heavy stroller that came with our infant carrier travel system up until this point. I tried out a few umbrella strollers in stores and just didn't like them - the handles were too low (and I'm not tall, only 5' 5\") so I was hunching down. Comfortable for short jaunts, but not for taking long walks with baby. This is one of the few decently priced strollers out there with higher handles. It also has an adjustable back, something else I wanted. AND a little bit of storage space! (Not much - you can't fit a diaper bag in there, but it's a small sacrifice considering that it has everything else.) It was easy to assemble, rides well, folds up nicely, is light (woo hoo!), and fits in the truck of my car better than the big, bulky stroller. I wish I found this stroller sooner!
Lightweight, cute, easy to push, cup holder, and can be taken on airplane. Just what we were looking for at a great price.
I'm kicking myself for not buying this stroller sooner! At first when I put my son in it I thought the seat was not deep enough. Reason being, I'm only used to seeing him in his travel system stroller which is HUGE! He is 11 months old and pretty big for his age, fits just fine. We've gone shopping, for walks in the park and to the zoo in this stroller and he remains comfortable the whole time.It has a nice recline feature that goes back just far enough to nap. Maybe not for smaller babies, but for 10 months and up, it is just enough. It is very light weight and easy to get in and out of the trunk of my car with one hand. I am also able to open it with one hand as well.The wheels are very substantial and provide a smooth ride for baby. It also turns on a dime so getting around in a crowded area or small store is pretty easy. The cup holder/storage pouch is very useful and easily accessible.My only complaint about this stroller is that the storage basket - while decent sized - is basically inaccessible because of the X frame in the back. maybe if you were putting something thin back there like baby's jacket or a toy, but getting a diaper back there is almost impossible. I just hang mine over the handle bars.Overall, I'm extremely happy with this purchase and I use this stroller ALL the time. I have heard from others that have this stroller that they were able to find it much cheaper else-where though.
I've had this stroller for a couple of years now...it's the last stroller in my house.  Easy to push, even with one hand.  I could use another 3 inches on the back support! LOL!  My 3 yr old loves to nap in this stroller!
I bought this stroller to take on vacation in hopes of cutting down on bulky items.  I didn't want just any umbrella stroller.  I really wanted something with a basket for storing items and that would hold my 3 yr old (39lbs).  More umbrella strollers do not fit either of these criteria.I came across this stroller during a Google search.  I looked into it further and ended up being stuck between this and the Jeep Cherokee Sport Stroller.  Here's why I went with this one:1) Folding: folds like an umbrella so it takes up less space. (The Jeep folds like a regular stroller)-Important for saving space2) The \"drawstring\" used to recline the seat seemed easier than the belt version on the Jeep.-Important for quick and easy reclining3) The canopy seemed like it would offer more shade-Important since my children are very pale and their eyes are sensitive to sunlight4) The canopy locks into position-Important to keep either child from pushing the canopy back5) 5 point harness (Jeep only has a 3 point)-Important for keeping my baby buckled in safelyThe Jeep offers a hard tray for parents and a tray for baby/child.  However, the above points were more important to me (esp. #5).  The Ignite comes with a parent console that is deeper than the hard tray on the Jeep anyway (but note, the Ignite's console is a soft one, so that it can fold up with the stroller).This stroller is used for both my 1 year old & 3 year old children.  Both my husband (6'1\" tall) and I (5'7\") were able to comfortably push this stroller with either child in it (26lbs & 39lbs).  It rolls very smoothly, was able to handle going over grassy areas without trouble and the wheels lock/unlock easily when needed.The basket isn't large for putting a full size diaper bag in, but it's not a large stroller so you shouldn't be expecting the same size basket.  I wanted the basket for putting small things in like a few toys or snacks for my children, small bags from stores where we purchased an item.  It held more than I expected it to, honestly.The only thing I wish I could change is that there is no child tray.  We don't use one often, but it's nice to put some Cheerios on a tray for the baby to munch on since he doesn't understand holding a bag.  But, I'm sure I can find something to purchase.  Again, this is already a step up from traditional umbrella strollers so I can make do without a tray!
We upgraded to this stroller when our 1-year-old was too big to fit in the itty bitty umbrella stroller we had before. (You know the kind, it looks like it was actually made for a doll.)The Ignite is much larger, but not too much so. It folds easily and fits into the trunk while still leaving plenty of room for groceries or other things. Compared to our first stroller (that came before our baby umbrella), which was a behemoth that was part of a travel system, this one feels as roomy, but folds down into much less.It is much more rugged and durable than other umbrella strollers, with good sized wheels that don't get out of alignment and cause the dreaded stroller shake. It was a bit pricier than I thought seemed necessary for an umbrella stroller, but now that I own it, I see the price is totally justified. It's a solid item. Highly recommended.
I purchased this stroller as an alternative to the stroller that came with the car seat as a &#34;travel system&#34;; mostly for running my daughter in to and out of daycare.It is precisely what I needed and is highly functional and appropriate for short trips or moderate distances. I still use the larger stroller for more involved expeditions so she can lay down.If you are looking for a lightweight stroller for your little one, this is a great choice!
Really can't be beat this for a fancy umbrella stroller. Wheels are a NICE upgrade over the cheaper units. Its definitely taller. I'm 6ft and have to stoop with standard umbrella strollers, but NOT with this one. Easy to fold. Lightweight. Would buy again.
I have a full size stroller and also a basic umbrella stroller, and I'm not happy with either. The big one is way to heavy and takes up too much space in my car. The small one is too small however with no storage basket cup holders nothing... This one is perfect! It is not big but no small. It has cup holder, a zippered pouch and a storage basket. It is lightweight yet doesn't tip over easily like alot of umbrella-type strollers. It has a sunshade which is useful and the weight limit is high which means longer use! Love love love it!!
I bought this to use as our \"trunk stroller\" for our 6 month old.  We currently have a BOB revolution (which we LOVE) as our main big stroller, but for quick errands and mall trips we have been using the Graco Snugrider with the infant carseat as our errand/trunk stroller. My husband did not want me to spend more than $75 on this new 'trunk stroller' so after reviewing many strollers I settled on this one.  It is what everyone says it is- a really good umbrella stroller.  Its sturdy, rides smooth, the handles are tall enough for me (5'8\") to use without slouching, and its easy to manuever between racks in stores at the mall.I do however wish I spent a little bit extra money to get one of the other lightweight strollers I was looking at.  My main reasons are this: I loved the huge basket in my graco snugrider (similar to the snap n go) I could run into the store and not have to worry about a cart or a basket or how to carry the items I was buying because I could easily throw the items in there.  Or, at the mall I could easily throught the diaper bag, my purse, or coat into the basket.  That is not the case with this stroller.  The basket is tiny, and very hard to access.  Also, I tried to hang the diaper bag on the handles- this works only when my son is in the stroller- otherwise it will tip over.  Other lightweight strollers do not have this problem.  And finally- the recline does not lay flat.  I realize this is the case with most umbrella type strollers, but some of the more expensive ones I was looking at did fully recline and with my 6 month old, this feature would be nice.  As he gets older and stays awake longer, it won't be as big of an issue.If you are looking for a true umbrella stroller, this one is great for the money.  As I mentioned above, I just wish I spent a little more to get the bigger, easier to access basket and the full lay-down recline.
The construction is well worth the extra $$. It is light weight and folds down easily. The straps are easy to adjust as well. I also like the height..this fits us both nicely. I only wish they would have made the recline feature more secure. It is a draw string and I worry that it won't hold as well as other methods. The only other want is that the canopy is a bit small and does not angle well enough to block the sun unless you are out at noon.
This stroller works very well for the weight.  IT folds up a little long, but that was not a problem for the check in process at the airport.It survived our HAwaii trip, including a few off road excursions and is no worse for wear.  Very well built- we could have just bought this for our primary stroller to begin with.  A larger sun shade would be nice, but it's all a size/weight trade off.
We only had a larger stroller as part of a system with the car seat and decided that we wanted something more manageable for travelling with our 8 month old.  With Disney charging $15/day for a stroller rental, this thing more than paid for itself at $50 (looks like the Red is now $59).The Good:-Sturdy and well made, definitely not flimsy like some cheap umbrella strollers.-At 6'2\" I didn't have to bend over for the handles, nor did I kick it when walking, even at a fast pace.-Reclining seat options, with the farthest one back good enough for our daughter to take several naps in it.-Easy to fold / unfold.-Assembles in a minute.-Our daughter is on the smallish side, but with this going up to 50 pounds, we will surely get some use out of it.The not as Good:-The shoulder straps are not very soft and I worried about them rubbing and irritating her neck.  We used a couple strap cushions that Velcro'd over the straps and she was quite happy. (something like this:Munchkin Reversible Strap Covers,Colors May Vary)-I read a review about the front wheel having a wobble, and our stroller had a slight one as well.  Honestly, if I hadn't read the earlier review, I would have never noticed it.  I had no problems navigating a heavily crowded Disney.-I actually think this is a good, but the Red Stripe model was not fire engine red as the picture, more of a maroon.-Tricky access to the under storage.  I kept our carrier in there and never took it out again...  but it was nice that I was able to fold it up with the carrier still in there.Overall:This stroller was a life saver at the park.  We used the carrier some, but it was hot and she was more comfortable and happy being wheeled around in the stroller- and so was my back.  I can't say I have used all strollers out there, but for the price, this one met all our needs.  I'm glad I bought it.
light, good quality, sturdy. AWESOME for the subway and those older tots transitioning out of a stroller. Get the $59 one and you'll be happy. the umbrella is quite nice for the price too. The little parent caddy thing on the top is awesome! (esp since you can't get to the basket) and both myself (5 foot 1 and my husband, 5 10\") can push it comfortably without kicking.3 negatives;1. the basket is useless as it's almost impossible to get to.2. the \"recline\" feature is like... 3 inches. (almost nothing.)3. both brakes broke at 6 months of occasional use.
I really struggled to decide between the First Years Ignite ($57 on amazon), the Summer 3D Lite Convenience Stroller ($79 on amazon), or the Chicco  Liteway Umbrella stroller ($179 on amazon).  I looked all over for stores who carried them to actually try them out, but no luck. So, I decided to go with the two lower priced ones.  I almost bought the 3D Lite for about $80, then read some of the reviews, which said it was flimsy and sometimes un-locked and started folding, so I decided to go with the Ignite for about $20 less.  Now, you have to know, I don't mind a $20 umbrella stroller, but when my children fall asleep in one, it's darn awkward. Do I let their head bob around, or stop and tilt the stroller back onto a chair at a restaurant or wherever we are?  It isn't ideal.  I wanted a simple umbrella stroller that reclined. My youngest is 18 months old.  It would be nice to have full recline (like 3D Lite), but honestly, my kids sleep fine in their slightly reclined car seats (45 degree recline is great, but they sleep with even less than that.  So, I opted for the lest costly stroller.  If I didn't like it, at least I had wasted less money.  I am very pleased. It arrived in 2 days (amazon prime free 2 day shipping), the fabric is nice and thick, the sun shade is wider than expected and has three toy hooks on the front of the visor that I could easily attach more fabric to, like a blankie, to create more shade if needed, for a sleeping child.  My 5 year olds like it too, and they are 43 and 47 pounds, so still are under the 50 pound weight limit.  The seat belt:  I wish we could easily opt not to use the shoulder straps, but they are permanently attached and you can't buckle the waist belt without the shoulder straps coming with it.  I might cut them off?  But the 18 month old didn't mind them on!  I really like the mommy pack that comes with it in the back up by the handles, it's really nice.  And the bottom basket is nice too!  I don't use a diaper bag, but it fits tons of extra clothes and snacks.  Another thing I noticed after watching youtube videos about each stroller, is that the 3D Lite one, when folded up, has two of its wheels sticking way out in a strange angle.  The First Years Ignite one folds up nice and straight and compact and all together.  If you wanted a shoulder strap for carrying it, like the 3D Lite one has, you could easily create one, like out of a dog leash, with a slip knot on one end and the buckle side on the other, made into a slip knot, or with Rock climbing or camping straps and a two plastic buckles that you can buy at an outdoors store.  They both weigh the same, so weight is not a deciding factor.  The two features I liked about the 3D lite better:  flat recline, carrying strap (plus a little extra sun shade, which people say doesn't make a big difference.  The features I liked about the Ignite better:  Mommy cup and cell phone/zippered pack near handles,  compact and straight lines in the folded up position, $20 less money, and sturdy (maybe sturdier?).  They both hold up to 50 pounds, so that too is not a deciding factor.  I'm very happy with the Ignite.  My 18 month old loves sitting in it at soccer games, watching the big kids play, and loves the smooth ride.  Wheels are smooth and well aligned, by the way, unlike the Toys R Us similarly priced ($60-99) brands I tried out in the store with and without 26 pound child riding in seat.
LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this stroller especially the brown color with pink polka dots.  We bought this stroller for our 2 year old daughter.  It handles great, reclines enough, the basket is good and the parent organizer is awesome.  The only thing I didn't like is the canopy doesn't rotate down. We added a $12 brown Fisher Price snack pod(drink and snack holder) from Target to the side and it is perfect!!  We slide her little toddler backpack over a handle and off we go!  We love it so much we sold the Graco travel system.  This stroller is truly the best of both worlds!!I have both the dot ignite and navy jet......unfortunately I owned the ignite first, so I was spoiled. But the jet is a nice stroller and better than a small umbrella stroller or the evenflo xsport we had.The Ignite has much sturdier fab
I ordered this stroller based on a recommendation from my friend. It's definitely easy to push and manuever but I somehow expected it to be lighter. It's light but not as light as I thought it would be. One plus for this stroller is the cupholder which makes it very convenient for us or my baby. However, I wish there was 2 holders so that it can hold at least 2 cups, one for the parent and one for the child. The one complaint I have for this stroller is the shade. The shade doesn't really cover my baby from the sun regardless how i maneuver his sitting position. It's sort of flimsy. I expected better coverage from the sun. Despite having the shade out, the sun is still in my son's face. I hope they can make the shade bigger so it can provide more protection against the sun,
I am also impressed with First Years company as they stand behind their product. Party due to my mistake I ruined the stroller. They sent me a new one free of charge! Buy with confidence!
Been using this stroller for a couple months now and I am pretty happy with my purchase. My granddaughter seems to love it and it looks comfortable for her.  It is light and pretty easy to pop open/set up and take down.  It has a nice cup holder (but only one) and zippered pouch between the handles.  I cannot give it 5 stars because the storage on the bottom is a bit of pain trying to get a diaper bag or parcels into.  The other day I put a diaper bag, 2 beach towels and my purse on the bottom and when I took her out of the stroller, it promptly flipped over. Now if I had been able to better distribute the parcels (get them fully into it) this probably wouldn't have happened, but I already had her in the stroller before I started trying to stuff all our junk into it...so perhaps that's just a learning curve.I think this is an excellent value for the price.  It seems to be very well made; sturdy.  The handle height is superb and I do not kick the wheels when I walk...YAY!  I am 5'5...but I think it would be fine for most anyone except for really tall folks...they just seem to be the right general height.
I needed an umbrella stroller that was tall enough for me (5'9&#34;) and my husband (6'4&#34;). This does the job, and we don't kick it when we push it (hurray!) It folds up nice and compact compared to my chicco travel system stroller. It's easy enough to use and it looks nice. It's great that there is a 5 point harness to keep young babies nice and secure. The recline is good enough, though obviously not as nice as would be a full size stroller. It steers nicely, and rides well over pavement and grass. Not so well over sand.My only gripe is that it doesn't support my fully-loaded diaper bag on the back handles without baby in the chair. If I take the baby out before taking off my bag, usually the stroller ends up tipped over and any contents I had on top (usually my precious coffee) ends up spilled all over the floor.This is a small price to pay though for its portability. Definitely not a cheapo umbrella stroller. I'm happy with my purchase.
We got this umbrella stroller before a long weekend trip with our 5 month old.  I LOVE that it is taller, we had read previous reviews that said this was great for taller people (I'm 5'8&#34;, hubby is 6'1&#34;).  It fold up fairly easy and conveniently fits on the floor of the backseat of our crossover.  The stroller organizer on the handlebars is great too.  The cup holder is a little small, but it is fabric, so it can stretch a little bit.  I especially love the zippered compartment.  Which is GREAT for throwing in a pacifier, and a few small toys that you can leave in when folding up.  The only thing I'm not 100% sold on is the cargo basket underneath the stroller.  It is fairly small (ok, because this is only an umbrella stroller), but also the bars on the back of the stroller make it difficult to get anything larger in (ie sweatshirt, blanket, purse, etc).  Other than that, we LOVE this stroller and it has been a great addition to the rest of the &#34;baby gear&#34; filling up our house!
I freaking LOVEEEEE this stoller. It is too cute. My daughter loves it too. The only thing I wish is that it came with an arm bar. Or at least one i can buy separately but it doesnt. It very light even know when you first see it, you are thinking 'there is no way this is light at all', it definitely is lol
I LOVE this stroller, it stands up to my expectations for an umbrella stroller.  The quality is great and my daughter is comfortable sitting in this and it is very easy to steer...I only have 3 complaints: (1) there is no belly bar (so connecting a snack tray or toy for belly bars is impossible), (2) it does not lay down very much - my daughter can fall asleep in it, but I wish it laid down flat so that she would be happier sleeping & (3) the bars in the back make it near impossible to get into the basket underneath the seat...
Lightweight and easy to use. The handle height is comfortable for taller folks. Front wheel locks broke off after just a few uses, though. They seemed pretty flimsy, but I'm st
Pros:This stroller is an excellent height for tall people.It is also a lot sturdier that your average umbrella stroller.It has a descent sized storage basket for an umbrella stroller.It unfolds and collapses really easily and can be done one handed.it has a convenient cup holder.It maneuvers well and you can choose to lock the front wheels to go straight or let them swivel.Cons:The handles aren't adjustable. So folded up the stroller is longer and wider than you average umbrella stroller.Because it is sturdier it feels a little heavier.All in all I am satisfied. It met my needs.
I read a lot of reviews on a lot of different umbrella strollers before deciding on this one, color was not important other than I didn't want a dark shade.  When it went on sale I made my move.  I mostly bought it to keep in the trunk of my car for outings and emergencies.  It's also the middle of winter so I've only used it a handful of times, but it works like it's supposed to, and doesn't take up my whole trunk like her other stroller.So far it works fine, no wheel problems.  I haven't gotten tripped up with the folding latch, but I do need both hands to get it open.  And it is a bit heavier than some, but not terribly cumbersome.  The bag compartment is somewhat blocked, but not big issue for me.The things I was looking for that it has are a 5-point harness system with pads, comfortable lower leg support and foot rest.
With 3 kids I have tried and owned a lot of different strollers.This is a nice cheap stroller with really good functions.Yes the sun shade is small but there is an aftermarket one (Summer Infant Rayshade)I like it better than our Maclaren and it was half the price.  But it is much heavier than the Maclaren (we had a volo). And it isn't as easy to maneuver.This is a great stroller for travel.  folds easy and compact.  But still has some higher end features.
Survived 2 flights and a lot of walking/strolling in Las Vegas so I feel like I have already gotten my money's worth. Easy to push, easy to fold/unfold.  Fairly lightweight.  Cargo basket is standard for umbrella type strollers.  Parent pouch came in handy.  Really happy with this purchase.
Cons:*When you bring the stroller up stairs backwards, the brakes engage thereby locking the back wheels.  Not so great.*Latch to hold stroller together is plastic and not very secure.*Difficult basket to store things in.Pros:*Easy steering/gliding.*Taller hands.*Top pouch has cup area and zippered pocket.*Canopy locks into place.*Baby looks comfortable and happy.  Was worried about the harness but she doesn't mind it (it's five point similar to a carseat).*Frame is rigid/strong.  A friend weighing 140lbs sat in it and didn't break (although would not recommend doing this).*Great in between a not-so-great-umbrella-stroller and big-bulky-traditional-stroller.All stroller's have pluses and minuses.  The cons were ok in this instance and the pros far outweighed other things.  Depending on what you want, weigh out the reviews.  We've had for about 6 months and no mechanical problems so far.
The harness is pretty decent for keeping my kid constrained.  It doesn't look like anything he will open for a little while.  It's fairly compact without sacrificing too much.  It's probably the best 'light weight' stroller I've seen.Quality fells good, back support is great.You can lock and release it using your foot, so it's well suited to one hand opening and closing with a little practice.The hood locks out which is nice on windier days.My wife if 5'8&#34; and I'm 5'10&#34; and the handles are a good height for both of us.It rolls and turns well.  'Suspension' is not as good as our other stroller, but it's not super rigid either.  I often tilt the front up to soften sidewalk bumps whereas I did not feel the need to do this with our 'fancier' stroller (we live in an old neighborhood where the sidewalks are moderately wonky).
Love it! If you truly cannot afford more this WOULD even get by being used as a sole stroller you own it's that good. A bit bulky for an umbrella stroller but it is so sturdy and heavy duty that I can't imagine it getting broken through rough use!
We were using a big jogger stroller for our baby's first 7 months or so.  It is a great stroller, but way too heavy and big for everyday use.  It was so difficult putting it in and out of the car, and too big to go grocery shopping with.  Once I decided I needed a lighter stroller,  I did a lot of research and decided on this one.  I am so glad I did! It's lightweight, but not flimsy.  I love it that it comes with 5-point harness, a canopy (although it's small, so I did also buy a sun shade that can attach to it), and space for my belongings.  I can open and close it very easily (I've done it while holding the baby), and it easily fits in the trunk of the car.  Oh, and I like the design as well.
I absolutely love this stroller. I'm actually becoming a fan of the First Years brand. I have the Wave stroller for regular walks with the baby, but as great as it is, it's kind of a pain to take anywhere.  The Ignite stroller is wonderful. It fits in the car, easy to fold and unfond, the baby seems comfortable in it at least during short outings. It's a little heavier and larger than I imagined, but I guess it's the payoff for durability and comfort of both the passenger and the stroller-pusher. I was also a little disappointed with the color - the red is kind of muted red (not like the pretty red on the Wave) and looks a bit depressing.  But it grew on me after a few days.
Wife wanted an umbrella stroller. I didn't want a cheap fifteen dollar one.  So we got this one.  Love the versatility of this!  NIce wheels that you can use on grass (we took it to baseball games).  Good size and stores nicely. We also have two older children and if needed one of them could ride in this stroller.  I am six-two and my wife is five-ten and the handles are of a good height.  Which is usually a big issue.
Light, easy to use, olds quickly and easily, but unless all you want to store underneath is a piece of paper.... The storage bin under the seat is almost impossible to access without really working at it. I read reviews, I thought this was the best one in this price point, but I'm just not that happy with it.
I've used this stroller for about a year and a half.  It's perfect.  It doesn't have any bells and whistles, but it is an extremely sturdy piece of equipment for a compact umbrella stroller.  The canopy is not great, but I don't expect it to be.  I have a little Honda Civic and this stroller sits unobtrusively in the trunk every day without hampering even big Costco shopping trips.  I like the five-point harness for when my child was smaller, my only complaint now is that I don't think it converts into a three-point harness now that my daughter is older.  (Or if it does, I haven't figured out how.)
This is a fantastic stroller. I originally bought it to take on vacation since I didn't want my full size stroller taking up the entire trunk. I wanted a stroller that would fold up like an umbrella but had a basket to hold my touristy stuff. I'm only 5'2\" and it's actually a little tall for me to push but it's still very comfortable, my husband at 5'9\" says it's just right. My son is almost 3, he's 33 pounds and 36\" and he says he's comfortable. We haven't even gone on vacation yet but we've pretty much retired the old full size stroller because we like this one so much! No problem with the wheels, it's been very smooth and nice.
This doesn't fit easily in our trunk, which is quite spacious.  We had to get something once our baby outgrew his infant car seat, and therefore the accompanying stroller attachment.  It is heavy and bulky, and yet the seat is shallow and the straps are narrow.  It's ok for now since our little one is bundled up for the winter (so the strap doesn't cut into him), but we're probably going to donate it or something and look for a replacement and look in person before shopping online.  The seat really is so shallow, and can't recline, which I wouldn't normally expect, but in something that's so big and bulky otherwise and takes up all of our trunk space, I'd think it would at least have some of the benefits of that.
This stroller is great for the price. This is my second stroller. The first one is Chicco full sized stroller that I'm happy with. I got this one to use during our trip to Europe. The basket is very small compare to my Chicco but I was able to open and close this one with one hand holding my 11 month old son.  It is very easy to push. I'm 5.6 and handles are ok.
We travel a lot and have a 16 month old. Our normal stroller is on the bulky  side and was very expensive. After hearing that many Airlines do not reimburse you if your stroller is damaged when flying, we decided to buy a cheap umbrella stroller. This stroller might be cheap, but has great features and keeps your child secure, safe and comfortable. I have traveled with this stroller over 6 times now, domestic and international, and it takes the beating from getting thrown into an airplane without breaking apart. It has a good size storage compartment and will recline so that your child can sleep. It is easy to fold and unfold- I recently traveled alone with my son to South America and when getting off the plane I had my son asleep in my arms, a backpack and my purse, and I managed to open up the stroller with one hand. It is lightweight and will hold up to 50lbs. There are times I use this stroller for small trips, to  the mall or to a restaurant when I know my other stroller will be too bulky.
This is a very lightweight and easy stroller to manage. It's easy to get up and down and pretty easy to lift into the car. The back sits up straight or reclines. The shade could stand to be a little bigger but it's fine. I can always buy an extender or something if I feel I need it but I don't think I will and we're pasty white Irish folk. We are not big Minnie Mouse fans or anything but we got this because i
We have a Graco jogger that we love. However, it weighs something like 35 pounds, and doesn't fit in the trunk very well. At that weight, it was a pain to get in and out for quick shopping trips. We wanted an umbrella stroller, but one that would recline, had underneath storage, a place to put a cell phone or drink, and a decent size canopy. This stroller meets all those criteria. As a bonus, it is also a bit taller than others we tried, and we like the plastic handles vs. the foam covered ones some other strollers have. We actually fell in love with this one in the store after comparing a few, but it was cheaper on Amazon. Our 1 year old son loves it, and sits happily in it. We don't use it for walks around the neighborhood, going to the park or zoo, since we have the jogger, but I think it would fair well in most situations. We are very happy with our purchase, and have recommended it to friends. The only flaw in the design (and this is likely a problem with all canopied umbrella strollers), is that the canopy is no longer round. It gets bent in half when the stroller is folded up (which is how it's stored in the car), so it now has a permanent almost crease in it, making it look more egg shaped. It still works just fine though.
We bought this as our travel stroller since our main stroller takes up too much room in the back of the SUV.  This served it's purpose.  It's lightweight and folds slim.  My only issues with it are:--You can't wear flipflops and release the lock using your foot (sounds ridiculous but we got this in the summer...and it actually hurt my hand when I tried to close it using that instead).--The wheels fell off the first time we used it.  The two of us both yanked on the wheels after assembling it (as the manual states to do) and they didn't come off but for some reason when we used it on a bumpy street, the two front wheels popped off.  I'm sure it was user error when putting it together but to be honest the manual picture was a little confusing as the wheel mechanism didn't look quite like the drawing!--Canopy is pretty much useless.But again, for the price, it's a good stroller.
This is the first umbrella stroller I have bought. So far I love it and I am excited to travel with it. It doesn't recline as much as I would have hoped but my son likes it so far. We will see how our first trip goes next week with it.
This red Ignite stroller is replacing a Cosmo Combi that I've had for about 2 1/2 yrs as a \"store\" stroller. My 3yr old (37\" and 29lbs) says that she is comfortable in this stroller.  I feel it's good as a store umbrella stroller because:1) It does not shake at all unlike my Combi. You can really get this stroller moving.2) It's really easy to fold up, unless you have flip flops on... then you need to be careful when closing.3) Turns great.  The front wheels do not get hung up and stuck when turning (Combi does).4) The stroller does not get stuck if there's a crack in the sidewalk (Combi).  Very smooth ride for me as I do not have to fight the stroller.5) Sun shade is too, too, too small.  There is a wide opening in the back, even with the seat in the full upright position, which allows sun to hit my very fair daughter.  I purchased a Ray Shade from Babies R Us for $15.99 to keep the sun out.  May not be a problem with a smaller child, but for a 37\" child it is.6) There is no cup holder for the kid.  I purchased one from Babies R Us for $7.99 because my daughter is used to having one (Combi) and I don't want to be stuck in the loop of taking her cup out of the parent cup holder, giving it to her, and then putting it back into the parent cup holder over and over again.7) There are NO mesh pockets.  I checked the entire box, opened from both ends, and there are no mesh pockets any where.  I called the company and even though there are no mesh pockets pictured here or on their website, the stroller is supposed to have them so they are sending them to me.  Great customer service!8) The bottom basket is decent remembering that this is an umbrella stroller and not a full size stroller.  I am also able to put my reusable grocery bags around both handles which balances the weight nicely.9) Does not fully recline.  I would consider the decline to be just leaning back versus laying down.Overall, a good umbrealla stroller for $51.00 plus the $24 in accessories for it.  So much better than Combi. For serious walks/outings I'll stick with my Tike Tech all terrain stroller.
We currently own two main strollers, this one and the Chicco Cortina. The Chicco is a fantastic full-size stroller; however, it is large, heavy and a bit cumbersome. For this reason, we wanted a smaller, more compact stroller. We started with the Jeep umbrella stroller and it was too short, too narrow and simply didn't function as a decent stroller. So began the search for the perfect stroller.The Ignite might possibly be the perfect umbrella stroller!Pros:It is lightweight and folds up very compact- just like an umbrella stroller should. Barely takes up room in my trunk.The parent compartment is awesome. Two cup holders would've been nice, but it does have one nice cup holder and a zippered compartment for your keys, phone, etc.It is much wider than most umbrella strollers. When my son was 18 months, he was already outgrowing our Jeep. He is two now and has oodles of room to grow.Child foot rest- our son seem very comfortable.5 point harness. Our son cannot get out of this thing!Easy recline. Our son doesn't sleep in strollers, but it is nice to be able to recline it sometimes. If your kid falls asleep in the stroller, you could easily recline it while they are sleeping.Tall handles. My husband is 6'4\" and is comfortable pushing this stroller.High Back. My son is rather tall for his age, and his head isn't even close to the top.Goes to 50 lbs- most umbrella strollers top out at 35Handles great! We are very active and out almost every day. This stroller does great on all types of surfaces and is easy to maneuver.It has a basket. Although it isn't super easy to access, it is still there! Not something you find on most umbrella strollers. It fits a diaper pod and a sweat shirt or two just fine. I hang my diaper bag from the handle bars.Insanely easy to assemble.True one-hand fold or open. As a busy mom, this stroller lives up to that feature. The lock switch that locks the stroller up and you pull up to close, it super easy!- Most umbrella strollers are a struggle and often result in a broken nail.Cons:The basket is rather difficult to access. Though, it is an umbrella stroller. While I would not accept this from a full size stroller, I will for this one. To have a basket on such a small stroller, is great and it does come in handy.Only one parent cup holderNo snack tray or cup holder for our kid. I purchased an after market one and will see how it goes.The sun shade is a joke. We are out most of the day, and I don't even bother with it! I have ordered an aftermarket one, and will see if that helps. For now, the sunshade is great for stashing small items- his sippy cup, snacks, etc.If my diaper bag is on the handles, and I take out my son, the stroller will sometimes tip over. This was resolved by putting two small weights above the front wheels.Overall- This is a fantastic purchase! It is my go-to stroller for the majority of our daily outings. I only take my full size out for long day trips now. My son loves this stroller and will often ask to just sit in it! If you are looking for a compact umbrella stroller with full size stroller features- this is the one!
Perfect stroller for keeping in the car. The handles are up way higher than most umbrella strollers so its way more comfortable to push around. Super easy to recline and fold up!
This stroller is a lot bigger than the cheap umbrella stroller that I am replacing.  I was pleasantly suprised with how large it is.  It will grow with my 2 year old and be sturdy enough for a 5 year old.  I will have this stroller for a long time!
This stroller is great for bus rides, tiny trunks and short rides. It's pretty small and light and can fit basically everywhere. Some people have commented about the poor recline, but it's actually come in handy for me. My daughter is 9 months old and a little on the small side, but she passed out in the stroller once. It was nice to be able to recline it to keep her from moving around a lot or slumping forward. No cups for snacks or a bar for toys which would have been nice, this is a pretty simple stroller. It's also not as easy to push up hills as a non-umbrella type stroller.This stroller also worked great with theComfy Baby Deluxe Weatherproof Rain Cover with Retractable Sun Shade and Large Easy-Access Windowif you're looking for a decent rain cover that fits it.
July 2012: My daughter is almost 11 months and I'm just getting around to buying a real stroller instead of the carseat frame or the jogger that we got on craigslist. The harness is very secure. It is easy to fold and unfold while holding a baby. I practiced several times in the living room first. I really like the little zipper pouch on the handle bars where I can put my keys or phone. It maneuvers well 
We got this to replace our First Years \"Jet\" stroller, as that one's foot rest broke. The Ignite is a little beefier than the Jet; its foot rest is more substantial. Also: On the Jet, my feet would hit the stroller's back wheels when I was walking behind it, leading me to push it one-handed and off to the side. I'm only 5'-8\", so it's not that I'm particularly long-legged. I do not have the same problem with the Ignite. The wheel locks work perfectly, and I can normally open and fold this stroller with one arm while holding the kid in the other.Our daughter is almost two years old and average height, and is just large enough to use this stroller safely. Start with something smaller for younger children, or you risk the lowest strap-height being too high for your baby.Why not five stars? Simply put, because the canopy is not adjustable enough. It can be folder or unfolded, but it does not swivel downward to keep sun out of your child's eyes.
Very nice compact, lightweight stroller.  Overall very nice and performed great on our vacation trip.  I like that it comes with a cup holder and a zipped pocket to stow keys, sunglasses, etc.  Not many umbrella strollers come with this.  Solid construction, very light and somewhat easy to use. Easily folds up and locks into place with a solid latch bar.When opening you have to really stretch it out before locking the mechanism into place.  If not, you most likely will bend the metal mechanism.  I did this when getting off the plane and trying to open it up in a hurry.  Fortunately I was able to bend it back into place and we didn't have any issues with it.  Also, the recline/incline operation is a little cumbersome.  Really easy to recline, but if you want to move the seat back to a more upright position you have to move the seat up with your hand and grab the 2 strings and pull them sideways to lock it into position.  Seems like some better thought could have been put into the design of that.Storage area is a good size, but can be difficult to slide larger packages into it, due to the folding support bars in the way.Most of these are just minor inconveniences really.  We spent a lot of time researching and testing out other umbrella strollers and they all have their pros and cons.  We found that this provided the best value for the money.  You might get a little bit better performance from others, but you will definitely pay for it.
Reviews were great so I bought it. Waste of money. Doesn't recline enough for them to even call it a &#34;reclining&#34; stroller. Feels super cheap and rickety. Very bumpy ride. My daughter couldn't begin to nap in this - and she naps anywhere. Regret the purchase. Spend the extra money and get an uppababy g-lite or something. Wish I had.
I got this stroller because it was a pain heaving our big jogging stroller down a flight of stairs everytime I wanted to take a walk (we live on the second floor). I am 5'8 and my partner is 5'10 and this stroller is the perfect height for both of us. It seems comfortable for our 27 pound 14 month old. The seat does recline back but I have never used it. He likes to be sitting upright and alert on walks. He doesn't like to miss a thing! The sunshade is not much but it helps. I always put sunblock on him before walks anyhow, as well as a baseball cap.This stroller folds up pretty easily (though you do have to set it on the ground to fold it up and really can't do it while holding a child) and is not too cumbersome to carry up the stairs with one hand while my child is on the opposite hip. It is perfect to toss in the trunk for a trip to the mall or the college to walk the nature trail. I am glad I bought this and am getting my money's worth for sure. It is a nice little stroller and does the job.
This is our 3rd stroller. We have a full size aprica and a nice jogger and wanted something lighter that folded smaller for trips or mall/outlet outtings with our 17 month old. I got the pop of teal color, very nice. Super easy to set up and our son seems to really enjoy it. He is 25lbs and 33\" and has plenty of room. The basket underneath is quite small but then again I didn't buy this stroller for storage space. My purse fits great over the bars or the mommy hook comes in handy. I can put his snack bag, toys, and a blanket underneath. Folds up and opens with ease. Wish there was a small detachable snack tray though but no biggie. This is the first stroller where we had to use the shoulder straps for our Son. He'd be trying to escape if we didn't use them. The stroller pushes so easily and turns wonderfully. I think it's definitely worth the money. Oh and I am 5'8\" and my husband is 6'1\" and the stroller is a perfect height. Love it!!Update:  So after taking this stroller for a stroll, I am not sure I am all that happy with it:/  Like the previous reviewer commented, the crotch strap is very narrow and cuts into our 17 month old.  We also have to keep pushing him back up in the seat as he seems to slide down, thus causing the crotch buckle to slide off the slide. I really had high hopes for this stroller. In the meantime, I placed an order for the Britax B Nimble and praying we do not receive the 2010 model that some reviewers complained about being in the recall period. Britax has a strong reputable history of producing high quality carseats and strollers. I am taking a star off of the ignite because the straps are so narrow and there are no strap pads which would've been helpful.
We live in Chicago and walk almost everywhere. It's crucial that we have a good, well-made stroller. This one definitely fits the bill, and it's cheap too. It's a nice-looking stroller that still looks great after a year of hard use. My kiddo gets a smooth ride, even over lots of uneven sidewalks and in the snow. My husband is 6'0\", and I'm 5'5\", and we both find it comfortable to push.As others have noted, the canopy is kind of meager. We don't really use it, just throw a baseball cap on the kiddo. The bottom basket isn't huge, but we manage to squeeze a lot of stuff in there. We also tend to have bags looped over the handles. My husband takes the stroller when they go grocery shopping, and he manages to get a couple days worth of groceries onto the stroller.Two vital accessories for us have been:1)JJ Cole Original Toddler Bundleme, Graphite, Toddler2)Jeep Deluxe Stroller Weather Shield
I am very happy with this purchase!  I was looking for an easy to transport, lightweight stroller with taller handles for my 6' 3&#34; husband.  We took it on vacation and it has been great!  We still use it almost everyday for errands, etc.  I love the 5 point harness, the parent's console (zip pocket for our keys, extra binky and small toy and a cup holder for our coffee), the ease of use and that we can use it until our son is 50lbs - most others are up to 35lbs.  The basket underneath is a bit hard to access directly from the back, but I found it easier to access it from the sides which I'm fine with since I would rather have one than none at all.  I wish the shade was a bit bigger and moveable but it works.  I also wish it would recline further, but again, this is just a travel stroller, so I'm fine with that too.  I would rate this 5 stars otherwise.  I would definitely recommend this to anyone else looking for a lightweight, quality, [step-up from the] umbrella stroller :)
I purchased this  stroller while I was in the process of moving and all of our normal things were in storage. I was looking for something light,  easy to use, sturdy, and  not a typical umbroller but  affording the general conveniences of one.  I was divided between the Jet and the Ignite.  I have never  seen the jet in person, but after seeing pictures of it online that another reviewer had posted this one seemed more solid. It does weigh more, but I feel the fabric is  sturdy, and the construction is well made.  I use this stroller to walk my daughter around stores, parks the beach and around our neighborhood.  It is NOT  a stroller that will store all of your things, but if you have a phone, camera water bottle,  bib  diapers and wipes and some toddler food and some other smaller items,  it will hold what you want.  You won't hunch over  using it.  I'm  five  and a half feet tall my uncle and father are over six feet, none of us has to hunch over while using it,  nor do any of us kick the wheels.  My stroller is NOT  the color it appeared in the picture. It is not a bright ice blue/ teal it definitely darker, but I really like it.  I thought it would fold up smaller than it does, but its not giant at all, slightly bigger than an umbroller.  to clarify, it  is longer, and a little wider  than a traditional umbrella stroller.  It fits in my Outback with out any issue and doesn't take up a monstrous amount of room. We lined up a cheap umbroller and a  middle of the road umbroller next to this and its obviously taller and wider and really more substantial, with the conveniences I wanted, but not the weight.  Despite it being a hair less compact than a traditional umbroller, this is the &#34;out and about&#34; stroller  I had been looking for!
We purchased this for travel with our nearly 2-year-old daughter.  Our everyday stroller is a Bob Revolution, which we LOVE but is not practical for travel. Although I would never use this as an &#34;everyday&#34; stroller, it met or exceeded our expectations for the purposes of travel.It handles very, very well.  Better than I expected, especially for the price.  It's no Bob but it was easy to steer and can be managed one-handed if necessary.  We did notice a wheel rattle which annoyed me but did not bother my daughter or husband.  For the price, I could live with it.  My daughter was very comfortable in this stroller and napped easily.  The recline is minimal but it was enough to assure her head was supported.  It was lightweight enough to lift onto public transportation and to carry up stairs occasionally.  It was narrow enough to fit on an escalator open and fully loaded kid and all (not ideal but the only option at some 'el' stations).Several reviews commented on the basket.  I wanted to give my 2 cents on this.  If you're used to a huge travel system basket you may be disappointed.  However, was happy with the basket and loaded it up.  I was able to fit a lunch bag full of snacks, a rain cover, a stroller gate check bag, a sippy cup and my daughters skip hop backpack filled with toys in the basket.  I could hang my skip hop diaper bag from the handles using the bag's stroller straps.  In the included &#34;parent console&#34; I had a water bottle and stuffed hats & mittens for both my daughter and I in the zippered pocket.  It was not easy but also not overly difficult to get at everything.  Over the course of our trip I quickly figured out how to load it to make what I needed most often accessible.  As long as the basket was fully loaded, the skip hop diaper bag on the handles did not tip the stroller when my daughter got out.Overall, I'm so glad we bought this and would highly recommend at this price!
This is a lot more comfortable and has more features than a \"cheap\" umbrella stroller, but still is light & easy to fold and carry. My biggest complaint is that the basket underneath is basically useless as the \"x\" cross bar completely blocks it. May want to get an add on net or at least some hooks if you plan on shopping or bringing many toys. Also, after walking on a sunny day, we decided to get theProtect-a-Bub Single Compact Sunshade, Blackto use for walks... it gets the job done and folds up well with the stroller.
I have a smaller car and needed a smaller stroller that I could leave in my trunk. This one is perfect. My larger stroller that has the car seat that clicks on was nice but I'd have to take the wheels off and it took up my whole trunk. This stroller is small enough so I can still fit other stuff back there too.I can fold it up one handed. It's good for babies about one year and older tho. It's more of a flatter seat not like a scoop seat for tiny babies.Got it when my son turned one. He's two now and it's still working great! Good buy for us!
I love this stroller. I spent a lot of time researching different models. I chose this one because of the features, lightweight and cost. The cup holder is great which you can't seem to find on a lot of models. Bottom basket is small but good enough to hold a jacket and hat.
If you need to carry a lot of stuff, this is not the stroller for you. It is next to impossible to put anything in the basket.  It also doesn't have a bar in front of the seat, so nothing for the child to lean on.I have only used this a couple times because it just doesn't have what I need.  I have replaced this with something else.
We have used this stroller in airports, in malls, in outdoor shopping centers, on walks with the dog, in the grocery store... It's just a great all-around stroller! I keep it in my trunk because it's lightweight yet sturdy. The wheels roll smoothly over anything! And the partial sunshade is an added bonus.
So easy to fold and unfold, which was what I was looking for.  not like the last stroller I had, it was a nightmare.  the only thing is that the bottom storage is hard to get too b/c of the crossing bars.
We got this for our big six month old and have been using it for six months (baby is now a year and 30+ pounds and tall). We keep it in the trunk and use it a lot, including vacation. I wish the lower storage level was easier to access, but that's pretty minor. Very sturdy for a light stroller.
My daughter is 2, 35&#34; and 30lbs, and she loves this stroller.  It is lightweight and compact.  Very comparable to the $20 umbrella stroller you see at target etc in size.  Very easy to open and close, easy to adjust the straps and the angle of seat incline.  My only dislike:  the awning or cover to protect her from the sun is tiny.  I somehow damaged mine almost immediately and it won't open completely, which makes it worse.  Otherwise, I love this stroller, and so does my daughter.
I have owned this stroller for a few months now, and it is a nice inexpensive option but won't last for multiple children.What I love:Very easy to maneuver!The seat recline is enough for an older baby/toddler and is easy for Mom or Dad to do.Compact fold.Parent Tray...I love love love this!!Tall handles!!  Such a great feature unlike the traditional cheapo umbrella stroller.Upright seat when not reclined...my son likes to sit up and look around.What I don't:The quality leaves much to be desired.Wobbly wheels, but it's not a deal breaker.Fabric on the foot rest part ripped after only 2 weeks of use.The X bars on the back make the basket difficult to access.I would prefer for the handles to be one solid piece...they may break/become loose after some serious use.All in all I think this is a wonderful travel/lite use stroller but you get what you pay for.  If you are looking for an umbrella stroller to use everyday consider something better quality like the Maclaren Triumph or Quest.  We burn the wheels off of our strollers and this just didn't cut it for constant use so it now stays at the sitter's house.
We bought the First Years Ignite Stoller to have when we travel so we did not have to bring our big Britax stroller. Overall, I like the Ignite stoller, but here are my pros and cons:Pros:1) Light weight and easy to pick up2) Nice, tall height for the handles on the stroller3) Easy to adjust straps on the seat4) The stroller is easy to collaspe and does not take up too much room in the hall closetCons:1) Strange cross bars make it hard to use the storage basket under the seat2) The shade on the stroller is very small and not that helpful to protecting baby from the sun, rain, etcI think this is a reasonably priced smaller stroller that is great for trips but not everyday use.
I do like this stroller but the color I see on my screen and what showed up are completely different.  Its more of a greenish teal - ewwwww!  Not what I was hoping for.  Ended up with a Chicco  - highly recommend :)
Our DK Innovations stroller lost a wheel and it appears they don't make them anymore.  We were heartbroken as 6' and 6'1 parents with shorter 5'7&#34; and 5'6&#34; grandparents. We had lugged that light stroller everywhere with its adjustable handles and light weight.We were facing a trip to Chicago so read reviews (thank you, members!) and decided to plunk down cash for the Minnie Mouse version of this stroller for our size of a 4 year old daughter (who is 2 1/2), thinking it would encourage her to sit in it.I don't have much experience with strollers.  We had the DK which was the go to stroller...and we have a BOB Stoller Strides running stroller, which is like a piece of well oiled machinery but is totally far too heavy, wide, bulky to, say, go to the mall or take on a plane...not to mention much harder for your child to see anything in as they sit more reclined, back further.  But for running, that stroller is amazing.Enter this one.  It was undoubtedly, as many reviewers stated, not a lightweight umbrella stroller as you think of them.  It probably would have been easier lugging this around being the model beneath this one, a few pounds lighter...but we chose this one because of the reclining back, which was used about 10 times in a 4 day trip, and the attaching sun cover, which we needed almost constantly.This stroller is pretty heavy duty-much more well built than I expected based off our DK stroller.  The handles do sit high on it but because of their shape, it's easy for my parents to push her too.The seat base of the stroller doesn't sink around and cup her butt like a normal umbrella stroller--it's much wider and more constructed and looks like it will hold her for many, many years going forward.  Or in the case of my daughter, maybe until she's 4 and 5 feet tall. ;).While not super easy to reach, the storage compartment was a lifesaver at the Lincoln Park Zoo to hold her blankie, snacks, etc. and the beverage tray was a great lifesaver for our water.The one complaint I have about the stroller is where the wheels are positioned, when my daughter fell asleep her feet would fall off the footrest and dangle and catch the wheels.  We would have to &#34;pop a wheelie&#34; with the stroller to get her shoes not to rub against the wheels.  Strangers would spot this, horrified, before we noticed.  On the bright side, apparently it's really comfortable for her to sleep in otherwise!
I needed a stroller that would fit in my trunk, but it also had to be something I could push comfortably (I'm 6' tall).  After a lot of googling and reading reviews, I gave this one a shot because it was one of the few that didn't cost upwards of $200 and seemed like it could accommodate tall babies as well as tall parents.It's all right.  My son doesn't seem to have any complaints, but then again, he doesn't have many words yet.  I have a few minor gripes about it though:- The canopy is not very effective at keeping sun off child.- The mechanism to adjust the recline is annoying (it's pretty much just a drawstring).- Handles are not *quite* tall enough to push comfortably.- There's a cupholder for grownups, but it's flimsy and shallow.- Assembly instructions for putting the wheels on are not the clearest -- make sure you don't put them on upside down, since they're kind of a bitch to remove and put on right-side-up. :&#60;It would also be really nice to have a cupholder for the passenger.  The manual says that &#34;not all models include a cupholder,&#34; which implies that there are some models that DO include a cupholder, but it seems to be a well-kept secret as to which models those are...All in all, it's not a bad little stroller for under $80.
For the price this is an AWESOME stroller!  We use this for our travel stroller since it takes up a lot less room in the car than our Britax B-Ready.  This is also the stroller we'll use when we fly in a few weeks.PROS:--Lightweight--(small) Storage basket underneath--Included and attached drink holder and storage pouch--Reclines somewhat--Nice sunshade with a lock feature--Comfortable handles.  I'm 5'4&#34; and my husband is 5'10&#34; and we're both comfortable pushing this strollerCONS:--Small basket underneath (to be expected).  I can't fit my big diaper bag in it, so we usually just use a small bag for a few diapers, wipes, and a bottle.  This isn't a deal breaker for us--Basket is hard to access.  Really close to the bottom of the seat.  I wish it was lower to the ground, but maybe if it was it would be kicked?--Seat is not very deep.  Sometimes I feel like our 8 month sits too far forward--The seat hardly reclines.  I feel like this is a feature that could have been eliminated since it really doesn't make a difference, but that's just my opinion.Overall, we are incredibly happy with this stroller and we plan on using it for years to come.  Can't beat the price either!
I have had Combi Urban stroller for several years. The wheels are absolutely terrible, so after having another baby, I decided I needed a different stroller.My main requirements: tall handles, good wheels and umbrella fold to fit in my tiny trunk of Mazda5. For the most part, this stroller is what I was lookingfor. Few complaints: its a bit difficult to fold, forget doing it, while holding a baby. Also its a bit bigger,than I expected, so takes more room, than Combi.Also, please read over the manual, before you put the wheels on. I put them on wrong and my father-in-law had to go in with a screwdriver to get them off, which was not easy! My bad, but there should be some warning on the wheels  for idiots , like myself! I think thats where some of the bad reviewscome from. Overall, pretty good for the price, hope it holds up.
I've had several strollers during the growth of my children. I think it's a little pricey at regular price but good quality. I bought an amazon warehouse deal for $ 45 and came as new. It's super lightweight, so for purposes of travel comes in handy.
I just received this stroller. My tall 3.5 year old sat in it and she fits fine. The foot rest could have been made a little lower, so her legs can be more comfortable, but she's fine. Her head does not brush against the top of the canopy. I love the parent console, it seems durable. The maneuvering seems great too. I steered it with one hand with my big 3.5 year old in it and it was good. I really wanted a Maclaren, but they're so expensive! This was my next choice and it was only under $60! Overall I think it's a great umbrella stroller for the price. It looks great and durable. I just wish it had a stroller strap to carry when folded.
The stroller is an excellent buy, lightweight, and well built.The first time I used it was at the airport and it was very easy to handle and fold. The only setback is that it is hard to use the bin at the bottom due to crossing bars at the back. However, all in all I highly recommend this stroller for parents who move around a lot with their kids and need a stroller that is light and easy to handle.
After reading on the top selling strollers on amazon and watching youtube reviews, we decided to select the First Years Ignite Stroller, Pop of Teal.  We love this stroller, it's super light and easy to assembled.  Our 14 month old son loves being in this stroller.  Like some of the reviews, it doesn't go too far down maybe a couple of inches but it's enough for our to fall asleep without his head bobbing around.  I would recommend this stroller.
Nice looking stroller, especially for the price (I for one was not about to pay hundreds of dollars for a stroller when this will do the job.) It looks more expensive than it is.I just wish it reclined.  The \"recline\" feature is pretty weak--only about a 70 degree angle. If it reclined flat (or close to it), this would be the perfect stroller.***UPDATE: We've been using this stroller heavily for several months now and have been very pleased. It's durable, easy to fold, and very well priced. You will need to buy an additional sunshade, because the sunshade is largely useless. I just wish it reclined fully...
we have the uppa baby vista stroller which is awesome but it's bulky. we wanted to find something that was easy to use in smaller spaces and easy to carry (i'm only 5'2&#34; with a growing boy)! this works just fine; i find that it's better quality than most in this price range. don't expect super high end like some of the ones you'll spend a lot more on but for the price i think it offers a lot.pros: the seat adjusts forward and back which is great for our son. has a harness clasp which is safer. there is a canopy which keeps most (not all) of the sun out and there are brakes on the wheels. the top handles have a cup holder and a small zip compartment. we haven't been in a situation where it's been totally soiled but it's been very easy to clean so far.we're very happy with this and i'd recommend if you're looking for an easy to use lightweight stroller that doesn't cost a fortune.
The first stroller we got was the Britax B-Agile but when you travel often you want something lighter. This stroller has a great size, it folds and is compact. It is also very comfortable as the seat is padded. I love the fact that you can adjust the canopy and that it reclines really low. Would recommend it 100%.
We really are happy with our purchase. We've had this for 2 months now and we use it every single day to take our 7 month old for a walk through the neighborhood every morning. He fits in it well, the 5 point harness is great and I like the back support that it provides. The harness height is adjustable to 3 heights so we'll be able to use it for a few years. People have complained about the wheels, but we've had NO issues with ours and we roll this thing all over horribly uneven flagstone sidewalks every day.It's lightweight, comfortable to push (I am 5'8\" and my husband is 6'1\").I gave it a 4 only because of a few minor (but not dealbreakers for us) issues that others have also said before me:1. the storage underneath is ample, but the access to it is awful! I figured out though that if the kid is not in the stroller, you can push the back of the seat forward to allow more room for access. That works as long as you don't need to access a larger bag in there too often.2. The sun cover really doesn't do much and it's annoying that it's not adjustable, but we bought an extender cover that works quite well.I will be traveling to Europe with it in 5 weeks and will update when I get back.
This is a nice umbrella stroller. Nice for traveling and quick trips. Folds up easy and let's a toddler sit more upright.
Nice little stroller, folds flat, easy to use, secure, good value.We have another stroller with cup holders and more surface area for toys etc, but when it's in the trunk there is no room for anything else, so we purchased this one as our &#34;bare bones&#34; stroller for traveling and it has worked out great.
This stroller is easy to open and close, maneuvers nicely, and fits in the car.  The only thing is I wish the bottom storage was easier to access.  Because of the cross bars to fold it, it is hard to get a diaper bag in and out of it.
I really like this stroller. It's smooth and so light. We were still using our travel system stroller. My son loves going for walks in this one.Pros:Easy to steerComfy for childGreat cup holder/zipper pouchHas a basketHigher handles5 point harnessThe straps are easy to adjustCons:The recline is kind of cheap and odd to use. It's a set of small ropes that you slide a plastic thing on to adjust.. You only have sitting up and a very slight recline.The basket is not easily accessible. The opening is narrow because of the bars.The crotch strap is way too close to the back of the seat rather than the front. I had to make it as loose as it can go, but it's still underneath my son. I don't like that at all, and it seems as he gets bigger it will be even more uncomfortable for him.
I purchased this stroller because we had to leave our \"The First Years Jet\" at home when I went to live with family while my husband was deployed.  I absolutely loved the Jet, but I thought the Ignite would be slightly better (more comfortable ride etc.) because of the price difference/description.Unfortunately, the canopy does not adjust (at all) like the one on the Jet version.  The description should be changed because it states it has a \"fully adjustable canopy\"....unless you consider \"fully adjustable\" the fact that you can open and close it!We have an extremely pale child, so it was one of the major selling points for me.  Unfortunately, I do not have time to order the Jet and return the Ignite, so we will just have to improvise!**Except for the canopy** the pros and cons here also describe \"The First Years Jet\" version we started with:Pros:- looks very nice and well built (the Khaki color is attractive and great for warmer/extremely sunny climates)- is VERY easy to push and turns quickly- +TALL HANDLES+ and great design keep me (5'7\") my husband (5'10\") and my father (6'1\") from having to bend while walking or kick the wheels like in most small strollers!- the *5-point* harness keeps my active little guy from trying to play with the wheels while moving like in other small strollers!- the ride is nice for both child and parent- the seat has more cushion (a bit more on Ignite than Jet).  Other small inexpensive strollers usually just have a board on the bottom with some fabric over it.- the recline is far enough back for sleeping/resting children.- VERY easy to assemble...(maybe 5 minutes if you include the unwrapping time) just pop on the wheels and snap the canopy on, and you're good to go!- super light and easy to fold/unfold and store.- does not take up much space in the car.- great price (Jet was about $20 less).- nice little parent console - can hold some extra toys, snacks, etc.- storage on bottom holds a small (size of a large purse) diaper bag and the ergo carrier easily.Cons:- Canopy does not adjust (on Ignite)- Storage on bottom is not very easy to access due to the frame criss-cross in back so you have to get creative sometimes.
We got this stroller as one that is smaller and easier transport than the one that was part of our chicco cortina travel system (we do love it, just can't really fit much else in the trunk!). This is a great alternative. My one year old is over 26 lbs and 32 inches. We wanted something he'd fit in for a while. He seems fine in it and comfortable. I love to parent \"tray\"! I will say that the stroller is sturdy, but the handles to feel a little cheap. Also, the basket can fit things, but you do have to maneuver around the frame. I think you just can't beat the price if this stroller!
Before my family and I took our 7 month old son cross country, I spent months trying to find an umbrella stroller that we could take on the plane with ease. We have a BOB, but didn't want the airline to ruin it.  After lots of searching, I took a chance on this stroller. So far, it's been 4 months and we love it. We can take it anywhere, it's easy to steer with one hand, and it's great for tall people. My husband and I are both 5'10&#34; and we don't have to bend over to push it. It folds up with ease too! I will say, I do agree with the reviews about the umbrella part getting dirty if the wheels are dirty. My tip, use a baby wipe to clean off the wheels before folding it up. I honestly don't have any complaints. We have taken this on the sidewalks, gravel and dirt walkways- all through major cities and have been very pleased with the durability. We also love the color and find it to be gender neutral!
Here is my review of the First Years Ignite Stroller. I have only used it three times so far. It is a really hard adjustment going from the car seat stroller to an umbrella stroller (for both Nolan and I).  The stroller itself is fine, besides the major lack of sun protection. The sun visor only has a few positions, which I feel is a poor design. It is really hard to transition Nolan from his car seat to his stroller without waking him up. The seat doesn&#8217;t cradle them in and I feel as if the crotch belt is what is holding him in place. It&#8217;s as if the actually seat part where their bottom goes is too narrow, because when he sits, he uses his thighs mostly as his balancing point (not sure if this makes sense). He cannot put his feet on anything to balance out the weight. That is why I feel like the crotch belt is holding him up. He seems somewhat comfortable in the stroller, but I don&#8217;t think it is a comfortable as other strollers, mostly because of the seat part. Will I think Nolan grow into the stroller? Yes&#8230;when he&#8217;s two. Will I think I learn to like it? I hope so. If he was my only child and I knew we were not having more, I think I would invest in a bit bulkier stroller so he could be more comfortable. I also don&#8217;t like that I can&#8217;t hang my diaper bag easily on the handles. I really think this stroller is designed for a bigger toddler. Not an 8 month old, like we have. In the end, I am going to try and return it (success!) and find a bit bulkier stroller that suits Nolan&#8217;s needs.
Was looking for a lightweight umbrella type stroller but didn't want the cheap versions.  With my older child (8yrs ago) I had a Jeep brand that I loved.  I researched and decided on this Ignite and so glad I did.  It is perfect!!The height of the handles is tall enough for dad and still a good height for shorter \"pushers\" as well.  The handles are a soft rubberized material that will hold up better than the foam covered handles did on my Jeep stroller.  The ease of assembly and opening/closing is nice.  Quick lock/unlock mechanism can be controlled with your foot, has a locking clip to keep folded as well.Wheels maneuver easily on different surfaces and front wheels can be locked into a non-rotating mode to prevent wheel wobble when needed as well.  Kick locks on rear wheels hold firmly.Holds up to 50 lbs which is a decent weight and should hold older/larger child nicely, although mine is only a yr old and 20lbs right now.  The 5pt harness is easily adjustable and had no problem getting the right fit.  The canopy is big enough to provide good coverage and can be adjusted in different positions.  It can also be removed completely if desired.A lot of umbrella strollers don't have cargo areas under them either, this one has a descent amount of space, and while it is kind of a tight squeeze, it is usable and definitely a plus.  Also, the cup holder and zippered pouch on the handles is great!! Holds my large 24 oz cup securely and the zippered pouch is large enough to hold my wallet, keys, phone, and more all at once.The only thing I don't really care for is the way the seat reclines.  It has pull cords on the back that you either tighten up for upright position or loosen to recline.  This does allow for multiple levels of recline, but it doesn't actually lock in position, so when reclined, my daughter was able to sit up and the seat back just moved with her.  There was quite a bit of movement as she continued to sit up and back several times.Overall, very happy with my purchase and would recommend to anyone!!
After reading several reviews, we bought two of these for our Disney trip.  Very happy that we did!  Folds and carries well, comfortable for kids (ours are ages 3 and 5) and carries plenty of supplies and souvenirs.  Very, very pleased that we spent a little extra on these instead of the flimsy umbrella strollers we saw many parents hunched over. I'm 5'6&#34; and hubby is 5'10&#34; and we were very comfortable with the height of the handles.
FOr everyday use, this is a great little stroller. It has a little bit of storage underneath, and I always hang my diaper bag on the handles, but it will tip over if there is no baby riding in it when you do that. Thats frustrating at first, but I got used to it. Easy to use, clean, and carry! I didnt give it 5 stars because I wish you could lay the baby down in a more reclined position. My daughter just can't nap in it.
I purchased this stroller after the recommendation of Mary Hunt (author of Debt-Free Living) and it is perfect for us. It is easy to fold down with one hand, easy to pop up, the 5-point harness is great for my 6-month granddaughter. Shipping was very fast.  The only Con I have is that the canopy isn't adjustable, but I purchased a cheap Rayshade UV Protective Stroller Shade that easily velcro's on offering more sun/rain protection. I like the parent bag, it is large enough for my insulated tumbler and cell phone, car keys, wallet, snack bag of toddler food & a pack of chewing gum.
We bought this stroller because it was more lightweight than our City Mini. While we love our City Mini, this stroller was used for traveling. I can break it down and open this stroller with one hand while holding my infant with the other. I wish it came with a standard front tray but that's not a deal breaker. I suppose you can buy one to add on. Other than that, the stroller serve its purpose for us.
Love this stroller!  It might seem a little expensive for just an umbrella stroller, but this one is worth it.  The best features in my opinion are:1.  Reclining seat (which you will not get with a cheap umbrella stoller), so if baby falls asleep you can lay her back2.  Larger size, so it can accomodate either my 11 month old or my 3 year old, depending on who needs a rest3.  Nice large canopy (I was surprised with how big it is, it doesn't look that large in the photos)4.  Cupholder/key holder and storage basket.  We took this stoller to a football game and were able to get our becco carrier, umbrella, and a blanket in the storage basket, and then use the cupholder/keyholder to hold our phones/keys with room to spare.Seriously, I have 2 other stollers, and if I had bought this one first I would have only needed it!!
We actually ordered the Maclaren Techno XT 2 days before ordering this stroller, and ended up returning that stroller with the box unopened.  We determined that this stroller gave us what we needed, and even though we could afford the Maclaren, we didn't think we needed to spend that kind of money on something that would sit in the trunk and get used once every 1-2 weeks.  We use the BOB Revolution on an almost daily basis when at home, so most of our walking is done with that stroller.  This stroller was actually purchased for travel, with the thought that we wouldn't be overly upset if the airlines destroyed it.  Well, we haven't gotten to use it for travel yet, but have used it when we've had to drive to other places and couldn't take our BOB.  We like the stroller, and the price is great.  It was super easy to put together and moves nicely.  We like the handles way more than the handle we had on our Snap `n Go;  it's easier to maneuver with 1 hand and still feels stable.  I do wish that I could collapse the stroller more easily, though.  Maybe I'm doing it wrong, but when I use my foot to push the metal bar up, if I'm wearing flip flops, I get a bruise on my foot.  I also wish the storage compartment was more easily accessible.  The canopy is small and doesn't give a lot of coverage, but we haven't used this stroller in the sun yet so it doesn't bother us.  Our 10 month old loves the stroller, and enjoys the forward facing view.  Overall, this is an outstanding stroller at a reasonable price.Update: After using this stroller for a couple of weeks, I've found that I can't put anything in the basket under the stroller, which can be super frustrating.  Maybe a small item, but nothing in a bag or box, etc., making the basket useless.  The maker should modify the basket so that you can get to it from the side, at least.  Still, we got the stroller more for the kid's transportation than for its basket, so for under $60, this is still a great stroller.
After outgrowing our travel system ( and being tired of hauling the damn thing around) I spent weeks looking at basically every single stroller on the market. Since we fly a lot I wanted something that wasn't too pricey and would be durable.I got this in the mail and I was amazed at how nice it was for the price. It does recline a good amount, enough for our toddler to sleep in I am assuming (we got it today) and he was loving it as soon as I started pushing him around the house. He isn't used to having a tray and I think his only problem will be not having his snacks in front of him. The fabric is nice and the color is pretty much dead on.I am really tall for a woman at 5' 8\" and I wasn't kicking the tires which I did read some people had an issue with. And the handlebars are comfortably high enough.The basket below is smaller than I would have thought but it should hold a jacket or two and some toys and a bottle of water.I did read that a few people had an issue with using this one handed, not entirely sure what the issue was but I was able to open it and break it down with one hand/foot. The thing with the bottom bar/lock is you have to snag the latch with your foot and pull it out slightly, but it isn't that bad to deal with.
Update: I've owned this for nearly 2 years and it is still holding up. It is my go-to stroller. It has been on multiple airplanes (via gate checks) and looks fine.----------------We bought this stroller to take on a trip (airport, parents', taxis...). What a great travel stroller! Very lightweight and appears to be comfortable. You can collapse it with one hand and your foot, which helps if you have to hold a baby. You can open in with one hand and a foot too. It has a very simple string mechanism for recline, and while it doesn't recline very far, it is far enough for the types of use it sees from us. Our son loves this stroller because it is pretty nimble--we \"pop wheelies\" and race around the house in it. Our sitter prefers this to our other stroller (a much loved City Select from Baby Jogger) for its weight and the ease with which she can push it up hills. Much more comfortable than an umbrella stroller for not much more weight or cost. If you need a stroller for trips, this is a good choice.
I have the khaki Stroller for about 3 weeks now and its great. I have nothing to complaint about. The material is perfect and very good quality . I am planing to travel overseas with my boy when he is 15 month old \"God willing\", and this stroller will be my friend through the trip.Go for it you will not regret it.
Got this stroller for an upcoming trip, it looks good, rides smoothely, all the features EXCEPT for adjustable canopy are as described. LOVE the parent tray, its like a little purse, storage basket is good for a little diaper bag but if the seat is reclined you won't be able to get anything from the basket. It's not super lightweight but much lighter then my travel system stroller, but I hope it will be more durable then a 10-pound umbrella stroller. Can't really fold it with one hand though, maybe need some practise with that. Overall, stroller is nice and well worth the money.
I purchased this stroller for a frequent guest at my house - my infant nephew. He and I have road tested it only once, but the test was a doozy.  That day was apparently the day every street in my (more urban than suburban) neighborhood was due for re-paving! The stroller was good on various kinds of dug up, rocky cement and brick terrains and took corners quite easily.  I wish it was a bit easier to control with one hand.  It's easily folded, but was a little bit of a pain to fit in my trunk(older 3 series BMW) which would be more of an issue if we were planning to travel with it. I love that it came in an all-black option (city chic) as I am no fan of the patterns that generally come on strollers, car seats, etc. I'd definitely buy this model again. That said, I bought this stroller with confidence because some Amazon reviewers have really taken the time to give good reviews. Please read them. Some of these ladies really know their strollers!
this stroller is perfect for me. Absolutely. Main reason why I bought it, is the size. It folds up really really really easy and nice in my trunk. It is also light. Assembly is no problem. Many parents have stopped me on the street asking me where I got this stroller. I have a 2 year old, who looks and weighs more like a 4 year old and this stroller is perfect size-wise. It does not have that cushion-y padding but I got accessories for that. If he falls asleep on it, I simply carry around with me a neck roll. Slight con - the room on the bottom to put some stuff on while strolling around is close to useless. It is hard to access it, almost blocked that you have to maneuver your way around to putting something underneath so I dont really use it, still it was not enough to knock off s tar. This stroller is very practical. light, easy, small.
We live in a 5th floor walk-up so we had to ditch out our old (very heavy) Graco stroller. I wanted a lightweight stroller that didn't leave me broke. My husband put this together in like 3 mins. My son fits in just fine (he's 28lbs and 31\" tall) the handles are very comfortable for me (I'm 5'1\")and for hubby(he's 6'1\"). The issues I have with it are these: I wish it would recline a little more and the pull tab on the back not be so hard to set. Also the criss-cross frame in back makes it hard to access storage on bottom, so I have to stuff everything in through the side. I carry the diaper bag over the handles because it's easier.Still, I really do like this stroller very much. The price was excellent and it does the job it was meant for.
The good:- Light- Compact- Rolls better than I expectedThe bad:- I don't really trust the locking mechanism for when its folded up- The top canopy, although useful, has never been used (this is my fault, but, really, why did I think i needed this, i use it in airports and malls only)- Its a bit difficult to lock it into place when setting it up with a baby in 1 hand, stroller in the other, and trying to do it with your shoe.  Mainly, the 'storage' compartment under the seat kinda gets in the way of you pushing the bar down to keep it fully expanded.  I'm able to do it, but its not a 1s ordeal, sometimes it takes 5s.  Big deal? no, but its a pain to repeatedly do this....Bottom line:  its a decent stroller.  I don't regret the purchase, I don't jump up and down over it either.
Wow, I didn't expect to get such a great quality stroller for around $50! I was about to buy Britax Blink Lightweight Stroller, Double Dots which was on sale for $99, but then I saw this stroller in suggestions. I immediately noticed the amount of 4 and 5 star reviews and I thought, I should really look into it.Pros:- comfortable open seat, my kids love to look around and see everything.- handlebar console - parent tray with 1 cup holder and pockets for the keys, cell phones, wallets. Very roomy.- tall handles. I am 5'5, my husband is 6'1 and we both feel comfortable pushing the stroller. Also when we walk we never hit the wheels with our feet because of the way this stroller is made.- rubber wheels - smooth ride. They are a bit bigger and because they are made of rubber they do not make as much noise compare to hard wheels that you see on umbrella strollers often.- YOU CAN PUSH AND TURN THIS STROLLER WITH 1 HAND! This is really great for a lightweight stroller.- easy umbrella style fold. Pretty lightweight (14 lbs) but it is heavier than the umbrella stroller and therefore a lot sturdier.- this feels a little like all terrain stroller. I had no problem pushing it on a grass field.- love the 5 point harness. Very comfortable and well made. It is same as in our expensive BumbleRide 2010 Indie Twin Stroller I was really happy to see that because it is so easy to close and open!- Great style! Great value for the money!Cons:- I don't really like the cross black metal thing in the back but it does add support so it's ok.- Basket is a bit small and hard to reach.- As in many other umbrella and lightweight strollers, the seat does not recline all the way flat. It still reclines some. I do not need this feature but some people do, so I thought I'd mention it.I can't think of anything else negative about this stroller right now. I am very happy with the purchase!
We bought this stroller for an international flight, and it worked perfectly.  It rolls smoothly and effortlessly, is great for tall people (I'm 6'2\" and don't feel bent over pushing this stroller), closes with the kick of the foot (to pop up the locking mechanism), folds down tight like an umbrella stroller, and it's quite light.  The reviews on here are spot on... this thing is excellent, but it would be nice to be able to adjust the tilt on the awning... once it's open, it's fixed in position.  A minor complaint in comparison to how great everything else on it is.
Great stroller for the price. Hardly any room for storage underneath but if you're on a budget this is a good stroller.
My husband and I love this umbrella stroller because it is the perfect combination of lightweight vs sturdy. My husband is 6'4&#34; and has commented that it was well worth the additional money to have an umbrella stroller he doesn't feel like he has to completely hunch over to push. I found out the customer service was excellent, as about a month after buying this stroller I accidentally backed into it with my car and broke one of the wheels (don't worry, the toddler was in the car at the time, not the stroller). They sent me a new wheel assembly free of charge and I was ever so grateful.
We have a very nice and pricey jogging stroller but we learned that sometimes you need to get around without all the extra baggage. This stroller flies with us, goes to the store and never fails. It is big enough to hold our kidlet and extra things but fits in my hatch back car.
We have theBaby Jogger City Elite Single Stroller, Red Sportfor our at home/around the town stroller but it's a beast and I don't like it taking up my entire trunk. I wanted a smaller stroller for the mall, etc. This one does not disappoint.PROS:-Handles - I'm taller (5'7\") and I love the height of the handles on this thing. It is so great to be able to walk without stooping over (like I did with the snap n go) and without kicking the wheels (I test drove the Chicco Liteway and kicked the wheels instantly - and this is like half the price).-Price - super reasonable-Quality - the fabric, frame, etc feels like a WAY more expensive stroller. I am really impressed.-Comfort - my 7 month old seems happy in this stroller. Would be nice if it reclined more, but hey, it's an umbrella stroller-Parent organizer - great to have and lots of room in there - plenty of space for my phone, wallet, a snack and a cup holder for me.CONS:-Size/fold: This is super easy to fold, but I wish it folded a touch smaller...I have a 2011 Honda CRV and this fits in the front part of my trunk (I wish it tucked in the back part so I could shove it to the back and put groceries, etc in front), but I'll deal. I'm not deducting any stars for this because It is a reasonable size, it is really more that my trunk isn't as big as I wish it was!-Canopy - I wish the canopy was bigger or at least adjustable to better block out the sun. Also while all the other fabric, etc feels so high quality the canopy is a bit chintzy and I hate how when you fold it the wheels get the inside of it dirty. Deducting one star for this.-Recline - like I said above, wish it reclined a bit more (my kid barely naps if not in crib anyway, no way she will sleep in this while sitting up - the recline barely reclines). Not deducting for this b/c it's just an umbrella stroller-Basket - wish it was a bit larger and more accessible. But, it's to be expected from an umbrella stroller and the parent organizer makes up for it.Bottom line - I'd buy it again and I recommend it to everyone I know!
This stroller was great to run through the airport and throw in the back of the trunk.  It was easy to put together, awesome for the price, and can hold our heavy bags also when we were holding my son.  The only drawback is that it is very long and may be difficult to fit nicely in some trunks.  But, that is the tradeoff to have a stroller for a tall baby that will last until 50lbs.
I really like this stroller.  The handles are tall and comfortable, the wheels are smooth, and it has a very small turn radius.  I am not kicking the back of it when I'm walking.  The folding mechanism gets stuck and it isn't possible to do one handed, especially locking and unlocking the latch on the side, it's not an autolock to keep it folded.  The material is durable, it leans back a bit.  Agree with other reviews that the shade isn't robust enough or moveable.  My seven month old did fine it in, with the straps on the lowest setting and fully extended, and it saved me lugging her car seat and huge SUV like stroller through the airport.  I definitely recommend this stroller.
The perfect travel stroller. I knew my double stroller would weight too much for travel so glad I found this light stroller with a 5 point harness. The only issue is that this stroller does not recline as much as I would like.
wish the sun shade was movablewish the basked was easier to get toHowever, still way better than 90% of the umbrella strollers on the market.  I used this when my son was a little under 6 months.
We got this as a gift.  We already had a stroller that was part of a travel system, but I love this one so much more and so does our LO.  LO was still a wee bit (3 mo) when we received this but we put a Summer Infant Snuzzler in it so we could use it with her right away.  DH kept driving to work with the travel system stroller in his trunk and I would be left with no stroller.  Now we have a light, easily foldable stroller at home that I can use to take her on walks around the hood or to take her for a spin around the local shopping areas.Highlights:  Narrower profile than many strollers can fit down narrow aisles easier.  Maneuverability is great-- super turning radius and it just rolls nice.  I don't kick the back or step on the wheels.  Feels very stable, I even take her on a dirt path and a grassy area to get to the road and it handles it just fine, I don't even have to lock the front wheels.  Pretty easy to fold and unfold.  5 point harness keeps LO extremely secure and the harness is very simple to buckle and unbuckle.  Works GREAT with the Infant Snuzzler (I got the terry version since I live in a warmer clime).  LO gets to face forward which she seems to enjoy immensely more than laying in the car seat of the travel system.  We got Red Stripe, which I like.  The best part?  LO actually will sleep in this stroller.  She never, ever stays asleep in her travel system stroller, even when we are moving all the time!!Things that aren't the best:  The sunshade is pretty small, and I have to use a gauze blankie to shade her if it is a very sunny day.  The underseat storage basket is small and the access to it is tight (I don't use it that much because I prefer to travel light anyways, so this part isn't a biggie for me but I can see how it would be for some people).Overall, I totally LOVE this stroller for LO and I can see us using it for a long time.  One of the best baby gear we have, along with our Tiny Love Rocker Napper.
I was going to get this on Amazon, but a local store was selling it for about the same price. I love this thing. Really easy to just throw my 10m old in a go. I haven't had it too long but it seems sturdy enough. I bought the Red Strip, which isn't nearly as bright red in person as it is in the picture so keep that in mind.
I bought this stroller specifically for our trip to Disney world because I needed a lightweight stroller that could hold my 5 year old.  I didn't think he was quite up to the level of walking we would do there and wanted to have something to hang my bags and put snacks in, etc.  I was very happy with - it held my son very well and he was around 50 lbs at the time.  I had a hard time finding a stroller I felt could hold an older child, so I wanted to pass that along.Since my 5 year old is my youngest I have not used this stroller extensively with a younger child, so I can't speak to that quite as well or compare it to other current strollers on the market, but I have taken my 18 month old niece for walks in it and its was okay for that, I wished the shade was either bigger or could be tilted further forward.  Folds up easily.The basket below holds quite a bit but is hard to get things in and out of with the child in the seat - the opening between the seat and the basket wall is pretty small.
I'm not sure why the Minnie Mouse one is so much more expensive, so I went for a cheaper fabric, sadly. This is a great, quality, little umbrella stroller. I have no complaints!
I was looking for a light weight stroller that was good for traveling and running errands. After reading all the reviews, I chose the Ignite stroller. My son loves it. He just turned 2 in September and it will last a lot longer for him. We have another stroller that is bigger and is supposed to go to 50 pounds, but he is already too tall for it and his feet hang over the side.It was simple to put together-just snap the wheels in place. It doesn't have a lot of room for storage, but it holds his backpack without any problem. The drink holder is fabric so I wouldn't put anything hot in it, but it does the job well enough. On another note, we somehow managed to lose a wheel. I emailed First Years customer service and they are sending a replacement wheel at no cost to us. I was super impressed with the quick response and the fact that they are giving us a replacement. Overall, great stroller and the customer service just made me love it even more.
Wow, I'm impressed with this stroller so far.  We've been using it for one week while we're on vacation (so it's getting lots of use).  It's very sturdy and looks great too.  My husband is 6 feet tall and has no problems with the handle length or with kicking the wheels.  There is a cup holder near the handles and a handy zippered pouch.  The under stroller storage area doesn't look huge but our big diaper bag does fit.  I also like the 5-point harness because it helps our 6-month old remain upright.  He also had no problem napping in the stroller in the reclined position.  I love that it's sturdy but not huge.  I have no trouble navigating tight spaces or bumping into people with this stroller.
I wanted a second stroller to keep in the back of our SUV at all times, for trips to the mall or long walks. Our other stroller, a Graco, is too big when it folds up and we can't fit both the stroller and our 70 lb German Shepherd in the back when we go to the park. This stroller is great! It folds up very easily and also can be set up with one hand by just using one hand to let the stroller extend and then using your foot to push the metal bar down in the back to lock it in place.  It's light and I prefer using this stroller on long walks instead of our bigger stroller. The only downside is the sun shade is very small (we have a Protect-A-Bub, so that doesn't really matter to us) and there is no cup holder for baby.
Perhaps this was my fault, but I was looking for a light, easy to travel, stroller when I bought this one. It is a really nice stroller, but much heavier and more bulky than I want from an umbrella stroller. I returned this and bought a cheapy stroller from a consignment store. If you are looking for a sturdy umbrella stroller that will last through a couple kids and you don't mind that it weighs 17 lbs. this is a good one, but if you're looking for a light stroller for short trips, you should save your money.
I got this stroller after selling my giant Graco travel set stroller and carrier.  I love this stroller!  Its so easy to set up or fold down.  It fits perfectly in the trunk and doesn't take up a lot of room.  And it is easy to manuever.  My child also things it is great fun and comfortable.  It hasn't been sunny out enough for us to spend much time outside so I haven't really tried the canopy shade.  The underside basket is big enough for my purse and some essential baby supplies when out and about.  The organizer at the top is awesome!  I love having an easy place to put my keys and phone and I love that I can zip the pocket shut to they dont fall out on accident.  And the cup holder is very convenient too.
We bought this stroller last year before our trip to Disneyland and we use it quite a bit!  Very sturdy, good size wheels, nice small under stroller compartment and we really like the cup holder/zipper container at the top by the handles.  Holds good amount of things. Highly recommend this stroller!
I own a Baby Jogger City Select stroller and although that's a great stroller, I started realizing that it's just too difficult to take that everywhere.  Our need for a lightweight stroller began when we were going on a trip with our 1-year old and realized she most likely will need a stroller and there's no way the City Select would be the one to take.So I did my homework here on Amazon and read all the raves about this stroller.  Settled on it in the Khaki.When it arrived I loved that I could put it together in 5 minutes without needing hubby's help.  I also thought it actually looked very nice and stylish compared to some other lightweight strollers I've seen out there.  So now I was anxious to use it.  Days passed until finally one afternoon we wanted to go on a walk in a beach neighborhood known for small and crowded streets.  This was perfect!  I passed through people with ease.  Having had a very heavy stroller, I was at awe at how lightweight this felt.  Maneuverability was good as well although it couldn't complete with the monster wheels I have on the other stroller.I setup and cleanup to be a breeze.  Couldn't be easier.  My daughter - who's not the most easy going - didn't complain once.  She seemed comfy in it and enjoyed the ride.  The seat belt/straps were also impressively easy to adjust and put one which is very important for active and squirmy toddlers.  And the little storage area at the top was  welcoming change and has some in extremely handy.The only things I didn't like - which were minor and therefore altogether constituted taking one 1-star away:- The bottom compartment is fine for very small items but don't expect to fit your bag down there.  I had a very small bag that actually fit but I had to incline baby's seat and squeeze it in and out.  So now I don't bother.- The sun visor is inadequate and doesn't hold enough sun away.  I have to figure out what to do here and if there's an extension.  If the sun isn't behind you or directly overhead it's pretty much in your kid's eye even if it is pulled all the way.All-in-all ... Yes, I'm glad I did my homework and now conquer, this is THE lightweight stroller to own.
I bought this for my 9 month old daughter for a vacation and loved it so much that it has replaced my travel system. This is very well made. The red is very dark and rich. The wheels, build, handles, basket...all very well made. It folds up easily. It is taller than most strollers but in a good way. I would definitely recommend for an everyday stroller.
Love the lightweight feel of this stroller and it handles ok although the wheels don't always feel as sturdy as my bulkier stroller (Safety First brand). The latch that secures the stroller once it's broken down (for your trunk or storage space) is not the easiest to latch and the storage rack underneath is nearly impossible to access. The criss-crossing of the bars at the base of the stroller make it difficult for me to add or retrieve any items. It's pretty much as waste of space. For $50-60, this stroller is definitely easier to tote around and is more compact when we're in a public setting. Thankfully it has a nice cup holder and zippered pouch up top to hold keys, cell phones and food otherwise I would've returned it for another model.
I was so excited when I ordered this expecting a much lighter weight stroller for my 10 month old son. I do love it a lot, and my husband loves it even more. We bought the Black and Red Stripe one and it looks fantastic in person.Pros:-The assembly was very easy. I assembled it myself in less than 5 minutes.-Looks Great.-Swivel and Locking Front Wheels.-No hunching over (not even my tall husband)-Very easy to navigate.-Smoooth Ride (even on the sidewalks of Brooklyn)-5 point harnessCons:-Placing items in the basket is hard because of the X design on the back. And the basket is small. Not a huge issue for me but sometimes annoying.-No 3 point harness. Up until this point all the 5 point harness' I've had on various baby products have also allowed for a simple 3 point harness. Not this one though.-Sun Canopy is not as big as I'd like. But then again, nearly none of the strollers I've seen have adequate size sun canopies. I purchased a black canopy attachment on amazon, which allows it to stretch ALL the way down if necessary. Fantastic Product as well.-Weight. I was expecting something that is not too heavy so that I can carry my son and stroller downstairs at the same time. This is incredibly heavy considering I was expecting a lightweight stroller. I placed it side by side with my Peg Perego Aria stroller and guess what, it is actually HEAVER. My husband agrees.Overall, even considering the cons I've listed, I still really love the stroller. I would have purchased it on Amazon, since that is my go-to site for buying nearly everything, but found that the best deal for this particular color is on Diapers.com. They also delivered it next day with free shipping as Amazon does. Love it.
My husband who 64 loves how tall the stroller is! I love how easy it is to fold! And I love all the pockets! And I love that my nine month and my four-year-old can fit in it
I have been looking for a portable/ compact stroller for a few months now.  The inexpensive options were not for me- did not want to hunch over just to push the stroller or have something that reminded me of a toy stroller.  This stroller is just want I needed- easy to fold up, compact, weighs only 14 pounds, reasonable storage options and comfort for my son.  While my son is only 8 months old, we can use this until he is 50 pounds. The 5 point harness is simple to use.  The canopy is OK- not big enough to really offer much protection, but it will work.  Well worth the money!
I'm a grandma and wanted to get a stroller to keep at my house for when baby visits.  I didn't want to spend too much either, and while this wasn't the cheapest, it was a good compromise.  Like others, I love the higher handles and also the drink holder and zipper compartment.  The compartment underneath is great as well.  Brakes work fine, and the stroller moves smoothly enough.  Up and down steps and curbs very easily; it seems well balanced and stable.  Maybe that's because it has 8 wheels.  I take baby outside but also wheel him around the house in it to save my back.  It's a nice looking stroller.  I got one which has green & khaki dots, and it looks good.I am not good at assembling things and had a little trouble, but I would mark that up to my ineptness.  I put one of the wheels on wrong, and it was very hard to get off.  Another wheel was not fully attached, so the stroller only went on 3 points instead of all 4.  My husband fixed that.The seat doesn't seem real well padded, not too soft.  The backrest has two crossed metal bars behind it which baby might be able to feel, so I put my own blankies in to make the seat softer.  Also put a wash cloth in front of those crossed metal bars to cushion the back more. One thing I wish it had was a chest strap to hold the shoulder straps in place. They tend to fall down off little shoulders.  I would recommend this stroller; I like some features better than the other high-end stroller he has.
Great for small cars. Durable metal frame. Easy to use five point harness. Best of all, it is very easy to steer...even with one hand. We have had this stroller for about a year and its holding up good. We use the ignite instead of the our larger full-size stroller. Recline and storage could be better, but still acceptable. Hard to beat the value at this price point.
I should have bought this a year ago instead of wasting money on more expensive stroller brands that aren't as good as this one.  I have been through lots of strollers and I have to say that for the money, this one is winner.  I have a 2 year old and a 6 month old.  I bought this mainly for the 2 year old, but now that I have had chance to try it out I am going to purchase another one for the 6 month old and get rid of the big bulky heavy stroller.  We are planning a trip to Disney in October and I was going to struggle with the big double stroller.  However, after hours and hours of researching, most people recommend taking 2 umbrella type strollers and if needed linking them together with the lionheart stroller links.  Since there will be four adults going I don't think I'll be linking them up too much, but I can't wait to travel with this Ignite Stroller.  Also, it doesn't tip as easily as some of the more expensive umbrella strollers out there.  I have had my loaded diaper bag attached to the handles and had no problem.  Also the parent console is great.  The storage underneath is definitely ok for a few items and the stroller is lightweight and folds very easily.  Only thing I will  be buying to add on for our Disney trip will be a sunray shade and possible a snack/sippy cup holder that will fit onto the side.  Oh and the wheels are super chunky for an umbrella stroller.  So, all in all very impressed! I've had about 10 strollers over the years and this one could quite possible be one of my favorites!
I did a lot of research on umbrella strollers for my 8 month old daughter. I was/am looking for a lightweight option that's compact enough to not take up all my cargo space (I drive a Mazda CX-5), tall enough handles for my height (I'm 5'10\"), a usable storage basket, a cup holder, and good maneuverability. So I thought the Ignite would fit this bill because it boasts being light weight, has tall, albeit plastic, handles, a roomier basket than most, comes with a soft cup holder and pouch for keys/phone/wallet, and Consumer Reports rates the maneuverability as very good. The price is also pretty fantastic, right? I bought it and put it together. By the time I was almost done, I had already made up my mind. It maneuvers well enough, at least in my living room. I LOVE the soft parent console and wish i could buy that separately to put on a different stroller. It is tall, and fairly compact, but here comes the con list:*14lbs is not that light, a carrying strap would be useful.*The handles are seriously solid rigid plastic. I didn't realize how much i prefer a padded grip until i felt this handle.*The basket is inaccessible. The frame is built right in front of it. If i wanted to get my purse/diaper bag in there, there would be a struggle.*The canopy should be omitted completely. It really doesn't do anything unless you were to only use this stroller at high noon.I still gave this stroller 3 stars because it's decent for its price and class. But I'm returning mine.
We bought this stroller to replace our one step ahead stroller. This stroller is hands down better all around. We rarely (very rarely) kick the wheels. I am 5'6&#34; and my husband is 5'11&#34; and neither of us have problem with this stroller. The only downside is that the shade is fixed and does not move which does suck a bit. We like the recline option (we have yet to use it with our 2 1/2 year old), but like that it is there. The basket is small, but what do you expect. I think this stroller will last us at least through baby number 2, which is on the way!
This stroller is very durable and sturdy.  It is a really great color.  Even though this is more the size of a bigger stroller since it has the under storage it folds up very compactly hardly taking up any space.  Great stroller!
So, the stroller is nice. Super easy to open and set up while holding a little one on your hip. My daughter seems comfortable in it.Here are a few things I like a little less about it: there are no shocks or anything, so strolls over cement feel pretty bumpy. Sometimes one of the front wheels will spin all the way around, like it's not making great contact with the ground.As other people have mentioned, you can open and close the shade but you can't adjust its position, so it only protects against very specific sun angles. Not a huge deal if you have a hat on your kid anyway.I really like the parents' tray: good space for the few things I carry.My biggest complaint is that it's not all that easy to fold up while holding a baby. That is, when you release the latch and fold it down, it folds forward onto the ground, so you have to bend over to pick it up and latch it. It's compact when folded and not terribly heavy, but I think I'll like it a little more when I can just set my baby down and fold it more easily.Overall a great value!
The First Years Ignite Stroller is a perfect light weight TRAVEL stroller! We purchased this for our baby's first international trip, and have used it for every outing since then. The umbrella covers just enough of the sunrays and it's easy to maneuver. The cup holder and fanny pack are so convenient. I can store my car keys and wallet safely. The undercarriage is not big enough to hold a diaper bag, but it is convenient for quick trips. We usually store small items like, pampers, baby's essentials, an umbrella, etc. under there. I wouldn't recommend this stroller for rocky terrain (FYI). But, if you need a lightweight stroller with style and sleek lines, for travel and everyday maneuvering, this is it!
When I was ready to downsize to a more 'travel friendly' stroller for my toddler I just went with one of the $20 specials at the store.  It folded up easy, was lightweight and the cost couldn't be beat.  But now I know that I shouldn't have gone so cheap.  This stroller was only $50 and it is worlds better!  It still folds up very easy, takes up only a little more space in my trunk and not only is the seat more comfortable for my little one, but I actually have area to store things AND a cupholder for my coffee.  Lesson learned for sure.
We bought this stroller to use on a trip to Mexico.  We wanted something cheap that we didn't care if it got ruined.  However, it turns out we really like this stroller and have been using it pretty regularly since we got it.  There are some pros & consPROS+  Tall handles.  You don't kick the wheels when you walk or have to bend over to push the stroller.  I'm 5'7 and my husband is 6'2 and we can both push this very comfortably.+  Pushes really well.  I was surprised how well this stroller handles.  I think it pushes better than my baby jogger city mini - which was 5 times the price of this stroller!+  Son loves it.  He can sit up straight and see all around him, which he loves.+  Folds up really easily and has a locking mechanism that keeps the stroller folded.  This feature was great for in the airport.CONS-  If you have a tall kid, like I do, the 5 point harness is a joke.  My son is just over one and the shoulder straps are already unusable.  My son is tall for his age.  He's 34 inches and the shoulder straps are as long as they'll go and they don't go over his shoulders comfortably.  We don't use the shoulder straps at all.  Which is fine, but it defeats the selling point of a 5 point harness.-  When folded the wheels hit the canopy making the inside of the canopy really dirty.-  The canopy is worthless.  If the sun is directly above you the canopy will cover part of your kid's body, however if it's not high noon don't expect the canopy to shade your kid at all.Overall, despite the negatives, I do really like this stroller for it's ease of use, ease to push and compact size.  Plus my son likes it so that makes it a keeper.
We have a primary stroller, a Britax BeReady so this is now our 'umbrella' stroller that lives in my wife's car for easy handling. It's practical but not very comfortable for the baby. It would be impossible for the baby to nap in it so we use it only when baby is awake and plan our trips with it accordingly based on baby's schedule.
We have been using this stroller for about 4 months.  It has it's good points, cheap, small, rolls.  But I struggle with it. The clip to secure it together is SO hard to unclip, I have cut myself on the stroller so often I now do not use the latch and just put it in the trunk open.  The wheels were always getting the inside of the canopy filthy when fully closed, so leaving it open fixed that problem too.The canopy is useless, you must buy an extender if you plan to walk at any time other than noon.The tab to close the stroller at the bottom is pointy.  Most people will push with the top of their shoes, this is not possible if you have on flip flops, or like your shoes.  The tab has ruined my husbands shoes by scratching the leather.  Now he must bend down to push it by hand, enh.  IIt is cheap, and we get what we pay for.Positives:The 5 point harness is nice and easy to use.And the handles are a nice distance from the wheels if you are 5 foot 6, I never tap the wheels with my feet when walking.If someone steals it one day at the zoo in stroller parking, I don't care.I could have spent $800 on an UppaBaby, but really I don't think the negatives of this cheap product justify spending $750.00, plus tax here in Taxifornia, to remedy.I would buy it again.
This is an awesome stroller, by far the best baby item purchase I've made!  My 10-month-old boy has been called anywhere between \"healthy\" and \"hefty\" - we just call him chunk!  :  He's 28 lbs and was outgrowing many baby items quickly!  My old umbrella stroller was only rated to 23 lbs!!  When I found this one it looked nice, it was compact, and it's rated to 50 LBS!!!  Yay!  Plus, the price make it an even better deal!  I was sold.  We use this stroller daily - walking the older siblings to and from school.  It's been great.  I must admit, the basket storage is small and difficult to get to when the child is reclining.  It is a bit heavy, too, but not so much that I wouldn't buy it again in a heartbeat.  I love the little mom's hanging basket room enough for a drink, your wallet, keys and phone plus room for more.  We are planning on taking this stroller to Disney and think we will be happy we did!
I recently got this stroller for our vacation to Disney. I bought it here on Amazon and got it delivered directly to he hotel in Disney. It was a life saver! The stroller is big enough for a big toddler, my son is 3 but I saw families with the same exact stroller with a 7 or 8 year old kid siting on it. The maximum pros:-Comfortable for the kid-Reclines for comfy sleeping-Roomy/wide for big kids-Tall backrest-The backrest has support for the kid back-Easy to maneuver, and rolls on every surface-Requires minimal assembly (just pop in the wheels and the canopy)-Super easy to fold-Lightweight-Good basket underneath-The parent upper storage is a great plus! Roomy enough for keys, sunglasses, lipstick, compact powder, and some etcs.-Space for a water bottle/drink-Easy to open/close canopy, so the child can do it by himself (my son did that all the time)-The seat is at the right elevation, so your child can get on and off by himself, and the footrest is very good.-The handles are very tall, so you won't curve your back to push the stroller, and your feet won't hit the stroller or the wheels while walking.-You can hang a bag/diaper-bag on the handles and it won't make your stroller to fall back.Over all, I can honestly say that I love this stroller, it is perfect to take to amusement parks, and for shopping. It is pricey because it IS an Umbrella stroller, but is worth it. I wish I had known this stroller before when my son needed a stroller on a everyday basis.It is a very good buy, specially for vacations, airports, parks and long days of walks, when your kid can't keep with the adults all day long and need some rest, comfort and a place to nap.
We got this stroller first for a trip across country. It worked great, and was super easy to fold up and collapse. The thing I love the most about it is that it's great for taller people. I'm 5'8&#34;, and my husband is 6'1&#34;, and it's comfortable for both of us. With a lot of other umbrella type strollers, I found myself kicking the bottom/back of the stroller, and it was annoying. This one doesn't do that at all. Also comes with a nice cup holder and zipper pocket. I use this one probably more that I use the bigger stroller.
So i am 5'9 and my dear husband is 6'3... this light weight stroller is amazing... and the price is great too. The stroller is so easy for quick trips as well as toting along on an airplane for out of state trips.  I wish i would have found this before i purchased our other umbrella stroller(hello hunched over back pain) but non-the-less this A+ find is well worth the wait.  i would recommend this to all tall people!  The cupholder with zipper bag and the small compartment below are great as well,,, just enough room so you don't overload yourself
My Mom bought be this stroller and I was super excited. I wanted a stroller where when my son got older he could still face me while we took walks but when he wanted to see the world i could turn him around without an issue. Within the first maybe 2 weeks the rubber on the handle bars started coming off. Its completely gone now. 4 weeks ago the rubber to click the car seat in is completely breaking off. I have to carry WD-40 with me everywhere i go because the wheels are so stiff its not even funny. I have to grease the wheels all the time to get a smooth ride. And on top of that my son doesn't even fit in the seat because the shoulder straps are not positioned right and i can't re position them. i have to fold blankets and make a sort of booster seat for him to sit in the stroller. Wish i could return this 1. ugh my 1st bad review :(
I bought it despite all the bad reviews about the wheels squeaking and being sucky. Sucky is correct, sometimes the stroller will not move. It's so squeaky that people tell me it is loud! I wanted to love it bc of the features and I really can not afford a buggaboo. I had to settle for a city mini which does not have a parent facing seat... Me very sad
Squeaky wheel! And it's not just a little bit of a squeak, it's a loud screeching squeal of a squeak.  It's so loud, that my husband and I were so embarrassed about it we actually used cooking spray while in the grocery store to spray the wheel to keep it from squeaking so badly. That solved the problem right then, but it keeps coming back no matter what I do and I keep having to spray it.I like that its tall, and not too bulky. It's the happy medium between umbrella stroller and full size. A lot of people commented about it being too tall for a short person, but I think that's a matter of preference. I'm 4'11\" and I LOVE the height of it. I feel like I have to lean over with an umbrella stroller, which is why I hate them. I do also love the parent facing feature, it was a major factor in my purchase. I do hate that you can't really fold the stroller up with the seat attached. Definitely a pain in the butt when it's raining and you're trying to do it quickly. I do also like the adjustable seat position. I lay my son all the way back when he falls asleep and also can change his diaper there instead of having to worry about using a nasty public changing table.In total, I do love this stroller, for the price especially since similar ones are so mcuh more expensive. I would still buy this one all over again.
This is JUNK! Do not buy this stroller. They sent me a new frame and wheels and it's still junk. The wheels are squeaking and sticking once again and the material is ripping. It's made  terrible.
I was so excited about this stroller! It has the rear facing feature which was a MAJOR requirement in my new stroller purchase. Well that's about the only good thing about the stroller. Oh well the fact that it has a bassinet feature as its called was awesome! It laid 100% flat, that was great when my daughter fell asleep... But here's the stuff that made me return the stroller... The front wheels don't roll over anything other than a perfectly flat surface ie the slightest pebble made the stroller jerk. And they squeak REALLY loud! I pushed it through walmart for 10 minutes and it slowly but surely started squeaking... it started out quiet by by the time I finished my 30 minute shopping trip the wheels were so loud I was honestly embarrassed cuz I could here people making comments... after research i bought silicone spray and sprayed the wheel... worked like a charm! (of course that was another 4 dollars tho!) Anyway... The canopy is tiny! It didn't matter if my 1 year old was forward facing, rear facing, reclined, sitting up, etc... The sun hit her face directly! I took her to the fair and as I was walking the front wheel fell off! I had set up the stroller according to the directions but apparently there was a piece either missing that comes assembled on the front wheel (the clip that keeps the wheel on) or it came off (which if thats the case was WAY too easy to fall off), regardless I couldn't use the stroller from that point on because there was no way to keep the wheel on! It is a cute stroller but honestly even tho it is inexpensive it is not even worth that price!
The first week I had this stroller my husband and I loved it. I even recommended it to friends. After using the stroller for about two weeks of light use the wheels started squeaking. No big deal. You can WD40 them. But one day while my husband was folding the stroller we heard a loud crack. He was gently folding the stroller like normal. When we next used he stroller we noticed the seat was completely broken in half from the frame making the stroller unusable. It's a great design, but you get what you pay for.  Spend a few more dollars and get a stroller that will actually hold up.
This stroller is exactly what I was looking for. I loved that my newborn could ride in it and I could see her, or turn it around the other way. The print is super cute, too! Folding out and up is really easy. But after about 5 uses, the wheels in front were stubborn. They don't turn and get all jammed which makes the stroller very difficult to maneuver. Silicone spray didn't solve this problem.
We have this stroller as well as a Wisp Travel System (that includes a Via carseat). I love that our carseat snaps right onto this stroller as well as the travel system stroller (it comes with an adapter for some other carseats). The travel system stroller is actually more compact (for our particular system), but this stroller has a nicer \"ride.\" So I keep the travel system stroller in my car and this one in the house to use for our walks around the block. I'd also use this one if we were going to a theme park or something where we'd be using the stroller all day. I have only used it in bassinet mode and carseat snap-in mode so far, as our baby is only 7 weeks old.PROS:- Very nice ride - easy to maneuver and smooth for baby- roomy bassinet - nice to take a walk and allow baby to lay down instead of sitting- sunshade feels very sturdy (some feel like they'll break so easily!)- Nice fabric that will wipe off easily- bassinet snaps off easily and bottom portion folds up easily- 360 spins very easily (not so useful for bassinet mode, but good for sit up mode later when you may want baby to face you or outwards- handle gets nice and tall or very short - great for my tall hubby!- storage space underneath is useful and relatively easy to get to- one steering bar makes one-handed pushing easierCONS:- It's BIG. We have a small house, so this is kind of a pain in the butt to store in baby's closet.- Maybe I'm missing something, but there doesn't seem to be a way to lock it in the folded up position. This makes it harder to store, as it tends to want to roll out into the open position.- The bassinet does not fold up - another storing pain.- Bassinet cannot be used off of the stroller (the sides aren't rigid, so they collapse down). That would have been a nice feature.
I did hours of research on strollers... contemplating between the First Years Indigo and theBumbleride Flyer Reversible Handle Stroller with 7\" Wheels, Seagrass. I finally settled on the Indigo stroller because the price was right and the features I wanted were all there. I purchased the stroller and matchingThe First Years Via Infant Car Seat, Abstract O'scar seat. My son was born in the winter and I didn't use the Indigo stroller regularly until about two months ago. For the first week, the stroller was wonderful. What I had initially liked most about the stroller was that I could easily attach the matching First Years Via car seat. In addition, the ride was smooth, quiet, and comfy. The stroller was a breeze to fold. Then, about two weeks into regular use, I started to notice the quality of the stroller diminish quickly. Here is what started to happen:(1) SQUEAKY WHEELS. The wheels started squeaking terribly. I'd oil them and within a few days the stroller was squeaking again! I'd be in a store and people would turn there heads to see who had the annoyingly loud stroller.(2) VIA CAR SEAT WOULD GET CAUGHT. This is what really bothered me. I could live with the squeaking, but this I could not. My son is 6 months old and we still use the infant car seat regularly. One day the car seat began to get stuck inside the left car seat stroller locking mechanism. We thought maybe it was our son's weight causing the problem, so we took him out of the car seat and tried again. No luck! We still couldn't get the car seat out. After fidgeting with the stroller and car seat for nearly 30minutes, we finally got the car seat unstuck! To test things out to see whether or not it was the stroller or car seat causing the problem, we decided to attached seat that came with the stroller. That too would get stuck and we wrestled around with it until it miraculously came unstuck.Unfortunately, this stroller just had to be returned (thank goodness for Amazon's 365 day return policy on baby items). As much as I liked its other features, I couldn't put up with its defective qualities. Perhaps I received a defective stroller AND car seat but I find that really hard to believe.In addition to it being defective, here is what else I didn't like about the stroller.(1) BULKY. I knew when I purchased this stroller that it would be a standard size stroller but I still feel it was unnecessarily bulky. In order to fold it up, you have to remove the seat and then fold up the frame. Before I had my son I didn't think this was a big deal. Now I know better. I'd recommend you find a one piece fold-up stroller like the Bumbleride Flyer.(2) NO CUPHOLDERS. There are no cup holders for the child or adult using the stroller. At the time I purchased the stroller, there were also no accessories available that could attach to the stroller. I think this is the huge oversight.(3) SEAT HAD TO BE REMOVED. I really found it annoying that I had to remove the seat in order to collapse the stroller or switch the stroller from back to forward facing. As I said earlier, I initially thought this was a frivolous disadvantage but I now think otherwise. Other strollers that have the same back to forward facing option allow you to simply switch the direction of the handles without having to remove the seat. If First Years ever redesigns this stroller, they should include that option in their redesign.Even though I decided to return the stroller, there are still some qualities that I liked about this stroller. Here is what I liked:(1) BACK AND FORWARD FACING. I loved that I could face my son towards me when he was an infant and away from me when he gets old enough that he wanted to explore.(2) EASY TO COLLAPSE. Although the stroller was bulky, the stroller was still a breeze to collapse.(3) EUROPEAN STYLING. In addition the practicality, I was looking for a European styled stroller. This is the most affordable stroller that is also stylish.After I returned the First Years Indigo Stroller, I went ahead and purchased theBumbleride Flyer Reversible Handle Stroller with 7\" Wheels, Seagrass. I will update this review in the near future with a comparison of the two after I get more use of theBumbleride Flyer Reversible Handle Stroller with 7\" Wheels, Seagrass. If you can afford to splurge on the Bumbleride Flyer, I would highly recommend it.
This stroller is really very nice.  It rides smoothly and folds easily.  The only issue I have with it is the fact that you Cannot fold the stroller when the seat is facing the parent.  You have to remove your child and turn the seat to face away from you before you can fold the stroller down.  Otherwise this is a really great stroller.  I'm 5'8\" tall and it's perfect for my walking stride, no kicking the stroller at all and the basket below the seat has plenty of space.  The strollers 5 point harness is easy to operate and it's a very comfy ride for your child all in all.  If you could fold the stroller with the seat facing the parent without having to turn it facing away from the parent I would have given it the full 5 stars.  It's a GREAT stroller for those of us who can't afford to spend the extra hundreds for a Bugaboo, etc.
I've only had this stroller for a couple of days, but I love it so far. A reversible stroller, that can also be used as a snap-n-go for a car seat-- for this price, you can't beat it!Pros:The assembly was super easy.Includes parent console/cupholder and belly bumper bar.Seat sits very upright, which my 10 month old likes a lot.Pushes and handles really well, inside and outdoors.Fabric seems waterproof and very durable (kind of nylon-ish)Of course, the versatility of the seat positions-- front facing, rear facing, and fully reclined, it becomes more like a bassinet.Has leg extender so child's legs don't dangle in the air, more comfortable.Huge basket.Easy to recline, move seat, and fold.Cons:Only comes in gray or red (so far anyway)Handlebar may be a little high for short people. (I'm 5'3\" and its manageable). I wish the handlebar was adjustable.You have to take the seat off to get a good fold. With the seat on, its bulky.Doesn't have a very tall seatback, wouldn't be good for older, tall kids. I'd say its a good stroller from birth to 2 yrs, maybe 3 yrs, depending on height.Overall, this is a great stroller. You are getting a lot for your money, and its great for young babies. I wish it had come out a year ago!
This is a very good stroller.. especially for the price.We live in NYC so we have to walk everywhere. This stroller is performing great on the uneven and cracked/snow-piled sidewalks and streets. The wheels seem to be very good and the swivel option is very convenient. I also love loove the way it looks as well:). I love the little pouch and pockets, great for stuff like burp cloths, bottles or the parent's drink, etc. One of the best things about this stroller is that it is reversible so the baby can face you or the street in front. Another thing is that it works for infants(we used it when my daughter was 3 days old) and kids up to 50lbs so technically, this should be the only stroller you need for your baby. The stroller itself is not too heavy(and I am not good at lifting things..)Now, for the negatives..I feel like the shade could have been just a little bigger, I feel like we will need to buy an extender for the Summer because the existing shade will not cover the baby at all. Another thing.. I feel like the seat could have been just a little bit wider for when the baby is sitting up. The basket underneath is not as good as it could have been, it says you should not place more than 5 lbs in it. And last but not least.. a big negative for me is the fact that you need to detact the seat before you can collapse the stroller. If you have a car that shouldn't be a big deal but it is really inconvenient if you have to lug the stroller on the subway or you live in a walkup.
Pros: It collapses easily buy pushing in the buttons and twisting the bar simultaneously. And YES it does collapse with the seat facing forward, fully upright or the seat facing you fully inclined. It does stick out, unlike most umbrella strollers but I like how sturdy the seat is so I wouldn't change that about this stroller.It's not the lightest of strollers, but no so heavy that my 5'2\" self can't handle itThe Indigo is great. I like gray and although it might show dirt more than others, it looks really nice.The bag underneath my stroller stores a backpack style diaper bag I purchased. It appears small, but holds quite a bit.I love that I can use the carseat with it or the seat it comes with. I love that baby can face me or away. So versatile!I purchased a snack holder to install on the side of the stroller since this doesn't come with one.I get a lot of compliments on the convenience of it. I don't have multiple strollers lying around.Cons:The storage bag for cell phones, keys, etc. is rather convenient but made out of cloth. It would be nice to have cup holder and plastic storage instead of cloth. I always like having drinks with me. They could make a cup holder with the cloth material- which would be better.It doesn't have a kid tray for snacks or cup holder.The back wheels definitely squeak! As other reviewers said, I sprayed some silicone spray and it solves that problem. I spray some on when the squeaks come back.
I tried this stroller in the store and loved everything about it - the size of the seat (could have been a little deeper but it was nice and tall), the size of the basket, the parent console, the way the harness worked.  A little sticky to get the seat to turn around but for the price not a problem.  But there was something about the front wheels.  Pushing straight was OK but turning and steering it felt like pushing a box through sand.  Took my chances and bought one anyway hoping just the display was not up to snuff but nope, same problem.  Took it back.  I have an 8 year old Graco that pushes just fine so it's not like you have to buy high-end to not struggle to steer.  It's a shame about the push because otherwise this stroller is great, but what good is a stroller that's miserable to push?  After returning mine, I tried the same stroller at another store - empty and with my almost 4 year old girls in it - since it says rated to 50 pounds - it is seriously like pushing a box through sand.  If the floor model won't hold up to abuse, YOUR model won't hold up to abuse, either.  I wish this was an awesome stroller - for the price it seems amazing - but it is simply too good to be true.
I bought this hoping I wouldn't get a lemon with squeaky wheels.  I wanted teh bassinet and forward facing options so much i risked it.  The strolller is absolutely awful just awful.  Others said it has easy maneuvering?  easy what?!!  This stroller is constantly being run into walls it's sooo difficult to maneuver.  My friends who have pushed my stroller confirmed that it is exceptionally hard to use.  When i called customer service for 1st years they said all they could do is replace the wheels!!!  What? replace the wheels that already don't work?  We routinely oil the wheels and have also bought graphite powder which the customer service agents recommended.please don't buy this stroller.  Don't waste the money and just buy a nicer stroller.  We bought this from Target because we recieved so many gift cerficiates.  Too bad we didn't use amazon their 1 year baby warranty is excellent.This looks white online but it's actually grey.  it has awful maneuverabilty.  Just buy a snap and go while your baby's 4months and younger and you're using a car seat all the time.  Then once you figure out your stroller needs (since you really don't know how you'll use a stroller until you have a baby) buy the stroller that fits your lifestyle.  We ended up buying a nice jogging stroller with an infant car seat adapter.  I thought that it would be better going for the 1st years since it seemed less bulky.  Not true.I'd give this 1 star but it is useful as an over priced snap'n go.1. this stroller shade is USELESS.2. The color is grey not white as it is n the photo.3. the wheels are so squeaky (within 3 weeks of use)4. The stroller constantly runs into walls.  it's very hard to push.
We wanted to get a smaller stroller than our jogging stroller 
I want to give this 5 stars because there are so many things I love (the front/rear-facing seat, the big storage basket, the parent cargo bag) but it steers so terribly that I find myself angry every time I use it. In addition, this thing takes up a lot of trunk space. The seat does not collapse so you have the frame and the seat to try to stow. That plus a diaper bag only leaves me room for about 4 grocery bags in my generously sized Volvo trunk.
My dad bought me this stroller because the one we originally got is a beast - the Jeep Liberty All-Terrain one (it will be great when our son is older - but right now it's just huge for him!) and he wanted to take him out for walks when he was watching him without having to use such a massive stroller.  So he bought this & then let me take it home to use as well - and I love it.The Pros:-Seat is completely adjustable: faces forward or backwards - multiple reclining options depending on how old your child is (or if he/she is napping) - and even the little foot rest is adjustable.-It also comes with a kit to use the stroller with your infant car seat - so you can take just the stroller frame & click your infant car seat in - I have no idea how well that works as I have never used it, but I imagine there are those who would.-Really easy to fold down - just remove the seat by pushing a button then twist the handle & it folds down nicely.-The handle (which is of course easily removable) is perfect for attaching toys to - I always have a rattle attached to the handle for him to fidget with when he gets distracted.-Lots of storage on the handle bar (which is removable) and below the seat.-Much lighter than the Jeep stroller we have - MUCH lighter!The cons:-Not nearly as maneuverable as a 3-wheel stroller.-It's not super compact - since the seat doesn't fold down with the stroller, it doesn't end up being as compact when folded as the massive Jeep Liberty stroller we have.I'm not using this for big long walks daily - I take a 20 minute walk every other day with him on paved roads (not very well paved - but paved none-the-less).  We live at the beach and I can tell this stroller would never make it on the sand - but that's why we have the all-terrain one.  I doubt it would stand up too well to rugged use.Had I understood what was needed with an infant when I first bought everything I would've bought this stroller instead of a stroller more suitable for an older child - but I'm so glad my dad decided to get it b/c I know I wouldn't be nearly as inclined to take the walks I do without it.
I bought this stroller because my 4-month old hates his car seat and hates strollers where he faces away from me.The stroller interior is a dark grey and the hood interior is turquoise. It was very easy to put together- took me under 5 minutes. It only fits Graco car seats- fyi.Cons:-The wheels are fingernails on a chalkboard squeaky and that started about 2 days after receiving the stroller. WD-40 will fix it-but you'll need to apply it weekly. I didn't think the squeak would bother me (after reading other reviews mentioning it) but I mean they have this loud squeak that would wake the neighbors type thing.-The wheels are also very cheap and look very worn after about 5 walks (walks just down the street and back).- The handle bar is too flimsy to hold a diaper bag- but the diaper bag can fit below.-Stinks when it comes out of the box- we had to let it air out for 2 days before use.-Stroller shade is UNBELIEVABLY small/short. I mean it barely covers anything- so if you're out alot during the day you'll need a shade extender or something.Pros:-Stroller looks more expensive then it is.-You can flip the seat to face you (the only way my son will use it) or to face out.-The seat has 3 angles- straight up, kinds reclined, and all the way down. My son loves it to be all the way down. Perfect for newborns!-It comes with like a fanny pack on the handle bars- I love it!!! It has tons of compartments. When going to the mall i can fit my wallet, keys, cell phone, lip gloss, tissues, baby wipes, pacifier, and water bottle in the compartments!!!-Bottom storage is large- but since you can't fit your diaper bag on handles you have to use that space below. I find I can fit my diaper bags and 2 small-medium shopping bags. My diaper bags also have stroller clips- so I clip it to the sides of the stroller below for extra security.-Stroller colors are great and perfect for a boy. Sorry girls.-Easy to take apart and fold up. It does require that you remove the seat and then fold stroller- so you have two pieces.For the price- you can't go wrong! Just grab some WD-40 and your set. I would recommend this to any mom- especially moms who have fussy car seat babies.Also my son is 4-months, 16 pounds, and 26 inches long- he fits fine. He can probably fit comfortably up to 20 pounds.
I've had this stroller for about 5 months now, and I've used it with both infant carrier seat and stroller seat. After reading many reviews, I was prepared for the wheels to start squealing soon, which they did. One reviewer said silicone lubricant worked wonders on theirs, and I intend to try that but haven't yet. I'd expected white cloth on the stroller, but it's actually ash-grey; maybe a matter of my monitor, or maybe the product photo. Oddly, the lining of the black sun canopy is metallic aqua, which is nice for me but may not fit the &#34;Urban Life&#34; look for some people.+ works with infant carrier car seat (adapter included) or you can use the stroller seat (5-point harness!)+ face baby forward or backward with either seat+ switching between seats and between front/rear-facing is very quick and easy+ easy open/close (good idea to lock the rear wheels before closing, it helps keep the joints from slamming into the pavement as it collapses)+ lightweight, fits easily into a Camry trunk along with groceries and winter emergency coats for a two-plus-baby household+ easy one-handed steering+ storage underneath is quite roomy, holding diaper bag, purse (mine is fairly small), light jacket, and a small bag of minor items from a store- ends of rear axle just snap into wheels, no bearings or anything to help with rotation, and the socket on the wheel is plastic; I'm sure any sand that gets in there will grind and wear down the sockets, as will the metal axle ends- horizontal handlebar gets uncomfortable after a little while- tires are hollow plastic
Edit to clarify: You do NOT need to remove the seat to fold this stroller, like some reviewers said...what you DO need to do is just put the seat into the full recline position FIRST to make it easy to fold (I have folded it in the half-recline position too with the only problem being that it catches on the parent console).~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Original Review:I bought this stroller in Sept 2010 shortly after my preemie was born (he didn't come home until Jan). I love love love(d) it and am looking to buy another after,erm, the husband managed to break it (it was not the poor stroller's fault - after grocery shopping and a day at the mall, hubby shoved it and the groceries in the trunk and pushed, pushed, pushed on the trunk lid until it closed...the next day, we found the seat part of the stroller broke right in half...doh!).I used it first with my preemie right in our home - it was literally his bed for about 2 weeks, as he could sleep inside when it was laid flat (he didn't need the leg/footrest!). Then we kept it in the apartment for a while (baby was medically housebound) as an easy way for me to cook, shower, do laundry - all while having the baby with me, just roll him along in the stroller! I kept his current bottle and a bottle of baby powder in the canvas console, wipes and diaper came along in the storage compartment below! I also kept an extra blanket and change of baby clothes in the compartment, just to be handy!Fast forward to outings - the first outings, I used it only in the full-recline position and facing me (and managed many a public diaper changes right in it!) and loved that the canvas console had the zipper to put my phone, keys and wallet in for safe keeping. In the 4 console pockets, I usually had a bottle of water, my camera, baby bottle, and tissues. Diaper bag was full and in the storage compartment below (the product says like 5 lb or so limit, but I know my bag is more than that, plus I always show some shopping down there - never ripped nor dragged on the ground). Got lots of compliments on the stroller, especially that the switching from parent to front facing, it wasn't flipping the stroller (thereby needing to adjust the console or cup holders).I love that there were a variety of adjustments and options. I never sat my baby up beyond the full recline for until Feb because he was so small, the straps were too big. Once he had a bit of head control and was a little taller, I put him with the mid-point recline (still facing me) and he was fine.  It was only in March that i used the car-seat adapter, and I know I will get some flame for this, but I didn't use an \"approved\" infant seat, but a Britax Asis that we had received as a gift. It has little notches on the bottom which we lined up on the frame, and it has a strap to securely lash the car seat on - before putting the baby in it, I put the seat on, strapped it on, and literally shook and jiggled the stroller like crazy - the seat didn't move (and hasn't since using with baby). I usually prefer for longer stroller trips to use the regular seat, as baby is sitting in the car seat during the ride to the location and will be on the way back, so I like him to be more comfortable by changing seats/positions.We finally started facing baby forward (in both the infant seat mode, and regular seat) and he is loving it! We have had no problems with the stroller ourselves, but will say, we are city dwellers and I can see that the plastic wheels would not be too great for all-terrain travel.As for the folding/storage, some people mentioned having to remove the seat to fold it - You don't have to, you just need the seat to be in the full-recline position (or at least, that makes it easy as can be!). I never removed the seat until we started switching between it and the car seat frame.And, now that the regular seat is broken in half, I am glad that we can still use the car-seat mode while I looked around at strollers, and see that what I really want is the same one again.Oh, and yes, my wheels started squeaking a bit about a month ago, but it was never that big of a deal for me. I was planning on having the hubby grease the wheels, but maybe he just wanted a new stroller! LOL!
I've had this stroller for about 3 months now and love it. So far I've used it without the seat and have inserted my Chico car seat instead. Fast and easy to use. Is really high up compared with my travel system, so this is the stroller I keep in my car.I plan on using the reverse seat tomorrow for the first time. Looking forward to having my six month old facing me, but not in her car seat. Should be a good ride. She's a heavy girl at almost 20lbs and getting her and the car seat in and out of the car is getting annoying. I know she'd prefer to be sitting up.My only complaints so far is that I wish is would stand up when folded. Having to lie it down on the ground is kind of gross.Second, while it's true the wheels squeak, I used silicone spray (easily found at Home Depot) and they are silent. WD40 didn't do the job.Highly recommend buying the Indigo. I tell everyone about it.
I am admittedly a strollers obsessed person. I am on my fourth baby now and have purchased over 7 strollers over the past 8 years.Update: 2011I used this stroller for about 8 months when the foam on the handle bar ripped (not even sure how). I contacted the company and they had me ship them 2 of the wheels and then they shipped me - for free- a whole new stroller. I was really impressed with this level of customer service. I did decide to sell it at this point and get a single BOB stroller as it fit my needs better at that stage in the game.Pros: The stroller was absolutely great to push the whole 8 months I was using it.The fabric really held up well.I am not due any day with my 4th baby and really miss this stroller :) I just can't justify having it AND my BOB double stroller (which rocks!)The sun hood was a dream to operate.The ability to switch from back to front and back again was incredible!!!! I LOOOOVED it so much and used it all the time with ease.Cons: The seat was a bit too reclined in my opinion even in the most upright setting. My son seemed to pull himself into a more upright position.Undoing the seat from the frame (chassis) every time I folded it into the car was a annoying. But it was worth it for those first 5 months when he really needed that flat area to sleep.It is quite bulky even when folded. But then again I had seen some slick pictures online of people who figured out more streamlined ways to fold it. I never invested the time to really figure that out.The storage basket is a bit of a joke.....thank goodness for my skip hop diaper bag. That did work out perfectly.Overall - I would buy this stroller again in a heartbeat. It was great!! I am glad I was able to sell it when I did - as I love my BOB revolution for an older child (1 year and up) but it would have been nice to keep this one too :)_________I started researching strollers this time around because I wanted one that had the newborn bassinet feature but couldn't bring myself to pay the $800 for the Uppa Baby (which looks beautiful but my husband gave me the evil eye when I told him the price :). I was SO HAPPY when I found this stroller for 1/4 the price! I plan to return to my part time work with my baby and so wanted a comfortable, compact place for him to sleep completely flat. This stroller fits my goal exactly.The first thing out of hubby's mouth (and mine) when we opened the box was \"WOW, that looks exactly like that $800 Uppa Baby stroller you wanted!\" and it does. We bought the black one and the fabric looks great.It was very easy to put together and the turning function is incredibly smooth and easy to do (from forward facing to parent facing). I also love that you can have it sideways too, great for at a restaurant. Even my 7 year old could do it and found it fantastic.The biggest deal for me in any stroller are the hood size and the turning. The hood is a very good size and offers more than 2/3 coverage. I always wish that any stroller will be as good as a BOB stroller's hood size, but we can't have everything :) (LOVE BOB strollers by the way)So for my turning test (because I am still pregnant) I put my 43 lb. 5 year old in the stroller and pushed her all around the house, in circles, etc. This stroller was still VERY, VERY easy to push. I was actually shocked. it did not lean to one side or favor the front or back and it didn't have tough points while turning. Everything was smooth.So for fun I put my 56 lb. 7 year old in it as well (I know this is above the recommended weight :) and it was still easy to push!!!!The storage basket is on the small side (and I have owned 7 strollers). I can see putting a small diaper bag in there OR a purse and some loose diapers and a few other small things. For me this is not a huge deal as I have the Skip Hop Duo Deluxe diaper bag and it clips on to the handle bar very sleekly and offers me all the storage (I hope) I need plus I can put my water bottle, keys, etc. in one of the parent pockets in my diaper bag. I love that bag!!! I bought the \"Childress Bottles and Bags stroller organizer with shopping bag hooks\" thinking this would be the perfect compliment to this stroller and I don't like it one bit. The \"water bottle holders\" are a joke unless you drink from a kid sized water bottle and the other pockets I found awkward. Anyway, I am returning it and just plan to use the diaper bag as my \"parent organizer.\"I do consider it a downside that you have to remove the seat in order to fold it into your car. But I also have never seen a stroller that was a bassinet and a toddler seat in one. I give them that. They also had the grace to include the adapter for a carseat so that your infant carseat will fit right into the metal frame when the seat is removed. Almost every other company that sells high-end strollers makes you purchase that separately. My hats off to them for this. Speaking of that feature it is GREAT that this metal frame can be used with our Graco Snugride carseat! As a mother of almost 3, I know the importance of being able to do this with your stroller so you are not waking your sleeping baby. Again, I wish you were able to attach your carseat into this stroller without having to remove the seat and install the carseat adapter but it seems this is the trade off for that bassinet feature I wanted so much.I believe I will be really, really happy with this stroller and will update when baby comes and I have had a chance to use it more. I only gave it four stars because to me, the 5th star should be reserved for products that you wouldn't want to change or improve.As a last note my other favorite strollers are the Peg Perego Pilko P3 or a BOB for singles, and HANDS DOWN the BOB Dualle for a double.
Been using it for 5 months now. Things I like:1. 360 degree rotation - awesome! Use it all the time. Sun shining one way, no problem - rotate, done deal. At restaurants, position this thing however you want, voila.2. Bassinet. A really good feature to have, until 5 months. Infants can't sit, really so it's great having my baby lie down flat. Converts to a regular, sit down stroller in 10 seconds.Things I don't like:1. Not that easy to collapse it. Really do need two hands.2. Not that easy to detach a car seat from the frame. Takes a few tugs and twists, which is suboptimal when you have a baby sleeping in it!Still, these two things are minor enough for me to keep all 5 stars. If I could, I would give it 4.5.UPDATE: After a few months, a front wheel became a bit wobbly. Called customer service, had a new wheel delivered, free of charge in 4 days. FANTASTIC customer service!
I LOVE this stroller! I like the twisting feature because when my daughter gets sleepy, we twist he handle up and move the stroller side to side. It helps her go to sleep in any loud place we have been in. Every feature is great! I just went to the First Years website to see if they have double strollers like this and am so upset they don't! I will just have to have two strollers for my kids because I refuse to settle for anything else!!
***UPDATE*** My son and I took this on a a test drive today and it's AMAZING. Smooth ride, cozy bed area for the baby, perfect sized canopy, great adjustable handle, and so easy to handle it's ridiculous! Can't wait to do more strollin'!Granted, I just got this stroller today but I already LOVE it! It was extremely simple to put together with very easy instructions to follow. It looks GREAT upon completion and super easy to change it for all the different features. The canopy is HUGE and will easily cover baby from all angles of sun. The swivel feature to change the seat from forward to rear facing is super, super simple and fun! The stroller is a bit wide but we will mostly be using it for walks outside so I don't really care how wide it is - people can get out of our way!The red/black combo looks awesome and I'm sure we will get a lot of \"where did you get that stroller?!\" because it looks so cool and unique.I bought a hanging basket drink/holder thing and it doesn't work super well but I fiddled around with it and it works good enough for me. I also don't care that the basket underneath isn't huge because I hang my diaper bag from the handlebar and it will still fit in the basket anyway if I wanted to put it there.Also easy to fold up and fits our car seat with the adapter. Love it!
I've used this for 3 months now.  I like the stroller a lot; it's attractive, it's easy to put together (and I'm awful with figuring these type of things out), and my baby is comfortable in it.  I can imagine getting several years of use out of it which is one of the reasons I wanted it.  It doesn't do well on rocky areas, but that's not what its made to do so I can't take away points for that.  The basket below it really is small and not the easiest to get things in and out of.  That is the downside for me: I can't put my diaper bag in it.  Otherwise, it's a nice stroller...similar feel to a bugaboo (although the materials aren't as nice) without the bugaboo price.
This stroller is amazing.  I also purchased the matching Via car seat with this.  Yes it's missing a few things but all other features make up for it. I love showing off the spinning feature. People go crazy over it. Lol.  Plus it is very helpful to be able to have the handle bar out of the baby when taking baby in and out of the car seat and when I take it to restaurants so I can have easier access to baby. A little heavy, but still super easy to fold.  Great value because it comes with the bassinet that doubles as a toddler seat. I mainly use it with the car seat now because my baby is still only 4 months old and it's so much easier to just pop the car seat on and off for quick trips. When going for longer walks I use the bassinet so baby is more comfortable and makes my life easier because I can do diaper changes right in it and don't need to search for a bathroom with a changing table. I put her in it using the toddler seat mode and she loved it. She does very well in it and has a better view of the world and if she falls asleep I just put it back on bassinet mode. I recently ordered a universal parent stroller organizer caddy and a snack tray caddy for the stroller and will post reviews once they arrive. This stroller was the best purchase I've made for my baby so far.
***EDIT 8/22/11***After about six months of use I ended up selling this stroller. Here's why:1)It does not sit at a full upright \"0\" degree angle (90*). As my son aged, he hated being somewhat reclined. This was a major factor in my decision.2) Basket. Basket basket. The lack of storage was really annoying and got worse as it went on.3) The footrest is not adjustable. This is sort of a pro/con based on the fact the seat turns into a bassinet, but his little legs stuck straight out when seated and hung over, he was uncomfortable.4) The two part fold. This really didn't bother me that much, but I greatly prefer being able to fold the entire thing together if necessary.5) Fabric. In Urban, the black fabric really wasn't as nice as I would have liked. It did repel stains but I wanted something that looked nicer.All in all, I did enjoy the stroller and was quite sad to give up the spin feature. However, now that my son mostly wants to face outward at the world (1 year), it doesn't matter. I ended up choosing the Uppababy VistaUPPAbaby Vista Stroller, Cole/Slatewhich really has been a dream come true. It has every feature I could ever want, along with the price tag. If you're looking to save money, the Wave might be for you. But ultimately, there were some things I still really wanted out of a stroller that the Wave just didn't provide. Maybe in future models. It is still a great buy depending on what you're looking for.***EDIT 1/11/11***I've been using this stroller for a few months now. I still really enjoy it. The packing/unpacking of the stroller is quite a breeze now. As another reviewer stated, we've had a little bit of trouble feeling like the right side of the handlebar is just maybe half an inch or so lower than the left. Apparently there is an easy fix so I look forward to that. The stroller has held up well with almost daily use. It is easy to clean, and my six month old likes to sit in it upright as well as sleep in it bassinet mode. I still largely hate the basket. I use it to stash a water bottle and a blanket, and maybe my jacket. That's about it. I use stroller cruise hooks to attach my diaper bag. I still think this stroller was a GREAT purchase for the price. If you're debating I'd still recommend you get it. I have been so pleased with all the features I purchased it for (reversible, bassinet to toddler, etc.) and it has not disappointed. Also, I get a lot of comments of 'that is the coolest stroller I have ever seen' and people asking me where to get it. I spent time in Miami where EVERYONE and their dog has a Bugaboo. There were at least 6 Bugaboos out by the Ritz Carlton pool there, along with my stroller, and even the Bugaboo owners took note! Not that it is important, but just to give you an idea, it looks like a more expensive and unique stroller. Happy shopping!*If you are looking for a footmuff, go for the JJ Cole bundle me in TODDLER. PERFECT fit! I also went with the Cruise Hooks to attach on the handle. Those are the two accessories I'd say are a definite must-buy. I'm going to purchase a Meeno babies stroller liner for summer, as well, but can't comment on its fit yet. I'll update later._____________________________________________ORIGINAL REVIEW:I just got this stroller today after lots of research on reversible-seat strollers. My initial impression is very good! Here is a breakdown of what I like and don't like:Like:1) Obviously the stroller looks very nice.2) The spin handle! It is very easy and fun to do also! This is the reason I chose the stroller.3) It was very easy to assemble. Pop on the wheels, the canopy, and the seat. It took less than five minutes.4) It handles well due to the large rear tires that always stay in the rear.5) For those that want, it already comes with a car seat adaptor which is nice. My baby hates his car seat, which is the reason I wanted a parent-facing stroller, thus I don't need this part.6) You CAN adjust from bassinet mode to toddler mode and vice versa while the child is in the seat (also not recommended though). Going from bassinet to toddler is easier though, because I wanted to be able to quietly lie the baby down when he fell asleep upright. This is more difficult to do because the seat part drops quickly if you don't support it when you release the buckle.7) Large canopy with peek a boo window (vinyl). This combined with the ability to flip the seat means baby never has to have the sun in his eyes!8) Easy operation: Easy to undo belly bar, easy to undo/place seat, easy to flip, easy to fold.Dislike:1) The stroller fabric isn't quite as nice as I would hope, but I am getting a Meeno liner. For the price of the stroller though, this is minor. I was worried about the straps and the fabric looking too windbreaker-like, but it is more like a woven nylon, and softer than I expected.2) The basket is the reason I rated this stroller only 4/5. It is difficult to tell from the pictures, but there is a hardware part of the stroller than extends directly down from the frame and into the basket a couple of inches. This makes getting anything larger than a small purse or a blanket very difficult to get in OR out. Storage is a BIG deal for parents so this is disappointing. I DID manage to hook my large Burberry diaper bag onto the handlebars (I know, it says not to). However, when it is in bassinet mode, it is awkward and the driver is right up against the bag. When the seat is upright in toddler mode, it touches the part where a child's lower leg would be. My baby is only 4 months so that is not an issue now. I suspect when the baby is older he will be outward facing anyway, and this won't be a problem, just something to be aware of.3) The strap system for the seat recline is cumbersome. I'm sure they could have figured something else out here. Hopefully for those that buy it later they will revise that in the following models. The two straps that adjust from bassinet mode to toddler mode are a little tough to do, you really have to squat and pull them pretty hard to buckle. I guess that means they're secure...Overall it is the best option for the price considering the bassinet to toddler and the reversible seat. The two part fold is not difficult. We also have a Chicco Cortina system and that stroller takes up more room in our BMW trunk than this does. It doesn't have a lock when folded, but it stands up so that really isn't a problem for us. The seat did come with a fairly strong fabric smell but after leaving it out in the living room for a few hours it has already started to subside. As for the velcro and the swinging bar on the underneath side of the stroller: put the seat in bassinet mode. Fasten the two 1\" velcro tabs around this bar. Then take the large velcro closure that runs the width of the stroller and fasten it around the previous bar you just velcroed. This helps to keep the bassinet seat stable and the seat keep its shape when put upright.We will probably be using this stroller when we don't need to pack around as many things or when I am alone with the baby so I can more easily see him and entertain him. We will stick to the Chicco when we need more storage space (i.e. going to Disney World, need a big shopping basket). I'm happy with the purchase. I debated on it for days and took the plunge; you should too. I contacted Amazon and as long as the product hasn't been used you can return it within 365 days. So, you can take it out, put it together, try it in your home and if you don't like it, you can return it for free, shipping included. Hope this helps!
Update 4.21.11: seems like it's best for small babies that can take advantage of the bassinet and reversible handle option.  When my daughter got older (around 7-8 months), she decided she no longer liked riding in the Wave stroller, she much rather prefered her First Years Ignite (umbrella) stroller because the seat back can be adjusted much higher.  She likes to sit up and look around, but somehow in the Wave she was always somewhat reclined and couldn't see far enough. I pulled up the seat to the max and even put a blanket behind her but she still screamed.  So, off stroller went for sale  :)  I have no regrets though, it was a much better arrangement for her than having her sweat and steam in the car seat travel system in the middle of summer with her head flopping to her chest when she was tiny. Bottom line: if you are still pregnant or just had a baby, get the stroller. If the baby is older than 6 months, there are better options out there.I have been using the stroller for 4 months now and still love it. I agree with other reviewers regarding lack of accessories and small bag space, but for my circumstances it's not an issue since we don't take long enough walks to have to tag along bottles and diaper bags and what I do bring fits fine in the basket.  I did get a universal caddy for the handle where I can fit a water bottle, keys, and wallet.My daughter is very sensitive to sun, so as soon as I see her squint, I just rotate the seat to make her comfortable, same for if she's had enough of me and wants to see something else  :) I first got a cute Graco stroller with the whole infant seat attachment gig, but my baby looked so uncomfortable and hot and could never take a nap. She started taking naps in this one when I got it.My daughter is only 5 months old now, so we are using a semi-reclined toddler seat now and I can't comment on how she will fit in the stroller a year from now, but I'm hoping we will get to use it until she's two.The only \"con\" if you can call it that is that it is bulky and you have to take off the seat to fold it, but we can live with that since it offers so many other cool features.As for the other reviewer commenting about the smell, most baby things we bought smelled and we had to air them out.  I didn't have any more of a smell issue with the stroller as I did with everything else and there is absolutely no smell right now.  My partner can smell anything a mile away and he hasn't complained.
I've owned numerous strollers over the years, and this is by far the best stroller out there. Its so much nicer than i even imagined! I have three kids between the ages of 3 months to 4 years.  The bassinet feature is amazing for my baby....it's so comfortable and cozy. My 18 month old loves that he can face me and chat with me while we are walking. And since this stroller goes up to 50 lbs i can even use it with my 4 year old if we really got in pinch. It's unbelievably easy to turn the seat from front to back. This stroller has all the features of the $600-$1000 strollers out there, even more in fact, and it looks every bit as nice. I would highly recommend this stroller to anyone!!!!!
Purchased this stroller when I was 8 months pregnant. I LOVE this stroller! We get so many compliments on it while out and about. Getting a rear-facing stroller was really important to me, because I did lots of research on language development, and we practice many aspects of Attachment Parenting. The stroller allows baby to see us, feel comfortable, as well as look out to the world.It is quite easy to put together (even at 8 months pregnant), and took about 20 minutes to assemble. It rolls and turns easily and smoothly, and it's easy to get baby in and out. The \"spin\" feature on the carriage is great and works easily. I also love how it doubles as a bassinet for little ones--we used it around the house as a bassinet up until 3 months, which saved us money on having to buy something that you only use for a few months!The extending handle is great for taller folks, and 
Update: I bought this stroller and originally gave it 5 stars, but after using it for 5 months i am much dissatisfied with quality and comfort. Problems i encountered:1. I had to buy a mattress (found one at buybuybaby) to make it comfortable for a newborn when in the bassinet mode. when in the bassinet mode, the stroller tends to tilt head down. i had to use towels under the head and a heavy object under the feet to level it out.2. i was never able to fold my stroller base, but it was never an issue since i have an suv, and it fits there just fine.3. i have and still is using it mainly with a car seat, baby is comfy in his car seat, i have put him in the stroller sitted and reclined and he seems to be very, very uncomfortable. he only tolerated about 15 min (he can stay in the car seat for hours).4. after five months of use and light grocery shopping, the basket has stretched out and now even with very light objects placed in it, it touches the ground, so i have to carry groceries in my hands when i shop now!5. straps are not very comfortable, especially now when using a bundle me up to keep baby warm.6. diaper bag issue became apparent when i switched from the car seat to stroller base, since basket is barely accessible and small, i strapped by diaper bag to the handle and it worked fine with the car seat, but with the actual stroller seat, diaper bag ends up sitting on top of babies feet or i have to carry it...if i had to do it all over again, I would not buy it! I am looking for a different stroller now, since my son is ready to sit up and needs a comfortable stroller for daily walks.Pros:large canopycan face both ways
We waited for a while for this item to come back in stock and I'm so happy we decided to wait rather than buying another stroller.  We really, really love this item.  It's well-made and really easy to use.  I do wish it had cup-holders, but the stroller is so awesome it's not that big of a deal for us.  We haven't found a universal cup-holder that works with this particular stroller, yet, but we'll keep looking.  The rotating feature is simple and really easy to use, the bassinet is so comfortable and the sun-shade is huge.  It's easy to maneuver and our little girl loves riding in it.  We haven't used the universal car seat attachment yet, but it was a big selling point that it's included with the stroller.  My only \"complaints\" are the lack of cup-holders and the fact that the stroller is so light; attaching the diaper bag will tip the stroller over. This was one of our favorite baby purchases and I would highly recommend this stroller.
I purchased this stroller and got it stuck multiple times while out in the open position. Luckily, I hadn't taken the car otherwise I would've had to abandon the stroller because it cannot fit in the car while open. I got a replacement stroller from First Years but I would've preferred to return the whole thing and not deal with it. I was out of a stroller for a whole month because they were out of stock at the factory.Now, I have the new one and it was working fine. It has not gotten stuck so far but I have to say it is super super heavy and very wide. Maneuvering in stores is tricky.The reason I got this stroller is because it is rear facing. I would have looked at the Peg Perego P3 switch more closely if I had the knowledge I have now.
we checked so many strollers before we bought this one..my wife hit 36 weeks :) so we finally had to make a decision which stroller is the best for us...we checked bugaboo's (which are 800$ !!!!!,gracos,mclarens...we also searched for them on the internet,and that was when we found The first Years stroller.we checked almost every video on youtube,all other reviews,and we made a decision to get it.when it came,we put it together really fast,u dont even need manual for it..we were amazed by it lightweight,functionality, great design and many other things...seriously this stroller cost us 300$ with tax and shipping,comparing to bugaboo its like 3 times less,and whats most important the first years stroller is better than bagaboo,we have some friends who have bugaboos,those strollers are very good too,but what would u choose if there was  a way to save 600 dollars and get the same quality and functionality,and in my opinion better stroller...first yeras looks great,its handy :),light,good quality materials,and whats important too,its tough :) u can easily transform this stroller without changing the main seat,it has adjustable handle height,attachment for infant car seats,and the frame can handle up to 50 pounds!!!!the only minus i found is theres no cup holders,but im sure u can buy it and install it easily...i strongly recommend this stroller for every family,u wont be disappointed.... :)))))
I was so excited to get this stroller as it had wonderful reviews and was much less expensive than the other strollers I was looking at. What sold me on this stroller was the fact that the seat position could be changed with the child still in the seat. When I got it, it was very simple to put together. It looked very nice. I put my son in it and he seemed comfortable. But then I went to change the seat position. It did not lock in place. I went to push the stroller and the seat kept spinning. I took him out and looked at the seat to see if there was something wrong. It locked. I put him back in and tried to do it again. It didn't lock. It would only lock if there was no weight in the seat. My son is only 16 lbs (well below the weight limit). So the main reason I purchased the stroller did not even work!Then a week later I took this stroller to the grocery store. When I went to put it back in my car, it would not fold. I had to call a friend to come get the stroller and take it home in her van as there was no way it would fit in my car while open.Aside from these issues (I obviously got a bad one), I had other issues with the stroller. The basket is a medium size basket but it is impossible to access. There is a bar on the bottom of the stroller that gets in the way when trying to put in a diaper bag. Also, you can't attach a cup holder to the seat because when you change seat positions, the cup holder will turn upside- down.Ultimatly, I spent money on a stroller that I can't use. I sent it back yesterday and I am ordering the Britax B-ready instead.
I'll update this review once my baby is born. I haven't been able to use it for real yet, I've just played with it around the house.------------------------Most of the negative comments about this stroller have to do with:1. No cup holder/parent tray2. Bouncy seat3. Seat needs to be removed in order to fold the stroller1. First off, there is no cup holder or parent tray for simple physics reasons. The handle is what is used to flip the seat around, and after the flip, the handle bar is reversed! Can you imagine some sleep deprived parent with hot coffee in a built-in stationary cup holder going to turn their baby around? Ouch!Also, be advised that not all universal cup holders work due to the girth of the handlebar. For instance, the \"Munchkin Stroller Cup Holder\" does not work. I bought a cup holder from Burlington Coat Factory, which I think is the \"JL Childress Cup 'N Stuff Stroller Pocket\" (based on appearance) and attached it to the front of the handle bar, but to be on the safe side, I'll try to remember to remove any beverage before turning the seat around.2. The seat does have some give to it, but that's good when going over bumps in the sidewalk. Also, babies like to be bounced a little anyway. I think the seat is sturdy enough and I would have no concerns about the stability of the seat in terms of safety.3. Yes, the seat does need to be removed. It's easy to remove through. Getting the seat back in I find a bit more challenging, but after some practice I think I have it down. I look on the bright side: removing the seat splits up the weight and allows for greater flexibility when transporting the stroller (seat can go in the backseat if needed for example).Overall I think it's a fabulous product. I love that the seat can be reversed. I also love that the seat and bassinet are the same unit. I love that the seat isn't still attached to the stroller when the car seat adapter is used - less bulky, less weight(in the Graco travel systems the car seat has to fit on top of the toddler seat). I also love the huge sun shade!I think if you read all the reviews you will have a good idea of what to expect from this stroller and you will buy it for all the positive features of this stroller for the price. (Price does vary - I've seen it go from $280 down to $225 on Amazon)

This stroller is amazing!!! We've had it for almost 11 months now and still love it. There is some room for improvement but otherwise it is great. The seat is very roomy, the stroller has a decent size basket that is easy to reach, huge canopy, and the swivel feature which allows you to turn you baby every which way is amazing. The handle bar is great and can be extended with ease to fit a taller person; maneuverability is amazing. Can you tell I love this stroller?Some ways to improve this stroller for my taste would be: (1) making the seat a little firmer so the baby is more comfortable and, when in toddler mode, more upright; (2) making the stroller less heavy and easier to fold (although it is a full size stroller so you can really only ask for so much); and (3) more accessories like parent cup, child tray, etc.Otherwise, it has to be one of the best strollers on the market!!! We are very happy with it.
Great looking stroller. Here's what I like and what I don't :I like:- the huge covering sun visor/shade that can pull over- how easily it is to manoevre around.- being able to switch position.- the bassinet feature- the look of it - it's super stylish looking.What I don't like:- you can't really put much in the underneath part and you can hang shopping bags on the handle. You can't even attach a mommy hook to the handle and it will slip all the way down to the sides and your bags will drag on the ground. This is a big deal for shopping as it doesn't help you with carrying pretty much anything except the child whereas I've used other strollers that you can put all your shopping bags on there and its a workhorse as well as a stroller.- the seat isn't very deep- it's tricky to put together - I find I have to lean right over every time and wiggle it with the red buttons pushed down to get it in place. Would have been nice if it could just drop into place.Overall I am happy with it for the moment.
So I really wanted a chic, uptown looking stroller without having to pay the 600-1000 dollar price tag! I love this stroller. It is so easy to use and the swivel feature is amazing! The basket below is somewhat small but seems that it will work fine. As with all the other reviewers, I do wish it had at least some detachable cup holders but you cant get everything you want! lol- Seriously, this is a great price for such a great stroller.... Easily folds and works well with the first years i450 car seat... it has a universal attachment for other car seats but just looks great with the first years car seat! get this stroller!!! you wont be disappointed!
The little bear pattern is deliciously cute.  I agree with the other reviews... i thought for a $25 price tag that this would be one of the covers that have the fuzzy bottom side (as one of the pictures suggests) but that is not the case.  Also, when washed, the brown piping bleeds onto the white patterned fabric.  For 2.5 times the price of the standard cover, I would reconsider this purchase.
I can't stress how thrilled I am at having super cute organic options more available. The recipient squealed with delight over how cute this was.
Ruined a whole load of baby clothes because the brown trim bled everywhere. Great to have a cover but be careful of the colors.
This is cute very thin fabric one of those fabrics that always feel cool to the touch...i like that. It is very cute and blends well with neutral decor...i thought it had birds on it with the trees but it is teddy bears...eh dont love that but whatever its organic and you dont notice them unless you get up close.
Love the pattern but nothing about this is worth $25.  I thought it was going to be the thicker, softer Boppy cover they make since it's organic but it's no different than the ones sold for $10.  Dissapointed.
My child is one of those high need newborns that has wanted to be held at all times since day 1, and has hated any other surface. I bought this in hopes of getting some respite from wearing/carrying my child in my arms around the house. He will tolerate being on it for a few minutes when awake, but that's about it. He certainly hasn't dozed on it, or anything of the sort.This isn't to say that the product doesn't work. I'm sure lots of babies love being on it (our cats certainly try to use it as a cat cushion, and they're pretty picky when it comes to soft and cushy!), it's just not going to please a baby who's intent on being held at all times like mine is (alas, by the time he grows out of it, he will have learned to roll, which will make this product not safe for him anymore).
Really, isn't that all that matters?!  I do not know why, but we have a daughter with acid reflux, and this is her favorite place to lay.  We wish they made covers for them (my only complaint), but we have multiples now and use them for changing her and for her to sleep in when we are there to watch her.
I was excited to see this option for a newborn while I was looking for a boppy pillow cover replacement. I ordered this and when I received it part of the stitching was already coming loose. I think this may be a fluke, but still a little disappointed.
These are super soft and cozy, it gently hugs the baby and he doesn't slide out of it like he does with a bobby u-shaped pillow.  Definitely recommend it.
I received this as a gift, and the lady who gave it to me said \"we used this every single day and I would have never known I needed it.\" This is exactly how I feel.  It is PERFECT for the couch or bed when the whole family is just lounging.  The 'C' boppy lets a newborn get too squished.  The lounger ROCKS!
I love this pillow. I got it for as a baby gift before my daughter was born and we use it every day now. My daughter is 6 weeks old and wakes up every time I put her down, except when I swaddle her, put her on the newborn lounger sideways and I also heat up the top where her head goes on the pillow by putting one of those microwavable rice bags adults use for headaches then take it away when I'm about to put her down. The pillow says not to let the baby sleep or be on his or her side or tummy while using the pillow, but she doesn't sleep well anywhere else except when someone is holding her. I always make sure to that if she were to roll off she wouldn't fall far or land on the floor or hard surface and I make sure to check on her a lot. My cousin borrowed it the other day for her 6 month old, who can roll over, and she loved it, stayed on her back the entire time. I think it might be a bit hard for even a baby who can roll to get out of it since they have to roll up hill first. The pillow is very firm so it isn't as much of a suffocation risk as a regular pillow.  Plus, it's so portable. I can use it in the crib, pack and play, on my bed, couch. I took it to a picnic last weekend. My daughter also prefers this to her swing and bouncy chair when she is awake and happy. It's perfect for taking pictures in. I wish the cover came off so I can wash it. The washing instructions say to put in it in the washing machine,which I wouldn't do. The material wipes clean pretty easily. My daughter spits up all the time and I just spot clean it. It could get gross if she ever has a big blow out on it though.
I used this everyday, all day, everywhere! I recommend this and have purchased it for all my friends that have become new mothers.
I loved this for my new baby. I kept mine on the kitchen counter till he was about 4 months. Its great to have a place to set them down when you are doing a million things. Of course once they start getting mobile you can't use it but it was great to have. Get it!
This is one of most favorite baby items.  My son came early and was a bit on the tiny side.  He immediately looked and seemed so comfortable in this lounger.  It is so versatile and can be used for sleep, play, feeding, and picture taking.  Even when my baby went through a rough time and didn't want to be set down in his bouncy, he still loved this pillow.  We would set it on the bed (supervised) for naps or just to set him down comfortably when we wanted to change clothes, etc.  Also, when I was alone I would tote this from room to room and it was particularly useful when I needed to go the bathroom ;).  It was also great for setting on the couch between my husband and I.  I know we did a lot of things the label says not to do, but we were always right there so I felt like it was perfectly safe.  We even put the pillow in the mini co-sleeper for my sons naps, because it was so comfortable he would sleep a lot longer and because it fit tightly I knew he couldn't roll off and get wedged...although I never left him alone in it.  I really can't say enough good things about this item.  My son is 3 months old now and rolling over so we don't use it as much, but he still loves it as much as ever.  I wish it came with a toy bar...lol...oh and a washable cover would be great too!
We used this product often with our daughter and plan on using it with our son.  It has a long life span as even a toddler can use it as a lounger (as we have found out).  I just wish they sold more (I actually haven't seen any here on Amazon, but that doesn't mean they're not available) slip covers for it.
This pillow cradles the baby and kind of \"hugs\" them as they are in it, It props them up a little so they can look around but keeps little wiggly babies that cant stay still safely in it still. My daughter loves it occasionally she even naps in it. When my daughter is super fussy most of the time putting her in this where she can look around calms her down and she seems to enjoy just being placed in it.its very well made and the pink print is really pretty. One thing i would say since the cover doesn't come off lay a folded receiving blanket on the seat before putting your baby in it if they tend to have blow outs other wise it will end up stained. So far this hasn't happened but i know my daughter has a tendency to do that so i right away figured i would do that and so far the only time it happened it was covered.
I love this pillow. My newborn sits in it daily and loves it. Definitely need to be supervising the baby when he is in it though, as my baby is getting longer I can see that he could roll out of it.
This lounger works well for infants.  My son fits comfortably at 2 weeks old.  The blue and yellow colors and geometric pattern are very modern looking.
My baby was only 8 weeks old when he first rolled out of this pillow.  We have the boppy (nursing pillow) and use it to prop him up from time to time, but wanted this for safety.  I still use it on the floor when I'm right there and he enjoys it for a short time.
my daughter loved it!!! it was one of the best things i ever got for her
I used this for my baby since he was a newborn and he's 5 months and still uses it. It's very plush and soft. We coslept with my son in it til he was about 3 or 4 months.
I love this pillow. While it is not recommended for use while the newborn sleeps, it works great as a portable chair. I like that it props baby up well enough for bottle feeding (with no hiccups afterwards! Didn't even need to burp him!), and is light enough for me to carry withut help after delivery. Print was cute and sweet.
My baby is 1 week old whenever I put him in this it looks like he's slouched over & not comfortable. I put a pillow under the feet side to make him more straight.
I had been using my regular Boppy to lay my newborn son in for short periods of time and he always slid down into it and I had to re-adjust him every minute or so.  Then I found this!!  It is so awesome and he loves it!  He will stay content in this for a good 30 minutes at a time.  When he's not using it I have to make sure I keep it propped up on end or my cats will be sleeping in it in no time.
I use the boppy lounger for many different things.  I use it for my newborn (since the day he came home from the hospital) for him to lounge in and he loves it.  I also had a very difficult recovery postpartum and I used it to sit on around the house and it was a big help.
Both of our kids LOVED this from day one - and it's been a life saver.  Our daughter, 2 1/2 months old, has already had a few colds and this helped a ton with her congestion.  MUST. HAVE.
My baby had mild reflux and this was a great option of somewhere to put her rather than laying on a blanket flat on her back.  It really only was useful until she was about 3 months old.  Then she was too big for it and able to roll off.
Definitely not a boppy for breastfeeding. Also make sure you are placing this on stable grounds, not a small bed or couch since it is very elevated and can easily fall off. Propping the baby seems easy and comfortable enough, but they don't like to stay propped as newborns for a long period of time anyway, I would invest in the Boppy.
You know - we own a few different Boppy products now and each one I bought thinking, \"Hmm... I wonder if this is really worth it?\" They ALL have been! We love this little lounger. Our newborn perches perfectly in it. I set her in it several times a day and it's become quite helpful. I use it when I pump bottles, so I set my baby girl up in the lounger so I can talk to her and smile at her while I'm using my breast pump. Not only does this help keep her happy, but it helps increase my production as well (I notice more letdown reflexes when I'm with her when pumping!)She enjoys sitting in her lounger as it lets her look around while comfortable. I also think we've had issues with reflux and the Boppy Lounger has helped a lot! She spits up constantly and can be quite fussy if she's reclined too much. We have the regular Boppy as well but she tends to fall into it, so I think the lounger Boppy also has it's place. We have both and they're wonderful helps with our new baby (11 weeks old now).This item makes a fantastic baby shower gift as well, I wish I'd gotten it as a gift. The fabric is very easy to clean and stain resistant. It retains it's shape well and is very sturdy for a big pillow-like item. I also find myself using it frequently in all sorts of creative ways when I'm holding her, nursing or whatever.I know I originally approached the Boppy products as if they were silly and unnecessary as a new mom. BUT, now I'm on my second new baby girl and I LOVE the Boppy products! Not completely necessary, no. (Not like bottles or diapers which you MUST HAVE!) but so very nice, nonetheless, for the new mom to own. I highly recommend the Boppy products to any new mom. I've had my eye on the newborn Boppy booster accessory, too! Might seem like a superfluous product to some, but having breastfeed now I see the wisdom in it and wish I owned it!These are good products.
You may not be able to use this for nursing, but the babies fit so much more comfortable in the lounger than the original boppy.  I was never able to get the original boppy to work for nursing (to big of a gap between me and the pillow- a regular pillow worked better) and my babies would always slip down into an uncomfortable position when laid in it.  The lounger hold the babies perfectly.
The seat is abolutely perfect for those few minutes when you need to put your newborn down to do a quick load of laundry, take a shower, etc.  This was bought after the birth of our fourth child, and I wish I would have seen it for the first three!  Much better than the regular Boppy pillow.
This was great for lounging with the baby on the bed or couch, or anywhere else he wasn't yet big or strong enough to lay down on his own.
Conceptually I like this lounger. If my baby slept in it, as other reviewers note, I would absolutely love it.  But, sadly, my baby does not sleep in it and after 3 days the chemical smell remained.  I bought it to help elevate my baby to help his stuffy nose but I never ended up using it due to the smell and as a baby seat, I believe babies would be on the floor to help develop motor skills.  Does not work for me.
My newborn is 4 weeks today and we use this daily ever since he came home. In deciding to purchase this, I talked to a coworker and we came to the conclusion that it may not be worth it since we could use a blanket for a similar effect and if anything it is a complete luxury because he won't be in it for too long. In a spur of the moment decision 2 days before his arrival, we decided to go for it. We are so glad that we did!Whenever I am working on the computer (like right now), I can stick him in the newborn lounger. Even though he is always supervised, I know that he will not roll out of it because he doesn't have the strength to get out of the indentation. And, he is upright and slightly inclined unlike how he would be if instead doing tummy time on a blanket. It is also very cushy so he is not on the hard floor. He always looks peaceful and content when in it. It makes me want to get a beanbag chair for myself! However, we know that he will not be able to be in this for the long haul. He was 22\" when born and his legs can only get to be another 6 or so inches longer before they hit the ground as they are at the edge of the top right now. His head is about 4 inches from the top edge now. However, I think that we still have several months of use we can get out of it.The only thing I don't like is that there is not a slipcover on it. We didn't research to find out if they are offered since he won't be in it forever so didn't want to mark it down for that. Though, it could be information a potential purchaser wants to know. We really liked the seed row pattern and the softness of the material. We could just toss the whole thing in the washer but I would prefer a removable cover that I can throw in the washer instead to take up less room. However, the times that he has spitup in it, it has wiped right off with no staining. With peach, 2 shades of blue, green, and brown, it is also neutral enough to use for any girls that we have in the future.---Update: He is 9 weeks now. He had spit up on it a couple more times but it always wipes right off. We have not thrown it in the washer yet and it doesn't need it. We throw a small receiving blanket over it as a layer of protection from spitups. The receiving blanket is smaller than what we would need for daily use but the perfect size as a makeshift slipcover. We take it with us to choir practice. While we practice, he just lays in it completely content. It is way lighter and easier to travel with than the bouncer or another place that we can put him while we need to be hands-free.
The usefulness will vary baby to baby but this has been great for my daughter. She is in a phase where she likes to be propped up rather than flat on her back so we are using this quite a bit. My baby was 7 1/2 pounds when we brought her home and initially did not use this although we tried. She just seemed too small for it and her head was at a weird angle when we sat her in it. Once she got to about 9 pounds she seemed to fit in it perfectly!
We received this off of our registry as a gift.  IT. IS. AWESOME.  Not only is it super comfy and easy to place newborns in but it is also easy to move around the house or take with you!  It has a little handle and is light enough to carry with two fingers.  We used this in lieu of a bouncer and are very happy we did!
I received the Newborn Lounger as a shower gift. I hadn't registered for it and didn't give it much thought at the time. Now that my daughter is one month old, however, I would say that it's been one of the most useful baby items in our arsenal. The shape of the pillow allows newborns to lay comfortably on their backs with the upper half of the body slightly elevated so they can look around in a way that they can't while flat on their backs. While our swing is great for fussy times or when she's asleep, the Newborn Lounger is my favorite place to lay the baby while she's happy and alert because it puts her at a perfect angle for \"face time\" with me. The material is super soft and comfy, so it's also a great back pillow for the couch or an arm support for holding or breast feeding. I highly recommend the NEwborn Lounger as a must-have for any new parent!
Also, there's no way to wash the cover except spot cleaning. Strange that a removable cover is not currently available.
When I received this as a gift at my shower, I wondered what this could possibly be good for. It's a $30 pillow, right? What's so special about it? Then baby was born, and I fell in love with him...and this pillow!This lounger is great to set next to us on the couch or floor to nestle baby, and is especially great for babies with reflux because it's slightly elevated. The shape is very comfy for babies. This isn't meant for sleeping, but our son has taken a few naps in it (with us right next to him, of course). I use this primarily for feeding my son while I'm pumping. It's definitely made my life easier.One thing that I wish they would change is the cover. It's not removable, and anything around babies needs to be so it can be washed. I put a blanket or receiving blanket over it to protect it, but it's still gotten some baby spit up on it. The fabric does wipe clean pretty easily, though. Other than the cover, this pillow is perfect!He's starting to outgrow it now at 5 months and about 17 pounds/26 inches.Bonus: it makes a great dog pillow, too. Our black lab, who has turned down every other dog bed we've purchased for him, loves to curl up in a ball on this pillow.
I had this with my first pregnancy (gave it away to a friend who loved with her 2 kids) and I bought another.Now I have 2 -- one for upstairs and downstairs.  I think they're great
This is by far the one of the best items I received at my baby shower. I have used this since day one and still use it now that my baby is three months old. It's a perfect little nest for baby to rest in, and it is also great to snap shots of your little one. I would recommend this to all parents.
Very sweet &#34;bean bag&#34; pillow for newborns.  I like to lay my granddaughter on this when dressing her or for putting her down to free up my hands for other things.  It is small so I don't expect to use it long for this granddaughter, and it is not washable, so I usually put a receiving blanket over it to protect it from spit-ups, etc.
Our baby seems to enjoy being in the boppy. It's snug and feels like an extra pair of arms to hold your child when you need your hands free. However, our baby (5 days old) already squirms and manages to move herself into a horizontal position. Probably returning it soon.
I wish that I had known how great this pillow was while I was making my baby registry. And I wish that I had owned it as soon as I brought my baby home from the hospital! It is so nice to have a place to set baby that is slightly elevated (to help with that pervasive spit up) and allows me to hold something else in my hands while interacting with my baby. And my baby seemed to think that it was very comfortable! I am definitely going to recommend this to all new moms.
This is what I will be getting people for a shower gift from now on. Love it. Sturdy yet soft enough for baby to snuggle into. Easy to clean and very pretty.
Cute and functional. Baby looks very comfortable and I love it that i can put the baby next to me on the coach while I pump or do anything. I wouldn't feel comfortable to leave the baby unattended in this, but it's not intended for baby to sleep in or to be left unsupervised. Very easy to clean the accidental diaper spills. Good quality product.
I brought this for a gift the baby is not yet born ut the pillow is very fluffy and nice I am sure the baby will love it
Baby loves being able to be slightly elevated and just hang with family. Great place to put him after feeding as well to avoid reflux if that's an issue. Also it seems very soft like cotton but it is somehow water proof. Baby spit-up etc. has easily beaded off and wiped clean.
Comfy but also sturdy so that you don't have to worry about the baby sinking in or the pillow getting lopsided. Good for naps for your infant or for resting your baby on while you read in bed, etc.
We wouldn't have survived the first few weeks without this! Its great and baby loves it! I have recommended this to everyone and bought it as shower gifts as well! :)
This pillow is super portable and our newborn finds it very comfortable! He has used it every day for 5 weeks and we love always having a place for him to settle down in any room with us or when we visit friends.  I will be sad when he grows out of it, which is likely to be soon but it was still well worth the cost!  If you think you don't want it because you already have the other Boppy pillow, you're wrong! I like them both but they are very different and are used daily for totally different purposes.UPDATE: *7 weeks old my son is a bit too tall to be comfortable in the pillow now. It was heavily used but only for a short term.  Now I just wish they sold them adult sized!
I received a Mambo (similar to a boppy) pillow for one of my baby showers and my little guy loves it, but it's still too roommy inside for his small size.  I purchased the newborn lounger and couldn't be more pleased.  The thicker top allows him to stay inclined so he can interact with his surroundings, and the hollowed portion allows him to be cradled perfectly.  Note: Do not let newborns play/sleep unattended as they can roll over the side, as I caught my little one doing.
My newborn LOVES her Boppy Lounger.  She sleeps better in it than in her bassinet or playard. It makes it easy to let her sit with me in different places around the house.  My nephew had one as well when he was a newborn and he loved it also.  I would definitely say this is a must-have baby item.
Hands down, one of the best gifts we received for our baby girl! I registered for it as a \"would be nice, but not a necessity\" item. One of our friends bought it for us, and we literally used it every single day until my daughter got too big for it and started to scoot her way off of it (around 4.5 months). When she was a newborn we often lay her in it to sleep and covered her with a blanket--I could put her on the couch (where we stayed by her), or on the floor next to the table when we ate dinner. Even when she stopped napping in it, I would still put it in front of me on our bed and lay her in it facing me, where we'd sing and play, and she was perfectly happy in it. It was great because she was elevated and cozy, rather than just laying flat in front of me. I would also put it on the bathroom floor while I did my hair and make-up and she'd be happy just watching me.The fabric is pretty and soft,  and it also wipes off clean, which is great because of course babies spit up A LOT. There's no cover that comes off, the fabric is just wipeable. The only thing that I didn't like about the fabric and the only negative about the lounger is that it attracted lint that wasn't really wipeable. I would sometimes run a lint roller over it, 
This boppy pillow is a must have for a newborn! I have the regular boppy (U shaped pillow) which is great but we couldn't place our newborn in it since it didn't hold her up at all (that pillow will most likely work better with older infants who can hold their head up/ sit up on their own). A family member purchased this for us and it has made our lives so much easier. Our daughter easily fits onto the contoured pillow which puts her into a quasi sitting position. Our daughter also has mild colic issues so not having to lay flat in a crib/ playpen while my husband and I are doing things around the house during the day is a huge plus and we noticed she's much less fussy. Having this makes it easy for us whether we are relaxing/ watching tv or need to get a few things done during the day and don't have anywhere else to put her. Almost every night, we place her in the pillow on the couch between the two of us and our daughter sleeps and relaxes in it. I loved it so much I purchased for a friend who just had a baby and they use theirs all the time too.
This pillow was a life saver when my granddaughter was born.  We took it to the hospital and then with her when she went to grandparents, etc to spend time.  She would be fussing and we would lay her in this and she would calm right down and go to sleep.  I know it says don't let a baby sleep in it, but we watched her closely and she loved it!!! I highly recommend it.
My baby hated to eb flat on her back when she was first born. She is now 10 weeks and still not crazy about it. I had a regular boppy for nursing, but I couldn't really sit her in it since she would just flop over. So I got this one. It's a little indented in the middle so it cradles them nicelyand they don't lay completely flat.It worked great as a quick item to carry around for a quick place to set your baby down wherever you are. Don't ever leave your baby unattended it it because there is no strap to buckel them in, but if your sitting on the couch and want to have your baby on your lap, this works great. It's worth the purchase. It also makes it easy if you have other smaller chilred who want to hold the baby. You can put this on their lap and the baby in it and it makes it much easier for them.
I got one for my baby shower and used it alot when my son was a baby.In fact, I like it so much that I've bought several of these and have given them to my girlfriends for baby showers.In addition to this lounger, I would include also a bottle of Vitaville Argan Oil for the mom-to-be so that she can use it on her stretch marks, as a nipple cream or just as a luxurious body lotion and hair treatment. A little bit pampering for the woman is important during this time :)
I don't know what we would have done without this Boppy for our newborn! She practically lived in it for the first couple of months. A soft, comfy way for her to hang out when we couldn't hold her and before she could fit other baby bouncers, swings, etc.
I received this at my shower and had no idea how handy it would be. It has been, by far, the BEST gift we got. My son loves it and I do to- hands free and he is happy to sit or sleep (make sure you are right next to them since it is not designated for sleep.)I have used it multiple times every day and he is now 3 months old. Everyone should have one of these.
We bought this after trying to find a way to get our newborn cozy on the couch with us. This is a great flexible option. We even used it for her to sleep between us the first few nights when we couldn't stop staring at her...she is so comfortable in this she often falls right asleep. I know it says not to sleep in it but until she is mobile it seems safe enough.Unfortunately we learned that she also has reflex and is prone to spitting up after she eats. This is made worse if you set her in any sitting position; bouncy seat, swing, carseat. This works like a charm as she is more reclined and doesn't spit up when we lay her in it.I would also suggest the cover that you can purchase for this as well. It is fleece and makes it very cozy for winter,
We didn't originally register for this.  We wound up purchasing it after our shower.  We used this lounger more than the rest of the gadgets.  We loved it so much, it's our go to gift for our friends with newborns!
I got this before my baby was born and used it until he was several months old (maybe 9 months) and hanging over. He loved this just as much as we did. It is the perfect little spot to place your baby while in the living room. He would sleep, drink and just hang out in this lounger. Great product!
We've used this lounger every day of our son's life (he's three months old now), he hangs out in it for hours, happy as a clam. The thing about this lounger that you can't get with any other piece of gear is its mobility. Wherever in the house you need baby to be, you just throw down the boppy and lay him in it. We have other places we can set him down, like a swing and a pack 'n play, but they're not as mobile. When we want to move baby from room to room without worrying about piling up pillows, this lounger is the answer. He's safe and comfortable and can't roll off easily. He hangs out in the kitchen when we're cooking dinner, in the office when we're working, or anywhere else in the house we need him to be. And even though it says on the label that kids shouldn't sleep in it (for liability reasons, no doubt), this lounger is my son's favorite place to nap. All my friends with babies are jealous because they didn't know this thing existed!
This is an excellent product, I recommend it to every parent with a newborn.  I use mine everyday, several times per day.  They are only useful until about 4 months of age, as after that babies can roll out of the pillow on their own.  It is soft, it holds the baby well (of course never leave an infant alone), and it is a great place to set the baby while watching tv, in between feedings, while folding laundry, etc.  This is my favorite Boppy product!
We used this after feeding our baby to help her with her reflux. She was cozy and comfortable on this pillow. The slight angle that the pillow keeps the baby at helped lessen the spitting up which was a big plus. Our baby is six months old (she is fairly tall for her age) now and almost too big to sit on the pillow the way it is intended. I wish it was a bit larger to accommodate babies a little longer.
I was skeptical when I received this as a baby shower present, but as it came from my husband's aunt, I decided to give it a try. I am so glad I did. This probably my all time favorite baby item. This is one of the the few things my baby loved to sit in. He liked it better than his bouncer, swing, and sometimes better than my arms! I pump exclusively and he would sit in it for 20 minutes while I pumped and be perfectly content.We have loaned it to a friend who just had a baby and it's the only thing her infant likes as well. I would highly recommend this product.
Love this lounger, it gets used daily. The baby loves to lay on it and look around. Very comfy for our newborn! This was a great idea by Boppy. We use it a lot more than the regular Boppy.
Must have item for me with a newborn. This was so great especially when my DD was havin hiccups or wanted to be slightly propped up. I think she felt comforted like when I held her
My twin baby girls love being in this seat! I was looking for a comfy and safe spot to put one of them while taking care of the other one, without having to strap them in their bouncers each single time, and this proved to be perfect. They feel comfortable in it, and the shape prevents them from falling :)
I was given one of these (in pink) by a family member. My daughter was born a month early since they had to induce me since she wasn't growing properly. She was only 3lbs 5oz. She was in the NICU for two weeks so when I brought her home everything was to big! There was no way I was putting a little baby in a BIG crib and the rock and play I got for her swallowed her up. So I used this with rolled up towels holding her in place and it worked perfect. She would lay on this and (even though it says they shouldn't sleep on it, since it is a pillow) she slept on it, on top of my bed because it was the only thing she some what fit into and was happy with. As she grew we continued to use it just for awake time and it has been such a HUGE help! I am a bit sad she has almost grown out of it now. I highly recommend it even if you can only use it for a few months it was a HUGE help to us.
This lounger is awesome. Very soft and thick. So comfortable for baby. I had a differnt lounger years ago for my oldest. This new one from boppy is much better. A great buy!!
Have you ever pooped while holding a newborn?  Tried to wipe yourself with a baby dangling between your knees?In these days of attachment parenting and never letting a baby cry, I bet many people have.  I sure know that's what I was doing.Get one of these loungers to keep in the bathroom and everyone will be a lot happier and more sanitary.  That's what I do.  I have no idea how other moms do it ... maybe I'm the only one who ever takes a baby to the bathroom with her -  but if you're like me, you will be very very happy to have a safe spot in the bathroom to put the baby down for a minute.  You can keep a clean towel over the lounger and replace it frequently if the idea of keeping this in the bathroom makes things seem unsanitary.  It's certainly more sanitary than having the baby in your lap!
I was told this was an essential item for a newborn. I agree this is an excellent product and easy to move around the house.
Great for baby playtime and daytime snoozing (although I would,'t let baby sleep overnight in this for safety reasons).The two sides are slightly different in indent height so smaller babies can feel comfy on one side and larger babies on the other.  Really comfy for baby and at the right angle for baby to lean up at so that baby is not flat.  I think this will fit babies up to a maximum of approx 4 months depending on your baby's size.The major problem is the lack of a removable cover so if it gets dirty, it's difficult to clean - although technically it is an 'easy clean' cover but I can't see spit-uo (or worse!) being cleaned off if easily!  Why would you not have a removable cover for when baby invariably makes a mess?!  Do the manufacturers really expect this to be wiped down only?  I don't understand manufacturers that don't make baby items such as this without removable covers.It can be put in a front load washer if your washer is big enough but that's not possible for many people.Overall, a reasonable buy but like a lot of things someone didn't think this through properly!.
He climbs all over it, and loves laying in it while looking at books or drinking a bottle. Thought this would be a waste of money, totally isn't!
I used this a lot.  It's especially good for when we Skype with her grandma and grandpa.  I use this way more than I thought I would.  I love taking pictures of my baby on this too, since I can put different blankets down for different backgrounds.  I found that all her pictures had the same background until I thought of switching out backgrounds.  :)
Our high needs little one loves this and has loved it since the day we got home from the hospital.  I would agree that while its not a necessity (we can get her settled down in the bouncy seat or newborn rock and play) but she loves laying in this :)  She is now 6 weeks old and still loves it.I would say that this wouldn't be safe for babies who are starting to be more mobile there is no safety belt or anything but I knew that when I purchased this and bought it only for the very early newborn stage.
We received the Boppy Newborn Lounger as a baby shower gift and it is one item that my husband and I use daily.  We call it the baby throne!  It basically is a comfortable cushion for the baby with a groove in the center for their bottom to lay in.  My baby loves sitting in it and looking around and watching us.  Since he's too young to roll over yet, it gives us time to run and put a load of laundry in the washer or run to the bathroom even without having to put him in his playard and worry about not being able to hear him.  The lounger is definitely lightweight and portable and has a handle.  We take the lounger with us to the grandparents' house for when we have to put the little one down for a nap.  Seems to be great for babies with reflux too since they are on a slightly inclined position.  You can also use the lounger for baby's tummy time exercises, supervised of course.  The only disadvantage to the lounger is that there isn't a removable cover, so one should probably lay a burp cloth underneath the baby to prevent spit up from leaking into the lounger.
Best baby product I owned, hands down.  You need to shower, or cook?  Baby can hang out and watch you.  Tilted up so baby can see and helps digestion.  This is better than the feeding Boppy that is a half circle because when baby is young I felt the regular Boppy forced her head to be tilted up at an unnatural angle.  This is much more gradual and comfortable.  And she LOVED it.  She did not like carriers, as she wanted to see what was going on and interact.
This item was a lifesaver! When we first brought my daughter home she would not sleep in her co-sleeper or bassinet, but she slept so peacefully in the lounger. I know it says not to let the baby sleep in this lounger but I was always present and she still has yet to roll off the lounger even though she is now four months old. She still lounges in this item even though her legs are a bit long but she is at the stage where she loves to grab her toes and feet. Still using the newborn lounger even though my little one is 14 lbs and 24.5 inches long. Definitely a must buy! Only thing is I wish the item came with a cover to wash in the washing machine. We just wipe the lounger down every once in a while and put blankets over the lounger but it would be nice to get it super clean since she has been it in so much over the past few months.
This was a fantastic purchase. My daughter loves it. It says not to let babies sleep in it but I did anyway. My daughter had reflux for 4 weeks and this was great because she was at an incline. I bought one for my friend who said it was the best gift she received. This is my new shower gift!
This saved our sanity. the boys LOVED it. very comfortable, very soft. we never attempted to wash it, so I can't speak on it's durability... The boys loved to nap and sleep on this. it does have the &#34;not for sleep&#34; tag though. It elevates them enough to help after feedings and helped keep reflux at bay
My baby loved this and napped in this for months. She eventually grew out of it, but it was our go to for a long time. We also had to wash it a couple times, and it was pretty easy to do (although you probably need a front-load washer and not one with an agitator in the center). I just wish it had zip on covers like the original Boppy so you could wash them and still use it with a different cover. Our baby was tiny and she fit in it right from the get go. As she got a little older (~2 months), we even used it for play time so she could see the toys I was holding up and eventually reach for them. It was perfect for that.
This is a wonderful product. It makes a great cushion for baby to play on. I don't have to feel bad about laying him on the cold floor with just a blanket. It allows people who are scared to hold small babies a place to put the baby and then place on their lap. It is exactly what I wanted.
Must have with the boppy. My daughter can produce some epic-spit ups and with this cover on + the pretty cover on top, nothing has made it through to the actual pillow, and it has been in the line of fire many times. Washes well and looks like new.
I personally like this boppy cover, i don't use it under another cover and it works well for us and our needs
I bought this so that I don't have to wash my boppy so often and it does protect the boppy well. I was afraid the cover may not be very soft since it was meant to be under another cover but it's very soft and can be used by itself. It's a great cover for the price!
fits my boppy well, easy to spot clean or wash in the washer and put back on. replacement covers fit even with this cover already on
Not 100% effective, but definitely better than no barrier at all. I like the feel of it- soft and smooth- and fits perfectly on the boppy. No complaints here.
It fits and does what it is supposed to do!  I have only been using it for a week so I can't comment on durability but it is exactly what I thought it would be.  Recommended no question!
I bought two of these. They fit perfectly and are very soft. In the event you don't have a cover over it for some time, this is definitely soft enough to use on it's own.
I bought these for my two boppy pillows (I am about to have twins), and this is my fourth pregnancy.  I went through three pregnancies without a waterproof slipcover, and wonder how I ever did it (I washed the pillow constantly, that's how!).  These are so much nicer b/c they are machine washable, and they protect your pillow - just put it underneath the pretty slipcover.  I was also extremely happy to see that the material is not plasticy or vinyl at all (I thought it would be) - it's actually material that is waterproof, much like a microfiber or some sort.  Highly recommended!
This does a great job protecting the pillow. So much easier to throw in the wash than the whole pillow. Boppies are treated w/ a flame resistant material that can create a mold after several exposures to moisture & not being washed. Its a good idea to wash them regularly or protect w/ a waterproof cover.
After a blowout nearly ruined my Boppy, I purchased this to put under my decorative Boppy cover.  It does the trick and protects the Boppy from messes.  Boppys are not easy to wash, so I highly recommend buying this.
I ended up with 2 reflux babies who projectile vomit...so this cover is exactly what I need to preserve the boppy underneath during tummy time, feeding, and even just laying around. We have one of these on both of our boppy's.
great product, pretty self explanatory. It's quite thin and fits the boppy very snugly, doesn't bulk it up at all which is great. I recommend this product!
It's nice to have this because our baby slobbered and spit up a lot until she was about 8 months old. So, it's nice not to have to worry about shielding the pillow from her because of this cover.
Protective Cover?? My son just leaked through the side of his diaper. I immediately cleaned him and the Boppy up, but by the time I even got the first cover AND the \"protective\" cover off, the poo had leaked through BOTH and is on my Boppy pillow. How can this be called \"protective\" and \"water resistant\" if things leak through within seconds!??Super soft cover and loved the idea prior to this event!!
I use my boppy pillow every day. Is great for nursing and holding my newborn.  This cover is very soft, great for baby's delicate skin.  Works wonders to keep your pillow stain free and all stains are gone after you put it in the washer.
Today my three month old had a major blowout on the boppy. My boppy has a slipcover in addition to the waterproof cover and the pillow itself still became soiled so this is not 100% waterproof. However, I am so glad I had it because it did absorb some of the mess. Instead of having a ruined pillow I was able to clean the little bit that did soak through and save the pillow.
Product is definately water resistant.  I only purchased this slipcover for my boppy as I found it was not necissary to buy an additional cotton cover. I'd say this was a pretty wise purchase for the price.
So far we have not had the mess that would necessitate this protective cover.  The regular slip cover is very think and sturdy and frankly does a great job.  It is easy enough to just wipe off any little dribble.  that being said I can easily see a scenario where all of a sudden you wish you had the cover.  If you have the extra $10 go ahead and buy it.  It may be worth the piece of mind.
It fits very snuggly.  I used it underneath another cover and the topcover then becomes loose.  I haven't spilled anything on it yet, so don't know if it'll work as a &#34;waterproof&#34; protection.
So I didn't initally buy this for my Boppy but I feed my baby using the pillow and realized that some of the formula/ spit up/ etc was dripping on the pillow. It's a lot easier to wash this cover than the whole pillow!
If you buy/receive a Boppy, this is a must have as your Boppy is destined to get soiled with formula/breast milk, spit-up, urine, and who knows what else). Whether you get the bare naked Boppy and decorative cover or you get a Boppy that comes with a cover, it does not come with one of these. So, you will need to purchase a protective cover separately regardless.
I purchased the Boppy Water Resistant Protective Cover for the same reason that everyone does. I was happy about the idea of having a cover that would protect the pillow from the little leaks and spills that happen with a newborn/infant...untilI was recently given the opportunity to test out this 'water resistance' feature, by my almost 2 month old. Much to my irritation this is not water resistant at all. The spit up was immediately attended to but it had already soaked through the top cover (which was expected) and soaked through the water resistant cover right down to the pillow. There is nothing water resistant about this. I'm convinced the people that are rating it as a marvelous product have never actually been given the chance to test it out.Here's the break down:Pros:- inexpensive as a regular cover- washes up well- goes on and off very easily- fits nicely under a decorative coverCons:- NOT water resistant in the least- will make you very frustrated when you discover this factThis gets two stars because I do not hate it, it works fine as a regular cover and is cheaper than some of the Boppy covers out there. It does not get more stars because it does not do what it claims.There is a possibility that Boppy company did not intend this item to go under a decorative cover. Having a decorative cover over this one may change the way this cover is designed to resist wicking moisture into the fabric and subsequently into the pillow itself. Then again, who wants a WHITE cover on a pillow they are using with their newborn or infant??
These weren't around when my first son was born, so when I would let down or my son would spit up, into the washing machine the Boppy had to go.  These covers are the best and I just keep an extra on hand so I can switch it for the one in the wash.  So glad they make these now!  Feel free to cover with a cute, printed one, but first put this on.  (Think of it like a mattress pad cover with sheets over it.)
This cover works really well, it's soft like bed sheets and is really the only cover you need for your Boppy.  It helps minimize spit-up from soaking into the pillow.  It washes very easily.  I'd skip buying the other Boppy slipcovers (I got one as a gift and it's really cute) since they are really just for looks and not so much for protecting the pricey pillow.
You'll want this the first time a diaper leaks while baby is on the Boppy.  Rather than having to wash the Boppy pillow, just peel the protective cover and throw that in the wash.  Much easier!  Easy to put on, easy to take off.  Great as a layer beneath the colorful selection of Boppy covers available on the market.
Cannot live without this pillow. It fits around your waist for perfect height for feeding. Whomever designed this deserves an award.
This cover is a super soft white fabric that feels nice against baby's delicate skin. I got the most adorable cover for my son, but it started looking junky after some spit up, etc.  The water resistant look fine after more wear, and they also wash well.
I bought this to put under my boppy cover so when there was spit-up, spilled formula, or drool on my boppy cover I would not have to worry about cleaning my the whole boppy, too. It did exactly what I bought it for. I would definitely recommend it.
This cover makes life so much easier when baby has a major spit up while taking a bottle.  Instead of having to worry about stains or issues with the pillow itself, I just have to strip the outer cover, make sure the waterproof cover is dry and then replace the outer cover.  Keeps the underlying pillow from getting smelly or mildewy from baby wetness on either end!
Glad they made a protective cover. Will help keep the pillow clean through all the mishaps of a baby's life!
I've used this product for about 4 months now.The cover is great, I've washed it probably about 20 times so far, and there is no pilling or wear whatsoever.I've tested it by drippling some water from a water bottle onto it, and it does not soak through. It is very water resistant.It keeps our boppy protected from breast milk leakage, baby spit-up, and drool.We use the cover underneath of the regular boppy cover, although it is soft enough to use as a cover itself, and we have done so on occasion. It fits perfectly underneath of the boppy cover also.My daughter has used this quite often for tummy time.We are now starting to use it for helping her learn how to sit up.If you have a boppy, I would consider this waterproof cover a must.
pillow is not 100% water resistant.  It still get wet and has to wait for it to dry.  I thought it was some plastic material, but it's not.
This cover is not water protective in the least.  I am very disappointed.  Had a minor spill and had to wash the boppy.  Not good.
Let's face it, baby's are messy.  Breast milk, spit up, poop, etc.  Protect your boppy by getting this. I put it on over my pink boppy so I could use it for my boy, and then put a custom made decorative cover over it.  Love it!
This is soft enough to use on it's own as a cover.  As such it's one of the most inexpensive covers you can buy for the Boppy.  Unfortunately it only provides slightly more protection then a regular Boppy cover.  It takes a little bit longer for the pee/poop/spit-up to get through but it will still get through unless you change the cover within a few minutes of the time your baby pees/poops/spits-up on it.If you really want to stop liquid from getting through to your Boppy I would recommend putting a large waterproof lap pad over the Boppy.  This is much more effective at stopping liquid and it also makes clean-up a lot easier because you don't have to hassle with getting the cover on/off the Boppy.
nice to have in the event of spit ups, which are inevitable. Makes it a bit harder to put a cover on, but worth the hassle.
I love my Boppy for nursing, and I ordered this cover to keep from having to wash it too frequently.  I have already washed the cotton decorative covers a couple of times and this water resistant cover definitely kept the pillow from getting dirty.  The only complaint I have is that this product is REALLY tight around the Boppy, so that the cotton covers fit really baggy around it.  I'm quite petite, so I haven't had a problem stretching the Boppy around me to nurse, but this protective cover does limit the stretchiness of the Boppy.
This cover is not as thick or water resistant as I hoped it would be. Our boy managed to poop through both covers the first day we got this. I would have preferred if the material was water proof to prevent stuff from getting to the boppy. Instead use a hand towel which will be a little thicker and absorb more than this thin slipcover.
I had a Boppy pillow for my first daughter, who had GERD & was constantly spitting up large amounts of milk. They didn't have these back then, and I really wish they had because I could've tested their water-proofness then. I bought two of these to use for our newborn daughter, who is coincidentally not a spitter. I haven't washed them that many times as I haven't needed too, but they seemed to hold up just fine in the wash, following the directions on the tag. I still put a regular Boppy slipcover over this water-resistant one. Overall a good purchase, and a must if your baby spits up a lot. Just wish they sold them in packs of two.
i have two for both my boppy's. these covers have saved the pillows from being continually saturated with breast milk.
The title says it all. I have a spitter...and we go through LOTS of laundry. this has saved the pillow on multiple occasions and therefore just required me to wash the cover! A great gift idea too.
This was one of the best purchases I made - Got sick of having to wash my boppy when the baby would throw up all over it.  This thing saved the pillow and my sanity more than once!
I would highly recommend this! It protects the pillow well from stains and spit up. I have two of them in case I need to wash one but the pillow underneath has always remained dry.
I received one protective cover from my Amazon baby registry upon my daughter's birth in August 2010 and bought another in December 2010.  I'm still using both of them as of November 2011.Both covers have been extremely durable despite constant weekly to bi-weekly alternating use under another Boppy cover, occasional use as the sole cover, and me shoving a Boppy pillow into them with force while I'm trying to finish the laundry and my daughter is screaming for neh.  Zippers of lesser items costing much more have self-destructed under far less stress.  It even stays white and the fabric stays fresh in all those regular washes.  Sometimes this cover can even be wipe-clean.Inevitably in the last fourteen months I've had ample opportunity to test out its water resistance.  There has been urine, some poop leakage, spit-up, bottles of water (oops), ice cream (oops again), snot (that one's not me), neh, and all manner of other liquids.  While many have penetrated the top \"decorative\" Boppy cover and ended up on the protective cover, none have appeared on my Boppy pillow.Please note that this product is not water *proof*, it is water *resistant*.  It will prevent minor spillages from getting through completely (eg the previously mentioned ice cream or small amounts of the rest).  But for major spillages (eg diaper blowouts, vomit,) you get at least a few to about fifteen minutes to dab with a paper towel and/or remove the Boppy cover prior to the liquid working its way down to the pillow.  Plus who doesn't want (or need) to change the covers quickly after a major liquid incident?Dirtying of the pillow would be almost instant with even a minor accident of mother or baby sans this protective cover.  5 stars is not enough.
It protects the Boppy from milk and diaper leaks, which are bound to happen in the nursing game! It's a must-have.
I put this on under the 'cute' cover I have for my boppy.  My son spits up a lot after eating and this has saved our boppy pillow.  If you plan on having more than one child this item is worth buying to save your boppy for future use.
As you can imagine babies are messy, so in order to save our boppy we invested in a protective cover & boy am I glad we did.
I was hoping this would help protect my Boppy pillow but it doesn't. My baby spits up a lot and it goes right through this protector. It's water resistant but not waterproof which is no help.
This is a necessity....period!
Must have this if you own a boppy and plan on actually using it with your baby! Babies are messy and they sure do spit up, spill and generally make a bit of a mess when eating or even just lying around. This will keep your boppy fresh as a daisy!
I bought this to go over my bare naked boppy. Without it my Boppy pillw would constantly need to be washed. My daughter is always spitting up or drooling on it. All I have to do is wash the cover. I have a few spares so I just take one off and wipe off the water resistant cover and put on a new cover. Very helpful!
I wish I would have known about this sooner. This works amazing for keeping spills, spit ups and what not on the boppy. It fits wonderfully over the boppy.
This was a baby shower gift. The mom to be requested this item. I wish this was available when I had my little one...
sometimes milk runs down my baby's face while eating & drips onto the cover. with this water proof cover, i dont have to worry about ruining the actual pillow. i can simply take this & the top cover off & wash them in the washing machine & put them both right back on. super easy & convenient
I picked this protective cover to place under the slip cover that came with the Boppy pillow (Boppy Pillow with Slipcover, Lots O Dots) I picked up. While it isn't made to be submerged into a tank of water, it does work when spit-ups, spills, and etc. happen during feedings.
The cover is exactly what it says, water-proof, I have a 1 week old son and he spills and leaks things all the time, the cover so far has been resistant to practically anything i can spill on it. I also enjoy the fact that the cover sits very snugly over the pillow, this eliminates loose corners or loose fabric that can get caught or bundled, but it makes the cover somewhat difficult to get on the pillow.
Good product.  Here is why:- Fits the boppy snuggly- Water resistant- Soft fabric- Love the flap over the zipperI have owned this cover for about 3 months and so far, I don't have any complaints.
So far this slip cover has held up well in the washer and dryer, and it does seem to be water resistant.  When it's gotten wet from milk (or pee once), we've gotten the cover and the slipcover off quickly, and the slipcover did keep the underlying pillow dry. If we'd been slower to take the covers off, I'm not sure how long it would have worked, though.  Anyway, this was worth the money, in my opinion, to keep the Boppy pillow from getting dirty or stained.
Fantastic!  I just love this pillow. I was taking my 10 month old on a 8 hour plane trip and he was going to spend the whole time on my lap. I was nervous about the two of us being comfortable, but this pillow was outstanding.  It's very easy and quick to inflate - about three good puffs is all it needs.  The other reviews mention it as well - don't fully inflate the pillow because cabin pressure will do that for you.  The back rest was terrific and it rolled up nicely when I needed to put it away.  This worked out great for several long train rides as well.  I washed the cover after a spit-up incident and it dried quickly in the hotel room.
I was tired of lugging my Boppy around in the trunk when I knew I needed to feed my daughter on the go.  With my first daughter I just &#34;made do&#34;.  Often I tried to hold my daughter up on the diaper bag.  It was always hard for both of us.  I knew I needed a better solution for traveling.I saw that Boppy made a travel pillow so I immediately began purchasing one.  But then I realized did some research & saw this pillow.  The comparison between the two show how different this pillow is:-the Boppy travel pillow is big!  it has it's own strap & has to be carried like a messenger bag (or another diaper bag!)  I have easily deflated & repacked this pillow into it's original bag-the Boppy travel pillow is SO expensive!  the My Brest Friend travel pillow is less than half as expensive!-the Boppy travel pillow is very thin.  I watched a review online that said it is not very firm, but that's because it needs to be able to fold in half.  this pillow is the same size as the regular My Brest Friend pillow.  because you inflate it, it is firm.-AND, most importantly, this pillow works SO much better than a Boppy!  I didn't realize what I was missing!  This pillow holds my daughter up higher & this allows us to both be more comfortable.  The positioning is better.  She doesn't fall into the dip by my chest & the pillow sits in exactly the correct position.  I am constantly pulling & pushing & re-positioning both my daughter & I when I use a Boppy.  I began using this & I can have both of my hands free while nursing!After using this pillow for 2 days while on a quick visit to my parent's house, I immediately bought a regular &#34;My Brest Friend&#34; pillow.  I am a convert!  I will buy a My Brest Friend Pillow for everyone pregnant friend I have!Changing breastfeeding...one pillow at a time!
It really stays snug against you and places the baby in a great position. MUCH better than just using a regular pillow. I don't know how I could have done without it - well I probably could have but my arms would be much more tired.
I am a man so I am obviously not the one using this product. I ordered this for my wife because on our first trip away from home, she just looked really uncomfortable trying to use pillows as a replacement for the Boppy that she usually uses at home. It's inflatable so it's easy to pack up and doesn't take up too much space.Our first inflatable My Brest Friend actually got a hole after a few weeks of use. It comes with a patch kit but our hole was in the seam so it wasn't possible to patch it. We contacted the manufacturer about the problem and they immediately sent out a new one free of charge! Amazing customer service. We have not had a problem with our replacement so far.
I ordered this pillow for the 7 hr plane ride(s). I already own the original Brest friend pillow and initially wanted to take it on board but then ran across its inflateable version and decided to give it a try. I am glad I did!It inflates in just a minute. I booked aisle seats and after everyone boarded inflated it in the aisle, and yes, people looked and guessed what it was! I first tried it at home to make sure it doesnt leak air, and when it was half inflated I put in in its cover where it stays now. By doing that, I avoided hassle of putting the cover on on board. The whole thing easily fit back into its original little bag it arrived it.Make sure you leave room for air to expand when the plane takes off. I figured that when the back part of the pillow that supports your back is soft, it is just enough. After take off, the pillow becomes hard just as the &#34;real&#34; one.One more note. It does NOT fit in the seat all the way! I first flew with a lady next to me who did not mind lifting the handle between our seats. On the way back people didnot want to do it, so I had to position it the way so it could stick out in the aisle. Much pain, because people were not watching and kept hitting it when passing by.
I held off on buying this but I should have bought it sooner!  Traveling with a baby you bring so much stuff that bringing a full size nursing pillow was just not feasible.  I can fit this in my diaper bag & inflate it really quickly anywhere I am.  I also like how the nozzle to inflate is right by the start of the zipper so I can leave the cover on to inflate and deflate.  It had the pocket like the regular My Brest Friend too.
I bought this to travel with, as it obviously takes up far less room than the regular pillow when deflated. I'm very happy I did. It functions just like the regular pillow and is very quick to blow up and deflate.
I ended up returning mine because it just would not stay inflated and when it was deflated it only a took up slightly less room in my stroller basket than just bringing my kushies nursing pillow (my go to favorite for newborns). For an inflatable pillow, I also don't think the wrap aspect is that great. Just the front part of the pillow is all that is necessary.
I've heard a lot of good things about this pillow.  I wanted this inflatable travel version bc of it's portability.  It took longer than I expected to inflate, and then had a hole in it!  Wasn't able to properly test it out bc of the hole and I returned it.  In the meantime, I also purchased a regular version (not from Amazon).  It's very stable and solid, and so far, I really like it.
Awesome travel nursing pillow.  I use the regular version at home but this is awesome as a packable backup version.  Very quickly inflates/deflates.  Takes up very little room in the suitcase.  Great for making mom/baby comfortable in our nursing routine while on vacation.
I bought this for a visit to my mom's house and it worked perfectly for the whole 10 days.  It does seem to leak some air, but it doesn't deflate while you're nursing or anything, and maintains a shape that is true to the real Brest Friend pillow - and it includes a patch to plug up a hole. Also, you can blow it up with your mouth really easily- it has two types of blow-holes.
We bought this to use during our trip to Japan.It works just as well as the large Brest Friend pillow-  and I can inflate it with somewhere around 10 lungfuls of air-  it seems quick anyhow, and I don't get the prickly soreness in the jaw you get from overdoing an inflation.My one big gripe is with the back support section.  It's a separate pillow with what seems like two TINY holes joining it to the main body.What happens is, it slowly inflates from pressure in the pillow, but when it comes time to deflate, you have to squeeze the living crap out of it to push the air into the main body to deflate all of it.I thought of using a pin to enlarge the fill/drain hole, but figured it's not worth potentially destroying the pillow.It even includes a patch kit, but it seems plenty durable as it is- no issues with two plane trips, a couple car rides, and being kicked about the baby room.
I love my regular brest friend and I love this travel pillow too!  Its still a little bulky deflated but still fits at the top of the diaper bag.  I love to keep it in the car for on the go feedings.  It was a life saver on the plane as well.  I wouldn't recommend it in place of the regular brest friend, but its a real must have for anytime I'm out with my son.
This is a really well designed product. It is travel friendly and doesn't take too long to blow up. There is a plug with a one way valve to blow it up that last little bit. It really saves the back and arm and my baby seems to be comfy. The only negative is that the cover is a pain to get on. However, u can just leave it on when u deflate for travel. I am using the word, travel, lightly. I mean u can throw it in the diaper bag for shopping trips.
Since I am totally dependent on my brest friend for feeding, and hate having to prop baby on pillows when I am am at someone else's home, i think this is a good purchase.  It works almost as well as the regular one.  my only complaint is that i think it's a bit too big to blow up by mouth so you really need a foot pump or something which makes it not so easy to deflate and inflate all the time.  I just leave it inflated which makes it less compact but still as light.  but you couldn't stuff it in a luggage that way.  if you know you are going somewhere where there will be a pump, then it's great.  Otherwise, just leave it inflated if you are traveling by car.
This worked perfect on the plane and worked well to travel with . very quick inflate & compact for travel ..
Great for traveling.  We took this pillow on a couple of international trips.  It saved my wife's back having this support on the airplane for nursing.  The back support was a bit awkward on the airplane because it takes up so much room but it worked out fine.  It folds up really small.  The inlet for the air isn't in the most convenient place.  It would be nice if you could inflate/deflate with out having to unzip the cover.  My wife didn't find it as supportive or convenient as the boppy for at home use.
For the four months I breast fed, this was my constant companion.  I didn't even discover this product until a few weeks in when my Boppy was taking up this massive amount of space when I had to be on the go (which was constantly due to my older daughter).Awesome features:  This pillow has a dual plug-thingo that allows you to quickly and EASILY blow it up without having to worry about the air leaking out between blows.  Trust me, it's really cool.  Then, you can pull that entire mechanism out of the plug area to leave this great big gaping hole to allow it to quickly and easily deflate.  While this is not as cushy as a Boppy, it's a fantastic nursing and general support pillow.  The cover even has a built-in pocket to hold things like pacifiers, cellphones, etc.  You can remove the cover and launder easily enough.  There's a strap that goes along your back (which is part of the inflated bit) that clips into the front of the pillow.  This allows for great support and solid positioning.  Even if your baby has reflux and you have to feed at an incline, you can make an adjustment with this pillow.Personally, I think they should add padded covers!  If this thing was more cushy, it would have replaced my Boppy completely!  When I got mine from Amazon, it was $20.  It was a great price to start with and definitely worth every penny.There was another review online that gave a great tip:  If you ever need to put the cover back on the pillow, let the pillow be semi-inflated (maybe 70%) so that it's easier to slide the cover back on without popping a seam by trying to stretch it over a fully-inflated pillow.
I'm so sorry I waited so long to buy this ! My daughter is 8 months old and because we're planning on traveling internationally in the next few weeks, I decided to buy this after a friend recommended the &#34;normal&#34; brest friend. It is very easy to blow up and makes breast feeding so much easier and agreeable for both my daughter and myself. It's a great buy !
It is a good idea, but it is too hard and difficult to fit it around waist, i am size 8.
I purchased the original Brest Friend pillow...(which I would give 10 out of 5 stars by the way).  I was unable to use my original one for a few days, and ended up with extremely sore nipples, and was ready to stop nursing!  Reminded me of the early days before I bought the first pillow.I purchased the travel pillow as a back up, and for traveling on very long flights.OMG, it's just as good as the original !  Easy to use, easy to carry, just love it. Extremely easy to fill up.  Takes less than a minute.  You definitely don't need a pump!Makes breast feeding so much more enjoyable.  Great price too!Update 16 June 2013:  I just traveled from the East Coast of the U.S. to Northern Africa.  I was able to use the pillow in the airport terminal, but unable to use it on the plane.  The seats were just not wide enough to support the pillow.  I had an empty seat next to me, but it still did not work out.I am still extremely pleased with the pillow, and may like it better than the original pillow! I keep one in the baby's room, and one in the living room.I would recommend this to any new mothers who are breast feeding, and want to enjoy it. I'd also suggest you take it (or the original) with you to the hospital.  Regular pillows just don't get the job done without a lot of discomfort!
I picked one of these up for an upcoming vacation. Overall, it is very much like the regular foam Brest Friend - same size and thickness. It will fit great in your other covers. It was supportive and my baby didn't seem to notice any difference. It's very light and compresses into a very small space. However, blowing it up was not like blowing up a beach ball. Manipulating the air valve so I could blow into it was challenging. It took a bit of blowing to get it inflated. I can't imagine doing this on a plane! With a cranky baby
i was hoping to take this with me as wel travel but when i received the product I realized that you need a special pump to inflate which defeats the \"portability\" of it.  was excited to have a portable solution and was disappointed.
Used a total of 2 times (each time it was used for a week when we were travelling).  Basically used this for 2 weeks (and not 2 weeks straight.  there was a space of 2 months between each usage).  After many months of not being used (carefully packed in the zippered bag it came in), I discovered a small hole along one of the seams. Tried using the repair kit it came with; doesn't work.  Contacting Zenoff Products to see if they can do anything about it.Two stars (rather than one star) since when it was working, it was great! My baby slept on it for a few hours while on the plane and was really comfy.  it saved my arm from getting sore since I could put her on the pillow.However, I feel that it is a waste of money since it only had a lifespan of 2 weeks.  the Boppy travel pillow seems like a better product
We are planning our first vacation away from home with our 4 month old & I really wanted to be able to bring my Boppy, but it just isn't feasible.  Having this inflatable substitute is going to come in very handy.  It's the same shape as the regular Brest Friend pillow.  It was super fast to inflate - probably took me less than 10 deep breaths to do it.  The cover is cute - green with a paisley pattern.  Overall, I'm very pleased.
I absolutely love my Breast Friend pillow, so was really excited to find this travel version which i will be using for a forthcoming trip home to England.
I bought this to use while traveling and it's been just as described. It has been used on a plane, in a car, sitting in chairs and on beds. I'd buy this again since it only takes a few moments to blow up and 30 seconds to deflate. This is especially useful since I have a larger baby. I don't know what I'd do without it since we're constantly on the go and travel frequently.
I bought this for a two-week trip with my 3 month old, thinking I really can't breastfeed without my pillow! I have the regular deluxe brestfriend and absolutely love it, I've used it for 2 kids now. Was excited to use this, as it gets pretty small, about the size/volume of a couple folded up tshirts for both the inflatable part and cover.  And it looked just like my regular brestfriend.On first use, it didn't inflate. Terrible! I'd just come off the plane, was engorged, and couldn't get this thing inflated as there was a leak somewhere. Later, I submerged it in the bathtub to find the leak, and I found a tiny little pinhole. Luckily, this comes with a repair patch so I fixed it up no problem. But still made for an annoying first use and I didn't have peace of mind knowing this thing was more fragile than I thought.Overall, annoying pillow, including the puncture and fact that I needed to reinflate it every night as it slowly loses air (like many other inflatable items). I'd get a different travel pillow if there were a better one out there, haven't found it yet and this will do I guess until then. It is definitely a reasonable price.Comparison to regular my Brestfriend (deluxe version):* Similar size and shape. Has the head \"bumps\", portion that goes around the waist, with the higher back height, buckle.* Does not feel as stable as the regular version.* Seems well constructed, actually clever in the various air walls they engineered to match the shape of the original. BUT, plastic is easily torn or punctured as I experienced.* Cotton fabric, pretty thin but decent.* Cover has zipper and loop enclosure to lock the zipper strap. Also has the little pocket as well.* The valve is located at the bottom - it's very easy to inflate (if yours doesn't leak), it took me less than a minute. And to deflate it's REALLY easy, as it's a two-stage valve. First stage is like a regular valve on an inflatable where you blow into; second is a very large hole to deflate it quickly. You just pull the end of the valve to pop out the first stage.* You'll have to reinflate every day if you like the pillow firm like I do; it leaks slowly even with all punctures repaired. A bit annoying.My advice: keep the inflatable part in a heavy duty ziplock gallon bag in your suitcase to protect against small punctures or rips, and make sure to bring the included repair patch!
An invaluable item for travel, saved me during a 10 day trip with my 6 month old. I suppose I could have fed him without it but wouldn't have been nearly as comfortable. Some reviews mention leaks but I haven't had any issues with it. Once deflated I store it in the cover to keep it protected.
Cumbersome. Not convenient. A waste of money. I returned this item. Invest in a travel Boppy (not a blow-up one). You'll be glad you did.
This portable pillow is going to come in so handy for my kids when they are out and about with their new baby!  Compact when deflated, it fits in the diaper bag perfectly!
When my newborn arrived, the boppy didn't have an adapter so he kept rolling inwards, rendering it useless. After visiting an LC that had a Brest Friend, I purchased the travel version instead of the full version. And, it was perfect. The plastic inside was helpful when he had a spit-up, because I could just strip the cover, wipe down the inside, and voila, clean. When we traveled, I deflated it and packed it in the case. I was very glad not to have the 'full' version and when he is weaned, I can just pack it up without much space taken up.The downside is, the back part is a little unwiedly and I didn't find it super supportive, so I just flapped it off to the side. Also the strap is kind of unnecessary--you don't really need to lock yourself into the pillow--so it just ends up banging around, especially at night.
My daughter (4 months old) loves feeding with the Brest Friend pillows (only downside being that she is so comfortable that she frequently dozes off during her feeding but that can be a good thing when it is time for bed).But the pillows are big and cumbersome to take places.  This travel version was a great find and it is now on our third trip. Particularly good for being able to bring on a plane and inflate after we're seated. For that scenario, I recommend sitting next to your husband/partner because the pillow spills over on to the armrest and strangers might be annoyed.Also, for when we aren't traveling, it is useful that the cover on this fits our other (deluxe) pillow. I can use this cover when the other one is in the wash.
It did say sunburst and had different picture shown. amazon sent me a replacement of a same wrong product so i gave up with hassle of sending it back and kept it. I am not sure if it works since i havent had the baby but looks sturdy enough. I am planning on using it every day use. Definetly better quality than boppy pillows and priced better for sure.
This &#34;pillow&#34; is amazing!!!! I own the foam one and this one, and trust me this is as travel friendly as you can get. You fold it and put it in its little pouch. I take it everywhere. It is the same size as the traditional one. I got the boppy travel but exchanged it for this one. I take it with me everywhere and inflate it with my lungs. Takes 30 seconds. Some reviewers say that you need an air pump to inflate it. NOT TRUE, you can inflate it with your mouth where the pump will go.The only recommendation I give is that once you open it let it air for a few days because it comes with that plastic smell. It goes away. The cover is similar to the one in the traditional pillow.Definitely a must have if you like to travel and enjoy the convenience of these type of pillows.
The breast friend is the best nursing pillow. I like the fact that you can adjust it, the pockets for keeping nursing pads or ointment, and that the cover is washable. It is a must for nursing moms.
I like this pillow. I use it for night feedings - I sit just on the side of the bed for those.My baby is 12lbs at 1 month and it supports him fine - no bad slanting, he feels secure on it. I like that it straps on - a must for my night nursing position! (In the day, I sit in a recliner with a pillow on my lap).I don't like the 'back support,' it is very uncomfortable for me, so I never use this when I am sitting somewhere with a back. That might be a size issue as I'm probably a size 16 or so and it doesn't look like it's made to wrap around me ;) It does, though! With plenty of room.My only actual complaint, though, is the velcro. I am either topless or pulling up my shirt to nurse, so the velcro touches my side - very unpleasant!Also, I do agree that it should have a water proof something. It's going to be saturated with milk, if nothing else. Seems illogical. Washed the cover, though, and it went on easily after.
This product helped me so much in getting my breastfeeding established.  The first time I used it was when meeting with my lactation consultant.  It helped me build the confidence I needed to continue trying to breastfeed.  This product is pretty firm, much like a baby mattress is, and the cover is very soft.  I like that it has a sort of snap closure so if your baby is was like mine and would doze off while nursing, I could take it off pretty quietly and lay him in bed without using the velcro.  My only concern would be if your baby is prone to spit up, you might want to make sure to keep a cloth handy or something because the fabric isn't waterproof and it would soak into the &#34;pillow&#34; underneath.  The professional model has a waterproof cover.  It does have a decent size little pocket where you can keep a little cloth or something. In hindsight, i feel like this was a splurge.  After about a month I had the positioning down and really didn't need the pillow anymore, especially since the little man was growing.
I received this and a Boppy at my baby shower. Wasn't sure which one I would like more, but as it turns out I am glad that I received and kept both of them. This one worked better for breastfeeding because it was harder and kept it shape better while the baby was on it; whereas the Boppy seemed to shift and sink in the middle. The Boppy is great because as the baby grows, she can use it to help her sit up, tummy time, and use as a pillow (when she is MUCH older).
very confortable and usefull, just as described, my girlfriend loves it, sh is able to do all kind of stuff with her hands while feeding our baby
My wife had this and a boppy.  She says this would work fine, but that the boppy offers more easy of use.  Having to unstrap this pillow everytime makes it diffcult. The pillow does offer good support and has nice little storage pouch.  Overall the quality is good and the design is ok.
This is a pillow that helps with breastfeeding.  The pockets are handy for keeping all of the little devices you might need with a baby.  I also use it to hold my baby, it is very comfortable and helps carry the weight of the baby and gives your arms a rest. The major competitor is the Boppy, and from what I have read most people prefer this.  Also, I used to have a boppy and we did not use it much. This one we use. The problem with it is that it doesn't follow us around, and if you hold your baby in different rooms then you need to bring this with you, or you are without it.  Also, the Boppy is everywhere and there are lots of different covers for it.  This one is harder to find with less accessories.  But I think it works better.
Experienced or not, this makes nursing easier. My wife loves the versatility it gives her with nursing the baby. It also serves a platform to hold the baby while performing other tasks, especially at the newborn - young infant stage.Recommended.
Wouldn't really consider myself truly plus size but I guess I am.  I'm a size 14 and this just didn't fit well.  I wanted to love it bc if it fit it would have worked and been so much more comfortable than the bobby that I'm stuck with but it just didn't fit.  I couldn't see spending the $50+ on the twin model that says it fits plus sizes so I just went with a bobby which I really don't love but have no choice.
The back support on this nursing pillow is awesome. I used this with my daughter until she became too big for it and I could literally be hands free nursing her on this in the nursing chair, doing stuff on my laptop on the bed table. I found it to be much more comfortable and stable than a boppy pillow.
I had the famous Boppy and just couldn't figure out what the hype was all about. My back hurt since i was hunching over the boppy to reach my little one and it 
Does position the baby well. My lo got too comfy & would just fall asleep. Also if you let the baby get used to a nursing pillow its just one more thing to lug around. I used it while in the hospital to learn positioning, but have not touched it since.
I put this item on the must-have list for any new mom who is planning to breastfeed. I am a first-time mom who had a C-section. I didn't use this pillow right after my surgery thinking it might put unnecessary stress on my incision. BUT when I did start using 2-3 weeks after my baby was born, I discovered that this is indespensible. It fits perfectly around my waist. It is adjustable so you can fit it accordingly. It provides very good back support and is so firm that it provides good support for the baby and you. It is easy to feed both football style and cradle style using this pillow. The fabric quality is pretty alright. It remained the same after a few washes to date. I use the little pocket to store washcloths and scissors to cut my baby's nails aftre she falls asleep after a feed!I highly recommend this. And according to my friends, this is much better than the boppy because it wraps around and provides much better back support. Remember it is important not to lean towards the baby while breastfeeding - that's really not good for your back.
I am nursing my fourth baby girl, and with the other three I didn't have one of these.  I honestly don't know how I got by with just couch pillows!  This nursing pillow positions baby perfectly, and it's very comfortable!  I especially love the chocolate colored slipcover, which I've already run through the wash and the color hasn't faded a bit!
I really liked this because I used it right away when my baby was born, it is great for newborn babies! not so for when they are a bit older
I have already been nursing for 3 months and I am still having a difficult time with my daughter being able to latch.  I tried just about everything out there to help with nursing.  I tried the Boppy, but my daughter would fall into the hole in the middle which made it difficult to line her head up appropriately for nursing.  The Boppy also squished together a lot and over time I know it would not hold up.  Also, I had to be very careful while using the Boppy because she could easier roll off of it.I also tried a foam c shaped pillow by Kushies and that didn't allow her head to line up either because I had to put burp cloths under her head to lift it higher.My Brest Friend works the best because it has two bumps (one on each side) on the top of the pillow that line up with each breast.  These bumps lift her head up perfectly and help align her with my breast.  Also, the top of the pillow has a lot of surface area and so I know I will be able to use this even when she is over a year old.  Next, it has a nice back support pillow. In addition, I like the feel of the fabric and the little pocket.I only gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because I always have to put a small pillow or blanket under it in order to lift the pillow up to the appropriate height.
This is the perfect breastfeeding pillow for an active mom. I can walk around, fold clothes, and even get up to mix something on the stove. (very carefully and I turn to the side so the baby is away from the heat i might add) Love love love...
I love this nursing pillow. I had a boppy pillow (which I like to use for my little man especially when's he's bigger and can sit up) but it didn't work at all for me. I had to add like 10 extra pillows just to make it kind of work. This nursing pillow is perfect. I can use it without any additional pillows (sometimes just a blanket to help create a bit of an incline). I take it with me everywhere - parents house, friends house, out shopping. It is great. So far has held up through severa washigs. My only concern is if to much milk gets on the pillow itself if it will get ruined but so far no problems.
Pros:1. The latch on this is really helpful.  I can strap it on, pick up baby, and settle down to nurse without having to arrange a bunch of pillows.  When I have to move to reposition or reach for something I can do so without disturbing Baby.2.  The back support is great.  I have back problems and sitting can be really uncomfortable.  This makes sitting in a rocker or couch comfortable, which is wonderful since I spend a lot of time sitting and nursing.3.  The pocket is really handy--I can always have breast cream, breast pads, or a binky in reach.4.  The foam is nice and firm to support Baby.5.  The strap is long enough to fit both me and my husband easily (he'll use it sometimes to support Baby when he's holding him for long periods of time).6.  The cover is removable and washable.  I washed it and air dried it and had no problems getting it back on.  It also dried surprisingly fast--it was dry by the next time I nursed.Cons:1.  The foam on the side where it latches isn't very wide (see the picture).  If you like nursing with the \"football hold\" it won't be wide enough on that side to support Baby.2.  The bumps seem a little pointless to me; they aren't in the right spot to support Baby's head.3.  The one thing that seems better about the Boppy is that you can use it to prop up Baby in a sitting position or for tummy time.  I might buy a Boppy just for that.4.  I wish it had a waterproof cover.5.  It would be nice if this was a little thicker and had a wedge shape to keep Baby close to your body.  I prop another thin pillow under it to get Baby in the right position.While it could be better, this is still one of my favorite baby products.  Nursing is such a big part of your life with a newborn, and anything that makes it easier is wonderful.
In general, this is an excellent sippy bottle with several important features:1. The bottle is metal, the ring is metal, the nipple and lid are silicone. This is particularly comforting if you are trying to get rid of plastic bottles and parts. The metal pieces go through the dishwasher nicely and the nipple and lid are very easy to hand wash (though we often put the lids in the dishwasher as well).2. The entire unit is durable. Even the small flap on the nipple has held up well in many months of use by our twin toddlers. I consider that a resounding success. We have also experienced no dents or other physical deformities in the parts.3. This bottle is easy to use. It fits perfectly into our kids hands, is not overly slick (unless, of course, they 'slime' it up with some food), and is easy to assemble and disassemble.I have a couple of caveats, however. I do not like that they paint began peeling off soon after we got the bottles (we also have the green one, and the behavior is the same). There is no paint on the inside, so ingestion via liquid is not the primary concern, but we do worry that our kids will 'pick' at the peeling areas and that chips might end up being consumed. The other 'concern' is likely conditional on how active your kids are with their bottles. The nipple design of this bottle is quite simple, but this means that if they flip the bottle upside down and 'bounce' the nipple on the table/a tray, it leaks profusely. If your kids are not so aggressive with their bottles this will not be a concern, but be aware that you might need to clean up a bit more than with a bottle with a hard nipple!All in all, this is an excellent bottle and our entire family loves them.
In an attempt to go plastic-free, I did tons of research online about what sippy cup to start my daughter out on, she is 6 months. Finding this one was great! It's stylish, high quality, no plastic, durable and amazon was the only dealer that did not have it out of stock, so I was able to order it and get it in the mail quickly.
Im on my second kiddo and have used many Sippy cups.  This one is the best for many reasons.Love the silicone mouth piece.  After boiling in water it no longer had chemical smell on it.  It also was softer and more manageable.  My son is 13 months and has been breastfeeding since birth and prefers this spout to bottle nipples.  He has been able to drink water effortlessly and also enjoys chewing on it for teething.The stainless steel keeps his water cool.  It's 11 ounces so carries enough for long outings.  I fill it less when we are home some can carry it.  I haven't had it in the hot sun yet, but I'm hoping it doesn't get too hot.  I will update when I know.We have had no leakage or spilling.  The cap is twist on and off.  There are no extra plugs, just the top nozzle.  I've tried it, it's tough tigger water through, but again my baby does it effortlessly.Cleaning is easy. I either throw it in with dishes using hot soapy water or I've thrown it in the dishwasher. Every now and then I book the silicone top to make sure it's sanitized.  I like that it's not plastic!  It's so much softer and bendy.Overall great Sippy cup and the only one we use anymore.
I really wanted to love this bottle.  There aren't a ton of choices out there in stainless steel, and this is the cutest of all the options I've seen.  The bottle itself is okay -- it could be better, but it gets the job done.BUT...- The paint chipped pretty quickly/easily, and I found green flecks on my baby's lips!!!  So if you go with this bottle, I highly suggest getting the plain silver finish instead of the fun colors.- The nipple ring sliced my hand open.  If you look closely at the ring in the picture, you can see how the bottom edge curls up and inward.  Well, it doesn't curl inward enough, and that inside edge is kind of sharp.  I screwed it on a little too tight, and sliced my hand open trying to unscrew it.  Now, I was exerting a lot of pressure (far more than a baby would be able to), so I don't think it's dangerous for the kiddos, but I'm a lot more cautious when I put this thing together now.- The volume markings could be better.  Since you can't see through these bottles like you can glass, not having every ounce marked on the inside makes filling them a guessing game.  The 5oz bottle, for example, only has markings for 2 and 3 oz.  That said, a lot of the stainless steel bottles out there don't have ANY markings, so it's better than nothing.- The nipples/spouts are wicked fast.  The level 1 that came with the bottle is comparable to the level 3 nipples from all the other brands I tried.  The sippy-cup transition spout is NOT a sippy cup -- it's just a soft (pliable as a silicone nipple) spout shaped like a sippy cup.  Both the sippy spout and the level 1 nipples will drip (quickly and steadily) without any suction whatsoever.  My daughter (now 8 months) won't touch this with the sippy spout on.  The sizing is standard (wide-mouth), so it's easy to buy replacement parts...but should you have to??- The cap is a soft, fold-on/peel-off deal that is pretty annoying, difficult to put on, and gets dirty easily.  I'd much prefer a cap that is more rigid (so it stays on and keeps the nipple or spout from leaking) and snaps on/off.  Kleen Kanteen manages to do it, so I don't know why Pura can't.All in all, this is a good bottle if you avoid the painted finishes, replace the nipple/spout with another brand, are careful with the sharp edge on the ring, and don't mind not having a decent lid.  Seems like a lot of trouble to have to go to for the price, though.
I'm not sure what the other reviewers are talking about, but these bottles have worked perfectly for us. We haven't had any issues with paint chipping or with our little girl not liking to drink from them. Definitely try them out - we love them and wouldn't change a thing.
I love this bottle.  It vents as well as avent bottles, with no complicated valve pieces.  It's the only bottle I know of with no plastic whatsoever.  I know a lot of bottles are BPA, PVC, and phthalate free, but it wasn't so long ago that we didn't realize those chemicals were a problem.  So, who knows what else is in the plastics we now think are safe, but really aren't.The downsides to this bottle are that your baby/toddler can poke the nipple into the bottle, and then it leaks everywhere.  It's also tall and skinny, which means little hands can grip it, but it's also a little unwieldy, although my 14 month old is starting to have an easier time with it.It does work with the avent sippy spouts, but those of course introduce plastic.  I wish that Pura offered different plastic free spouts for older babies.  My daughter loves the silicone toddler spout, but I worry that it's just a glorified bottle nipple.  Maybe a harder silicone spout that just sort of slows the flow would be good.
I've been trying to contribute as least as possible to the \"pacific garbage patch\" so I'm on a quest to stop buying plastic.  This has proved very tricky with respect to baby items so I was very pleased to find this item available.  The bottle is great, it works well and our son really likes it.  I bought one in green and blue.
I have 4 different brands of stainless steel sippy cups & this is by far my favorite!! I use the Avent sippy spouts but the other ones fit well too, it's just I needed a hard spout that wouldn't leak b/c my son likes to tip his cup over to force milk out of it...definitely recommend this cup!
I love these bottles! When I found out we were having another child I was on a mission to be plastic free. I researched and I found this bottle, klean Kanteen, and Lifefactory. But, I didn't like the idea of giving a glass bottle to a baby when they get old enough to hold it by themselves. So then it was down to Klean Kanteen and Pura. I picked Pura because it can go to newborn to toddler with one bottle and had different nipple options. No more buying plastic sippies. I took the advice of other reviewers and got different nipples right away, we got MAM. Other advice, get the sleeves to go with they are really nice to have.And as far as leaking goes, just make sure that the you screw it together really tight and you won't have a problem with the 11 oz bottle. If you are thinking of getting the smaller 5 oz, we had problems with those w/ the MAM nipples, they were prone to leaking. The only thing I could see was a difference between the two... the 5 oz bottle, on the rim the steel has a brushed finish, the 11 oz is shiny. So if you are thinking you should get some 5 oz bottles too, just get these 11 oz and buy newborn nipples and save the fast nipples for later.And an added bonus, they just came out with sealing discs to make your babies bottle into a water bottle for later, or a snack container (which is what we will do for the 5 oz bottles we have). All and all I am glad I spend the money on these, I feel like I am really getting my moneys worth!
My daughter was about 13 months when I started trying to get her to use this as a sippy. She quickly discovered (in a department store!!!) that she can push the whole nipple into the bottle and dump all the milk out! I thought it may have been a fluke, or I screwed it on wrong, or maybe it was the sippy nipple so I tried a normal one...she continued to push it in and dump her (expensive, raw) milk out! Perhaps if you start it as a normal bottle with a smaller baby and transition to sippy they won't realize what it can do...but I can't recommend it.
The sippy spout is good unless you're sucking very hard - then it seems to kinda collapse and also baby got some air bubbles and was hiccuping.I do like that the spout interchangeable with ThinkBaby - we have those and I'll give those a try as well.Overall I prefer glass (more inert), however this stainless is better for travel and lighter for baby to hold up than glass.I have quite a few healthy drink holder options at home for him for different scenarios and needs.This a good option.  Not HG though.... sigh.
Love these. My child carries it all over and despite months of constant use, the color hasnt peeled off. My daughter is hard on these. I see that other people have had issues but that hasnt been the case for us.
My daughter use this everyday. We changed the nipple with an avent sippy spout. No leaks and she can hold it by her self because its skinny.
It's difficult to get it to vent properly and not leak. We use the mam nipples and get leaks pretty much every time but still use this bottle daily to stay away from plastic. Our bottle leaks from the bottom of the screw on ring. We have tried new nipples and it.did not help. It's not huge leaks just enough to be annoying and get everything sticky.
I am absolutely loving this bottle. I was so tired of having to replace plastic bottles over and over as the plastic broke down and they started to harbor bacteria and smells, I swear we must've gone through 50 bottles in 18mos (my daughter has a health condition that required her to have 8oz every 2 hours most of her first year- her bottles take a lot of abuse). I considered glass bottles but was concerned about my active toddler breaking them, and I could not find one glass bottle that someone had not complained about the ring not fitting well and/or cracking.This stainless bottle on the other hand, is a dream come true. Its crisp and clean, lightweight, easy to clean and never holds on to smells. My toddler also absolutely loves it- I actually got her to drink 20oz of water in one day, when I usually struggle to get 8oz in her. She loves the crisp taste of water with no plasticy taste. I'm going to have to order another one, because its hard to get her to put it down long enough to clean it. She'll drink a full bottle of water, hand it to me and say \"more water!\".As far as some of the issues in other reviews, I have had none of those problems. I don't find the cap to be sharp, it screws on easily if you don't force it. As with any stainless bottle, you have to carefully make sure the threads are lined up before you start twisting or you'll end up with it at a bad angle- and of course its going to leak if you don't put the lid on correctly. That is a matter of user error, not any flaw in the bottle.As far as mixing formula in it, just put your finger over the nipple like you would with any bottle, I don't understand the reviewer who said it spilled when shaking it... doesn't everyone cover the nipple when they shake a bottle?I'm also very happy with the silicone cap, it goes on super easy and pulls off easy, and it really gets the job done. I keep this bottle in my purse with no fear of the cap leaking.This bottle works perfectly, I love it, my daughter loves it, AND it has a lifetime warranty. Can't beat that! I'm recommending this to everyone.
LOVE LOVE LOVE!!! I did tons of research on a stainless steel bottle and sippy cup for my daughter. This one kept coming up as the best. I actually bought this smaller one that has the bottle nipple, then bought the sippy spouts and made it into a sippy cup. It is perfect for my 8 month old, we started using it with her when she was 6 months old. Great cup, no metal smell, no rough edges. Clean, sleek nice design. We also bought her the 11oz one for when she gets a little bigger. Love them. Will probably buy more as she grows.
Overall I really like these stainless steel bottles. I wanted something that was completely free of plastics, and this one fit the bill.The main drawback is that you cannot microwave these, so you have to heat water for formula first and then make the bottle. (I know they say you shouldn't microwave formula anyway, but please. Sometimes when baby is screaming for a bottle you have to do what is fastest). Or, with these, you can use warm water from the tap, but that is not recommended either.At any rate, I've ended up using these bottles more to offer my daughter a bit of water or watered down juice with her meals. I like that they stay cool, and they convert to sippy cups with a spout you can buy.The paint on the outside makes these look cute, but it does chip. Sometimes my daughter tries to gnaw on the bottle now that she is teething, so I really have to watch her with these.Overall, these are good bottles but I prefer Lifefactory glass bottles with the silicon sleeve, for the reasons indicated above.
These bottles are easy to use and clean, durable, and come with a perfect wide-base nipple. I love the colors, too.
This bottle is truly ONE OF THE KIND. My son really loves holding it and has no problem carrying it around, which makes life much more easy for me. It was a breeze to switch from the 5 ounce bottle to the 9 ounce bottle and then convert it to a zippy cup. My toddler hasn't had any issues at all. We also love the extremely convenient silicone cases that are available in multiple fun colors! It is a MUST HAVE for anyone who loves and cares about the environment as much as our family does. THANK YOU PURA KIKI!!!
I have been using the pura bottles for the past couple months and I am really loving them. I originally was using glass bottles, but the stainless is so much better because there is no chance of breakage, and unlike the glass can be safely converted to a sippy cup when it is time (so I can justify the higher price). Sunlight breaks down vitamin c and other nutrients in milk, so it is great to not have to put a cover on the bottles like I did with the glass.  Their customer service is also excellent. The reason I didn't give it above 4 stars:1. They currently do not come with sealing discs. I bought some avent ones, and they work great, but would have rather not had to buy them separately.2.  I  wish that I could pump directly into them rather than transferring (exposure to air also causes oxidation of vitamin c in milk). They say they are coming out with an adapter soon. It may be too late for me unfortunately!3. The nipple it comes with is way too fast of a flow for a breastfed baby. I had to buy other nipples as well. The good news is that they are compatible with a lot more than they state on their boxes. I stuck to newborn vented nipples --- think baby nipples, mam vented, and coddlelife classic vented all work well. I think my daughter likes the mam nipples best. BUT that was more cash I had to shell out on top of the price of the bottle.-------Edit 3 years later.1. These have held up well as I am using them with my 2nd baby - with the exception of the paint!!! Almost all the paint has chipped off after 3 years of hard use. I have the silicone sleeves to hide it, but I think they chipped more because I leave the sleeves on in the dishwasher. The non-painted ones still look amazing. I have started to try to manually chip the paint off the others after a run in the dishwasher. Stick to the non-painted ones for long term use.  To be fair, this is also the case with our Kleen kanteen bottles. I guess it's just not good to put painted steel in the dishwasher.2. The nipple has improved, they now are very similar to the think baby nipples, but they were still too fast of a flow until about 3/4 months ( I had to supplement the first week). I still had to use the mam nipple for my tiny newborn.3. They now sell their own sealing disks, but they are much more expensive than the avent ones.
I needed a basic stainless steel bottle and this one really works for us. However I wish there were latex nipples available to fit it since we avoid plastic whenever possible (and silicone... not to be confused with the element silicon... is plastic, no matter what they call it). In my search for latex I tried a few brands of nipples other than the ones listed as compatible on the Pura website and indeed none of them fit. It supposedly came with slow flow nipples but I found them too fast for my baby (and much faster than the other slow flow bottles we had) so I bought another brand of compatible slow flow nipple which worked fine.The ounce markings in the bottle aren't helpful. Unless you have a flashlight and a periscope you can't actually look into the bottle and read the markings. I don't need this feature anyway but if you want to easily be able to tell how much is in the bottle you're going to want to go with glass (or plastic).
We have both this bottle and the organickidz 4 oz bottles, and I prefer this one slightly even though the organickidz can hold more volume.  The size is a little shorter, so it fits in my fridge a little better and I like that there is no plastic at all.  We are using Mam nipples with it as my daughter wouldn't take the nipple it came with, and they work great.  This bottle isn't cheap, but effort would be required to break one, so we know it will last long after we are done with children needing bottles or sippy cups.
I don't have any problems with scratches or paint chipping like others have experienced.  I ALWAYS wash it by hand.  My 18mo old uses it all the time with the sippy nipple.  No problems with leaking and its the perfect size for him because he never drinks more than 4 oz with a meal anyway  Also, he tossing this thing around and watches roll off the table onto the floor and it is still like new.
Great sippy cup. Goes from a bottle to a sippy cup.  It is easy to clean and doesn't leak.  I get comments on these only time.The paint does come off of the stainless steel, so I do prefer the stainless steel ones.
My daughter loves the pura bottles.  We use the sippy cup nipple with this bottle and it's perfect size for our outings.  Light, stylish and sanitary!  Awesome little bottle.  Can be used for newbies or older kids as a sippy cup with the right attachment. Highly recommend!!!!
Bought this to use to try to get my daughter off the bottle (She'll only take milk from a bottle nipple - everything else goes over fine in a sippy or big girl cup, but not milk *sigh*).  I love the system, and wish I had used it from the beginning with her.  Only two complaints, which are things I should have realized with this being steel.. when you put cold milk in, the whole thing top-to-bottom gets REALLY REALLY COLD.  We solved this by using one of the baby leggs legging things as a bottle sock, and it works perfectly.  No more cold hands for her!  The second complaint is that milk goes bad really fast in these.  Like, if she doesn't finish off the bottle overnight by the morning its chunky...her Avents only did that after a full day or more (not that she was drinking them, just if it got left out somewhere or whatever). I think its a chemical reaction or just the lack of lining that does it.  Not a big complaint but one to be noted if your kid sleeps with it (don't want them to wake up and drink chunky milk!). The bottle is CUTE, like, really really cute.  We haven't had anything but compliments on it. No problems with paint chipping either, although I don't have a chewer.  The tops are interchangeable with Avent bottles (nipples fit this, and these tops fit on the Avent bases) which wasn't completely clear in their advertising (I was afraid only CERTAIN Avent tops like the sport one would fit, but the regular bottle nipples fit fine).  No leakage problems here unless you don't screw the top on right.  All in all this is a great system and I wish a) I had bought more of them and b) I'd been using them all along rather than wasting money on Avents!
was a great bottle i would reccomend never did dish washer on it jus hand wash cause i read sum bad reviews bout the dishwasher taken the paint off so i never put in there i loved it isa great bottle
If you want your 15m old to walk around the house and create milk puddles everywhere then this is the bottle for you!  I've never had a bottle/sippy leak sooo bad.  We've always been a klean kanteen family so I'm going to stick with those bottles with a MAM nipple.  The only thing that the Pura bottle has going for it is the cool factor, and forget about those silicone grip covers, they are impossible to get on and off!
I really like this stainless steel bottles, easy to keep clean, no plastic, and durable.  My only issue is the nipples.  I bought this brand over other stainless steel bottles because you can use different nipples brands, however, the styles are all the same.  This bottle only works for wide nipples. So if you baby prefers a wide nipple you should it, but if not don't get it.
We use this with the Pura sip spout for my son's milk with meals because I hope the smaller size will get him comfortable holding a child's regular cup eventually.The first 5oz bottle we received got some kind of corrosion on the inside within a few days.  When I contacted Pura they were very helpful and quickly sent a replacement.  We haven't had any issues with the new bottle.
This is a nice looking bottle and I love that its stainless steel. The hole in the nipple is too big so my little one chokes when feeding. Pretty pricey for something that isn't perfect.
There is a learning curve with these bottles. For some reason the short bottles leak and the large bottles don't. I am leaving this review on the 5 oz bottle to let you know. The only difference I can see between the two sizes is that the inside band on the 5 oz is brushed stainless and the tall is still shiny. If I were you I would just skip the small size and just get the talls. Just order newborn nipples and save the fast nipples for later.We still use the shorts when the talls aren't clean. You just have to make sure that the lid is on really tight and you will be fine.We use MAM nipples with these, these are the only nipples our son will take, maybe if we used pura nipples or a different brand this won't be a problem.I do like that they just came out with sealing discs for the bottles, then we use the 5oz to hold snacks or something.
I give this a four because I love that the entire thing is stainless, apart from the spout.  But, it does leak.  It's so easy for my little one to tip and drink from.  Just the right size as a first bottle to hold herself around 8-9 months, but it leaks.  Did I mention it leaks? :). I am so bummed about that.  We only use it for water because of that and won't be using it much on cold days...
bottles are cute but the stainless steel rim on the lid gets super-hot when the bottle is warmed and not safe for the child or the caregiver. the sleeve is a great idea for the bottom of the bottle, but does not fix the too hot issue of the stainless steel lid. this brand/bottle would be ok if using as a sippy cup or if do not need to warm milk for your little one.
Within the first minute of use, my baby was chipping the paint off of the outside of the bottle with his teeth. Perhaps a company which hangs its hat on non-toxic, plastic-free claims should consider their market and not use paint that will end up in a baby's mouth.
Lets start with, I am not someone to usually write reviews but I absolutely love these so wanted to share why.....I have tried every bottle out there with my little boy. He has awful reflux so I wanted to try out and see what worked best for him and me. I tried Medea, Avnet, dr brown's, playtex drop ins and evflow....then I came across these on line while I was doing research \"being that crazy Mom\" about harsh chemicals in plastics bottles so I ordered on liking the idea that they were stainless steel and had no plastic, I also ordered on of there nipples to try. I ordered the 11 oz one which I thought was going to be ridiculous in size but I was surprised when I got it, I loved the size. He loved the bottle!! I used there nipple and it helped with his reflux now that he is a little older I use the Dr browns as well and he does just fine with that too!!! I ordered 4 large and three small the next week..... I got some of the little caps too and they are great for packing bottles to go.....or when he starts eating for some snacks! Best part is they also turn into a sippy cup....so it's worth the price you spend on them. If you put them in the fridge they get so cold and all I have to do is run some hot water on bottle to warm it up and it takes seconds because the stainless steel. Also, you can put in purse and not worry about any leaks!!!! With nipple on it or with the cap. I would recommend these to anyone. Especially moms who are pumping at work and putting there milk in coolers.... They get really cold and stay that way even if your ice packs failed you. I hope this has helped!!!!
I bought this to use as a stainless steel sippy cup.  My child never quite understood how to use the sippy by tipping it back enough so we put a straw into the sippy nipple.  The stainless steel bottle is fine however the silicone sippy spout can easily be pushed into the bottle by the child,making a mess.  I have since gotten the Safe Sippy 2 and like it better since it has a straw included and holds more liquid.  If you are looking for a stainless steel bottle to feed your baby, go with the Kleen Kanteen.  I am really happy with the bottle and the nipple that goes with it.  Also, for first time parents there is no point in getting a small bottle since the baby outgrows that amount of liquid, just go with the larger 9 oz and save yourself some money!
If I knew about these earlier I would have purchased for my first child they are definitely worth every cent!
We've tried many bottles and cups and none has come close to this one. We love that it's not made of plastic and is easy to put together. The infant spout was great for when our little one was younger but now that she's a toddler, we use the sip spouts which has held up surprisingly well despite vigorous chewing. It's easy to clean (we actually boil the whole set every once in a while to really disinfect, spout included since it's silicone), easy to use, and even comes with a great no-spill cover for traveling (also made of silicone which is a huge plus). Love it!
Love that in todays world, baby can have things that are stylish, practical, and heirloom quality! These stainless steel bottles are so wonderful! With colors to match every personal taste!
These stainless steel bottles are a great alternative to plastic bottles. We used glass bottles too, but always reached for these when traveling or spending time outside, where breakability was more of an issue. These are sturdy (held up to the dishwasher and several drops) and the nipples seemed to please my baby. I also like that you can buy a sippy-type top for the Kiki when your kid outgrows bottle nipples. We did that and were happy with using it as a sippy cup as well. The colors are also very fun and cute!
We bought this bottle to use as a water bottle for our6 mo old son. I love that you can transition from a bottlenipple to a sippy cup style top on the same bottle. Sofar we love this bottle. It was also great to be able toswitch to Dr. Brown's nipples since that is what wegenerally use.I have had no problems with paint chipping or sharp metaledges that another reviewer commented on.
I love the wide mouth - it makes it super easy to clean. I also really like that I can change out the nipple and put in a sippy spout so it can grow with my daughter. I just wish it had some sort of way to tell how much is in the bottle instead of having to open it up and look into it which doesn't feel very accurate.
At the time of writing this review our daughter is 9 weeks old. in the months leading up to her birth we researched many items including which bottles to buy. With a wealth of information on the Internet we had certain criteria. We didn't want plastic bottles, as while new ones are BPA free we still have concerns on the longer term effects of exposure to plastics when our daughter is so young. We therefore looked at glass bottles and in so doing came across some great reviews of Pura Kikki. note: We supplement breastfeeding with formula and our daughter has around 6-8 bottles a day. We have had no major issues with her latching onto bottles or breast.We ended up buying a Life Factory glass bottle, a ComoTomo silicone bottle and a PuraKiki stainless bottle. Since then we have bought another 9 x PuraKiki 5oz bottles and 4 x PuraKiki 8oz bottles so for those who don't want to read further you can see which we prefer.We liked the PuraKiki bottles over glass bottles as they are SO much lighter. That makes a big difference when carrying them, or having the little one hold them etc. Also even with the most careful parents it is inevitable that the bottles will end up getting dropped at some point. The last thing I wanted was to have a crying hungry baby, a dropped broken bottle and the stress of trying to solve this - particularly when tired from lack of sleep!The ComoTomo silicone bottle was also good, however the PuraKiki is better for us in terms of:a) durability - the stainless steel design is holding up very well to the dishwasherb) durability - we had made some spaghetti bolognese and put the dirty dishes in the dishwasher with the baby bottles/nipples.. Now the ComoTomo bottle and all nipples have a nice orange/brown tinge from being stained by the tomato residue from the bolognese! The PuraKiki stainless bottles are unaffected.c) durability - fitting a new replacement nipple to the PuraKiki is easy and cheap. Replacement nipples for the ComoTomo are more expensive.d) flexibility - the PuraKiki can take different brands of nipples, we like MAM and PuraKiki nipples. With the ComoTomo you have no option but ComoTomo nipples.e) flexibility - The PuraKiki can convert to Storage Jar and Sippy cup. We've bought the Sippy Spouts but not used them yet. We have used the Silicone Sealing Disks and they work well. We use them when mixing formula and also when going out on day trips.f) longevity - I can see us still having the same PuraKiki bottles in 1,2,3,4,5 years time. We'll either be using them for storage or for no. 2 if we have another child.The PuraKiki bottles do cost more, however for us it is absolutely worth it.So why only 4 stars....a) Leakage - we occasionally have had some leakage from the bottle. To be fair this could be because we bought some older style PuraKiki and newer style PuraKiki bottles and perhaps the design has changed in more than just a cosmetic way. I've not had a chance to see whether there is any real difference in the threading on the lid and hence whether we only get a leak when we put an old style lid on a new bottle (and vice versa). The reason we have an older style bottle is we found some on a discount website and didn't realize it was an older style until it arrived. Since then we've ensured we get the latest design. The leakage is a rare occurrence.b) Pura Nipples - the new style Pura Nipples have a single vent hole on them, however I find that when I have a fussy baby it is difficult to see where the vent hole is and ensure it is facing up. I'd rather see the design modified to include 2 vent holes or make the vent hole easier to see. This is only really a minor issue, however when trying to feed a crying baby the MAM nipples are just so much less stressful as you don't need to worry about orientation. Hence I really like using MAM nipples on the PuraKiki bottles.c) Measurement Markings - When pouring liquid into the bottle you need to have reasonable lighting to see the 1,2,3oz markings as they are on the inside. Once the baby has drunk, assuming their is liquid remaining, then it is difficult to measure how much is left and hence how much has been drunk. In the first few months of the babies life keeping track of milk intake is important. We bought a glass 2oz measuring cup and just pour whatever is left into it. I guess we need to wait for someone to invent transparent stainless steel!d) Opening - My wife has struggled a few times to open a used bottle. This could be due to me tightening them too much, dried milk in the thread or just the design. This isn't a major issue to me however my wife has expressed very vocal frustration a couple of times and with a young daughter a happy wife is a happy husband!e) Sterilizing - Not necessarily a negative however you cannot sterilize the Pura bottles in the microwave as they are metal, instead once a week you put them in a saucepan of boiling water (or you could try the sterilize setting on your dishwasher if it has one)Overall VERY pleased with the Pura bottles as demonstrated by us buying more of them. However others may find the bottles don't suit their needs based on the points above hence 4 stars.
these are too thick to put on the seat belt. i didn't even use them, but they look nice and are quality made.  just not for me especially since my little one hates putting her arms through the belts anyway i didnt want to chance it.
I have been looking all over for something to prevent my toddler's (2) crick in the neck. He's always had that problem when sleeping in his car seat. It was awful watching him sleep and he never had a restful slumber. Finally found a strap that actually supports his head/neck! Long trips in the car have been so much better for him, he sleeps deeply, peacefully, and isn't cranky when he wakes.The straps are very thick and plush. I've order multiples for husband's car and grandma's car!!!
they are so cute! and very squishy and soft.. I use them in car seat / travel system and for baby carrier - baby usually falls asleep there , so these helps! and looks adorable!
I've bought a few sets of these Cushy Straps for our grand baby. I added them to his baby stroller, car seat and his infant swing straps. The Straps are very soft and give some support to their little necks.
Help cushion straps from rubbing into my daughter's neck.  Also help keep her head from falling forward when she sleeps in the car.
My 11 mo old (21lbs) is in a convertible car seat and I had problems with his head slumping badly when he fell asleep in the car.  I was propping his head with blankets, but when it's 80+ degrees out, that got hot.  I bought these and love them!  His head still tilts to the side a bit, but not nearly as bad and the price is better than I found elsewhere as well.I looked at purchasing a \"U\" shaped neck support pillow for him, but the kid ones I found were 2 inches thick and I was afraid that would push his head forward.  This seems to be a good fix.
These are so cute and soft.  They hold my son's head in place while my husband swerves around curves.  My son however think they are food so he's always trying to eat them.
The concept is cool, and if I had a baby that had any higher risk for SIDs or breathing issues, then I could see how this is a necessity to help parents get some much needed rest. However, as a nervous first time mom, this provided limited help for a few reasons. The first two weeks was when I was most anxious, but couldn't get the monitor on squarely on the baby because of the umbilical cord. Once the cord fell off, I was already sleeping easier but decides to give it a try anyways. We had three false alarms - once when the baby rolled herself onto her side, twice when the baby was in my arms nursing to sleep. It became more of a nuisance than anything, especially getting it in and off with the high volume of diaper changes you go through with a newborn. I had to learn peace of mind on my baby's well being either way - even if the device didn't go off, I would still wake up and reach over to check if she was breathing. So unless there is a real cause for concern, not on my list of must-have gadgets if we have another baby.
UPDATE 12/2012:I stopped putting this on my baby three days after her first birthday, because she learned how to take it off. It brought me great peace of mind, and we will be using it again when we have another baby.UPDATE: I think the alarm could be a lot louder. I tested it out by setting it off, putting it back on my daughter, snapping up her clothes, and putting a thin swaddle blanket on her. I can certainly hear it but I'm not 100% sure it would wake me up coming in over the monitor. I'm going to experiment with it and see if I can set thye monitor up differently to help. I don't think it's the monitor though, because our monitor is very sensitive and we have it set on \"high.\" I will also try not wrapping her up, but I don't think she will sleep that way. Bummer.FIRST USE:It's fairly easy to program if yoU read the manual. It clips on easily and securely. My daughter barely noticed it, and fell right to sleep asfter nursing. The alarm is loud enough to be heard over the baby monitor. The sensor is very sensitive; no false alarms yet (after about three hours). I had the Snuza sitting on my thigh as I read the manual and it was detecting the small muscle contractions in my leg. Not bad for $100.I chose this one instead if the Halo, not because of price, but because if my baby has apnea or stops breathing, I want an alarm to sound instead of a vibration to rouse her. Just my preference.MY PERSONAL FEELINGS ABOUT USING THE Snuza:My daughter is five months old, and I have literally been unable to sleep soundly since her birth, especially after she gets her shots (a lot of friends are anti-vax and freak me out all the time). Coupled with the monitor, it has made me feel so much better. I'm not saying I won't still check on her at night, but maybe I won't have a heart attack every time she sleeps longer than six hours and I forget to wake up. Maybe I won't constantly think about going into her room and finding her blue. Or maybe I'll still worry but with less intensity. Maybe I'll let myself enjoy her babyhood more.What prompted me to purchase this at five months? My daughter started crying really hard a few nights ago (I was taking a quick shower and she woke up), and when I looked at her she was slightly discolored. Just seeing her like that scared me. I had been considering getting one of these when we moved her to her own room. I thought I was being ridiculous, but what do you pay for peace of mind, and even greater protection for your baby? I mean, there are no guarantees, but as long as this thing stays put and stays on, I'll know if my sweet baby's breathing becomes weak or stops.Again....not bad for $100. And I would pay any price for my baby's safety.
I bought this for my 3rd child. I can't imagine how I functioned without it. Such a peace of mind at night! I always worry about him un-swaddling his blanket into his face or rolling over. I really recommend paying the money for benefit. Plus, I figure I can resell and get some money back when I'm done with it. All my friends with babies find this appealing too!
We loved this! We had the Angel Care monitor, but since he was sleeping in his sleep n play rocker, it wouldn't work and we were paranoid first time parents. I think we only had one or two false alarms with this because it wasn't resting on his tummy. You have to make sure to roll the diaper a little underneath it to have a very snug fit. We used this for about 5 months until  he moved into his crib. It was SO nice to get sleep!
I bought this for my son was he was about 5 weeks old. He loved to sleep on his stomach and this gave me peace of mind to allow him to do so. Everyone told me I was crazy and I wouldn't need this (Rather expensive) baby product.When my son was 9 weeks old, he suffered 9 apnetic &#34;episodes&#34;, where he stopped breathing and had to be revived.It was later determined he was having seizures. I had stayed up for more than 36 hours watching him, to make sure he wasn't having anymore, when they finally found a medication to stop them. Thankfully, my son has outgrown these episodes, but this product was indespensible in the interim.If I hadn't had this product, I wouldn't of been able to sleep in the first few weeks after coming home from the hospital. My son is 9 months old and he still wears this nightly, and I adore it. It gives me peace of mind. I do not use a baby monitor, I do not get up to check on him. As long as he is wearing his snuza, I know that he is safe and breathing.The alarm itself is quite loud, I can hear it from my bedroom (which is directly next to my sons room), or in the kitchen. I think if you could hear your child crying from any room, you would hear this alarm too. YES, I do get false alarms, where the snuza has come away from his diaper. But if he is wearing footed pajamas, and it falls off, but stays in the PJ's, often, it won't alarm, because it is still touching part of his skin, and I'll find it down by his feet when he wakes up. This does not bother me. Also, the alarm doesn't wake him up anymore. Many times I have gone in to find the alarm going off and him still asleep. I usually just turn it off at that stage because rearranging it would wake him up.Also, in terms of the battery, I have been using the same battery since September, and had no problem. I did order two replacements just in case, but have not used either yet. Apparently there is some disparity about which battery to use, The SNUZA Face book page has a document which clears this up.So, I think I paid around eighty dollars for this product. It has been well worth it for me, and I will use it with my next children. Everyone and their dog told me it was a frivolous purchase but it has probably been the single BEST baby item I bought, regardless of my son's health condition.
this product rivals AngelCare, though I wouldn't say it replaces it. I bought AngelCare when my son (4.5) was a newborn, and I used it with him and my daughter (2 mo) for overnight. I bought this because I'm a bundle of stress when I fall asleep with her next to me, or I haven't gotten any sleep continuously trying to put her back in her bassinet. Also, in the car for long drives, swing for naptime, really just anytime. We've had one false alarm but who cares, really. It's not extremely loud, in fact it alarmed when I was sleeping and I didn't hear it, but my husband did. Best for naptimes as it could fall off.There is only one draw back to this (and I have to stress, this product is amazing), and that is though the censor is very soft and pliable, since it's attached to baby's diaper or pants, if they're curled up or wiggling around when waking up it can be uncomfortable.
Honestly, I don't know why people still mess around with those silly pads.  This thing is small, portable, easy to use.  Left button turns it on, two buttons pressed simultaneously turn it off -- how hard can this be?  Never had a false positive after a month of use.  tested many times on myself (held my breath for >15s, alarm goes off without fail.)  Love the product!
I absolutely love the Snuza Go. We chose this one over the regular snuza because of the ability to adjust the time of the alarm (15, 18, or 20 seconds) and because of the ability to replace the battery. Our son is at a higher risk for SIDS due to being born a bit early and being relatively low birth weight. These factors combined with the fact that he sleeps in multiple places (making an under-mattress monitor useless) made the snuza a great choice for us. We can use it whether he is sleeping in bed with us, in his crib, in his bouncy seat, or even in his carseat. Because it is so easy to use, even his grandparents can use it. I highly recommend this product!*NOTE*We used this until our son turned about 9 months old, at which time he became to squirmy. The Snuza simply would not stay on the diaper anymore at that point. Though we still recommend it to others, I was extremely disappointed with the battery life. It lasted nowhere near a year and, based off of local stores who sell it, this is a common problem that they often hear from their customers, as well.
We received this item off our baby registry today.I started out a little surprised at the size of the unit - it is smaller than I expected, but is actually no bigger than I think it needs to be, which might sound odd. I posted some pictures so you can see the size of the unit next to some common items.Our baby is not born yet, so I tested the item by clipping it to my shorts and taking a short nap. Not a peep. Then I took it off and set it on the ottoman next to the sofa, and it went off after 15 seconds (as I had programmed it to do), just as it should. I then let it sit and tapped it every 10 seconds to test the \"8 movements every 60 seconds\" feature. It went off at 50 seconds to let me know that the movement rate seemed low, just as it should.Note: Not mentioned in the item description, but good to know, is that the device comes with a clear plastic carrying case to protect the movement sensor if you're packing it in a diaper bag for a trip.Overall, if it continues to work as it has so far, I will be extremely pleased. In a perfect world, the only time I'll ever hear it go off was during my tests.UPDATEThis item worked perfectly on our baby from birth until around 8 months. By 8 months she was such an active sleeper - rolling around and whatnot - that we started getting false alarms so we stopped using it. Up until that point, it remained firmly clipped to her diaper all night long. We also had no issues with battery drainage.It really did provide us with peace of mind. We had a very colicky baby who would only sleep an hour at a time (tops) throughout the night. We were up and down like that for close to 2 months, then like a switch she started sleeping 5-7 hours at a time. Without this, we would have been constantly worrying that she'd suffocated since her prior sleep pattern was so horrible. Knowing that this would go off if she did stop moving allowed us to sleep easy.If we have another baby, I won't let it go to sleep without the snuza go. We recommend it to all of our baby-having friends.
This is so great for peace of mind when you are concerned about SIDS.  I would not be able to sleep well because I was so concerned with my baby's breathing.  With the Snuza, I can sleep better (but I still check her breathing from time to time).  I did have problems with the battery- the unit would zap through a battery every 2 weeks.  I contacted Pneo customer service and got a prompt replacement.  It's been working great now!  I have not had any false alarms either.  I plan on using the unit until my daughter is a year old, and using it with all of my children.  I wish I'd gotten it earlier!
The Snuza Go alarm gives this first time mom of twins peace of mind. They are worth every penny. We have had a few false alarms, mainly overnight when a diaper gets full and gapes a little but I'd rather have a false alarm than a product not sensitive enough. Love these!!
We have preemie twins that spent three and four months in the hospital and were discharged on oxygen without monitors. We got the Snuza's as a peace of mind that our babies were safe and sound in their cribs and we are so thankful for this company. Though we have had false alarms, we have also had a few occassions where the babies were startled awake by the alarm - and I hate to think what would have happened without the Snuza. They are super portable and great for babies with reflux or babies with torticollis / plagiocephaly who need positioning.
After 2 women I know lost their babies to SIDS in a months time I bought a snuza. I felt like I needed to do everything I possibly could to prevent something like that happening to my child. My husband felt like it was just another kooky baby item but he came around quickly. I just wish that they gave these to everyone when they leave the hospital; health insurance should pay for these!! With my first son I had a sound monitor in his room turned all the way up so I could listen for him breathing at night (yeah I'm a nut!). We decided to not even buy a sound monitor after using the snuza for a few weeks, we feel confident that we would hear the snuza from the next room.It has worked great for us. My son doesn't like it touching his skin so we put a onesie with pj bottoms on him and tuck it in the waist band of the pants. I also use this when he is swaddled. I just put it on before swaddling him and I haven't yet had a problem. (We use the miracle blanket) We have yet to have a false alarm though a few times I've forgotten to turn it off when I changed his diaper and set it off that way. We've been using it about 8 weeks so I can't comment on how well the battery life goes. We do use it roughly 9-12 hours a night and it's been going strong for atleast 2 months so not too shabby.
I decided to order the Go rather than the Hero because I wanted to know if she stopped breathing period. The Hero will vibrate to try and awake before alarming but my thoughts are that if my baby stops breathing I want to know, even if it causes me to awake in the middle of the night! This has caused false alarms because my 2 month on sleeps in a rock and play as opposed to laying flat in her crib, but it's really not that big of a deal.
Great product. The peace of mind is worth the price. My daughter has sensitive skin & the unit does not irritate her. Fits snugly. So glad I made this purchase.
We purchased this after we brought our daughter home from the NICU. We did have false alarms. (She would move around so much it would come loose and then alarm.) There was one real alarm when she had stopped breathing and I am forever thankful that we used this alarm.
Fantastic product.  This saved my husband and me from sleepless nights (besides the baby waking of course).  Highly recommended for all parents!
I'm a first time parent, and with all the literature I read about SIDS I was a stressed out mess when my baby would sleep at night.  I am so happy I found the Snuza.  It easily attaches to my baby's diaper, and doesn't seem to cause any discomfort at all.  You can keep it on silent mode, or turn on the audible tick, which is nice when you are in another room (you will need a baby sound monitor unless you're close by) It's so reassuring to hear the audible tick.  I tested the alarm by leaving the Snuza on the nightstand, and it is loud.  The sound does get a little muffled when there are multiple layers on the baby, but so far has not been a problem.  I can now get a good night's sleep.  This device is well worth the money.
I am a somewhat paranoid new mother with what my family calls &#34;the worry gene&#34;.  Before my baby was born, I did quite a bit of research on movement/breathing monitors and decided on the Snuza Go! based on its portability and favorable reviews.  This little orange device gives me extreme peace of mind and helps me sleep peacefully knowing that my baby is sleeping safely.  Our baby uses it for naps and nighttime sleeping.We have had a few false alarms when the baby kicks a lot while going to sleep or sleeping and the monitor slides off.  I don't view this as a bad thing, though - it shows me that the monitor is working AND that it's loud enough to rouse me from a deep sleep.
(This is FacelessGhost's wife) I was a nervous, first-time mother and was tired of not being able to sleep soundly. The Snuza Go pretty much changed my nights. We used it with my daughter until she was about 11 months old when the battery died. As she got older she moved around a lot more at night and the monitor would sometimes fall off her diaper, but until then we had maybe 3-4 \"false alarms.\" And we used it *every* night starting at about 1.5 months. As long as we folded over the top part of her diaper before putting it on, it stayed on whether she stayed on her back or rolled over to her stomach.I wouldn't say this is a \"necessary\" item for everyone to get, but if you're stressed about your baby at night then totally buy this. We're definitely going to use it for any future babies, and I have no qualms with recommending it to anyone. It's easy to use, it works like it's supposed to, it's small and doesn't bug the baby, and it gives a lot of peace of mind.
I bought this for my son when I moved him to his room at 8 weeks. We stopped using it just after 6 months due to needing new batteries. We used the Snuza every single night for the time frame I put above. The battery lasted much longer than I had anticipated. We had about four false alarms the entire time, but those false alarms are so worth it in my opinion. While my son slept on his back for much of the time we used it, he did sleep on his tummy every night towards the end. The few false alarms we had were when he slept on his tummy. Fold the top of the diaper over before connecting the Snuza and it stays on great. The alarm never woke my son when it did go off, I'd simple turn it off and back on and he'd just stir a bit. I will definitely be using this product with my next child (after I get new batteries). I also like that it is portable. We were able to take it on vacation, unlike some of the other breathing monitors I have seen. Great product. Recommend to everyone!
I feel so much more comfortable at night since buying this one. Especially while co-sleeping, and while transitioning to the crib.
My daughter co=sleeps and has had breathing issues.Since she co-sleeps, the Angle Matt was not an option. This clips on her diaper, she doesn't even notice it is there! Gives mommy piece of mind, the alarm is loud so you will wake up instantly if it goes off.
We bought this for our newborn and used it for 8 months. It provided such great peace of mind. It only went off once when she was really little and I'm convinced it was not a false alarm(she was sucking on her pajamas in her mouth!!!). When she got a little older and moved around more we had some false alarms but it was worth the peace of mind. This is great for newborns and little babies who can't roll around or move much.
I am a new mom and this little device is amazing. At first, we had a couple of false positives (which really freaks you out at 3 a.m.) but after figuring out the trick to putting it on we have had no problems. We just fold down the top of the diaper to form a nice snug fit and we make sure that the clip is slid down ALL the way. If it isn't the sensor part flips up &/or the snuza falls completely off resulting in false positives. Our little one wears it almost all the time. That is where the addicted part comes in. She has it on at all times unless we leave the house. It is just peace of mind. I will have to wean myself off of it I am sure. =)
I bought the Angel Care Monitor first and then returned it.  The Snuza is so much better!  It clips right onto your babies diaper, so you can use it when baby is sleeping in your bed, in a co-sleeper, or in a pack n play.  (Angel Care only works with a standard crib.)  I even occasionally let my son nap on his stomach because it really helps with his gas, and this monitor clips right on his back and still works great.  I've had a few false alarms, but only when the monitor falls off because he was moving a lot.  I definitely think this is worth it.  It gives me great peace of mind.
I bought this when my baby was a couple months old and am still using it even though he's almost 8 months. I had to have my first one replaced when it started to malfunction, and even though it took a while, the company honored their warranty. We've had more false alarms now that he's bigger and moving around a lot more, but I'm willing to deal with the annoyance of false alarms (sometimes jt wakes him up since we have to put it back on, or he wakes from the beeping)because it has gone off when it was still attached to him and he was sleeping on his tummy. I would highly recommend it to any new parent!
Wish I wouldn't have purchased.  It is hard to set and I never really knew if I could trust it to work, so I really didn't get the rest I wanted.  Maybe it will work better with baby number 2.
With SIDS such a worry in parents' minds, this device attaches to the baby's diaper and the tip touches the baby's stomach monitoring its breathing.  It'll blink orange if it registers irregular breathing.  I have it set to go off after 15 seconds if my baby isn't breathing.  It has gone off once, and I jumped out of bed.  It can definitely be heard from down the hallway.  It went off because our baby was born at 5 pounds and he was really small; almost too small (too skinny to be wearing this). Now that he's 11 pounds, it fits on him much better (i.e., fuller stomach).  This device is great because it can easily be taken anywhere the baby is going to be sleeping.  Before our baby was born, we were considering the Angelcare monitor, but decided on the Snuza because once our baby starts rolling over, etc. it's attached on and we don't have to worry about him rolling off the mat like with the Angelcare.  I would recommend this to any new parent.
Really gives you a peace of mind and fits snug right on the diaper perfect for little babies. My daughter spent her first two month of life in the NICU so to come home and have something to give me peace was AWESOME
I bought my Snuza Go! fall 2011 before the birth of my daughter. I was a terrible mess with my first, a son, due to SIDS fears. I just wanted to enjoy my infant this time around without fear of this happening. The Snuza saved my sleep! My baby wore it for 10 months without realizing it was indeed there. I hade very few false alarms, most of them user error due to me not securing the clip enough on the diaper, only twice did the Snuza go off without me doing something to cause it to fall off my baby. It's way more conveinent than some like an angel care monitor because it can go anywhere. I had bought a back battery and never had to use. It ran on the same battery life it came with for 10 months of constant use. This device is INVALUABLE! I highly recommend it to any mother or father, you can finally sleep when baby is sleeping without fear something will happen to your precious baby.
So far we love the Snuza go. We chose it over the more expensive vibration one because of the price, and also because it is smaller, time of alarms can be adjusted and the battery can be easily replaced. The battery is available on Amazon, but the first ones we bought came dead. Glad we use Prime.It is easy to use and switch on and off after a few tries.We were using the Angelcare sensor mat, which was great. But as our baby approached 8 months he moves off the mat quite often. That's not a problem with the Snuza. The Snuza seems a natural progression after a baby outgrows the mats.Just a couple of false alarms caused by the diaper being too loose.Highly recommended, and great peace of mind.
I recommened the Snuza to anyone who has a baby. I have a crib movement sensor as well, but I like this one way more because I can put it on my son no matter where he is, without having to have a flat surface and cords everywhere. My dog chewed my first one and yet it still works! I ordered another just to be safe. I've used it for 3 months and the battery is still going strong. We have very few false alarms, only when my hubby doesn't put it on the diaper tight enough. :)
I purchased the Snuza because my pre-term baby was not registering with the Angel Care monitor.  It would not pick up any of her movements or breathing and was constantly alarming. I bought another system similar to the Angel Care and had the same problem. I came across the Snuza and decided to try it.  I am really happy with
Told myself I would not buy one of these..........but as a first time mom I caved. I know it will not &#34;prevent&#34; SIDS........but it truly does offer peace of mind.  I can go to sleep knowing should anything happen I will have at least some notice.
As a new mother, I was constantly waking up at night checking on my newborn son. I was anxious and would always stick my finger under his nose to make sure he was breathing. The quality of my sleep was poor, which is even worse because mothers of newborns don't get much sleep anyway! This product came highly recommended to me by my sisters, and before then, I'd never heard of a Snuza. I ordered this and have been SO PLEASED with it! It works perfectly and allows me so much peace of mind at night! I don't wake up every 30 minutes to check on my son anymore, and as a result, my sleep quality is SO MUCH better and allows me to take better care of my son when I am awake. It is worth every penny, and I highly recommend it for any mother of a newborn!
Small, portable and convenient. It is Not cumbersome like some other monitors. I Wish the battery lasted a little longer.
This is hands down our favorite baby item. We can't sleep without it on her! You do have to put the diaper on snugly for it to work properly, but you get the hang of it quickly. We've been using it daily for 8 months and have only had two false alarms, both of which were our fault for not getting it on correctly.I chose this model because you can change the timer setting, and I followed the directions exactly but it still won't let me change the time. It works otherwise though, so I kinda forgot all about that.
I got this for my son because he sleeps swaddled and started turning over onto his stomach while swaddled at 3 months. The little guy sleeping unswaddled is a whole other can of worms. It never went off until 2 weeks ago. He hadn't rolled over while swaddled in over a month so I was thinking about not using it anymore.When it went off, at first I didn't even realize what the sound was. He had a cold and was very congested. When I rushed in to get him, he was face down and seemed very startled. I hope beyond hope that he didn't stop breathing but thank goodness I had the Snuza on him!!Now our problem is diaper leaks during every nap and stretch of sleep at night. I've tried 2 different kinds of diapers in 2 sizes. It has to be the Snuza + him growing. That's why it gets 4 instead of 5 stars from me.
We had a little incident at 6 weeks with out son, he had some trouble breathing, one night and it lasted for about 3 days anytime we laid him down, particularly on his back.  As per the physician I laid him semi upright on a pillow right by my head at night, and proceeded not to be able to sleep for 3 nights straining to hear his quite breathing.A friend of our loaned us her under the matress angelcare monitor.  It was okay, but I was so nervous when he slept in his crib (the angelcare is in the bassinet) or fell asleep on the couch or in his swing, or when we were out....so I started looking into other options and ended up purchasing the Snuza.I chose the Snuza Go over the Hero because if my baby is having trouble I want to know!! I do not like that it might be \"rousing\" my baby and I don't know it.  So I intentionally purchased the Go.Finances are tight but I would gladly spend 2x this much to keep our son safe!So far we've had no false alarms, after I got the hang of putting it on correctly, one of the first times we used it, i put it on in dim light & didn't position it correctly. I'm very very pleased with this product. My 13 week old baby seemed not to ever notice it's presence!One thing to note is that, it does have a very tiny red/green light flash indicator on it to see if the breath signal is weak or poor. I can see it though most of his clothing. This might be a problem for some & a reassurance for others. It's a very tiny light and doesn't disturb the baby or us ever. But just something to note.The only con for me is that if baby is sleeping its hard to turn it on without waking the baby because it gives three louder beeps to indicate its turning on, but they are louder than need be, irritatingly so. I have to bury it under a pillow or other fabric or leave the room to turn it on to keep from waking my son.Still a very good product that I would recommend. He really scared us for a while & this definitely makes for a reassuring peace of mind!! Wish I'd had this for my first two, but they are both healthy toddlers now!
It must touch the skin in exactly the right spots or it won't work right. It is not worth the money and I returned it.
Attach this to the top of baby's diaper UNDER her PJs. I made the mistake of thinking that would give it a false positive but that's actually how it works.  It's kinda weird to see your kid's belly flashing through her jammies in the dark but at least you know she's breathing!! I use it for bedsharing.  We are careful not to have blankets and pillows near baby's face but this gives me added peace of mind.
We used this until our daughter was 10 months old. It was at that time she began moving around too much for it to stay on 100% of the time.This particular monitor is my favorite because:1. it was easily attached.2. it could travel with us.3. it was reasonably priced.4. it wasn't too obtrusive.The only drawback I had with this one is that it didn't always stay on some of the thicker cloth diapers - we use pocket diapers. We use a few different brands, though, so we began putting her to sleep with only the BumGenius and FuzziBunz and it worked perfectly.It will be used for our next child.
This is good for piece of mind, but mine kept slipping off.  It doesn't work well with cloth diapers.  Oh well.
The Snuza was hands down the best baby item I bought. My husband and I tend toward being paranoid and this thing provides us with extra reassurance that everything is ok with our little girl. We got so much more sleep (and it was still little sleep!) with this because I wasn't as tempted to get up and constantly check that my daughter was breathing (even though I still checked a few times!).We selected this one over the Halo because it was a bit cheaper (and we didn't think the vibration feature would add much) and because you can change the batteries yourself (we bought a spare inexpensive battery off Amazon to have a back-up). We haven't needed the battery and we've been using it every day for 10+ months. We also looked at the AngelCare, but we had her in a Rock n Play and then a Pack and Play for ~4 months and the AngelCare won't work for those.My child is still wearing the Snuza at 10+ months -- she started sleeping on her stomach at 4 months when she learned to roll over and the Snuza didn't bother her -- she's now interested in it when I first put it on, but she keeps it on. We use a Summer Infant Swaddle sack with the swaddle portion wrapped around her waist (so her arms are free and just her legs are covered) and that keeps the Snuza in place. We had two false alarms in the middle of the night when we didn't use the swaddle sack.We've had a handful of alarms -- 2-3 were false alarms when it fell off, and 2 were undetermined -- my child didn't seem to have anything wrong when we woke her up, but it was still attached to her diaper (we use disposables....it stays on).Just buy it -- it's worth it.
Our baby prefers to sleep on her tummy, but it made us nervous due to all of the SIDS warnings.  We purchased this monitor for her to wear when she is napping and sleeping and have found it very reassuring.  We tested it and the alarm is nice and loud and goes off at 20 seconds of no movement.  We've never had a false alarm.  I chose this over the Angelcare monitor because baby sleeps in different places throughout the day, and I have hear that the Angelcare gives a lot of false alarms, especially if baby shifts off of the pad.  Can't go wrong with the Snuzaq!
While this seems like an expensive gadget, I believe it is worth its weight in gold. Our fifth child is 7 weeks old and I came across Snuza while researching for a new sound monitor. I just felt like I should get it for her, to be safe, rather than sorry. She was about 3 weeks old when we got it. A week and a half later she came down with RSV. The monitor has now gone off 3 times and I do not believe any of them were false alarms. RSV can cause apnea and Im so thankful that we are aware she's having some of that going on. Each time she has been fine thankfully, not blue or discolored. This morning the second type of alarm, a beep every 2 secs, went off. That means that three different times it had to rouse her by vibrating. That scared me but it helps us to keep an eye on her with all of her congestion. I will always have a snuza baby alarm on her and any future babies too! We are very thankful and know God brought it to us for a reason - it has really helped me get sleep, knowing Ill know if she gets into trouble.
A year and a half ago my 2 year old daughter passed away in her sleep.  Now that her sister is 9 weeks old, this product is an absolute must for when she is at daycare, during naps outside of her crib, or if we travel (I prefer the angel care deluxe for use in her crib).  This unit is easy to use, very convenient and works great.  I am so grateful for this product so that I can have some sort of peace of mind that I will know if anything goes wrong.  I do not think that parents are overreacting by buying & using this product.  I wish that I would have known about it with my first daughter.
We found that this gave us piece of mind. I recomend it to everyone! It fell off a few times or got loosw and gave a false alarm, but I would rather have a few false alar,s than other potential end results. This item is well worth the money. As a side note we had this and the next model up (the one that vibrates). I did not see the value in spending more on the higher model.
My daughter was born prematurely and was on oxygen until she was 9 weeks old. She wears this monitor EVERY night! It lets me sleep so much better knowing that if she were to stop breathing the monitor would alarm and I could immediately intervene. I haven't had any problems with false alarms. Great product, I would recommend it to anyone!This battery was supposed to last 1 year but it ended up only lasting for about 3 months! Very disappointed...
We started using ths when my daughter was about 1 week old and have used it every night since.  We've never had a false alarm, but it works perfectly anytime I test it by setting it on a table (she is 6 mos old now). Simply put, this device allows me to sleep at night. I don't have to check on her a million times a night, and unlike monitors the baby sleeps on, this is easily portable and can be used on any stationary surface (it won't work with swings, bouncy chairs,  the car, etc since the alarm can't tell the difference between those movements and the baby's movements. ) Side note, my dogs hate the sound of the alarm - they bark and go crazy, just like  with the smoke detector - which makes me like it even more!
I am neurotic about checking on my children breathing.  I check all through the night.  The SNUZA was a great relief for me.  Only two mishaps.  I was able to use this well past 9 months.  I applaud the inventor.  We just need one for our elders now.
unlike our daughter, our son is a tummy sleeper - after agonizing over the fact that he's NOT on his back, I thought i'd get a sense of security if I at least monitor his breathing while he's asleep - well, the sensor doesn't pick up each breathing while clipped to the back or side of the diaper.  save your money if you're buying this to monitor a tummy sleeper.
A friend of mine recommended this movement monitor for me, and we love it! It alerts you if baby were to stop breathing and moving. Unfortunately, it has gone off several times when the baby was just fine, but I would much rather have that happen and be on the safe side! It gives me a peace of mind at night when we are sleeping. Very easy to use and the alert is very loud. Unless my 11 month old is very wiggly it stays in place just fine. I've only had to change the battery once, but we use it every night.
We ordered the Snuza monitor because I'm an anxious first time mom, and it sure helped! I slept soooo much better knowing that the alarm would go off if our daughter were to stop breathing. I knew it would work, because twice it fell off (you really do need to turn down the top of the diaper to hold it in place!) and lay next to her in bed, and sure enough the alarm went off. Those were the only two false alarms we had until recently, and we've actually stopped using the Snuza because she moves so much it's nearly impossible to keep it on her at night. We did have problems with the battery, it died when the Snuza was only 3 weeks old. I called Amazon and they next day mailed me a new Snuza, and we've had no problems with the second one. We used the Snuza from the time our baby was 3 months old until she was about 8 months old. I'd still be using it if I knew how to keep it on her! And with the next baby (Lord willing), I'll use it sooner! It gave me great peace of mind. The reason I only gave it 4 stars is because it's a little tricky to get it to stay on her, but it worked very well during the peak of my sids anxiety. My sleep has definitely suffered slightly since we've stopped using it. I would recommend this product to any new parent, it was totally worth the money to us!
This little device allowed me to get much more sleep in the first 2 months of my daughter's life than I would have otherwise. I didn't want to worry too much, but I got much more nervous because my daughter choked on spit up our first night in the hospital and didn't make a sound. Luckily we were awake and able to get help from a nurse immediately, but it put a good scare into my husband and me. It was so reassuring to know that as long as it was quiet, she was moving. As she started moving more and rolling over, we started getting more false alarms because the monitor would lose contact with her stomach, so we stopped using it at that point. Also I should note that we were able to successfully use it with cloth diapers (prefold/fitted with cover), I know that's one thing I wasn't sure about when I was first considering it.
Expecting our first child, we purchased this carseat after reading numerous reviews of many different brands and styles. We decided to skip an infant seat and use this one rear-facing for the first year. The seat arrived promptly, looked great and I am sure it will function very well. However, two major points:1. I would highly advise, if possible, to get a measurement on how it will fit in your car. Borrow one from a friend, request a dimension from the company, anything. It \"fits\" into my '08 Subaru Impreza behind the passenger seat, but the seat has to be all the way forward, so no one over 5'0\" can ride in it. Not good for mom and dad to drive together with baby in the back.2. While the instructions are fairly straight forward, I quote to you from p.37 of the instruction manual: \"Step#13: Ensure the angle indicator ball is the green with to keep the child's airway open.\" How can a reputable company print something like this? Are all the other instructions, even when they make sense, correct?I am not unhappy enough to return the seat, I think we will use it and enjoy it in forward facing position, but for now we had to get a separate infant seat which fits behind the driver and passenger comfortably and provides great infant neck support.Update: 2.5 years later, we've been enjoying the seat! It was tough while we kept it RF (for 2.0 years) because you do have to put the headrest on once your child is 22 lbs to continue to RF, at which point it becomes the size of any other seat with the same RF weight and height limits (like the Graco MyRide 65 which we also have). Once you FF, it's a beauty. Everything is easy to adjust, like the strap between the legs which is near impossible while RF. The straps glide easily through the buckles, the fabric comes off very easily. My favorite thing about it - the ease of install with a seatbelt for RF position. So I am upgrading my original 3 stars to 4 because it has proven to be a nice seat and I would recommend it to others.
I bought this same car seat a few years back for our now 3 year old and loved it!  Since our baby hated his infant car seat I thought I'd try this one for him (he's now 7 months old).  He loves it!!  The infant insert is very soft.  I love the belt/strap lock system as it helps to keep the seat super snug and safe.  It is a big difficult to reach the latch to losen the straps, but I just tilt the seat of the vehicle back a bit and am able to reach it.  My baby loves his seat and rarely fuses in it anymore.  The only thing I wish it came with was a head support so his head didn't flop down when he's sleeping.  It was an easy fix as I had one I could use, but it would be nice if the infant insert had that built in as well.
We have this same seat with the micro-suade cover for our daughter, and we love everything about it! (Easy to install, great safety ratings, easy to take the cover off & clean, looks great!). I like the seat we got for our son- with one exception- the cloth fabric cover. It shows everything and isn't as easy to wipe clean as the microsuade, plus not as soft... Wish they had offered it when we bought a 2nd seat!
I ADORE the true-fit carseats we've owned for my daughter, so I was brand-faithful and bought this seat for my 12 month old son. He LOVES the seat. It's nice and padded, the straps are protected from scratching his skin, and the fabric is soft. I know that my son will be safe, and, once installed, it is VERY secure. However, it is very frustrating to install. It took my husband and me (both fairly good about things like this) over 1/2 hour to install AFTER I read the instructions forward and backward.I think this will be an AWESOME seat forward-facing. I adore the C630 forward facing, and I think this will be better. Although I wish I had just purchased the C630 again, since the recline feature is simply a little knob on the side that reclines it an extra 5 degrees.The pros:My son likes his big seatHe is very comfortable with the fabricsThe seat fits better in the car (even with the removable headrest on) than the infant seat with base.It is easy to adjust the harness heightThe cons:It is impossible to install rear-facing without two people.Rearfacing makes it difficult to access the harness tightness adjustment.There are some DEFINITELY wrong instruction points in the instruction booklet.
We love this seat!. I drive a Nissan Versa and have had my now 30lb 16 month old sitting backwards behind the drivers seat (with head extension on) for ~ 8 months. I'm comfortable and he's comfortable and safe! It is much easier to adjust when backwards if its not in the center of the back seat. A curved back seat makes it easier to adjust than a flat bench seat but its still doable. My husband drives a Saturn Vue (very flat backseat back) and he has no problem adjusting it, I think its much harder to adjust than in my car.
I don't write tons of reviews unless I really love or do not like a product. We bought this for our second vehicle because it was on sale on Amazon. I was excited after reading the reviews on it thinking it would be a great seat. When I got it in, from the looks of it before going in the car, I thought I would prefer it over my Britax Marathon. Boy, was I wrong! I am trying to sell it now and going to buy another Britax. A word of advice, just spend the extra money for a Marathon or Boulevard! Let me go through the things that we do not like. This might be a better seat when it is forward facing, but I am keeping my son facing back until the recommended 2 years of age.1. It does not recline and we have to put a towel underneath in order to get it to go back at all when back facing.2. The latch that goes into the seat tightens in one side only, not both sides. Each side on my Britax has a locking device. This doesn't seem like a bit deal - it really is.3. The straps are the same way. They are hooked together so that one side pulls the other side tighter. The Britax is two separate parts.4. The material on the straps is very scratchy. We live in Louisiana, so my son wears sleeveless things.5. My son can't sleep without his little head tilting almost forward.6. He also seems to cry a lot more when he is tired because it is next to impossible for him to go to sleep in it, just not comfortable.7. There is no or very little padding. You can see the straps and things that should be covered up.I didn't know these were big deals until I got the seat. If I didn't have a seat to compare it to, I probably wouldn't realize these things as a problem. But, my mom used this seat this weekend without me telling her anything about it and when I picked my son up, she said how much she hated it. Honestly, I am so shocked this seat has such good reviews and needed to come let people know my thoughts on this seat. Very disappointing really. I am glad we purchased this seat when it was on sale for $135. Honestly, I almost wish it wasn't on sale because that is what sold me between that and the Roundabout. We are just going to go ahead and get the Boulevard though.
My 7 month old out grew his infant seat and after MUCH research, I purchased this wonderful seat. I have 3 kids in all, and I have had many cheap car seats that I hated. First, I'll tell you what I love about the seat.It has a large interior. Plenty of butt space. My kids were all chubby babies, and toddlers. My 60lb 8year old can fit in this seat just fine.No rethreading the harness. Adjusts easily.Easy off cover. First time your kid pukes in his seat, you'll understand why this is such a wonderful asset.Takes less space,(width), in the back seat. My 10 year old, and 8 year old in a backless booster, have more space than they did with the infant seat back there.He falls asleep in it easily stays asleep longer.Now what I didn't like...I didn't have to use the extra padding, and I'm not sure if I would have liked it. It's kind of stiff.You have to watch the straps. They will twist in the buckles, but this happens to all of the other car seats I've owned. Just be careful.I had to get a neck pillow to keep his head from falling too far to the side when he sleeps. It didn't seem to bother him, but I didn't like it.Over all this is a great seat. It is pretty tall, but I drive an 06 Kia Sorento, and it fits no problem.
I wanted a car seat that would serve an infant from birth and beyond their first year, and would fit in the back seat of my Toyota Tacoma 4door pickup truck. I FOUND IT! The First Years True Fit Recline Convertible Car Seat WITH THE REMOVEABLE HEAD-REST is exactly what I needed. I refused to spend a good chunk of change on one of those travel system car seats that would only last for maybe the first 3months *at best*, (and have you noticed that the majority do NOT come with their REQUIRED base?!); and then another good piece of green on another car seat that still had to be rear facing, and then again later on a toddler/booster seat. The additional expense just didn't make sense. I was further sold on this car seat when I saw the 360-degree views of it's features; not all of them of course. I love the snap-on/snap-off cover! Cleaning is going to be so much easier than having to work with the entire seat. I may not even have to remove the seat from the vehicle. Not having to unthread and then rethread the shoulder straps as the baby grows was the true big seller for me. I found out once I started exploring the seat at home that the bottom buckle strap is also just as easily adjusted. NO NEED TO THREAD; just push and slide to the desired position. The small level window at the foot of the seat turned out to be a huge help in knowing just how far back to recline the seat. It seems so simple, but any little tid-bits help.To those reviewers who are complaining about the instructions and supposed difficulty in handling and installing the car seat, I'm not sure I understand. Once it's out of the box, play around with it. There's no lose screws or need for any tools. Besides adjusting the straps to fit the baby and then \"latching\" it to your vehicle, there's little more to do. Not quite sure what a particular part does? Skim the instruction booklet.
My little guy was in one of those baby trend car seats that come with the jogging stroller. he always cried when we put him in it and it turns out he just felt wayyy too cramped. we put him in this bad boy and not a single peep.
I like this Car seat, but i do have a complaint, the instructions are wayyyy to complicated. it took us 2 hours to understand the instructions and when we actually understood it, we could see that it was so easy to install it. they should make the instructions less complicated.
We had this car seat for our daughter and when it was time to buy one for our son their was no question or shopping.  We bought it again - just in a different color than the first.  Great seat!
I took advantage of the free returns offered by Amazon and compared this 650 model with the 670 model and also with the model that is the same as Beethoven's 5th and a chocolate bar made by the brand starting with an E.I'm not going to be keeping this one, so here are the cons first:1) The fabric is a bit rough. Granted my baby most likely won't be naked in it, but he will be warm and in as little clothing as possible during our California summers.2a) The removable back/seat padding piece is kind of hokey. It has open teeth for the straps to fit into but it looks like it would get folded up weird and maybe get frustrating for both myself and the child.2b) The aforementioned pad covers up a square cut-out in the seat cover that would collect crap. It seems like having the extra padding is a must just to keep the hole covered up and that it would be uncomfortable for chubby legs to be rubbing up on the hole if it weren't covered up.3) There is no head padding for an infant. Most every other seat that is for infants+ has a little something for their floppy head. Not this one.4) The recline is a bit of an overstatement. It's not like the recline feature on most other reclining seats. It's a tiny plastic flip lever that raises the edge of the seat maybe an inch up.5) It is purely a plastic frame. Has no metal frame in it. The E brand's seat does have a metal frame.6) The main fabric is attached to the seat with snaps. I would be super afraid to wash this pad. At least if it had elastic you could force it back into position if it happened to shrink. Also, elastic loops are so much easier to fix/repair/replace on your own.7) The manual doesn't say how the level is supposed to read for correct installation. I read and reread it looking for it. Instead it's only color coded with numbers and x's. I assume that for rear facing the ball is supposed to be in the Green zone with the 2's and for front facing it's supposed to be in the yellow with the 1's? Or maybe it's always supposed to be in the Green. Who knows. I'm not keeping it so I don't care.8) The head rest piece for the booster doesn't lock into place. It's just a tight hold.Pros!1) The removable hokey pad is really padded! Seems like that would be really nice, and also add an inch to the kids height, and maybe be uncomfortable for a wide rear.2) The cup holder can be put on either side of the seat!3) Fits really well in the Prius! Fully 'reclined' rear facing, the passenger seat can still sit back almost all the way back. If the passenger seat is pulled up a bit it could even be slightly reclined and not hit the car seat.
Luckily, we bought this car seat when our daughter was just about ready to face forwards.  We used it rear-facing only for about a month.  The release button for the straps is located on the front edge of the seat.  So if it's rear-facing, and tight up against the seat back like it should be, it's nearly impossible to get your hand in between to pull the release button.  I would have to get into the back seat, and kneel with with one knee on the top of the carseat with all my weight, to pull it away from the seat back far enough to get my hand in.  Ugh.  If we had to do that any longer, I would have returned it.
When our first child was ready to graduate from his infant carrier carseat, we got a Britax Marathon for our primary vehicle and a First Years True Fit as the secondary seat for our less-used vehicle (it was quite a bit less expensive). This was after exhaustive research that centered on safety. While there was nothing WRONG with the Marathon, per se, I ended up liking the True Fit much better. It was roomier, had a cupholder that the Marathon was lacking, my child seemed to fit better and more comfortably in it, and it seemed to be designed better. The no-rethread shoulder strap system is one of the most ingenious ideas EVER. And the removable head-rest is great for a smaller/younger child in the rear-facing position (so the seat does not take up as much space in the rear, in turn giving the front driver or passenger more room up front).When it was time to move our second child from an infant carrier to a convertible, we recycled our first child's True Fit in our secondary car (it's still well within its 5-yr. lifespan), bought another (new) True Fit for our primary vehicle, and booted the Marathon to \"back-up\" status to be kept at grandma and grandpa's house. In my experience, the Marathon is not worth its designer price, and the True Fit is worth more than its comparably reasonable price.
While this seat appears well made and comfy, it is just monstrous!  I have a new Acura MDX SUV, and I couldn't put the driver's seat back when I put the car seat in the back in the middle, in the rear-facing position.  It is also VERY heavy!  It just won't work for me.
I purchased this car seat after my son was already 6 months old. For the first half of his life, we lived in the city and used public transportation, so we had no use for a car seat. I would have wanted one of those infant car seats that snaps into a base if I had been driving around during the first 6 months!I'm giving this seat five stars because it has some of the highest safety ratings for convertible car seats as rated by the NTSA [...] It feels incredibly durable, and when my son is in it I feel like he is surrounded by impact protecting wings and totally safe. Once you get used to how the seat works, adjusting the straps is pretty easy. There are lots of labels and features on the seat itself that help remind you of how it's installed, so that you don't have to constantly refer back to the manual. And the manual is stored in a handy little pocket in the back of the seat. However, it is definitely not for everyone.- If you have multiple cars, it is a pain in the butt to install and reinstall.- If you travel, it's huge and heavy. Putting it on a plane definitely requires two people. Lugging it through the airport is painful.- It is really big. Every car we've used it in as been an SUV, with the exception of one (a sedan) and it just barely fits in most of them. Sometimes the short parent has to drive, because the front seats can't be moved back far enough for the tall parent. I would definitely see if it fits your car if you have a small one before buying it online.That being said, it's comfortable and SAFE and I like having it and knowing my son is well protected in it.
