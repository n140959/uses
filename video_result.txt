B00627V4UU while filming this season- 911 happened. I was stunned at what happened to danny Sorenson. I wanted to see more of his character. after losing simone-this was too sudden. new characters emerged and were good too and the flow continued. still made me want to see more."
B00627V4UU I love NYPD Blue because it's so well written, has such great talent, and it is not overwhelmed with sex scenes.  Yes it contains some, but it's not all the time.  The stories are about people on the street and the everyday happenings of a cop shop.  Simply one of the best shows of its kind out there."
B0063BGBO4 Early Bret Easton Ellis novels and their subsequent film adaptations were famous for portrayals of disaffected youth doing naughty things and contemplating life. Now, imagine a handful of characters in their forties doing the same thing, and you've got I Melt With You. Rob Lowe, Jeremy Piven, Thomas Jane, and Christian McKay are old college buddies who meet up annually at Big Sur to celebrate a birthday, but with their own families and hidden secrets plaguing them, they embark on a week of drugs and parties until a tragedy forces them to face their past. Steer clear of I Melt With You, the film's laughable script and ludicrous plot points do nothing to help the actors trying so desperately to make something of the material."
B0063BGBO4 I MELT WITH YOU is a disturbing film - in the psychological/ psychosocial sense - but perhaps the most disturbing aspect of it is the fact that the title it is based on a song lyric, suggesting that the story may indeed be more universal than we imagine. To read the lyric is imperative to understanding the film: `(Let's stop the world) I'll stop the world and melt with you/ (Let's stop the world) I've seen some changes but it's getting better all the/ Time / (Let's stop the world) There's nothing you and I won't do/ (Let's stop the world) I'll stop the world and melt with you/ The future's open wide'When four 40-something college friends - Richard (Thomas Jane), Ron (Jeremy Piven), Jonathan (Rob Lowe), and Tim (Christian McKay) - meet up for their annual reunion, things start to spiral out of control, and a suicide pact they made as young men is revisited. A loud, and rather repulsive weekend of hardcore partying with drugs, alcohol, and sex - a binge in the beautiful Big Sur area - leads them to recognize that now they're all middle aged and not really happy about the directions their lives have taken. The fact that in their younger they made a pact while under the influence of drugs that if they were unhappy as middle-aged men, they'd kill themselves a pact they signed in blood. One of the men - Tim - is gay and is the most distraught and his decision to carry out the pact drives the remainder of the story to its end.This sad but conceivable story was written by Glenn Porter who with director Mark Pellington wrote the screenplay.  The dialogue borders on inane at times but the theme of the film is riveting. It is a disturbing story that only grows in the degree of wastefulness of lives in retrospect. Grady Harp, September 12"
B0063BGBO4 Firstly, let me tell you this film is about four friends and a week they spend together. They're all 44 years of age and the characters are varied. One is a self respecting artist/writer who says the artist should not be cynical, then you have a doc who is estranged from his family and his ex wife is remarried and he is suffering from helplessness blues, then you have an interesting sad happy homosexual man and lastly a regular guy with competitive genes. Four of them are trying their best to run away from their miseries during this get away and there is always some awesome music playing in the background. The music is an easy 10. The cast is mostly people you've seen on HBO (Entourage, West Wing, Hung..) The storyline is unique and I felt a constant surge of energy. If I could change something about the film, I'd add a few more sensitive dialogs without making it seem a little pushed. The editing could have been a little more \"free\" and that would have set it free. I can picture this film not doing too well and tanking completely but it had a few unique situations and conversations but towards the end like it's characters it ends up drugged and hungover which is why I really liked it, I guess. It was honest in that sense but a little more intelligence and... Anyway, thank you film-makers for the wonderful sound track, I have discovered some 10 good songs and varied artists. It is a good portray of the human condition and a dialog by Sasha Grey is quite possibly the best scene in the film. WATCH IT!"
B0063BGBO4 The acting was great but the movie felt like it was dragging on.  The drug use took away from character development and the plot was lacking.  With such a great cast, I was expecting something better.The sound track was good though."
B0063BGBO4 There are two questions one has to propose after watching an overwrought parable of a film like \"I Melt With You.\" Is the movie any good? And is it worth watching? I know some who feel these answers are always the same, but I don't. If someone asked me if Mark Pellington's outrageous examination of middle-aged regret was good, I'd have to say no. So over-the-top and patently ridiculous, the movie is an absolute mess tonally and thematically (even to the point of morphing into a thriller for its conclusion). But is it worth watching? There's something to be said about the absolute madness of it all that makes \"I Melt With You\" sickly fascinating. Even as I was laughing at how inept the story line felt, the movie kept pushing into greater and greater outrageousness. And I must admit, there is an odd entertainment factor to be gleaned from this unpredictability. While it may not be a \"good\" movie, it patently refuses to back down and play it safe. I respect that as well. My rating, therefore, is divided. I give it one star on merit and three stars for its bold commitment to lunacy. Overall, I'll make it two stars and predict that this is the love-it or hate-it proposition of the season.The movie introduces four childhood friends who get together once a year for a week of insane debauchery. Without much preamble or development, we meet the guys briefly in their everyday lives before they assemble at an isolated chalet. Thomas Jane, Jeremy Piven, Rob Lowe, and Christian McKay play the quartet and it's clear that, as a whole, they've been a pretty privileged bunch. But looks can be deceiving, or so the screenplay would have you believe. Each man is haunted by regret and the life not chosen. Despite being successful professionals (some with families), the trip instantly devolves into a drug-fueled music video of bad acts and excess. The movie, in these early scenes, has so little plot momentum that it seems a repetitive (and rather silly) glorification of poor choices and a complete disconnection with recognizable humanity. As each man faces his supposed demons and idealizes a more innocent time, the movie slows down to hear their hard luck stories. But one tragedy and a childhood promise will forever change these men. I won't reveal any more than that, other than to say that the movie just gets systematically more loony as it progresses.With pulsing music, disjointed camera work, and absolute hysterics, the movie becomes a preposterous thriller. To their credit, the actors never waver and all serve up deliciously over-the-top interpretations of \"real\" people. I know some will consider the subject matter provocative and thought-provoking, but it's so far out there--you can't take any of it seriously. But by the time the film enters its final 45 minutes (and the great Carla Gugino shows up), the movie has jumped a school of sharks (not just one) to enter bad movie nirvana. It's so bad, it's good! I'm not sure how anyone would get deep meaning out of \"I Melt With You,\" although its central premise is sound enough. If you do, however, good on you! For me, it's a master class of excess that takes itself way too seriously and thus becomes an absolute treat for lovers of bad movie mayhem. Without the slow start, maybe I'd have rated this higher for the delirium! As is, though, I hated it AND loved it (but for all the wrong reasons), yet am hard pressed to actually recommend it. Despite those that will proclaim it some sort of modern masterpiece, there's a reason its critical consensus on Metacritic is 26 out of 100. KGHarris, 8/12."
B0063BGBO4 This is actually a painful movie to watch and although the Richard character is truly disturbing ifnot despicable, the others are pretty well not worth watching at all.  There is so much drug and alcoholuse that the humanity is erased from the film.  Awful.  Do not bother unless you yourself are part ofthis drug culture that's being portrayed."
B0063BGBO4 This film is actually a lot better than I expected. Five college grads reunite at a beachhouse getaway for the weekend, when things go horribly wrong from depression and a plethora of drugs to add to the mix."
B0063ONN9C My daughter keeps asking to watch season 1 again even though we have season 2....not sure what that's about. The writing seems as vapid as usual to me. Whatever...."
B0063ONN9C I used to hate this show, but I guess it finally grew on me. My daughter is obsessed with it so I guess after a while I started to see the appeal. The songs are cute, the characters are cute too. The colors are bright and the animation is great. I like that the characters look different (they aren't all little white kids) and that there are boy mermaids! How darling! Also, Mr. Grouper is a teacher. Usually on tv teachers are portrayed as women and men are portrayed as wanting nothing (wholesome) to do with children. In the &#34;time for lunch&#34; segment at least one of the kids (usually Oona for some reason) has a healthy lunch item like a veggie burger or carrot sticks. I always think it's positive to show children enjoying healthy snacks, even if they are cartoon mermaid children.My daughter loves Nonni and Deema. Nonni is precious and his deadpan humor is in stark contrast to the antics of the other characters. Deema is a little diva (I think we all know a little girl like this) and my daughter loves her hair. She loves to draw swirls and say it's Deema's hair.Her favorite episode is the one with the witch (voiced by Wanda Sykes) who wants to turn everyone into frogs. The songs and story are very creative. I thought it was sweet how they made the Big Bad Wolf a total sweetheart and the Giant a softie.To be honest, I don't think it's very educational. I know it makes attempts at education but I really don't think it comes across. I don't mind letting my daughter have a bit of shallow entertainment in small doses, since she is advanced for her age. But for kids and parents there are more educational shows."
B0063ONN9C The songs are catchy and the characters and stories are super cute.  We are totally on the guppy train in this house :)"
B0063ONN9C I do really like it. It was very, very good because teach little lessons, dance and sing and just have fun.  It's a show that makes me laugh!"
B0063ONN9C My child loves this show.  It's great to watch them interact and learn.  I totally recommend it for any pre-schoolers"
B0063ONN9C My 3 1/2 year old granddaughter loves this series.  So happy to see it is available on Amazon, now she can watch whenever she likes."
B0063ONN9C Wonderful, family entertainment.  This program is both educational and delightful!  I love watching it with my son."
B0063ONN9C My 2 year old son loves this show! I am so glad he is able to watch it through amazon prime on my kindle! Cute, educational and fun!"
B0063ONN9C My granddaughter loves Bubble Guppies, and watches them as often as possible!  She is 4 years old.  It's colorful, has a catchy tune, and good story lines."
B0063ONN9C Kiddo adores this show. She love, love, loves the music and asks to watch the songs again and again. She even tries to copy the dancing! She's also learned a ton from the show. All those Mr. Grouper let's think about its she has memorized the answers and not just repeats them, but understands them. She even memorized the songs down to who dances/sings in the background on each one. It's like a kid magnet! If I play this when we're traveling random children drift over to us in the airport to look over her shoulder! Usually when we're at home I let her watch one show a day after lunch/before nap and it's usually this, Umizoomi, or a Go, Diego, Go (she's animal obsessed). Hope she continues to love it because she &#34;discovered&#34; this around the same time as Sesame Street and she's very over sesame. This keeps going strong!"
B0064JGWZS AMC is still making the best shows on TV, and this one is near the top.  It takes a while to develop the characters, but if you stick it out then the wait is well worth it."
B0064JGWZS I have watched many westerns with my Dad and this is one of the best! It tells about the beginning of the railroad and how the people have lived besides the main story about a Civil War Veteran that is looking for revenge toward the men that killed his wife and son. I can not wait for Season 3 to start on Aug. 10th!!"
B0064JGWZS I love to watch this show. And I'm not going to lie to you the main reason is because Anson Mount is so Hot. He really is the reason I started to watch the show."
B0064JGWZS I love the show as I said in the title and I'll say it again it is just great. I think the appeal for me is I like the character of Mr. Bohannan (Anson Mount) he really is the whole show and his character development has been great. I might even have a slight man crush on him I can't quite tell. I mean the show was not without its flaws but I don't agree with some of the directions some of the characters have taken (head shot) but still a great show and I'm excited for season 2.So to somebody who likes westerns likes cowboys and Indians and things like that this is a great series with high production value, great acting and amazing sets. They really set the stage for the time and you never feel a break from that period of time.Oh and one last thing I just love Mr. Bohannan's voice as you can tell from the title hopefully you read \"Yeah that seems about right\" in his voice because one of his lines from one of the shows and that's how I say it and I LOL every time.Enjoy the show as I know you will."
B0064JGWZS When I first heard about \"Hell on Wheels,\" I really thought it might be yet another unforgettable series. Instead, this is entertainment PLUS, all the way through Season One, that will have you waiting for the next Season, too (or is that, Two?)!Anson Mount is simply terrific as Cullen Bohannan and Colm Meaney is always a pleasure to watch! Great to see Monk's Ted Levine in a totally different role (though he doesn't make it through all of Season One!) and finally, a word of warning: the violence can get REALLY violent!I loved \"Deadwood\", but Hell on Wheels has made me forget all about it!"
B0064JGWZS I'm on the fence on whether or not I'll get another season. But I liked it enough to where I will keep it.  (If I don't like a DVD I purchased, I send it on to friends who might.)  I would actually rate it 3 1/2.  A little violent, but not quite as bad as other shows I've seen."
B0064JGWZS My wife and I recently had the delight of taking a guided tour through the streets of Tombstone, Arizona.  We're both history nuts, and our guide - a retired doctor who's gone about researching the peoples and places of the famed city for his own purposes - peppered his 2 and  hour presentation with modern pop culture references in order to help bring the days of the Wild West back to life.  In terms of authenticity at depicting the struggles of daily life for common folks, he rated two television programs very high.  The first - we guessed right - was DEADWOOD; the second was a bit of a welcome surprise: AMC TV's HELL ON WHEELS.HELL ON WHEELS appeared on AMC's schedule with relatively little pomp and circumstance ... at least, little by comparison to their competing programs MAD MEN and THE WALKING DEAD, which were given red carpet treatment.  The small, comfy Western's first season came and went with little critical acclaim, though it currently garners a respectable score of 63 on Metacritic's tracking poll.  Starring a practically unheard of Anson Mount in the lead, along with strong character actor Colm Meaney in a sizable secondary role, HELL ON WHEELS is `the story' of the old West, of pioneering a frontier and making it hospitable for the men, women, and children coming to populate it, all with a healthy bit of gunslinging vengeance thrown in for good measure.Cullen Bohannen (played by Mount) harbors a mystery: he's on a personal vendetta to find and kill the men who raped and murdered his wife while he was away fighting the Civil War.  In order to `fit in' inconspicuously amongst with the unruly types populating the expanding Western frontier, he takes a job as a crew chief for Thomas Durant (Meaney), rail baron.  However, Durant's sheriff - `The Swede' (Christopher Heyerdahl) - suspects Bohannen is secretly up to no good, and he goes forever out of his way to keep the man under his thumb.  The track will be laid, blood will be spilled, and vengeance will be had ... but at what costs to the players involved?What's particularly fascinating about the program is that - strictly from a character dynamic - Bohannen never knows who to trust, and this keeps the audience on the edge of its seat.  He's an effective boss, but he's constantly on his guard against others wanting the `top job' and willing to weasel it out of him.  Durant clearly suspects Bohannen's motives, but he's beholden to him at the same time for getting the tracks laid.  Lily Bell (Dominique McElligott) - a widower with strong ties to the train business - wants to trust the man, but she's drawn into her own affairs to set right the legacy of her late husband.  To its strengths, WHEELS becomes a kinda/sorta Western noir as the roles of `ally' and `adversary' always seem to be in flux for our main character.Also, the expansion of the frontier - the building of the railroad - serves as a metaphor for all the stories here.  No gains are made without great personal effort and sacrifice.  With each new stretch of track comes another turn into unsuspected treachery - be it financial, spiritual, or even territorial as the local Indian tribes seek to stop the `black beast' rampaging over their land.  But, in order to grow, something must be torn away first - or be crushed under the locomotive's mighty steam-driven wheels - and the frontier promises to always extract its price.Bohannen's primary storyline - vengeance - comes and goes throughout the course of the first season; it plays strongly into the pilot episode, as well as significantly in the season finale, but along the way he's allowed to grow a bit and come to grips with the consequences of his actions.  Where it'll all go is a mystery as the season ends on a bit of a dramatic upheaval (no spoilers, just a massive set-up that might change the stakes for all involved) ... but I'll definitely be on board once the train heads out again for the next season.If there is any weakness to the stories here, it's the prevalence of interracial relationships.  For some reason, it seems as if the writers were intent upon putting everyone through the ropes so far as `race matters' was concerned.  Granted, you've got your `whites,' your `blacks,' and your `native Americans' all thrown together at a time when the cultural melting pot was boiling on the stove, but I'd rather the program dial back the blossoming romances every-which-way and continue to tell great stories of exploration.  Bohannen's search for justice has enough teeth to carry the main narrative for a respectable amount of time; layering on secondary romance after romance only dilutes the tales into yet another `spin' on race relations that, so far, carries the same moral of the story: \"try to get along regardless of color, folks.\"  Plus, there's plenty of gibes made at the expense of the Irish.  Seriously, by the end of the season, I was hoping that the writers played out the race card so that it appears only sparingly in the episodes yet to come.  It grew tired real quick.Mount, in particular, does an impressive turn as the principle gunslinger here.  For a talent whose rarely been seen on the big and small screen, he brings a wit and a charm to his grizzled stare, and the West comes alive with the crack of his pistol.  He's an everyman plunged into an antihero's journey - a jaded past and a jaded future - every bit as mean and lean as the circumstances require of him.  Meaney feels a bit miscast, at times, but, as the season progresses, his character thankfully gets fleshed out a bit more.  The true grit here, though, goes to Heyerdahl's Swede; he chews scenery every time he's on the screen - a great foil to Mount's main thrust - and it'll be a pleasure to watch where this ticket takes him.HELL ON WHEELS is produced by a partnership of AMC with Entertainment One Television, Nomatic Pictures, (gayton)2, Endemol, Endemol Entertainment UK, and H.O.W. Productions.  DVD distribution is handled through Entertainment One.  The disc is solid with exceptional video and audio production qualities; it looks and sounds terrific.  Music is used to terrific effect throughout the first season, at times sparse and, other times, haunting.  There's a great array of special features, including several `making of' shorts and character bios as well as some additional focus providing key insight into the narrative of several episodes.  If you're looking forward to season two, then you'd do well to bone up on these in order to better grasp where the show may be headed when it comes back to the small screen.STRONGLY RECOMMENDED.  Fans of HBO's late foray into the contemporary Western DEADWOOD would do well to discover HELL ON WHEELS' charm; it isn't as obviously vulgar or gritty, but it captures the mystique of that certain time and place of the days long ago with equal emphasis on delivering a quality show with exceptional (if not minimalist) production qualities.In the interests of fairness, I'm pleased to disclose that the fine folks at Foundry Communications provided me with a DVD screener of HELL ON WHEELS: COMPLETE FIRST SEASON by request for the expressed purposes of completing this review."
B0064JGWZS I truly enjoyed watching this series- it has so much going for it. The setting is the backbone of \"Hell on Wheels\", and it convincingly brings this strange community (a camp of laborers at the western frontier, where the Union Pacific Railroad is being expanded upon and slowly extending its reach across the United States) to life. I could feel the filth and desperation of this world, as well as the aching backs and blistered hands of the men who were worked to the bone by their merciless \"walking bosses\".Equally strong are the actors who were cast to bring the characters of \"Hell on Wheels\" to life. The two protagonists, Mr. Bohanan and Mr. Ferguson, are absolutely fantastic. Though deeply flawed, I could not help but find myself rooting for them... even though they were oftentimes at odds with each other, making for a somewhat muddled viewing experience. But that is by no means a complaint. This is the result of brilliant writing (and acting), and all who were involved in the process deserve to be commended for their efforts.The only thing holding this first season back from five stars is some tired cliches (the wild eyed preacher, the angry Irishman, etc.), as well as some absurdly gratuitous violence that I feel was included simply because that's the trendy thing to do on cable TV nowadays. I have no problem whatsoever with violence in media, and I thought much of it was well placed in \"Hell on Wheels\". Confrontations between Native Americans and railroad workers made sense, as did the constant disputes among laborers. But do we really need to see things like the well dressed railroad tycoon mutilating bodies in order to make for compelling newspaper photos? The answer is no, my friends. That's in there simply to get a rise out of the viewers. Ugh. Such a boring, tired concept.But by no means should you let these minor criticisms prevent you from watching this series, particularly if you're a fan of period pieces, the HBO series \"Deadwood\" (from which influence was clearly drawn), or American history. This is fantastic television- no question about it. Can't wait for season two."
B0064JGWZS The series deals with the post Civil War expansion westward through the eyes of a former Confederate soldier who lost his wife and only child to Union soldiers.  Bohannon, our hero, joins the railroad crew as he finds a clue to the death of his wife.  Working with the railroad is secondary to his own justice and revenge.Season One is tawdry, dirty, and often horrid in the showing of the wretched life and conditions these men, and many women, were subjected.  Alliances, both easy and uneasy, are born and die as quickly as they are needed or no longer useful.Hell On Wheels has a feel of grittiness from beginning to end.  Some may find this a little too overpowering for their senses. Others will enjoy the series for not sugar coating the ugliness of the times."
B0064JGWZS Is it original? Yeah. Is it poorly done? Yes, definitely. Very bad show. It's hard to care about any of the characters. The actors are just there for a paycheck. If you're a dullard, you'll think this is a great show. If you've seen better, forget it."
B0064JGWZS Historical value. I've actually sent history students home to watch this one. Even the weapons are well thought out for this series."
B0064JGWZS As much as Cullen Bohannon's adventures are interesting, and Colm Meaney's character is compelling, and Tom Noonan is just... wacko, sadly the show doesn't work as well as it should.The show, as another reviewer here pointed out, is DEADWOOD Light. It even uses many of the same tropes as that program did (mysterious and violent yet forthright man; naive yet beautiful recent widow; SOB boss who runs everything in the surrounding area; unconventional and troubled preacher), but that's nothing revolutionary to a Western. These are pretty common all around.The story of the building and connecting of the Transcontinental Railroad is pretty darned compelling, but obviously, that needs to be dressed up a little more: The Black and Irish workers, the side-businesses in the camp, the little pieces of subterfuge and manipulation; this is apparently the drama driving the show forward. Again, sadly, it's just not compelling enough to maintain interest for those who have seen this show before and seen it better cough*DEADWOOD*cough.While freshman showrunners Tony and Joe Gayton (who also wrote the somewhat-entertaining Dwayne Johnson/Billy Bob Thornton B-movie FASTER) deserve props for doing their very best to make this look and feel authentic, the characters and the story are just too bland and too stock (much like FASTER) and the performances, with a few exceptions, don't flesh them out further. I really wanted to like this show, too, since AMC has a few of the very best shows on TV right now. I DVR'd every episode and watched the first four, but everytime I thought about watching a new episode, I just felt like it was a chore, and that is not the feeling you want when you sit down to watch TV. Oh, well."
B0064JGWZS I can not say enough great things about this series. Well written, and the actors are wonderful. I have been searching for a great western type series to watch..and Shazam, here it is. This is a must see!!"
B0064JGWZS Hell on wheels gets much better as the program progresses from one episode to the next. If you only watched the first one or two episodes you may not be very impressed with the show at first. As the episodes progress the characters get more interesting and the story as well. The only problem with this program is that they've taken on a very big subject with a very low budget. If you go to their website and look at the production information you'll see what I mean. Considering the program renewed for another season may be the budget will be bigger and the producers will be able to present a better picture of just how grueling it was to build that railroad. If the storyline has the characters stay in one location as it would appear to be headed at the end of the first season the show will probably not see a third season. With a program like Deadwood you can have a show that is primarily character driven but when you have a show about building a railroad you need more than that. Nevertheless when the program returns in early 2013 I will definitely buy it."
B0064JGWZS By Jim Clark, publisher, Lee County Courier, Tupelo, MSI'm usually a fan of shows or movies which have a basis in history. Hell On Wheels fits that mold.Producers Joe and Tony Gayton got the idea from seeing a documentary.\"We [Joe and I] started talking and remembered this story, American Experience, which was this really great documentary, and I thought, 'God, that's great. I just learned a bunch of stuff I had never learned before.' You just have this cursory information that the Chinese and the Irish built the railroad, but it got in underneath all the dirt and stuff that went on, with the financing of it, and the greed and corruption. ,\" Tony said.The lead character Cullen Bohannon (Anson Mount) is on a mission. The ex-confederate soldier is out to revenge his wife and son, who were killed by Union soldiers. He knows Union soldiers are working with the transcontinental railroad, to protect the venture from outlaws and Indians. He gets a job from Thomas \"Doc\" Durant to supervise an all-black \"cut crew.\"He meets and eventually becomes friends with Common (Elam Ferguson), a recently freed slave, who is trying to figure out what to do with his freedom.Another important character is Lily Bell (Dominique McElligott). Her husband, a surveyor was killed by Indians and she barely escaped. Her husband was partners with Doc, and he had maps which showed the course the railroad must take through the mountains. Doc courts her, mainly concerned on the front end with getting those maps.Hell On Wheels  is a great series, full of potent images, memorable characters and a story line that's believeable and rememberable. It was renewed for a second season."
B0064JGWZS Hell on wheels is a Great series, good story lines, love the chemistry of the cast. I will be getting season 2."
B0064JGWZS This is a very gritty series about building a railroad after the civil war and the trials and tribulations that the workers had to go through.  Lots of little sub-plots throughout that keep things interesting."
B0064JGWZS I very much enjoyed this fast-paced, semi-historical western series. Super exciting and full of suspense. The part I liked the most is that it wasn't like the HBO series \"Deadwood\" that throws out an F-Bomb every minute or two (literally). Sure there is some spicy talk, but it's not overdone in my opinion. There are elements (like the \"Soiled Doves\") that are just saucy enough without being disgusting. I think the blood and gore are a bit much, but every action-film is getting to be like that. Note to Hollywood filmmakers: Not everyone wants to actually SEE a man's head being blown off! We are intelligent enough to get what is happening without seeing a ton of blood and gore. So, anyway, other than a few moments where I had to close my eyes during the action scenes, I was riveted to the screen. Definitely give this series a chance. (Also, the 1st season is better than the 2nd...just FYI)."
B0064JGWZS With all the success that AMC has had recently turning out high quality adult programs such as \"Mad Men\" and \"The Walking Dead,\" few new dramas in 2011 were as eagerly anticipated as their Western revival \"Hell on Wheels.\" Despite a somewhat mixed reaction from the mainstream media, the show was an instant hit when its premiere episode became the network's second highest rated debut in history. And yet, despite these big numbers and impeccable production values, it is still very much a show that is finding its way creatively and dramatically. There are so many reasons to recommend \"Hell on Wheels\" and yet it takes a while to find its footing after a powerhouse beginning. For most of its ten episodes, I found myself admiring the show's technical construction as opposed to loving its storytelling arc.The two strongest components of the show (evident from the very beginning) were its lavish depiction of the Old West with some spectacular battles and effects and a dynamic lead villain in Colm Meaney. The story opens in a post-Civil War America with an enigmatic soldier (Anson Mount) seeking revenge for the murder of his wife by Union officers. His journey puts him in the heart of a railroad construction project led by Meaney at an untamed post on the outskirts of civilization. There are working girls, disgraced clergy, thuggish bosses, newly emancipated slaves, a Native American presence and a myriad of other unscrupulous business types coexisting in this tempestuous microcosm and seeking to exploit the new possibilities on the road west. Meaney is absolutely terrific and other notable performances are turned in by Common (unexpectedly solid as a sometimes ally of Mount) and Tom Noonan (as a preacher trying to reform his life). While the entire cast is quite good, some of the peripheral characters have yet to be developed in any meaningful way.There is no denying that \"Hell on Wheels\" is a handsome and extremely well executed from a technical standpoint. From the sets to the costumes to the effects, there are some pretty spectacular action set pieces and period recreations. It's obvious that many people love \"Hell on Wheels.\" I wished I had been more emotionally connected to the earlier episodes, it took about half of the season before I felt really invested. After that, though, I really loved much of what came next. There are so many strong elements at work here--I was willing to be patient. The skeleton for a improved second season is in place. As long as the show digs deeper into its characterizations, there's no reason to think it can't develop into one of TV's best dramas. Not fully cooked and sometimes relies on too many cliches, but it has enormous potential. And it sure does look great! KGHarris, 5/12."
B0064JGWZS This series is about the contradictions in our national history as we re recovered from the civil war,aftermath of slavery, Indian wars, personal trauma, growing industrialization. The story lines are absorbing and the acting is generally very good with particular praise for Anson Mount as Bohannon, Thor Heyerdahl as Swede, and Ted Levine as Johnson.  Levine plays a railroad overseer who turns out to have played a crucial role in the hero's traumatic past. He is outstanding in the role. I don't want to say more so as not to spoil it for those who have not yet seen the series.If you enjoy historical sagas like Deadwood, Hatfield and McCoys you will enjoy this absorbing drama."
B0064JGWZS A colleague recommended I check out this series and I'm so glad I did.  It's a great story - very different from what is on TV right now.  I will order the second season as well and try to catch the third season when it's on TV.  This was reasonably priced and a great way to be introduced to the series."
B0064JGWZS I stumbled on this series and was blown away. It is the best!  Love everything about it. Acting and casting is first rate. I love Ian Tracy and he is perfect The story is clever..  I can't wait for season 2 starting aug 12, 2012.  The scenery is gorgeous. The star is a hunk too. Can't say enough positive things about Hell on Wheels.  A wonderful example of when film is good it can be really really good!"
B0064JGWZS I wasn't expecting the solid greatness this fantastically written, directed and acted TV series gave me. Most TV westerns of recent years have been a mixed bag. Mostly short series, not ongoing like this one.AMC has really got a winner on their hands here. And thus far season 2 is just as great. If you like your characters deep, and your western action exciting, then Hell on Wheels will fill your bill."
B0064JGWZS This could have been good..it could have been great. But, in order to please blood-thirsty audiences, I assume, too many scenes were sensationalized with blood, violence, and gore and a huge turn-off."
B0064JGWZS This movie was very very good. I cannot wait to buy the second and third seasons of Hell on Wheels now."
B0064JGWZS There are some things to like in this show and some things to definitely dislike. But first off this is a tale set shortly after the American Civil War, focusing on a Confederate veteran who is seeking several men who did his deceased wife wrong. Turns out these people have gone west to work for the railroad company looking to reach the Pacific Ocean by a certain point. Of course, the tale branches off into several subplots and layered relationships. Colm Meaney, who some might remember from STAR TREK, is best known to me and plays an investor with a stake in this venture as it will hopefully make him his fortune. The outfits and looks of things feel right though the dialogue at times feels a bit too modern. It's slow in the beginning but that's because they're developing several subplots which will eventually overlap. There's some good coverage of relations between Irish and former slaves which is well done and has a great deal of truth to it for the era (both sides were competing for similar jobs), as well as the effects Manifest Destiny had upon the American Indians in the way (anybody else recognize a certain actor from LAST OF THE MOHICANS?) of progress. There are also some nice contradictions in the series, like evangelists preaching alongside hookers at work and talk of fair wages amidst rampant racism. For Deadwood fans I'd say this is better than the third season but certainly not the first and arguably a notch down from the second season. Budgetary concerns kept out Chinese Americans which got criticisms. The show is hoping to rectify this in the second season but it all depends on finances. On that note this premiere was the second most popular of AMC shows to date bringing in 4.4 million viewers. CHARACTER/DIALOGUE: B; STORY/PLOTTING: BVISUAL FEAST SCENERY POTENTIAL: B to B plus; GETS THE PERIOD RIGHT (for TV viewers): B to B plus; OVERALL GRADE: B to B plus; WHEN WATCHED: December 2011."
B0064JGWZS I really enjoy gritty westerns, epecially any with Clint Eastwood, so I like many were amazed with HBO's three season run of Deadwood. Hell on Wheels is nearly as dirty and raw, minus the language and nudity, as that show, but a couple of episodes ran rather slow and at times some scenes were unbelievable. The acting is solid throughout and the main character (featured on the DVD cover) who happens to look like Daniel Day-Lewis is someone I've never heard of before, but does a solid job. Even rapper Common proves he has some acting ability in the sidekick role.Miss Deadwood? Check out the weaker but still entertaining Hell on Wheels."
B0064JGWZS American TV continues its run of quality series with this Western set in post Civil War America.  There is a sense of the familiar in the way the episodes are put together, using the editing and music stylistic choices that have worked well in other quality TV series, but satisfyingly there is also a sense of something new, in the setting and the characters.  The setting is a gritty - well no, lets make that muddy, settlement which houses the workers on the railroad, and moves from time to time to stay where the work is - hence the title.  Into this town of ex slaves, immigrants, criminals and whores, comes an ex-Confederate soldier, on the trail of Union soldiers who murdered his wife.  However the pleasure in the series isn't this slim character arc, but rather getting to know the range of characters who subvert the usual clich&eacute;d expectations in Western - yes, we get the hooker with a heart of gold - but her history is an unexpected one, and yes, we get the lone preacher trying to convert the wretched hive of scum and villainy - but his character is also not as we at first expect.  Even Colm Meaney's magnificent railroad baron is a treat, as he defies expectations and manipulates (and occasionally is manipulated) those around him.  The head of security is a fantastic creation - The Swede, and then there is Common, playing the ex slave, and Dominique McElligott as the Englishwoman who supplies the beauty against the range of beasts on display.  They're all well drawn and well acted characters, which makes this an eminently watchable series.I had the same view as others as I watched this, that it was good to have aDeadwood: The Complete Series [Blu-ray] substitute back on screen - but in fact it's kind of unfair to compare the two.  The settings are quite different, though both maximise the drama by using a very distinct geographically bounded area to set their scene.  They are both down and dirty and show humanity at more lows than highs, but I would suggest there is a hint more optimism here, even if we still have the violence and cursing and whoring.  I am not an expert on the period, but the railroad crews are an interesting point of view to peek into this period of history and convinces as to its authenticity thanks in large part to its utterly committed cast.  I for one am looking forward to the next series..."
B0064JGWZS I love this series and had to have the discs. I plan to watch this many times over. Go Hell on Wheels!"
B0064JGWZS The reviews about poor historical accuracy caused me to hesitate to buy this series. Since I don't know that much about the exact history, any artistic license taken did not bother me. This show is great and the 3rd season is in my WishList."
B0064JGWZS Set Tivo to capture this show when it started and after first, set to get season pass. Interesting, well done, multiple complex character show with old West as backdrop. More than a Western. Some history that seems to ring true even if it actually isn't. Rough and tumble and bloody at times. I do like series and hope to catch all of season 2. Recommend."
B0064JGWZS Deadwood (2004-2005) was the last good &#34;authentic&#34; Western show......until now.  Hell On Wheels does an excellent (and authentic) job of re-creating the era (post-Civil War; dawn of the Transcontinental Railroad), while still mixing in enough drama, sex and intrigue to attract more than just history buffs.  All-in-all, an excellent first season; I just purchased season 2, so we'll see if the legacy continues."
B0064JGWZS Cullen Bohannan (Anson Mount) provides a most interesting protagonist in this realistic post Civil War drama/action series. Cullen is seeking revenge for the defilement and death of his wife during Sherman's destruction of Meridian, Mississippi. As Cullen gets his revenge, he comes to find out there is more to the story. He is unique in that he married a Northern woman, and freed his slaves prior to the Civil War and hired them to work his fields. He also claims no belief in God as he comes across as a second amendment atheist. Rapper Common did an excellent job as Elam.Cullen takes up with the railroad in the wild prairie land as Native American raids become one of many the dangers in this traveling road show known as \"Hell on Wheels\" which includes people who support the men such as prostitutes, preachers, and picture men.While the costume details and history appear authentic, there was one thing that caught my ear: The derogatory word for a Chinese worker (rhymes with clink). The first known use of the word was in 1890. The film starts in 1865. Appears to be some sloppy research.My main criticism of the series is that it moves at a slow soap opera pace.No f-bombs, sex, or nudity in the pilot. Things get a little spicier in the series."
B0064JGWZS Hell on Wheels is set several years after the USA Civil War and concerns the struggles of building the transcontinental railroad.  An interesting time period to explore and very well done set pieces.  It's just shy of HBO's Deadwood in terms of authenticity and character but if you enjoy this time period or \"the old west\" you will enjoy this show.  Good job AMC!"
B0064YPHEK Love the Nature series. Its educational, enlightening and entertaining. There are even some episodes I'm not sure i want to watch ...but they suck me in and i end up enjoying."
B0064YPHEK I liked the premise at the beginning of following the raccoons given collars, but then the focus shifted to other cities.  By the time it shifted back to the Toronto study there was not enough time to get much information.  I think it would have been more interesting to focus on the original study with perhaps just a few remarks about the Japanese and German ones."
B0064YPHEK What a great series!  I will watch it again and again.  One photographer dug a four foot by four foot pit and lived in it for seven months to get a shot of Siberian tigers!  It's a great series."
B0064YPHEK The nature series is very entertaining while enlightening and does pass on a lot of knowledge. This series should be in curriculums in elementary school."
B0064YPHEK The doucmentary was good.  Interesting but not in great detail.  The poor video quality made it hard to watch.  Interesting about the Harpy Eagle, but I had to go to other websites to get more detailed information"
B0064YPHEK I love Nature but do not have cable TV or a local PBS station to watch so I was happy to see it on Amazon Prime but sadly not a lot of episodes.  Hope they add more at some point."
B0064YPHEK it is just great nature show...heads above those on animal planet and other channels similar such as discovery etc.  watch it"
B0064YPHEK The particular episode I watched about odd animal friends was so heartwarming and so different to see animals grow up together that would usually be enemies.sometimes it's like humans if you aren't yet taught to hate you don't know you aren't supposed to be friends."
B0064YPHEK I like this series. Each episode is interesting and some of them are downright fun! They're not controversial at all."
B0064YPMOU I was still in High School when that war ended for the US but had some recollection of events both in the classroom and newspapers and broadcasts.  I also have an older brother who served two tours there.  This was an amazing piece of documentary work.  Both the visual content and narration was amazing.  I really can;t say enough about this series.  Watch it."
B0064YPMOU This was an excellent series and I highly recommend it to anyone with an interest in this war and the struggles our Soldiers and country faced."
B0064YPMOU I enjoyed watching the series. I enjoy Vietnam movies. I grew up watching the war on television and worrying that I would be drafted into the war. The war ended before I finished high school. Confusing time in America during the war with the protests against war, civil rights movements and riots. It was good to see the soldiers point of view from the private up to the general."
B0064YPMOU decent real footage and objective reporting. Welcome the insertion of facts and events that were not presented before, butexisted non-the-less."
B0064YPMOU *Added 21 January 2014: The latest reviews offer an interesting insight into this series. There are even more reviews than expected and they are less critical! During WWII the 'enemy' was obvious. Vietnam is more easily compared to Afghanistan.Original review date 14 September 2013:How to explain our involvement in Vietnam? How to explain our country divided? This is a beginning to try and help one understand the reality . . .  my generations's war. Photographs and video footage bring a reminder of what happened but cannot give back the lives lost. Familiar and yet different, an intimate view of what happened and what was to come. I found the narration to be well done even it didn't always match the footage. The nightmare scenarios followed one after another and the lessons were learned too late. Who they were, where they were from and what they did, create a video worth watching/listening.['Army Brat' . . . both daughter and wife]The wrenching reality of this series is by far superior to most Vietnam documentaries. The original review remains as written and I have chosen to append these comments after purchasing and viewing the entire series. My own knowledge came from those who served 'in country,' veteran sites and archives. For those who want a simplified comprehensive assessment, this series presents an overwhelming abundance of information for both the personal and political overview.  Thank you to all those who served our country and to those that made this documentary possible."
B0064YPMOU I felt this was the best Vietnam War documentary I've ever seen.  Not only is the war in Vietnam given a broad look, but also what was going on back in the states, and how our vets were treated."
B0064YPMOU A very good albeit short history of the Vietnam war.  Some not before seen footage.  Worth a watch."
B0064YPMOU Very well done. The film footage show a lot of what was happening and took me back to the way things were."
B0064YPMOU This  series should be required viewing for any politician that wants to get the US  into another war.  Very moving sequences and personal  experiences.  Some of the footage was shown repeatedly."
B0064YPMOU I grew up during this war and remember watching some of the things mentioned during tv newscasts. I am not sure how exact it is historically but I feel like it was a good representation of the series of events that happened during this time period in American history"
B0064YPMOU Absolutely fantastic! Shows the real war as it was, not as it was portrayed to be by our government. If you are a war historian then you need to see this program!"
B0064YPMOU This is a greats series. It gives the viewers insights into the minds of the young men and women who served and fought in the Viet Nam war. I am a history buff and study a lot about this period in American history (my father served in Viet Nam in 1966)."
B0064YPSRG This is a quirky romantic comedy about a young man in New York City, who is a pickpocket. He meets a woman and has a passionate affair on a one night stand. She finds out she's pregnant and confronts him with choices and challenges he must make in order to continue the relationship. Very funny, Enjoyable, and Entertaining. Highly Recommended!"
B0064YPSRG First of all, don't pay any attention to any bad reviews, I seriously doubt these people actually watchedthis movie. For an independent, it was quite a surprise. Facinelli does a terrific job with the screenplay abouta pickpocket trying to pay off his Father's $500,000 debt to scumbag Vincent Gallo. Along the way, he manages tolift a badge from Michael Madsen, who works for acknowledged superfreak William Forsythe (in a very subdued role)and then all hell breaks loose.As our lead is being pursued by seemingly the entire NY City police force, his mom breaks bad with Joe Pantoliano,and he \"accidentally\" bumps into and falls in love with the beautiful, but recently impregnated, Jaimie Alexander,with whom he had a one night fling then apparently forgot about.The writing is tight, the characters are well cast, there is humor, drama, intrigue, and romance, and this is MichaelMadsen's best role since ... well since hell I cant remember... a long damn time.Anybody that doesn't like this movie needs their heads examined. For its budget, a solid 4.5 stars."
B0064YPSRG LOOSIES like so many other art house films that take a while to build an audience, but then enjoy a faithful following. But this film is a real find: Peter Facinelli is known to everyone as the head of the Cullen Clan in the vampire TWILIGHT series and as the goofy delusional doc on the NURSE JACKIE TV series (and from roles in a lot of small films where he didn't get the notice he deserved). But who could tell that this tall stud muffin natural comedian could also write? Facinelli came up with the story and wrote the screenplay for LOOSIES and he also stars as the main character - and he is a hands-down winner in each category. Director Michael Corrente seems to let Facinelli have the film and he plays it to the hilt while at the same time molding into a solid ensemble of fine actors.Bobby (Peter Facinelli) is a young pickpocket in New York City, snatching wallets, cellphones, briefcases and money as slick as any pro could perform. He lives with his mother Rita (Marianne Leone, wife of Chris Cooper!) and follows his life of petty crime to pay off his recently deceased father's gambling debt. All his work is turned over to Jax (Vincent Gallo), a filthy clod of a guy who berates Peter's inability to go big time in theft. Bobby is a fairly happy-go-lucky guy until he accidentally encounters Lucy (Jaimie Alexander), a beautiful girl who works in a bar but who Booby happened to have a memorable one-night stand with three months ago. Lucy confronts Bobby, Bobby doesn't remember her name, and when Lucy informs him that their little tryst created a pregnancy, Booby tries to do the right thing and find the money to give Lucy to 'take care of the pregnancy'. This leads to a serious of crazy events: Bobby needs big money, mistakenly lifts a police badge form a cop (Michael Madsen) whose boss (William Forsythe) threatens to fire him unless he can get his badge back. The 'cops and robbers' scene plays out: Lucy doesn't want to be associated with a pickpocket despite the fact there is a newly rediscovered chemistry with the changing Bobby, Bobby resents his mother's finding a boyfriend Carl (Joe Pantoliano) who owns a jewelry store, but plans a gig with Jax to work a deal with Carl to get the cops off his tail and allow him to become the guy he really wants to be.How Bobby makes his way through this complex plot is the magic of the fine writing and the first class acting by the surprisingly hunky Facinelli. Jaimie Alexander is a terrific find, and the cameo roles by Vincent Gallo, Marianne Leone, Joe Pantoliano et al are beautifully realized. 'Loosies', by the way, is the term for loose cigarettes that people can but without investing in a pack. Seeing the film, titled so appropriately, will make the audience sit up and pay attention to Peter Facinelli in a totally new realm of respect. He is VERY good! Grady Harp, April 12"
B0064YPSRG For some writer's block reason a skilled pickpocket doesn't understand high school biology about reproduction and gets a girl pregnant and doesn't understand how it was possible. Duh! Anyway, tediously long script showing the pickpocket art of stealing cellphones to pay a debt to a not-so-nice fence while running from the cops. Stereotypes of coping with the girl's pregnancy and dragging her into the fray only to have her turn his life around. Usual stereotypes of dumb cops, double crosses and redemption. Actors were cast for their respective roles by looks and the robotic acting showed why, Twilight obsessed vamps notwithstanding.A bit concerned with the consistent and continual portrayal throughout the movie that lying, stealing, avoiding responsibility, drinking, bad parenting all were shown in a positive light while the cops come out as conniving drinking dumbasses."
B0064YPSRG A hardly memorized movie of a not-so-bad looking guy avoiding sexual encounters while a story is about his choices as he was accused in making one pregnant during a one night stay.Not much at all."
B0064YPSRG Nice little romantic \"comedy\". One of those where things just go from bad to worse and one has to shake one's head. Liked both main characters and think they did decent acting jobs. Could be a data movie for 25 - 30's.  Recommend as entertainment."
B0064YPSRG I have to say that I am a huge fan of Peter Facinelli, having said that this movie could not have entertained me any more. He did a superb job with the part as did the rest of the cast."
B00669UD0Q A Lonely Place To Die is a solid film.  It's about a group of young Scottish hikers programmed for adventure.  They're quite happy about their journey at first... until one guy from the group goes to take a leak and hears the faint sounds of a little girl crying for help.  They then realize the girl is underground so they dig and dig... and eventually find her.  However there's no time to celebrate I'm afraid, as it's quickly discovered that these hikers are being hunted by two crazy men with guns and a Russian accent (at least I think it's Russian).For the first half of the movie, these hikers are literally running and climbing rocks for their lives as the crazy gunmen continue to stand around, reload and fire at their targets, and hey, if they intended to wipe out the hikers backpacks, they succeeded with flying colors, har har!Anyway the hikers are now on a mission to protect the little girl that they freed and saved from the underground box she was forced to squeeze into, and after the first half with all that intense mountain climbing and careful maneuvering the storyline eventually rolls into town... not sure *which* town exactly, but the gameplan remains the same- protect the girl no matter what.  Unfortunately  now the gunmen are more aggressive than ever.You see apparently the little girl is valuable but I wasn't really sure in what way, and if her importance was explained I didn't catch it (and I even tried as hard as I could to understand the accent of the two gunmen but every so often a few hard to comprehend lines were thrown in there).There's some really graphic segments in this movie.  The one that surprises me the most is the one where two of the hikers were simply climbing down from a mountain and suddenly the guy standing on top of the rocks falls down the mountain to his death on a row of rocks beside a river.  It's an amazingly graphic scene and makes me sick when you realize how fragile life can be for a mountain climber- one wrong move and that's it, you're done.  The woman who was positioned halfway down the mountain turns around and sees her friend falling as it happens, and she lets out a terrifying and realistic scream that really bothers me.Overall, I really like this movie.  The Scottish accents are easy to understand, the woman most persistent on protecting the female child is really beautiful, the acting is fantastic, the action and suspense is constant, and it's just a wonderful movie."
B00669UD0Q This movie requires patience, but if you don't have it just fast forward till it looks interesting.  This is a decent thriller, but not overly thrilling.  I just couldn't get into the characters.  I watched it but I found myself fast forwarding which I don't do very often.  I think perhaps this movie needed better editing, there was to much footage of mountain scenery, parade, et cetera.  Had they trimmed there and developed the characters more it would have been better.  It doesn't take all that much to figure out what is going on, and they dragged us with all the extra footage.  There are some great scenes of them escaping the bad guys, but they needed a bad guy boss on the scene with some character.  The bad guys are okay but nothing made me think, oh those guys really scare me (see John Lithgow's great performance in Cliffhanger).  In fact I think they were made to look so cold blooded I just didn't care about them at all.  The five people on the mountain are decent, but only a couple I halfway felt I knew a little by the end.  The police that try to help are barely developed so once again they are okay.  They needed more screen time because I started to like the black cop, but didn't get time to really know him.  The girls father at the end was more interesting because you could feel his intensity.  All-in-all a pretty decent movie but it had a lot more potential had they developed more of the characters and spent less time on the surroundings. I love scenery and sets, but they don't make the movie, the actors and story do.  At this less than seven dollar price it is worth buying.Recommendations:Shoot to Kill,Cliffhanger, andThe Eiger SanctionCA Luster"
B00669UD0Q In the immortal words of Charlie Brown,\"Argh!\".  This film is terrific for its first two-thirds.  Director Julian Gilbey wratchets the tension in this portion immeasurably.  Gilbey seems to be taking his cues from John Boorman's \"Deliverance\" and Walter Hill's \"Southern Comfort\" in exploring the age old themes of man versus an unforgiving natural terrain combined with threats from his fellow man.  It's in the film's final third where things go terribly awry.  It's here where the film devolves into a second rate \"Taken\" that makes little narrative sense.  I'm ambivalent about recommending this movie.  If you must proceed there's a lot of good stuff but you have to divorce it from the dross."
B00669UD0Q A Lonely Place To Die is a very Atmospheric film that not only has beautiful scenery and cinematography but also packs a punch as far as storyline and execution.The Acting is first rate and it is what it is, there really aren't any big aha moments or unexpected twists.The group of mountain climbers are in a race for their lives and the life of the little girl they saved from a man made underground prison.Many lives will be lost be it the pursuers and /or the Climbers.The main question is why do the men with heavy artillery chasing them want the girl so bad,where did she come from and will she be returned safety and will any of the climbers be alive to make sure she is?One of the best adventure/suspense thrillers of the year in my opinion because it's no nonsense and cuts right to the literal chase.There is quite a bit of violence and blood but nothing that put's it in Slasher mode although I have seen many slashers with less blood.Bottom line it's well worth a rent and even a buy."
B00669UD0Q There have been some number of adventure thrillers where mountain climbing is at the heart. For my dollar this is well worth seeing.Here's the scoop. Five friends start out to climb a mountain. By pure chance they come across a young girl held in a makeshift underground vault. They realize she's been kidnapped for ransom and proceed to free her and make their way off the mountain, only to find her kidnappers are on their tail. Who will prevail in this game of cat and mouse?Given the mediocre reviews I almost didn't hit the play button on this. I was glad I did. It's better than I anticipated. It's directed and shot well. Great respect is shown for the mountains and landscapes. It gives the viewer a good sense of nature without looking like a travelogue. The pursuit is generally pretty good. There were a couple of cheap shots in the script. Face it. Playing the gun jamb card at a crucial part of the proceedings just doesn't cut it any more. But a lot of nifty things do happen elsewhere. Making the kidnapped girl an Eastern European, with the subsequent communication barrier causing more problems, was a nice touch. Things DID get a bit muddy for me when the guys with the ransom money enter the fray. I had a difficult time hearing what they were saying so I think I missed out on some important stuff.The acting by the climbers, particularly Melissa George, was pretty good. The bad guys didn't do much more than shoot their guns so it's hard to gauge their acting skills.This isn't quite worth the 4 stars I gave it but it's certainly better than 3. If you like action/adventure flicks you could do much worse."
B00669UD0Q Tossing bits of formula storyline into a box and shaking it does not produce anything but jumbled stuff. Just a few examples follow even though the entire movie is poorly edited, directed and the acting came across as actors just acting the roles and not understanding the roles. This potpourri strains credulity which for this type of movie you have to have.(1.) Pointless most of the first half hour showcasing partying at a climbing lodge. Helicopter scenic shots of hills, birds and the usual vehicle on a road. Overbearing drum and piano pounding sound effects to create tension when the acting and story is flat.(2.) Lots of scenes of Scottish Highlands at camera angles that made hills look like mountains; streams look like white water rapids. Pointless time spent on a very small town pagan honorific festival with fireworks made to look like New York City July 4th, all through different angles of the same firework. Lots of scenes of climbing equipment being assembled with multiple camera angles; turning a 30' drop into one that looked much further.(3.) People seem to repeatedly always show up at the same location despite the remote isolation. The first was our climbing group coincidentally finding a girl buried underground in a forest with only a small breathing pipe. The second that two hunters happen to be in the same spot. Then two more just walk up at the same remote spot and kill those hunters. then these two always seem to show up at the same location as our climbing party which has now split into two groups going in different directions yet all three groups seem to show up at the same location. Clever editing, in this case, made instanteous space travel possible.(4.) Buried girl is a kidnapped Serb Croatian - of course, since that's a currently popular ethnic plot point in movies. How the girl looks clean and fresh after being buried for days and the 3 inches of forest ground cover above her box looks undisturbed is quite a burying trick. She could have just pushed the lid up.(5.) Same girl is swept downstream and ends up underwater for ten minutes yet is revived by just breathing into her lungs. Hello, she should be dead and besides her lungs should have had water in them which needed to be cleared out first. When she revives it's as if she's waking from a nap.(6.) Climber falls down a hill and severely breaks an arm but later he using it just fine, then he says it was his leg that's broken so then he starts limping even though he was running previously when it was suppose to be his arm.(7.) Female climber is upstairs in an apartment that's engulfed in flames. She passes out, but in the next scene firemen are carrying her away. Such fast firemen (more editing) yet when the gunmen (who again seem to always know where to be) are going through the town shooting anyone they don't like, the police are no where to be seen.The ending reflected the movie in that it made little sense and went nowhere. Seemed like an afterthought finish. Great, and even good, movies pay attention to details and not just assume the audience is a bunch of not-paying attention toadstools."
B00669UD0Q By Jim Clark, publisher, Lee County Courier, Tupelo, MSThe Gilbey brothers, Julian and Will, almost didn't get to see their vision of A Lonely Place To Die, come to fruition. During one of the numerous climbing sequences a boulder came crashing down, almost hitting the production team.The film which was filmed in the Scottish highlands focuses on five mountaineers, who get caught up in fight-to survive the elements and ruthless killers.The climbers rest at the top of the ridge when Alison (Melissa George) tells the rest of the gang to be quiet, that she hears something.Soon the group discover a vent pipe coming out from under the ground with a weak voice coming from beneath. They dig, uncovering a chamber with a young Serbian girl inside. She can't speak English and they can't speak Serbian but they slowly become aware that she has been hidden away as part of a kidnapping plot.Miles from civilization the hikers must decide what to do. Knowing the danger, some want to abandon the girl saying \"at least she's free from her containment.\" But conscience prevails and they concur they must become reluctant heroes. The girl has no experience climbing. The terrain is unforgiving so they split up with two going for help, while the other follow a longer but safer path to the nearest community.The kidnappers return, armed to the teeth and start the deadliest of hunts.This is a terrifying cat and mouse where the obstacles are steep, the prey unarmed and the odds astronomical.This is a sleeper, must-see thriller."
B00669UD0Q Good, solid, tough, very brutal and action packed thriller about a deadly encounter in Scottish Highlands...This is a very good albeit VERY brutal British thriller, with good actors and a strong scenario, all of which is placed amongst breathtakingly beautiful landscapes.Of all the actors, before watching this film I knew only Melissa George (i saw her in &#34;Triangle&#34;), but everybody plays well. My favourite characters were Jenny (Kate Magowan), the older of the two women, who left her daughter with grandparents to relax a couple of days in the mountains in company of her significantly older husband and then Ed (Ed Speelers), frequently wise-cracking and occasionally annoying slacker, who once had a Croatian girlfriend who used to scream at him a lot in Serbo-Croatian...)))About the scenario, without revealing anything else than what is said on the back cover of the DVD, I will just say that it begins with five friends, three men and two girls, hiking in the wilderness of Scottish Highlands. They are all good people and the introduction, even if it is short, manages pretty well to establish a connection between the viewers and the five heroes. The place they have chosen to hike is so remote, that there is no cell phones service or Internet available and even the GPS plays tricks...Then suddenly the five heroes discover someting in the middle of the forest... And once they discovered it, the film really begins, because now some other people simply CAN NOT let them leave the wilderness alive...I am absolutely not saying anything about what will happen next, but believe me, if you like action packed thrillers you REALLY want to see this film. The scenario is really solid and the tension is maintained to the end. The villains are extremely bad people, but unlike in so many American films they can also speak - and what they have to say is as interesting as it is shocking...The finale of this film is particularly good - and shocking. Frankly, at the very end I felt a very cold shiver on my back... The conclusion of the film could be that if you really want to steal a dragon's egg, you should first be CERTAIN that you can outfight, outrun or outsmart the wyrm... Because woe to you if you can not...Music is rather discreet but in the moments it appears, it is very skilfully chosen to fit the landscapes or the action. In the beginning and expecially in the end we can hear absolutely splendid traditional Scottish songs, one of them dating from Jacobite wars. I liked them greatlyA very important warining here - this film is extremely BRUTAL and minors should not watch it in any circumstances.Bottom line, this is a good, solid and very BRUTAL action thriller and I am very pleased that I watched it. Enjoy!"
B00669UD0Q A LONELY PLACE TO DIE is an intense action thriller buoyed by breathtaking climbing sequences and quick-paced action sequences.  Set in the gorgeous Scottish Highlands, the film follows five mature adults on a climbing vacation who stumble upon a little girl buried underground, obviously a victim of kidnapping.  Their decision to rescue the child propels them into a cat and mouse confrontation with the deadly and relentless kidnappers.What elevates this sharp indie is the characters are believable and empathic, even if we don't get a lot of background we do care about them and want them to come out on top.  Director Julian Gilbey expertly keeps the tension intact and elicits strong performances from his talented cast.Melissa George (TRIANGLE, BAG OF BONES) gives an outstanding committed performance as the feisty but sensitive Allison.  Ed Speelis is good as the roguish Ed who experiences a sudden and required maturity.  Sean Harris oozes chilli9ng venom as evil Mr. Kidd and Karel Roden quietly compelling as Darko, the negotiator.  Eammon Walker and Alec Newman round out the cast.  Holly Boyd is effective as the kidnapped child.A LONELY PLACE TO DIE is dark and an ultimate downer.  Its also an expertly filmed thriller worthy of more attention."
B00669UD0Q A Lonely Place to Die is a movie best seen knowing as little as possible about it so, if you've avoided learning about the plot so far, just watch the movie. It plays with expectations and conventions to appear to morph from genre to genre while actually staying true to its own story. It's an adventure tale that moves along briskly without dawdling where it shouldn't and without rushing, either. The few very, very slight missteps are only apparent in contrast to the assuredness of the rest of the film and they pass, quickly to be forgotten. The Scottish Highlands setting verges on beautiful familiarity but reveals strangely beautiful alienness as the film progresses. The action and stuntwork in the film remains at a human level and is all the more effective for it."
B00669UD0Q If you are looking for a movie to add to your movie night, try this one you will love it. I watch this on Netflix, thinking it may have been poor entertainment, I was wrong. Its  starts of with 5 hiker's in the mountains; when they hear the cry of what seem to be a young girl crying for help. Then everything spirals down hill from there, I won't spoil the movie you won't be disappointed. Although, I felt the ending could have been better ,but still a great movie."
B00669UD0Q This was a good popcorn thriller. Nothing more.The acting was good, story line had some holes but what film that we love doesn't?I can confidently recommend this movie to anyone who likes a good adventure film but isn't looking too closely at the cosmetics.Should give it 4 stars but, meh, it will find its viewership.Worth it if you can find it under $10."
B00669UD0Q \"She's our responsibility now. We've got to get her off this mounting as soon as possible.\" When a group of mountain climbers out for a weekend of fun hear a sound in the forest they begin to investigate. When they find a little girl held prisoner in a small chamber they decide to rescue her. While trying to get her to freedom the hunters decide that a group is more fun to hunt then one little girl. This is a very frustrating movie to watch. The beginning was very tense and has you interested almost immediately. You feel like you can't catch your breath the entire time and are really rooting for the crew. Then with about a half hour left the movies stumbles badly and turns into something completely different and is barely able to hold your attention until the end. If I judged the movie based off the first hour I would definitely say watch this. Based off the ending I would say watch it still, but shut it off with a half hour left and have someone tell you the ending. Very disappointing. Overall, a very good movie for most of it. I give it a B- (would have been higher if ending was better.)"
B00669UD0Q Five mountaineers in the Scottish Highlands inadvertently get involved in a crime when they rescue a kidnapped Serbian girl in the woods. Following the tradition of thriller genre that is best represented by John Boorman classic \"Deliverance,\" Julian Gilbey's movie \"A Lonely Place to Die\" starts out promisingly, but rapidly descends into a series of nonsense.I can generally ignore plot holes as long as a film is good enough to entertain us. Unfortunately, \"A Lonely Place to Die\" is not good in most aspects. Action is mostly derivative with cardboard characters that cannot make a sensible decision even when \"villains\" are not around. Melissa George plays Alison, a seasoned mountain climber who should have known that climbing down a cliff is not a very good idea when some criminals responsible for the girl's imprisonment might be back in any minute.The film ditches its original idea of the cat-and-mouse thriller in the Scottish mountains in its third act, where things get even more ridiculous and confusing. Without spoiling much, all I can say is that a third party arrives in the climax that is padded out with drawn-out dialogues and unexciting action sequences involving guns.Obviously there is the potential for an intense thriller, which seems buried somewhere in \"A Lonely Place to Die.\""
B00669UD0Q The idea of taking someone and hiding them away until the ransom is collected is not new, and that is the main story here.  What is new, though, is the fact that they are hidden underground in a remote area in the mountains and found by mountain climbers/hikers.It does get very gory at times but you have to expect that from the contract killers/goons who took the young girl to begin with."
B0066SB8UQ You really can't go wrong with the Green Lantern Corps at all. Like to see this animated series do well and continue to evolve."
B0066SB8UQ If you have even a passing interest in the DC Universe or Green Lantern. You really must watch this show. From the beginning. You'll be so hooked. AND, you'll love it. On par or a bit better than Avenger's the Earth's Mightiest Heroes. Even better than the new Green Arrow adult show Arrow. Basically uses Geoff Johns inventive creations and condenses the story from the comic book series."
B0066SB8UQ This has to be the best animated adventure out there. It has a story plot that goes on and weaves it way through the story line. it has drama, adventure, action,heart and a love story of sorts as well without getting sappy and did i mention a actual story line ! Not just thrown together it is great. by the series it will be a great addition to your library"
B0066SB8UQ I checked out the pilot when I saw Sam Liu and Bruce Timm were involved, was immediately hooked and got an amazon video pass for the whole season.  At first I was skeptical of the 3D animation medium, especially since it's been done so badly before with superheroes (iron man, spiderman), but the simplified palette and detail characterized by Timm's style translated perfectly into the 3D medium.  What sealed the deal was they that they didn't skimp on details, such as the perfect syncing of the facial expressions and mouth movement to the dialog, the models being complex enough to give very human like expressions.  Clearly some pixar-level talent was involved in this series.  The art and style of this series is sublime, worthy to stand among the other feature-length animated superhero films from Sam Liu in the last half-decade.Aside from surface details, the voice acting is top-notch and the stories are amazingly well done.  The antimonitor arc was engaging and enjoyable.  It brought back some decades old memories of these green lantern stories and honors them with this modern re-imaginination."
B0066SB8UQ I hope they make a second season.  My favorite character was not the main character, but the red lantern.  He was cooler."
B0066SB8UQ This a good, family friendly show for all ages.  I especially like how this TV series brings together all aspects of the Green Lantern series."
B0066SB8UQ Forget what you saw in the Green Lantern movie!  This cartoon is true to it's comic book origins.  The CGI is perfect for this intergalactic cartoon.  The Green Lantern Corps is perfectly portrayed in this animation breakthrough. Think Incredibles style animation and quality on a weekly basis. That's how good this cartoon is!  This one is worth the price of admission.  If you like the comic book genre and a well written and acted cartoon, this one is a keeper!  Attention is paid to the character development and villains that are worthy adversaries to the hero.  This one doesn't try to dumb down the characters for a young audience. Adults and kids will watch this again and again!"
B0068ZCCA2 as always - great twists & turns and great challanges - never gets old to watch people being so sneaky."
B0068ZCCA2 My husband and I just started watching this show because it was on Prime.  We are hooked to the whole series!!  Best long running reality tv!"
B0068ZCCA2 I would really like to see much earlier survivor shows, starting with the first season since I never got to watch those."
B0068ZCCA2 I am glad I didn't have to wait from week to week to find out what would happen next. Very enjoyable to watch from the comforts of my home."
B0068ZCCA2 Watching Boston Rob play Survivor is amazing!  A lot of crazy characters on this season makes it so much fun to watch!"
B0068ZCCA2 This is a fun show to watch with young teen agers. We enjoyed it and watched some of the episodes together."
B0068ZCCA2 BEST REAL TV SERIES YET."
B0068ZCCA2 I didn't get a chance to watch this series when it was on network tv.  But I have enjoyed watching it on Amazon especially since there aren't any commercials."
B006DUK1K0 I watched this not knowing what to expect.  I found it entertaining and telling a story of life in a french brothel at the turn of the century.  It turned out better than I expected when I first started watching it."
B006DUK1K0 I accidentally started this when scanning through so I can't rate it. Sometimes the movie starts when I'm trying to slide through the selections."
B006DUK1K0 I have not watched this performance I it's entirety.  Interesting watching movie with sub titles.  Intend on seeing whole movie."
B006DUK1K0 Very slow moving plot if there is one.  Trying to tell to many stories and really not showing anything really grabs you."
B006DUK1K0 Didn't hold my interest and turned off the film after the first five minutes.  That's my impression and not a slam on this film without viewing it longer."
B006DUK1K0 This movie was so odd and yet I couldn't stop watching it. If you're wondering if you'd like it just know that this film (IMO) was a cross of a History Channel docu-drama, late night poorly made soft core porn and Moulin Rouge (&lt;because of the interior design and cinematography). Here are my top 10 noteworthy observations from the movie:1. As you can probably figure out by the title, this film focuses firstly on the market and exploitation of women in France come the 1900s2. ^However, the director/ writer were both clever in really drawing your attention to the different women when they were all together and everything seemed harmless, and natural and beatiful in the state of undress. Pretty much any other time you see these women (90% topless, 10% fully nude) and with a man, (maybe just me, maybe for others), but I didn't find them appealing anymore. It's as though they morphed into puppeteered china dolls that felt so lifeless yet had such entertained facade around their \"guests\". (And yes, I understand anyone might put on a facade if you were being sold for sex every night).3. You are constantly reminded in this movie that despite the care-free somewhat lux lives these women are living, they are by no means free. Every day they rack up a debt that they will never be able to re-pay4. It is strange at times as you get mixed feelings from some of the women about sex/ relationships- some speak of their 'clients' in a rather light and humorous manner, some seem like they pride themselves in their \"specialties\", while others have grown to despise sex altogether.5. The interior design and lay out of the bordello is quite beautiful (although I'd hate to see it under a black light lol)6. For how much time is spent around the characters the ending is quite disappointing but neat that they filmed this \"bordello\" in present day with it's surroundings.7. The modern music was at times an odd touch, especially when many of the characters are slow dancing in period attire to the Moody Blues, although this has been accomplished in other movies seamlessly, here it achieved quite the opposite effect.8. Very interesting undertone with the main character, as you follow her from the beginning as just another ordinary prostitute through her horrible accident, her odd dream sequence and later the revival of someone/ something else in her.9. It was very interesting to watch their use and methods of sanitation, even though many ended up getting sick or dying anyway.10. Also noteworthy is the appaling goodbye letter written to one of the women stating that since coming from an aristocratic and healthy family and despite his deep love and unquestionable willingness to sacrifice himself for her, he must not see her anymore as she has an infectious terminal illness...really?? You're more concerned about catching an STD and spreading it to your high nose aristocrat family than the fact that you have no morals or self-respect to 1. tarnish your character by going to the local whore house and 2. be a coward and liar who obviously doesn't know what deep love or self-sacrifice isOverall, it was to say the least an interesting movie, that still managed to keep my interest despite it's slow moving plot and english subtitles. I would probably only recommend this to students with interests or classes in human rights, women's rights, exploration of human sexuality, or psychology, as this movie could make for great discussions and personal interpritations."
B006DUK1K0 A really boring soft-core porn film rather than a French art film.  As best I can tell there was no plot.  if you're looking for a god foreign film pass this one up!!"
B006DUK1K0 This movie was so much more than expected.  I thought it was a beautifully done movie on all counts. I thought the timing appropriate to the film and the unfolding of the story. If I was looking more for entertainment than thought provoking material this wouldn't have been my choice. The nudity was entirely used as costume, not excitement or for shock value.  It addressed the vulnerability of being female while focusing on a more specific slice of that vulnerability that is only different because of the specific exchange of coins. The era, the settings, the players make no difference in the experience or our social structure as it relates to women. The sheer sensitivity of all the people who put this together is amazing. It took great understanding to pull this off in this delicate way.  All that being said the title was completely unfortunate.  I would never have selected this movie and someone looking &#34;for a good time&#34;, will be disappointed.  The reviews should help but many go by a title.  It does not attract it's target audience. I will think about this movie while others will be frustrated. That will be what is reflected in comments."
B006DUK1K0 The movie was okay but it dragged in places.  The ending was a little disappointing and left the viewer hanging."
B006DUK1K0 It is best movie in long time.  I loves the history and always learn something that I haven't hear or learn in the past."
B006DUK6SM \"It's takes a village to raise a child.\"  Everyone could have made a difference before it was too late if they had chosen to do so.Movies Message:  We all have choices everyday in our own \"villages\"."
B006DUK6SM This movie surpassed my expectations for it!  Maudlin and stirring with deep regret and a heartfelt sadness that is not easily expressed.  Piven is a very good actor for a young talent.  Having sons, sons who drifted away through traumatic separations make it difficult to watch.  Losing someone is a living death though they are alive; still it is like a death when they are out of a person's life.  Divorce has made a Nation full of dislocated parents and children.  Asking why a thousand times a day doesn't make it any better or different!"
B006DUK6SM What happens when you leave a child unattended for a few minutes, only to find out that the child has ventured out of the truck, in the cold winter, and is found too late. With this premise, the movie is about the parents, both a little screwed up, and certainly not parents of the year. The father, who is responsible for the event, never quite makes it through, and one can tell ahead of time where this story is heading. Sad, a great reminder that children must be under supervision at all times, and more depressing than anything else. 3 Stars."
B006DUK6SM ANGELS CREST is not a perfect movie: there are so many undeveloped sidebars that keeping everyone in a place where they seem to fit into the tale is difficult.  But there are some powerful performances here and some cause for reflection that makes the movie very worthwhile watching. Based on the novel by the same name written by Leslie Schwartz, adapted for the screen by Catherine Trieschmann, and directed by Gaby Dellal, the story deals with numerous interactions of a small town populated with alcoholics, drug abusers, adulterers, and other strange types and how they deal with a tragedy that makes no sense.Nate Denton (Ameko Eks Mass Carroll) is a 3 year old son of Ethan Denton (Thomas Dekkar in a breakout performance that deserves attention) who awakens one morning in his pathetic home to tell his beloved single dad that it is snowing.  The father/son bond is strong and Ethan dresses them both to go out to view the beauty of the snowy countryside in their old truck.  When they arrive at a perfect spot, Ethan turns to the backseat to take Nate out to make snowmen, but Nate has fallen asleep in this safety car seat.  Ethan makes the truck warm, locks the truck and walks out to view the spectacle of winter, the deer, and the eloquent mountains.  In a few minutes he returns - and Nate is gone!  Ethan is terrified, begins shouting his son's name as he searches for him.  The town is alerted and a search party begins.  Nate's mother alcoholic mother Cindy (Lynn Collins) is notified of Nate's missing and begins her tirade on every person she meets.  After an overnight search for Nate, Ethan discovers Nate's frozen body and is devastated. Ethan is taken into custody for a death stemming from negligence and the townspeople form sides as to Ethan's guilt.  Among them is a waitress Angie (Mira Sorvino) and her small daughter Rosie (Emma Macgillivray), Ethan's friend Rusty (Joseph Morgan), a lesbian couple (Elizabeth McGovern and Kate Walsh), Cindy's preachy  mother (Barbara Williams). and the local police.  The town brings in the District Attorney (Jeremy Piven) who obviously has secrets of his won that mirror Ethan's crisis.  The story is resolved in a strange and tragic manner, leaving many crises unsolved.Thomas Dekkar gives such a fine performance that we are able to see inside his heart and head and soul.  The supporting cast conveys the small town response to a tragedy among their own - who is guilty of what and how could the incident have ever occurred.  There are many ideas created by the writers and the characters that are never realized fully, but the sense of human response to an accident is staggeringly real.  There is much more to this film in retrospect, after watching it, that haunts the viewer.  Grady Harp, December 11"
B006DUK6SM The plot is interesting, the characters are believable, technically great. I would like to see more of this program, and hope it makes the cut."
B006DUK6SM Heartbreakingly realistic performances by most of the actors along with an excellent script makes &#34;Angels Crest&#34; a must see drama.  It portrays the consequences of bad decisions in as brutal a fashion as I have ever seen in a movie.  The lead actor was outstanding if somewhat enigmatic. His heartbreak is as true to reality as I have seen any actor portray."
B006DUK6SM and scary reminder of how quickly little people become curiously efficient! well directed/acted relationships that, like real life, are dependent on the domestic occurrences...and the invisible command to mature or deal with consequences."
B006DUK6SM Just what we need.  Another deeply depressing downer about dealing with the death of a child.  This time we have Ethan (Thomas Dekker from TV's \"Terminator: The Sarah Conner Chronicles\"), a 20 something dad who has custody of his 3 year old son.  He is divorced from his alcoholic, skanky sleep-around wife (Lynn Collins).  The film is set in the fictitious Angels Crest, Montana (filmed in the Alberta Rockies), occupied by a small but close community of gorgeous people, at least all that are under 50.The town has a diner where everyone gathers and exchange gossip about each other.  The diner is run by Angie (Mira Sorvino), the sympathetic big sister type.  We know we are in for rough sledding early on when Ethan takes his 3 year old out into the wilderness to build a snowman.  The poor kid falls asleep and dad decides to leave him in the truck and track down some deer.  I mean, there is all kind of wildlife in this mountainous region, but you would think this guy had never seen a deer.  When Ethan returns to the truck 10 or 15 minutes later, the kid is gone.  Somehow he had managed to escape his car seat, roll down the window and escape.Well, there is no happy ending and it is hard to not feel for the poor schmuck as you would anyone.  No one in town feels anything but sympathy including the town lesbians played by Elizabeth McGovern as the former straight, married with-a-son one and Kate Walsh in all her butchiness.  Then there's Cindy's (Collins) mother the Evangelical and Jeremy Piven as the D.A. who is going to prosecute Ethan.  Jack (Piven) it seems has a past of his own.  Something about losing his only child, but we never learn the particulars.  Then there's the best friend of Ethan who has also been sleeping with Cindy.  Whew!  There's more but you get the idea.In a tragedy play like this, the director got too involved with the numerous characters.  In addition, some of the scenes are just ridiculous.  In one, Jack the prosecutor (Piven) shows up at a potential witness's house wearing one of those furry hats with the earflaps that tie...and it never comes off.  In another, Ethan decides to take Angie's three year old daughter for a ride in his truck without telling her.  This is after his son dies!  Are you kidding me?  Anyway, forget this film unless you want to go into a manipulated deep state of depression, albeit with some beautiful snowy Rocky Mountain vistas.  A much better, but similar themed movie of this nature is Atom Egoyan's \"The Sweet Hereafter\" (1997)."
B006DUK6SM I rented this because Mira Sorvino was in it and the last two movies we've watched with her in it were so well-acted that now I check out any new movies that she's in.  She had a small role in this movie, but she was good in the role.What I liked about this movie was how real it felt, the acting was so good that you could actually believe they were father and son and you get lost in it that way.  The little boy steals your heart. What I didn't like was how underdeveloped the other characters were, how several side stories were introduced but went nowhere and the extremely abrupt ending.I don't regret renting it and I thought it was pretty good, but also frustrating in that it felt incomplete."
B006DUK6SM My wife and I found this movie to be quite boring.  The acting was OK, but the author left something to be desired."
B006DUK6SM None of the movie was a surprise but a simple depiction of tragedy. The film simply set up the scene, the basics of character, a tragic event to propel the movie There were tons of subplots hinted at and it could easily have gone off course, but it didn't.  I thought it was interesting that the film maker made the choice to remind us that everyone has their own baggage in any situation, but that doesn't  change the main focus. It really made me think about how quickly the most innocent choice could go wrong so quickly.  A bad choice could  turn even quicker and children are so quick after they learn to walk!  the town sentiments were complex and mixed in with their own personal issues, but it seemed to be a divide between those that had children and those that didn't, but there is plenty of room for differing opinions. Lovely seamless acting by everyone."
B006FTBWXY Nice to watch Family and also you learn from it. A four some language not appropriate.. improve for kids to watch they are our future..."
B006FTBWXY The show is still pretty cool. Like learning about all the stuff that comes into the shop. Clean for the family."
B006FTBWXY Unlike the ever predictable theme of every Rocky movie that came out these guys are doing the same thing all the time but have fresh stuff to show you at each show."
B006FTBWXY Love this show. I enjoy all the history you learn about a object and not to mention how much some stuff goes for."
B006FTBWXY I love this show.  Not only do you learn amazing history of the objects that come in, but the enthusiasm of Rick for his purchases is fun to see.  And the interaction between family members and staff can be hilarious. To be able to watch this show on my new ipad is absolutely wonderful."
B006FTBWXY I always learn a lot about things that people bring in to sell.  There is a lot of history behind some of the items.  Always fun to watch."
B006FTBWXY It is fun to see all of the different,and interesting, things that come into the store. It must be a very large business operation as most pawn shops that i have visited were filled with a variety of pretty common stuff.Pops, the boys, and  Chumley are the real fun entertainment of the show."
B006FTBWXY I love the historical aspects of this show.  It is outrageously fun.  All of the personalities seem to work well together."
B006FTBWXY I have the HDX 8.9&#34; and really love this show.  Being a Prime member, I especially enjoy getting certain seasons for free.  Anyway, content wise the show is wonderful.  It's always entertaining because you never know what someone is bringing in.  Picturewise, the picture is excellent in HD.  This is just a great investment in your entertainment."
B006FTBWXY Love the family and chumley too. Rick loves History and me as we ll. I hope to some day go in shop and buy something that I don t need, that somebody else didn t need and then pass it down to somebody that doesn t need it either"
B006FTBWXY I have been watching this show long enough to know that Chumlee is a good shot. He should compete in tournaments."
B006FTBWXY well: this is a 2 Disc set beginning with Darth Pawn & ending with Take a Seat which is from 2011 & NO NEW DVDS yet! Now they cut & edit their own programs to sneak in additional ads. But I digress. If you LOVE the guys, you WILL Luv the episodes but we are willing to get more dvds & everything stopped. There are other Pawns but they're basically Reissues or as they call them &#34;Fan Favorites&#34;. I've written A&E & HISTORY to no avail & no answers. Lousy marketing in our opinions. We can't afford the Instant Seasons that are available either."
B006FTBWXY Love the Pawn Stars guys and this is another great season.  Hope to see season 6 and 7 next on Prime.  I like to learn about things and watch this guys, they always make me smile."
B006FTBWXY When this show originated, I never expected it to last.  As it progressed, I became hooked on trying to evaluate the various items brought in.As the show progressed, my opinion of the blue-collar, poor grammar guys in the shop really upsurged.  They really know their history and business.  From fine art to antique artifacts, these guys are truly knowledgeable way beyond the poor knowledge demonstrated of their native language.The show is compelling, kind of like a poor man's PBS Antique's Road Show."
B006FTBWXY We love this series.  Informative and funny. Love the interaction between the generations who work together. Chumlee is a hoot!"
B006FTBWXY Love this season as I do all of their seasons. Chum lee and the guys are as always great. Love the new shop"
B006FTBWXY My family and I love this show and the staff.  We mainly watch it because of the history we learn about the artifacts."
B006FTBWXY The show features a trio of men who seem to really enjoy how they make a living by buying and selling some very unusual items. Once in awhile someone will show up with a rare, almost priceless item that they want to sell. That's where the fun begins. Is it real or is it fake?  This keeps the interest high, making the show well worth watching."
B006FTBWXY In every episode you learn bits of history behind the items brought into the pawn shop, all while being entertained.  And who knows, maybe you have a valuable treasure sitting in the closet. :)"
B006FTBWXY Quick Take: Essentially, this is half a season for half the price. A non-sale, non-discounted price of 19.95 fits in line with almost six hours worth of DVD content. A full season, had it been released that way, would simply have doubled the asking price.Last year, History and A&E; Television made the dubious decision to start releasing Volumes of their most popular shows as opposed to Seasons. I was one of the most vocal opponents of this move and some of my scathing tirades can be found on those initial releases. In truth, though, I have nothing against the idea of volume releases (especially for shows that aren't held together by continuing plot threads) as long as three things are clear:1) They need to be priced according to content and no more expensive individually than a season set would be.2) Don't start releasing Full Seasons and then switch tactics mid-stream to confuse unsuspecting buyers.3) If it isn't a season, all content needs to be disclosed on the DVD packaging so the consumer knows what they are getting!Last year, many of these early Volume releases broke my second and third rule. I mean really! How can you release a DVD when it's not a full season and NOT tell buyers how many and which episodes are included? Absolutely unforgivable. I need that information to decide whether or not I want to purchase the set. As we have progressed, though, and the notion that we're to continue with Volume releasing has stayed with us, the point becomes rather more muddy. Now, we're past the second issue and the third issue has been corrected. All of these Volume releases now contain information about the content. So, there is no deception and no confusion. You get \"x\" number of episodes for \"x\" price. It's now up to you whether or not it's worth it. That's fair. If you don't like it, don't buy it.Volume Five of \"Pawn Stars\" contains sixteen episodes over two discs for just shy of six hours worth of content, coming from most of Season Four.  If you have collected the earlier entries in the Pawn Stars DVD releases, this is the next group of chronological episodes.  There are no Special features, but English and Spanish subtitles are optional. Included:(1) Darth Pawn, (2) Put Up Your Dukes, (3) Pawn Illustrated, (4) Striking A Chord, (5) Harrison For President, (6) Wise Guys, (7) Robosaurus, (8) Ah, Shoot!, (9) Going Postal, (10) Chummobile, (11) Evel Genius, (12) Pablo Pawncasso, (13) Sub For Sale, (14) Missile Attack, (15) Not On My Watch, and (16) Take A Seat.The show is entertaining for several reasons. Of course, some intriguing merchandise passes through their hands and you just might learn something. But as in any reality show, this one is as much about interaction and conversation as it is about the art of the deal. The Harrison guys are a colorful crew--real old school Vegas. Perhaps the biggest scene stealer is Chumlee (like an adopted son) who plays village idiot, but can surprise you as well. It's comical and engaging for the most part. All in all, it is rather like the unsavory and confrontational cousin to the classic \"Antiques Roadshow\" with more grit and edge. KGHarris, 8/12,"
B006FTBWXY Please read my review of Volume 6.Not too much has changed.I reviewed #6 before #5 so the review process is backwards.This is an unusual series.Much like &#34;Antique Road Show&#34;but in a pawn shop."
B006FTBWXY Every show has interesting things that come into the Pawn Shop.  However, I am extremely tired of the jousting, barbs and insults form the Old Man (especially), and that Rick never has a good job or good word for Cory or Chum.  I've stopped watching almost.  I don't watch nearly as much as I did in the past."
B006FTBWXY I love the Pawn Stars series, particularly because we can't watch it on television so being able to rent it from Amazon is a plus. What's not to like with 4-5 fat guys showing off their knowledge of historic object (and some not so historic). Satisfies an inner need for greed."
B006FTBWXY chumlee is the star of the show. rick is the brains. their antic are almost as good as I love lucy. Plus you get and education as well."
B006FTBWXY The is a very fun show. You just can't watch one. Great entertainment plus you always learn something as well."
B006FTBWXY Big Hoss is stepping it up to try and assert his place as a co-owner of the Pawn Shop.  Very interesting dynamics in a great setting with lots of interesting characters and items coming thru the doors."
B006FTBWXY We love Pawn Stars and appreciate being able to stream it but...Amazon's responsiveness has been horrid!!! They must improve on the responsiveness of the equipment serving up these videos. I essentially gave up after viewing just one episode (which we loved).The problem isn't once the streaming starts, but it is getting the system to the point where an episode can be selected and then started. I'm using a Roku3 box."
B006FTBWXY Love the people, history lessons and fun they have.  Three generation shows a deep love as well as real conflict. We often wonder who and where are the women in their life."
B006FTBWXY I enjoy this show very much.  It is interesting to watch the various items that come in for sale and the negotiations that take place between the seller and the pawn shop owners.  Some sellers over value their product while some under value their product and the pawn shop owners have to sort it out while trying to make a profit.  It is all very entertaining."
B006FTBWXY Very entertaining.  I think Chumlee is really cool.  The old man is hysterical.  They're all good.  Keep them coming. Voila!"
B006FTBWXY Very entertaining, and enlightenment of what articles are really worth. I'd recommend this program to anyone who has old memorabilia lying around to watch this program."
B006FTBWXY My whole family likes this show.  We love the different historical finds.  We like to know what an object is worth and what you can get monetarily from one.  The family chemistry is fun to watch.  We have recommended this show to our friends and family."
B006FTBWXY Viva Las Vegas! Where else would you find characters like this. Entertaining and educational with a bit of real life drama."
B006FTBWXY I really enjoy seeing trinkets and treasures coming out and the value put on them.  But I cannot stand the pompous attitude that pervades the show through the slob characters.  It's so bad that I just turn the program off midway.  I'll take American Pickers and the storage war people over the Pawn Stars any day any time."
B006FTBWXY I love pawn stars, so of course I like volume 5. If u like the earlier seasons then you'll like this one. I'd recommend it to anyone who likes reality tv."
B006FTBWXY Fun to see what kind of things make it into a Pawn Store. The items are interesting as well as the people that bring in the items.The family dynamics are also entertaining"
B006FTBWXY If this show would stop interrupting itself with SCRIPTED NONSENSE, it would be nearly perfect for what it is.  Interesting transactions and conversations of historical relevance with customers and experts are the highlights of this show.  Here we have people who are genuinely interesting WITHOUT SCRIPTED SCENES, participating in fake pranks and telling poorly-timed jokes.  It just stinks of audience manipulation and poor writing.  Neither of which belong in a &#34;REALITY&#34; TV show.I blame the show runners.  They need to be fired.  Let's just follow the &#34;Pawn Stars&#34; on their terms and hear from them and let reality HAPPEN instead of manipulating it.  I think these guys are interesting people.  Let THEM run the show.  Let THEM decide how to film.If the fake crap does not stop, I am not going to view this anymore--and I suggest you avoid it too.  Why participate in time-wasting TV tactics?  I tune in to observe experts and pawn professionals do their thing.  This is not supposed to be the next &#34;Three's Company.&#34;Otherwise, the show is great because Chumlee, The Old Man, Rick, and Corey are good, unique, and often funny people.  When not scripted, of course."
B006FYDKMA The best pickers in the Biz, been watching these guys since they started the show and love every episode.  Well produced with great audio and video quality."
B006FYDKMA THIS show is fun to watch for the entire family,teaches our our younger generations how things used to be,when the guys find old hidden treasures from the past..these &#34;pickers&#34; are not afraid to get their hands dirty,sometime s climbing through piles of storages things,to find a &#34;honey hole&#34;of special items from America's past.They travel America's back roads,again teaching us all what great country we live in."
B006FYDKMA This was a great episode, but I may be biased because I think all of their episodes are great. And as a collector myself I always learn something new from these guys."
B006FYDKMA After all these years this show still amuses me in what they do. Every time I watch it I actually learn something. Its still as good as it was when it first started."
B006FYDKMA Mike and Frank seem like guys I could hang out with, I enjoy the dynamic of the two of them driving around in the van and the interactions they have with the people they pick. I also love the stories that go along with the treasures that they find. It didn't hurt that I only paid $9.99 for the entire season, Mike, that's what we call &#34;breaking the ice&#34;."
B006FYDKMA Seems like a good series and the characters are interesting."
B006FYDKMA Its refreshing to see nice guys doing well in business -- treating others fairly, not trying to swindle, cheat, beat or climb over others as a way of doing business. They make it pleasurable for all! Very enjoyable show."
B006FYDKMA Many years spent riding with my dad doing just the same thing, meeting folks and picking!  Can't beat it.  You meet some crazy, funny and interesting people who widen your horizons and expand your knowledge and just plain have fun!  I can even almost guess the prices they will pay and what they will sell it for.  It is great to see them treat people fairly and just enjoy themselves.  Good fun!"
B006FYDKMA My wife and I can't get enough of this show.  Mike and Frank (and Dani) are entertaining, the stuff they find is amazing, and the information they supply on history of the objects is usually quite interesting"
B006FYDKMA This is a great consept for a show. I watch every episode i can. I like the way the guys treat everyone they meet."
B006FYDKMA I'm not a reality TV? Fan but I do enjoy this show, the guys are fun and funny. As is the gal in the store. A key part of the team. Finding and sending the guys to a good picking site. All in all, a fun entertaining and even educational, whenThey find an object, and can give us it's history,You won't be disappointed, if you watch this, show, and all the characters, they run into."
B006FYDKMA These two give a glimpse of how things were in the &#34;good old days.&#34; Mike and Frank are always on the lookout for things that bring back the past in rural America. They have lots of fun looking, and we have fun watching them look."
B006FYDKMA I think it's boring but the Mr. likes it.  Not much changes from episode to episode.  It must be a guy thing."
B006FYDKMA Explanation For Lower Rating:I'm not sure what the History Channel is doing with their DVD releases this year, but it is certainly a step in the wrong direction. When they released \"Pawn Stars: Volume Three,\" many people assumed that the show would be Season Three as the other two seasons of the program had been released in their entirety. It was, in fact, only sixteen episodes. When they released \"American Pickers: Volume Two,\" it was the same thing. Season One had been released with all episodes, but this Volume Two was only eight episodes of Season Two. I know some people that preordered sight unseen, or just weren't paying attention, felt a little shortchanged by these smaller portions as opposed to what they had assumed were full season DVD releases. Personally, I didn't agree with the decision but, at least, the DVD packaging was very clear about what was included. Anyone who read the box knew what to expect: how many episodes and which ones, so it wasn't a blind investment!Now here's a leap backwards for \"American Pickers,Volume 4.\"I am sitting here with the DVD in hand and nowhere does it say how many episodes are inside. Never mind that it doesn't list them (which in my opinion it should if it is not a Complete Season package), it doesn't even tell you how many episodes you are getting. I suppose I'm supposed to look at the running time and do some estimated mathematics? I know this may seem trivial to some or that I'm overreacting, but I think the company owes potential buyers this information. My lower rating, therefore, reflects the History Channel's (or A&E; Networks distributing) apparent disregard for its own fan base. I don't like to make purchases without knowing exactly what I'm paying for!  It's not the price (which is in line with the contents), it's the lack of information that bothers me.I, however, will tell you what is inside. The 2 DVD set has eight episodes, a chronological continuation of Season Two for just shy of six hours worth of programming.  Really, how hard would it have been to include the fact that there were eight episodes on the DVD box?Season Two: (1) Fairlane Fever, (2) Too Hot To Handle, (3) Trading Up, (4) The Emu Chase, (5) Keep Out!, (6) They Boldly Go, (7) The Possum Trot, and (8) California Dreamin.  There are no special features, but there are Spanish and English subtitle options.The premise, for anyone unfamiliar with the show, is that two \"pickers\" (Mike Wolfe and Frank Fritz) travel the country trying to unearth hidden treasures from the various people they meet along the way. Some of the items may have historical significance.  That's the angle the History Channel uses to tie the show into its lineup. In truth, the show has similar appeal to the classic \"Antique Roadshow\" mixed with the treasure hunting gamble of \"Storage Wars\" with a dash of \"Hoarders\" thrown in for good measure. It's always intriguing to see what long forgotten gems might be lurking in someone's garage or junkyard. Along the way, the boys chat up the locals and experience a different kind of Americana.  An interesting show, but fans deserve some respect in these DVD releases.  KGHarris, 8/12."
B006FYDKMA My husband and I enjoy American Pickers. This show captures audiences both old and young. Very diverse and entertaining. Funny!"
B006FYDKMA The chase is on to a reality show that is fun and amazing in the search of America's lost treasures.  You will love it and a must for trivia and seakers of the past ."
B006FYDKMA I love American Pickers I have watched almost every episode at least once some several times. Started watching it the first season and would record it on the DVR.  Since we have had Amazon Prime we have watched all of those shows and the newer ones too. Appreciate not having to lose them after a year or so.  They are fun to review."
B006FYDKMA Amazing show with both history and entertainment. The stuff they run into keeps you wondering what they will find next. Mike and Frank are great together and make the show flow."
B006FYDKMA GREAT SHOW!!! MY BROTHER TOLD ME ABOUT THIS SHOW& I LOVE IT.... SO WHEN I SAW IT OFFERED AMAZON &#34;PRIME&#34; (FREE) I SNAPED IT UP!!!!"
B006FYDKMA Yay...love these guys and the people that they find. Always a good time filler!"
B006FYDKMA I learn so much from watching these guys. Great show. Never gets old. Always something different. Frank and Mike are great together."
B006FYDKMA History, stories and junk combined and delivered by two real characters. An educational, human interest tour-de-force. I can't wait for the next season to go Prime."
B006FYDKMA Awesome Show for anyone who likes old stuff. Funny and educational with engaging characters. Have seen stuff on this show I've never seen before!"
B006GM4JNU This might be the only Disney show that's actually worth watching.  It is very entertaining and has a nice range of characters."
B006GM4JNU My 6 year old son loves Phineas and Ferb and he is so excited to be able to watch them again as we haven't had cable in a while. The episodes play nice and smooth over our Roku box."
B006GM4JNU This is a great show for kids. It is one that does not need to be reviewed. Your kids can just watch it."
B006GM4JNU I like the show, but Candace gets on my nerves. She is such a drama queen and yells waayyyy to much. I think Phineas and Ferb are really cool, creative and smart though. The villian and Perry is also a cool part of the show. The villian is almost likeable. Which is good. He's just a bit misguided."
B006GM4JNU I will cheerfully admit to being a childless adult that enjoys this show. Kids can't appreciate so much of what makes this show funny. The songs are great and so are the characters. I cannot recommend this show enough. It is truly creative and deserving of your time."
B006GM4K2A If you like the show you'll love this Phineas and Ferb season. It's fun for the whole family... even grandma!"
B006GM4K2A Mom loves the show for the pure genius that is Phineas and Ferb and their inventions. Son (who is an adult, but started watching the show when he was in the &#34;proper&#34; demographic), loves the antics and is seeing the layers of the show now. In fact, at work, one of the teams that Mom is on had a &#34;homework&#34; assignment where someone who had never seen the show (only one out of the 6 team members) had to report on what &#34;OWCA&#34; stood for. This is a show that adults can enjoy while the kids are watching, too."
B006GM4K2A My 6 year old son loves Phineas and Ferb and he is so excited to be able to watch them again as we haven't had cable in a while. The episodes play great over our Roku box."
B006GM4K2A The show has broad appeal to girls and boys; various ages and interest. I like the shows Imagination and modern approach to story telling."
B006GM4K2A My six year old loves it as does my husband. The only thing that gets on my nerves is Candane is an annoying drama queen. And the mushy love stuff between Candace and Jeremy and Isabella and Phineas is a bit too adult for kids. The evil villian is not scary at all. Perry and the evil guy are funny,but there is some physical violence between them. It's short lived but still short lived. Take a look and see what you think before you let the kids watch. It is meant for older kids age 7 and up."
B006GM4K2A I am a childless adult who was introduced to the show by a friend. It is genuinely funny and most episodes are memorable. The songs are great and the characters are strong. Kids can't really appreciate why it is so funny. Highly recommended."
B006H0602Y ------------------------------------------------\"Roadie\"(Magnolia Home Entertainment, 2012)------------------------------------------------Ron Eldard shines as the lead in this indie film, playing Jimmy Testagros, a working-class lug from Queens, NY who is brought down to earth after having spent twenty-six years as a roadie for his all-time favorite rock band, and then getting fired and having to confront the emptiness of a life spent on the move. Down on his luck, he heads back to his hometown and the cold comfort of his rock-poster filled room in his widowed mother's house. Bobby Cannavale plays his dramatic foil, a former high school bully whose grown up into a jerky, loudmouthed adult who lures Jimmy back into the same humiliating, imbalanced power dynamic that divided them as teens. Cannavale's character generates heat in the script but is a little overstated -- his jerkiness is explained by his being a cokehead, but it's still a bit much. A more subtle performance comes from veteran character actor Lois Smith, who plays Jimmy's half-senile mother, and whose subtle reactions and keen appraisal of her son's failings gives the film real kick.  Eldard's Jimmy -- mopey, charming, transparent and forlorn -- is a compelling character, likable though pathetic, a guy who's bottoming out yet remains charismatic and attractive despite his all-too apparent failings. This is a movie about accepting people with all their flaws, which is a message I appreciate -- it might be a little too depressing or one-note for many viewers, but it's definitely worth checking out. (DJ Joe Sixpack, Slipcue film reviews)"
B006H0602Y This movie is amazing. Let me share, perhaps against your will, some personal data. I am 53, going back to my hometown I left 30 years ago. I have a life time of experiences spent apart from my old friends and enemies. I will see some of my old friends and daughter from times long gone during this trip. The feelings I am having, and the imagining of what may come are so close to what this movie conveys. Going back, after so long, to see what has been and perhaps your life under different experiences. This movie seems so real that it feels like I could have experienced it. Don't miss this one."
B006H0602Y I was at about 3-1/2 stars on this one.  It was a cool movie.  Kinda reminds me of going home, and seeing people you haven't seen in years."
B006H0602Y Somewhat slow-moving and depressing, but great acting and feels 'real'. Makes you think about what could have been, and the lead character's life is sad, but realistic. A good renter."
B006H06CFO Answers to Nothing almost became a 3-star movie but thanks to the final 30 minutes making a dramatic improvement in storytelling, it's only fair to award it 4 stars.  It's about four separate stories happening at once, and I'll list them right now:1- Dane Cook is NOT a comedian in this film.  Let that be known right off the bat.  Instead he cheats on his wife with a woman who looks and sings remarkably similar to the legendary Patti Smith.  As you can guess, he's cheating because he doesn't get along with his wife.  Unfortunately there's a few exceptionally graphic and inappropriate sexual related scenes in the very beginning that I didn't really care for, however I suppose having \"it\" happen during a story about a World War II soldier parachuting down to a house in France with an attractive inside is an interesting spin.  You'll see what I mean when you watch the movie.2- An African American woman who has a certain hatred for other black folks and seeks help with a counselor to figure out why.  Sort of pointlessly weaved into the storyline if you ask me, since if you were to remove this segment it wouldn't have been a big loss.3- An attractive blonde-haired detective woman who wants to bring down a potential suspect involved in the abduction of a child that she strongly believes is responsible for the childs disappearance.  Unfortuantely this segment was *severely* lacking.  At least, the scenes involving the detective.  There's a REALLY good segment with the suspect near the end concerning a house break-in that's easily the best part of the movie.4- A woman who has to take care of her paralyzed brother by bathing and taking him for walks in his wheelchair.  I suppose her intention here is to get into proper running shape so she can continue to have the strength to take care of him, but the fact that she was in desperate need of assistance because of how straining of a job it was leads to some interesting segments with her family later on, and especially memorable is the running marathon segment near the end.The only problem is that on a few occasions the storyline really drags, especially from the 30 minute mark until the 1 hour and 15 minute mark.  That's a good 45 minutes of lackluster entertainment that tells a decent enough story to get the job done, but never does anything that truly stands out.  This is why it's quite difficult to give the movie 5 stars.  However the ending is REALLY darn good- all the events are convincingly and thoroughly explained by the conclusion.  Good movie."
B006H06CFO Writer/director Matthew Leutwyler manages to challenge the concentration and intellect and attention span of the viewer in this non-linear and ultimately satisfying intertwining of stories that examine the bad in the best of us and the good in the worst of us. Against the backdrop of a child abduction case (person of interest is next door neighbor Beckworth (Greg Germann) we follow five days in the life of Frankie, a single parent detective (Julie Benz) assigned to the case, her best friend Kate (Elizabeth Mitchell) whose determination to get pregnant keeps her from confronting Ryan (Dane Cook) her psychologist husband's infidelity with rock singer Tara (Aja Volkman) while he is attempting to reconcile his parents (his fragile mother played by Barbara Hershey) long separation, an on-line video game addicted  school teacher Carter (Mark Kelly) and his obsession with the missing child that pushes him to the edge of vigilantism, a beat cop Jerry (Erik Palladino) grieving over the violent death of his wife, Drew (Miranda Bailey) recovering addict and her wheel chair bound brother Erik (Vincent Vinteresca)preparing for the LA marathon, and Allegra (Kali Hawk), a self-loathing African American TV writer's search for love who happens to be a patient of Ryan's (and who is on the brink of a mixed courtships with a shy and likely virginal Evan played by Zack Gifford). The string of stories asks us to look at their lives (and ours!) and to take action where it is needed to end injustice.The cast of characters is so strong that despite the rather confusing progress o the story we get to know each character very well.  The ending is exceptionally well handled.  This is one o those surprise films that appears on the surface to be one of those shallow/too much too fast director's egomaniacal art films, but by film's end the audience simply cannot fail to be touched in many different positive ways. Grady Harp, August 12"
B006H06CFO This is what we call a major league indy plot with loosely connected characters...intertwine is the phrase they like to use to make it sound artsy. There is a missing young girl. Beckworth (Greg Germann) the neighbor is a person of interest. Frankie (Julie Benz) is the investigating officer. Her friend Kate (Elizabeth Mitchell) is the sweetest thing this side of candy, and she is married to a psychologist Ryan (Dane Cook) who lies and cheats. One of his patients is TV writer Allegra (Kali Hawk) who is African-American and hates blacks. There is also a woman who cares for her brother. He is in a vegetative state. She wants to push his wheelchair in a marathon. There is also a rock band, the woman Ryan is cheating with, a rookie cop, and a teacher so obsessed with the missing girl, that it screws up his on-line video role playing game.The film builds up multiple characters in a mostly boring fashion. It isn't until the climatic ending that you begin to feel you have just seen a decent film. This film reminded me in many ways of another indie, \"Garden Party.\" If you don't like one story or character, wait it will change. The acting was exceptional well, however a story being all over the place is not everyone's cup of tea. If you are not an indie fan, you may not enjoy this feature.F-bomb, sex, nudity."
B006H06CFO \"I'm buried in the armor, I'm an iron man.\" After a child is abducted this movie deals with the following five days and a group of people including the single mom who is investigating the case. Her sister (Mitchell) who wants to get pregnant badly but her husband (Cook) is cheating on her. A school teacher who is obsessed with finding the missing girl. An alcoholic who is taking care of her wheel chair bound brother and a self hating black woman who wants to fall in love. I have to begin by saying that this is not a movie for everyone. Very slow moving in some parts and not a happy movie at all. That said I really enjoyed this. Dane Cook is a huge surprise in this role and is actually a very good dramatic actor. This movie shows how each person is somehow intertwined in each other's lives and how one life effects the other. While not nearly as good as \"Crash\" it does have that type of feel to it. This is a movie that you must be in the mood for and is a struggle at first, but the last half hour makes you glad you stuck with it. Overall, the type of movie that leaves you thinking about it long after it is over. I recommend this. I give it a B."
B006I0GSZM If you are a Steven King fan, you will love this movie.  This held my interest from the very beginning to the end. I love thriller and suspense movies and this one fit that bill.  I loved the story line and the suspense was on the edge of your seat.  Absolutely loved it!  I gave it 5 stars as the acting, story line and the fact that Steven King did it again........so well!  Highly recommend it."
B006I0GSZM As always, Stephen King knows how to deliver a story. This is no exception and for those who like his work, they won't be disappointed."
B006I0GSZM It must have been deliberate.  Pierce Brosnan, of all people, looks like Stephen King in this adaptation of his novel!  The novel was one of King's best because he managed at long last to combine a horror story with a love story.  Love stories prior to this had pretty much eluded him although he tried. The tv show is rendered in much broader and bolder strokes than the novel.  There is always that tendency in screen adaptations of novels though.The scary stuff is plenty scary.  There is ghost after ghost in creepy rendition after creepy rendition.  If you are in the mood for horror, this is the tv show for you.The protagonist's wife is killed  in traffic while he is at a book signing.  He is devastated and retreats to their lakeside home in Maine. There he begins to wonder if his wife was seeing someone else.  He also meets someone new but she is locked in a custody battle with her child's rich paternal grandfather. It turns out to be a lot more complex problem though than an affair or a custody battle.  There is a mystery going back to his grandfather's generation which affected a circle of young men from the 1930s.King's best screen adaptations were Kubrick's THE SHINING starring Jack Nicholson, Rob Reiner's STAND BY ME with the late River Phoenix, Christopher Walken starring in his DEAD ZONE, Kathy Bates in her Oscar winning role with James Caan in MISERY and Sissy Spacek and Piper Laurie in CARRIE. Those are pretty lofty standards for others to try to meet.  That is heavyweight film talent. They are all either Oscar winners or Oscar nominees. So doing it on tv with a good actor, but hardly a Walken, Caan or Nicholson, gives this less of a chance right from the start.  BAG OF BONES is a good job but it is not up there with these now classic five star films."
B006I0GSZM This Stephen King adaptation is much more entertaining and colorful than many of the other reviews here let on.  I'll admit, important elements of the novel were missing in this mini-series.  The single-mom character was much more complex and fleshed out in the novel, and some of the stranger, more interesting images and scenes from the book didn't make it into the movie.  However, I thought the ghost-story-mystery aspect of the film was old-fashioned and deliberately paced, and I thought it was very entertaining.  I like the fact that the movie slows down to tell the story without a lot of quick cuts and abrasive sound effects.  Pierce Brosnan's obsessive grief comes across as completely credible, in my opinion, and his performance goes a long way in making events believable.  Is this a higher-end King adaptation?  No, it is not.  However, I did think it was fun and engaging.  You might want to give it a chance if you're a fan of the kind of atmosphere and scripting that older ghost stories take on (Ghost Story, The Changeling, etc.).  After all of the terrible reviews I've read for this, I was pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed this movie."
B006I0GSZM I thought it was good and wished it would have continued. The storyline was sad, but it was well written and there were times when I couldn't tell what was real and what was not real."
B006I0GSZM Had read the book many years ago and decided to watch this. Almost four hours long, if remember correctly, in two parts. Good acting and a very engaging story line. I am used to the edgier approach of movies instead of the restrained presentation of TV movies. That said, it was time well spent."
B006I0GSZM Why people should expect a movie to emulate a book makes no sense. They are totally different mediums with their own strengths to be taken advantage of and weaknesses to be avoided. They are separate stories that share a common bond. Example: I thought \"Help\" was better as a book (actually what my imagination created) than as a movie but the movie had it's acting strengths.As far as \"Bag of Bones\" it was too formula driven and loaded with stereotypes. Usual writer searching for inspiration; loses wife; goes to rural Maine (of course); encounters murder mysteries; has dreams; has romantic affair; things turn inexplicably on and off; windows/doors/drawers open & close; bad townsfolk are hiding a secret; spirits appear; spirits lose power when dug up. Help! How repetitively redux.Acting was OK but dialogue sounds like it came from a too cloistered Hollywood writer - simply not realistic conversations. CGI effects of ghostly dead people was standard '40s movie making boring. Some effects were more laughable than scary such as lightning hitting a sign which happens to land on and kill some townsfolk (cheaply shown as an old pickup catching fire) and a tree that looks sort of human shaped that gives a jolt when touched, finally a CGI face appears on the trunk while a branch or two take a swat at our hero-writer (the trees in \"Alice...\" and in \"Wizard of Oz\" were scarier)."
B006I0GSZM Fantastic story line and great acting.  Several twists and turns with intrigue and horror to make you hang on to every moment.  If you haven't seen a movie that deals with a good mix of supernatural and reality, you don't want to miss this one."
B006I0GSZM It's been many years since I read Bag of Bones, so I don't know if I'd be nitpicking the details of this movie more if I'd read the book more recently, but I thought it was solid.  Like most TV movies, some of the acting was really good, and some not so much.  Pierce Brosnan as Mike Noonan was a highlight.  He's one of the most accomplished actors to take a lead role in a Stephen King adaptation, and he didn't take it lightly.  Many actors struggle at being believable in a supernatural tale, but I thought Brosnan came off as genuine in every scene where he interacted with the forces around Dark Score Lake.  He also did great expressing Mike's grief in the first part, showing that he still has formidable dramatic talent.  Being a longtime fan of King, I can't help but think it's incredibly cool that a former James Bond played a Stephen King character.  I'm sure King didn't mind it too much, either.  Out of the other important characters, I thought Max Devore was done well, and the girl who played Kyra did an excellent job.  Mattie, Sarah Tidwell, and Jo were passable, and most of the secondary characters, like Bill Dean and the housekeeper, were fine.  Lowlights for me were Mrs. Devore, who was cartoonish, and the officer who harasses Mike. Like I said, though, you can't usually expect an all-star ensemble when it's made for TV.  On that point, some of the special effects aren't so special with the TV budget, but some of it was actually quite good, particularly a couple of gruesome death scenes and some zombie-esque ghosts.  This movie also has several old-school horror \"jump\" moments that are effective at startling the hell out of you even though you know something is about to happen. All in all, I've seen worse Mick Garris-directed films, and maybe only a couple that are better.  Brosnan carries the cast, and the source material is strong enough to make for an entertaining 2 and 1/2+ hours.  It felt to me by the end that I had experienced something close to a novel, with enough mystery, drama, and suspense to keep my full attention.  I'd give it a solid B."
B006I0GSZM Whenever another television adaptation of a Stephen King novel comes around, I always feel a little wary. Some of his supernatural offerings seem better suited left to the imagination as opposed to getting a literal screen treatment. That's not to say that there haven't been good interpretations. There have. But there have been just as many failures as successes. If anyone should have a sense of King, it is director Mick Garris who collaborated on previous TV efforts include \"The Stand\" and the much maligned \"The Shining\" miniseries. For me, \"Bag of Bones\" falls squarely in the middle ground of King's television presentations. It has been simplified and changed in ways that purists and/or fans of the novel may not appreciate. But for those unfamiliar with the story, it has its share of pleasures as well. For those expecting big scares, however, the pacing of this two-part miniseries may be a little off-putting. I would describe this as a melancholy murder mystery enhanced by supernatural elements as opposed to any kind of horror show.Not surprisingly, King sticks close to the topics he knows. The protagonist in \"Bag of Bones\" is (once again) a popular writer, played by Pierce Brosnan, who is pushed to the brink of sanity in picturesque Maine. Reeling from a personal tragedy and trying to push through writer's block, Brosnan settles into his family's lakefront country estate. The town is populated by a typical array of eccentrics including a plucky single mother (Melissa George) and an evil town bigwig (TV stalwart William Schallert). It seems that this quaint little berg has seen its share of unpleasantness with a series of murderous drownings through the years. Brosnan starts communing with spirits in the afterlife, and the central mystery seems to have something to do with a blues singer named Sara Tidwell (Anika Noni Rose) of a bygone era. Past and present meet as Brosnan seeks to establish a connection and put a long standing mystery to rest.The leisurely pace allows the viewer to really get to know Brosnan, and he gives a solid lived-in performance. The cast also has Jason Priestly, Matt Frewer, and Annabeth Gish (perhaps the most underrated actress working), but none of them has anything to do before all but disappearing. George is likable enough, but the teleplay doesn't really establish a relationship between her and Brosnan before forcing them together. Schallert is menacing fun and his female companion is a hoot. Noni Rose gets a couple of welcome musical numbers, but isn't developed with much depth. Everything is so straightforward and uncomplicated in this adaptation, it is never very hard to envision where the screenplay is taking you. And when you finally get there, it is so rushed and rather unconvincing.It's fair to say that this adaptation of \"Bag of Bones\" lacks the subtleties and shadings of the novel--but that's probably to be expected. If you aren't anticipating big thrills or an exact replication of the book's plot, I might still recommend this for Brosnan's performance. Without commercials, this clocks in at just over three hours. I, personally, liked this slow build (although someone who watched with me declared it a snooze-fest). I just wished that when we got to the conclusion, it had offered up something of a surprise. Still, it was enjoyable enough. However, it is not a particularly memorable endeavor when you think about all of the King adaptations that have been produced through the years (would they and could they all be made by Frant Darabont for the big screen!). KGHarris, 12/11."
B006I0GSZM I love Pierce Brosnan so this show was a shoe-in for me to begin with.  Though it used a lot of cliche scary effects, it had an net resting enough plot to keep me intrigued."
B006I0GSZM This lost my attention ten minutes in. It was stupid, flat and boring and I never finished it. It didn't live up to Steven King's other works."
B006I0GSZM It's what I'd watch when there was nothing else at all and I had gone through all my DVDs and feel like &#34;well, that was OK&#34;"
B006I0GSZM Not my cup of tea.  Used as background noise while using my PC mostly.  I really don't think casting a British &#34;pretty boy&#34; as a Maine outdoors &#34;man&#34; fit the part either."
B006I0GSZM This is how I choose movies from the Roku my husband got for his birthday from my daughter.  It was a tense and unsettling to watch and a satisfying end.  I'm giving it 4 stars because I waited too long to write this and think I would remember it better if it were 5 star material.  Still think I'll be watching it again, which is a good test of the experience."
B006I0GSZM I enjoyed watching this mini-series duo of broadcasts. The acting is good. Brosnan is convincing as the main character. There are some odd situations, but the plot carries you along most of the time. Since there are only 2 episodes to this series, the viewer is quickly pushed to the main character's situations. It would have been nice to have 2 more episodes or more to flesh out settings and characters. The topping to this is a classic Stephen King ending... you'll know it when you see it."
B006LG7IJ8 I was hesitant about this show. I am not sure why, but I put off trying it for a long time. Then I heard some interviews with Carrie Brownstein and she seemed like an interesting and intelligent person so I decided to watch the first season. I liked it, but I was not blown away. At some point in the second season that changed. I laughed as hard as I have ever laughed in my entire life at some of the sketches in this second season. I was actually in physical pain from laughing at some of the sketches. That is when I knew I was a convert.The writing on the show is excellent and very consistent. Obviously, some sketches are funnier than others, but the percentage of really funny sketches on this show is, I think, higher than any other sketch show I have ever watched. I have also come to really love the recurring characters. I think that is part of the reason I liked the second season better than the first. It took a little while for some of the characters to grow on me, and I think it took me a little while to really figure out the sensibility of the show, but now that I have figured out the sensibility, and gotten to know the characters, it has really become one of my favorite shows.Fred and Carrie are also really good comic actors. That is probably no surprise with Fred since he has been a staple cast member on Saturday Night Live for ten years, but it is amazing to me what a great comic actor Carrie is. She delivers her lines perfectly. Some of the humor in this show can be subtle. Some of it is not subtle at all. But a lot of it is the kind of comedy that would not necessarily crack you up on the page, but delivered correctly it is genius, and Fred and Carrie always deliver it beautifully.The whole show just has a really great feel. Every sketch feels like the kind of thing that you come up with when you are sitting around with your friends and someone says something funny, or introduces some funny premise, and then someone else takes it further, and someone else takes it further, and so on, until everyone is laughing so hard they can barely stand it. Watching this show is like that. The show really feels like it is just friends having fun and it seems, from the interviews I have seen with Fred and Carrie, like that is an accurate account of how this show came into being. I think that whole sensibility carries over into the show and makes it a really enjoyable viewing experience.There is one sketch from this season that I have to single out. It was the sketch where a bunch of kids are at a museum and Fred and Carrie are playing Lewis and Clark. I don't know what it was about that sketch. It is a really weird sketch in some ways, but I am not exaggerating when I say that I laughed harder at that sketch than I have ever laughed at anything in my life (\"I don't know why you're running!...They are still running...\") Any show that can take such a weird, silly, premise, and make me laugh that hard, deserves my absolute seal of approval. If you have been hesitant about this show, as I was, I recommend giving it a try as soon as possible."
B006LG7IJ8 I love these crazy actors! they'll do anything for a laugh, the impersonations of the west coast portlandereeer's is extremely funny!"
B006LG7IJ8 As a Portland resident, I'll admit that it's nice to see the town in high-quality photography, and I'll agree that most of the caricatures are quite spot on. However, I've never been a great fan of the show for a couple reasons. One is that the same ideas are milked over and over, often using the same characters, with no new ground being broken. The feminist bookstore is probably the best example: Each successive skit in that setting seems to be just a variation on the original idea, without reaching for additional substance or a new perspective. Another problem is that Armisen and especially Brownstein seem to equate inarticulate mugging with comedy. This just in: They're not the same thing. Sputtering your lines, raising your eyebrows or tossing objects is no substitute for true humor. There are some skits that are nice in the way that a short poem is, and of all the routines in this season I think the Battlestar Galactica one is truly inspired, though it does go on a little too long in the middle. This series is adequately diverting most of the time, but it's hardly as good as it thinks it is. Still, I'll keep watching in hopes of someday seeing Union Station in high definition...."
B006LG7IJ8 This show twerks the quirk. What can I say, it's so strange that I love it. It reminds me of that stuck-up boyfriend I had that always went on and on about &#34;PORTLAND is so GREAT because..... &#34; with his nose in the air. He was such a tool. I sincerely hope he moved there and drowned in a craft beer. Ugh. Anyway, unlike Jeremy, this show was cool. The city seems to be a lot like East Nashville- kind of insufferable, but adorable, in the way a small, confused child is when they're constantly running after shiny new toys and getting obsessed with every new fad they see.God I love this show. I guess I'm kind of like the people on it, which is why I really hate it so much. I'm so confused. Inside every hipster is a lot of self-loathing, mixed with an equal amount of self-importance. I'm so confused. Great show, though!"
B006LWHBDA I chose this rating because its really just all informative reviews of their opinions in what they do and how they do it when they go to these auctions.  Most reality shows are stupid and don't have meaning or purpose.  Just a bunch of people getting together to tell the world of their lives and businesses they make money off of.  It is okay for some people; there are better things to watch for entertainment.  My husband watches this stuff.  It is a waste of my money and my time.  Somethings shouldn't be aired more than once or twice and this is one of them."
B006LWHBDA Fun show to watch for quick laughs, it's not &#34; Under The Dome &#34; it's like a 30 Min. sitcom but some funny characters to say the least."
B006LWHBDA I believe a lot of these shows are fake, meaning that the situations are scripted and the valuable items are strategically placed.  Whatever.  Even if this show is like that (and, I'm not sure if it is or not), I watch these shows to learn about antiques and collectibles.  This show has that!  They buy some cool stuff and I'm learning about different items and what their value might be. Don't watch it to critique the reality of the episodes.  Watch it to learn and see some cool stuff coming out of the storage lockers!"
B006LWHBDA This first season is 6 shows long and that's really short for a show. I have seen the first 4 shows so far and that's like almost the whole season. lolSo far, I thought this show was exactly like the original Storage Wars show. Everything seems the same, but the people on it. I believe the people on the original show is much better. They bring a more interesting view on their finding and explain more about what they see and find before and/or after they see a locker. While this show does the same thing, they don't do it as well.These Texas people do bring some different elements to the show. They more likely to bid low and keep low on their bids on lockers. They don't go buck wild like the City Folk as they call them in Texas. They all have similar but different personality to the original show cast members.Moe similar to Barry.Dave similar to VictorBubba and Ricky similar to Darrell and Brandon.Ricky and Lesa are similar to Jarrod and BrandiThis show is recommend if you really like the original Storage Wars show."
B006LYWJR6 Muriel who lived in a small oceanside town dreamed of being happy. She wanted to be loved and wanted friends who really were her friends. She was a simple girl who really didn't seem to understand the way the world worked. Her father was a brow beater who's never ending diatribe of how awful and unworthy his children and spouse were in his eyes didn't help her self esteem much. She made rash decisions that were mostly poor ones. However, in the end she did manage to figure it all out with the help of a devoted friend. Her unorthodox wedding to a high stakes athlete was a mistake that proved both good and bad for the girl. While navigating the treacherous friendships that were superficial at best and short lived with girls who found the only thing important in life was status she found herself. It was hard and it was heartbreaking but it was funny as well. This movie was unique and the music was of course awesome! Who doesn't love ABBA?"
B006LYWJR6 An Australian chubby girl who dreams constantly of her wedding and the tricks and subterfuge so she was involved in in trying to reach her goal. A thoroughly dysfunctional family is of no help."
B006LYWJR6 This was an odd movie, off beat to say the least, but it hooked you in so that you wanted to see what was finally going to happen, as Muriel's character developed.  The ending was worth the wait"
B006LYWJR6 Ok, first time I watched this I was like wtf? A month later I came across it again and this movie really grew on me.1. The cast is all relateable in some way, if that's not enough the humour and accents are enjoyable on their own2. The plot moves a little slowly at times, but it makes up for it in the more dramatic scenes that lead up to/ after them3. It
B006LYWJR6 \"Muriel's Wedding\" is the Majority of Girls thinking, when you are NOT the Popular Snob in School, Family or Work.  Oh, but there is payback for those, who think they are better than everyone else.  When you come out behind that shy timid girl and have grown into a beautiful butterfly that attracts men like bears to honey.  I was like Muriel when I was 14 and oh the first class reunion, the night clubs that I was the one to know to get into, and the boys, who thought they were too good for me.  Payback can be fun and that is just what I did, they asked me to dance and I had a guy far better in looks, manners and personality, so I said, \"No thanks I am with someone\".  To every wall flower and shy timid girl there is a day you will turn into that butterfly and enjoy it, as long as you can.  You see you always were someone and now they know it, as well as you do.  You are the dancing queen the one, who makes all of them jealous.  Be proud of who you have become, because you are a special person and never forget it my friends.  Toni Collette, as Muriel the bride was great, she played the girl, who was shy and timid and wants to be like the popular girls, who do not want her hanging around with them.  While Muriel goes on a vacation she meets a old high school friend named Rhonda, played by Rachel Griffiths, Bill Hunter is Muriel's Father Bill a critic of every single person in the family from his wife, to all 6 children and shows how he is having a fling with another woman.  The ending is great and the story fits 80% of the women in our world, who have not become that butterfly, who spreads her wings and takes off for better places.  Muriel does and finds herself to become the person she was meant to be and tells her father that \"NO, I am not going to come back home and take care of your children, you take care of them I am going back to Sydney!\"  She does so bringing Rhonda with her and that is how the movie ends.  It is a Great Comedy, Wonderful singing by Toni Collette and Rachel Griffiths doing an ABBA number and dancing to the music as they sing on stage.Below is the link that every girl and woman should watch on a Friday or Saturday and thank yourselves for finding, who you really are:B006LYWJR6"
B006LYWJR6 I noticed that this, one of my top 25 favorite movies, was available for streaming with Prime, and read some of the reviews.  I was floored to see some of the poor reviews.  Not that it must be everybody's cup of tea, but how is it people can watch and not have a CLUE what it's about?  Minor spoilers as to themes follow.Yes, it's offbeat.  Yes, it's told in an unusual way.  The old adage \"Show, don't tell\" is followed throughout, and perfectly so.  But for goodness sake- isn't the time spent viewing a movie worth a little reflection on its meaning?  The absurd events of Muriel's life mirror the absurdity of life writ large.  The movie's about a young woman who wants desperately to BE somebody.  She's shy, awkward, weird, doesn't know how to behave, inevitably says and does the wrong thing.  The in-crowd shuns her, and still she tries to gain acceptance.  Those efforts are demonstrated against the backdrop of relations with her dysfunctional family of misfits.  She resents and yet is an amalgam of her parents- her mother, fat, insecure and self-loathing, her father, a grandiose liar who will go to any dishonest lengths to seem important, make the news, garner attention by any means possible (he's a politician).  The mother just wants to be valued by her husband and children, to no avail.  Muriel's younger siblings are even more pathetic than she, and actually look to hapless Muriel for inspiration and guidance.  Oh my.The movie is about Muriel's quest to find out who she is and find meaning in life, the Holy Grail of quests (though not necessarily her realized goal- at first she just wants to LIVE).  She tries various desperate things, some inspired by her parents' behavior and values (I won't list them), but the biggie is finding a husband and having a fancy wedding, however possible, by hook or by crook- THAT will show everybody.  She gets herself into trouble ever more deep.  In the midst of all this, she meets an old school chum, someone slightly more evolved, who doesn't care WHAT other people think (the fabulous Rachel Griffiths).  Griffiths becomes a friend and role model, has an effect most profound on Muriel.  They get an apartment together, and Muriel just begins to spread her wings- and tragedy hits.This movie is all about life, fraught with disappointments, unkind people, and misfortunes foreseeable and unforeseeable (and yet- there are other ways to look at it).  It's about seeing yourself anew, taking the blinders off.  It's about the myriad ways we delude ourselves, inventing things to value and feel good about- often valuing style and mere appearance over substance and character.  It's about longing to change, to be your own person, to be a person of integrity, instead of a colossal screw-up.  And parenthetically, what is integrity?  So few people exhibit it.  And yet, it's everything, the most essential thing- without it you've got nothing.  And finally, it's about what it truly means to love other people.  Or so say I, anyway- these were some of the things I came away with.Come to think of it, these are some of the themes of another wonderful Toni Collette film (an adult drama), made a few years later,Japanese Story.This sounds like solemn stuff indeed, but it's not, that's what's so wonderful- the reality seeps into your emotional pores through osmosis, themes reverberate between a series of intriguing, memorable scenes, some funny, some ridiculous, some tragic (e.g., her mother's clothesline in the back yard.)  No-one hits you over the head with anything, you figure it out for yourself.  The ending of this movie is one of my favorite film endings ever- things look pretty bad, how could they get any worse?  But DON'T count this fat, pathetic loser out YET.The triumphant scene where the cabdriver throws opens the cab door, with ABBA playing, is one of those quintessential, iconic movie moments that etches itself into your very psyche: \"Leave 'em burning and then you're gone...\"  I saw this in a large theater when it came out, and it got a standing ovation.  If you don't like this, or at least appreciate the themes, you must be made of wood.  This movie made marvels Toni Collette and Rachel Griffiths international stars, and rightly so.  BRAVO."
B006LZSF8M If you must watch this I would say watch teh first half and turn it off, as soon as you hit the horrorifying slaughter house footage, its downhill.This could have been a really powerful wonderful documentary but instead decided to be over the top Peta ad.All the hidden footage of animals in slaughter houses are not given enough context.Go watch Forks over Knives you will learn more."
B006LZSF8M This movie is a must watch, along with the movie chow down. People, we are killing ourselves with what we eat. Go back to nature and live to be healthy and old. It teaches you how to spend as much time on earth as taught in the bible."
B006LZSF8M This is an excellent film about three carnivorous New Yorker's who give veganism a try - and like it (more or less). It is pretty humorous until they get to the animals-in-industrialized-hell footage, then it's hard to stop weeping (or maybe that's just me). I highly recommend this film."
B006LZSF8M Real people and real life circumstances made this documentary very easy to watch and understand. It was well constructed and kept me very interested in watching it. I learned a lot too."
B006LZSF8M This film approaches American Agriculture and diet lifestyle from the perspectives of three citizens who are newly educated about the film's topics and ideas. Their reactions and changed lifestyles are the convincing themes of the documentary. Very different from the other films on this thread, this is one for those who don't like to watch documentaries.There's no question that the film both educates and entertains, albeit with moments passed cringing in reaction to what  the daily, ordinary behaviors of American agriculture are."
B006LZSF8M This film really opens your eyes.  I didn't realize just how badly many animals are treated.  It was interesting but there was a little bit of language.  My family has been vegetarian on and off but now we are going vegan between inhumane practices (even with organic farms!) and other health concerns I think we need this."
B006LZSF8M I thought this would be a nice little film about what to eat and how to get healthy as a vegan. Not so much. I should have known when they went to the grocery store and she was showing them what was and wasn't considered a vegan product. Did you know Oreo's are vegan? Yep! Wow, and so healthy for you...  That's when I realized the film maker wasn't so much interested in spreading a message about how to get healthy eating as a vegan, but was more interested in proving that eating animal products was contributing to animal cruelty. Yeah, and don't even get me started on all the soy crap they \"discover\". Soy is not a health food, people!!Personally, I already know all about how animals raised for food are treated. I read \"Diet For a New America\" many years ago and it totally opened my eyes. I was not interested in seeing that again. I understand that she wanted to prove a point, but I don't like the idea of forcing people to see that sort of thing without a warning to begin with. It felt like the filmmaker's only justification for being a vegan was the fact that animals raised as food are treated badly. It wasn't about health at all. The message I got was \"become a vegan so no more animals have to suffer\".And, if you don't know anything else, you're going to watch this and believe that ALL food animals are treated inhumanely.I had to stop watching this movie about half-way through, so maybe it isn't fair of me to give it a review, but I think it's important that other people know before going in, what's in store for them. It wasn't what I thought, and I don't want that message forced down my throat. I'd rather watch \"Food, Inc.\" I thought it was a million times better than this."
B006NU7C48 I'd not seen any episodes for several years.  I have seen Jennifer Saunders, Joanna Lumley, and Julia Sawalha in many other projects and always enjoy their work so figured since I had the chance would watch some f these episodes.  I admit, it takes a few minutes to get into &#34;the grove&#34; of the shows.  Once pulled in they are hilarious. For a real treat check out season 6 episodes also."
B006NU7C48 I often as I watch this I never grow tired of it. May be we all need a moment of fabulousness"
B006NU7C48 I used to watch this show a while ago, the first two seasons.  Viewing it as a therapist, it is a sad show and not really that funny."
B006NU7C48 I love british humor and this is wonderful!!!!  I have actually watched all of the seasons several times and I never tire of them"
B006NU7C48 The show like the other seasons are very, very, entertaining. I love the characters and they played they roles very convincingly."
B006NU7C48 This is still one of the funniest but most irreverent comedies ever made for television.  Jennifer Saunders writing and her performance as well as that of Joanna Lumley are simply priceless in their depiction of a pair of aging, vain, shallow, self-absorbed boomers who are wealthy enough to get into plenty of trouble but still envious of those with more.  The perpetual social climbing, lubricated by more than ample alcohol, and peppered with hilarious unbridled condescension (and sometimes outright bigotry) skewers the former Sloane Rangers more pointedly than any other satire of the era.Don't start watching this series without beginning at the beginning.  It is necessary to see the whole series to understand the preposterously endearing relationship between these two aging relics and truly enjoy the humor."
B006O2WRHM We have all the seasons so we had to purchase this one as well. Unfortunately it has much fewer episodes than the other seasons. My daughter's favorites are Farm and Gooble. I found myself enjoying the Farm episode myself, and my daughter loves me to sing the garden song to her as a lullaby. Super Music Friends Show is her favorite part of the whole show. No matter what she's doing she always gets up to dance. I think it's super cute and fun, and less annoying for adults than many kid's shows."
B006O2WRHM My 2 year old son has been watching Yo Gabba Gabba since he was 4 months old. Yes, he actually watched it. The music kept him happy when he was very young. He still watches it to this day. He sings the songs, dances with them and everything else. It's one of the lesser evils on TV for kids (my personal opinion)."
B006O2WRHM Our girls love this show, and all the toys. Our girls watch the typical cartoons, like Disney toons, Dora, etc. - but YGG gets them up and DANCING. This show is great!"
B006O2WRHM I did not like Gabba Gabba at first. It was not like the shows I watched as a kid, but none are these days. I'm 65 and Ding Dong School and the old Mickey Mouse club. But my 2 year old granddaughter loves this show. She sings the songs and loves the dancy dance time and follows the story lines. The characters are much like their counterpart human children and the kids seem to get this. It will not bother me to see Ruby talking with nostalgia about this show when she is in her 20s."
B006O2WRHM When I first saw this show I was like nope. After watching it a couple more times I saw the good message it sent & my daughter loves to dance & sing a long!"
B006O2WRHM My daughter's favorite show. This episode is cool. I wish they'd film new episodes, but the episode with Jack Black is definitely our favorite."
B006O2WRHM My Autistic son doesn't have very many favorite shows but this is one of them by far.  He even has tablet games related to the show."
B006O3Z39U This is a series my wife and I find irresistible.  We have never been disappointed.  If someone would reply letting me know why the recent seasons aren't available with Roku (or other devices), I would greatly appreciate it!"
B006O3Z39U I watched the very first episode but decided that enough was enough. Over the last 8 seasons I have watched as this show has went from interesting paranormal research to scripted reality. This episode was no exception. I have no words on how disappointed I am in Grant and Jason. When the show started they presented Ghost hunting in a positive light. With proper ways to investigate and going to real people's homes. Now they just look like abunch of bafoons. Jason never believed in everything they heard/saw, but now he cops to anything. It use to be personable and watchable, now it's just a joke. They 'jumped the shark' when they brought in the ghost hunting dog. Thanks Grant and Jason for destroying something I loved all in the name of ratings!"
B006O3Z39U I love this show. It is absolutely my favorite show on tv. BUT, WHERE IS IT!!!!!!! I love the show. I love the people, their interaction with each other and the spirits. I absolutely believe this is a credible show and that what they are doing is real. I love the technology that they use and their professionalism and competence. And I think this next season is going to be one of the best, but I can't find it. I was in the middle of purchasing whole seasons and poof gone. Help me tell syfy that people are cutting the cable cord and need Amazon to have access to this. I'm sure they would make more money by people buying seasons than paying cable. This is a great show you learn allot and get real thrills unlike with sparkly vampires or gruesome not got to watch movies!!!"
B006O3Z39U I was worried that Ghost Hunters would not be as entertaining anymore without Grant but I was wrong.  If anything, the newer shows are even more chilling.  Of course, that is no reflection on Grant and I do miss him."
B006O3Z39U Just good old ghost hunting at its best . I think ghost hunting should be about gathering evidence of the paranormal. Not so much entertaining the audience but rather explaining the how and why ghost are there and trying to prove it."
B006O3Z39U This season was good. I have watched almost every season from the beginning.I hope they keep that new investigator(not Michelle but the other one) She seemed down to earth and relaxed. She wasn't trying to show off or anything. I hope they bring her back. Michelle lied on the Acadamy. She was not a good investigator, She just seems like she doesn't want to be there. Adam however blew me away. Adam was a great choice. I love Adam and Amy. Amy has really stood out since Kris left. I love watching Adam and Amy. They make a great team. As well as Britt and KJ. We will miss Grant, Steve and Dave are always fun. But Jason needs his buddy Grant. :("

B006RECSBC In all honesty, if I see one more cat jump out from behind a door, I'm going to shoot my television.  I just can't bring myself to understand why anyone, ANYONE, would think that that was a good idea.  As a film director, how can you justify building a suspenseful sequence around an animal of any sort, but especially a cat, making noise in a dark corner and then popping out just when you think you're about to see something really terrifying?  It's beyond my comprehension.That being said, a stupid scene like the one mentioned would not and should not be enough to entirely write off any horror film.  It happens so often in horror films that you'd basically have to write them all off.  What CAN cause you to write off a horror film would be the fact that it just isn't scary.  I'm struggling because I honestly can't decide whether or not this was supposed to be taken seriously.  Maybe this was supposed to be a comedy or a spoof, you know, like `Scary Movie', but I know that it's not and that makes me confused.  This has got to be one of the most unintentionally funny films I've ever seen.  Each scene looks like something out of a poorly crafted comedy.  It reminds me of when I saw `Darkness Falls' and I laughed throughout, which is not the reaction you want from a horror film.Clich&eacute;s abound in this messy film that centers on a haunted hotel that is going out of business.  The employees are obsessed with the rumors surrounding the ghost haunting the hotel and they do everything they can to stir stuff up.  God, none of this works.  The performances are so affected and mannered and just bad and the direction is completely uninspired.I've seen a lot of bad films this year, but this may be the worst."
B006RECSBC This is one \"horror\" that fails to deliver on all counts.  While there was a brief period in the first half when I thought the film contained a substantial amount of atomsphere that I'd probably be able to end up giving the movie 3 stars, unfortunately it never improves.  The nonsensical communication between the two main characters ends up wandering WAY too long and thus, completely destroys all potential this movie had.  I fully expectd an improvement in storytelling to eventually occur but, again, it never comes.  Basically other than the surprise ending, the Innkeepers disappoints.It's about the character of Sara Paxton roaming around a hotel with a haunted history.  She apparently works there at night.  A computer-obsessed geeky guy plays the role of the second biggest character and he works behind the counter... I guess.  He spends most of his time on the computer or sleeping upstairs so his job is really easy.  He's more like an arrogant know-it-all that never wins me over that's for sure, whereas Sara is more of a curious almost jaunty teenager constantly on the alert and jumping around at the slightest bumps she encounters in the night.  The other characters that occasionally enter the picture (such as the old woman in the room upstairs and the curious old man that wants a specific room because it contains memories) never accomplish anything meaningful and simply feel tacked on for the sake of character diversity.Well apparently this old hotel is haunted, so Sara spends all her time walking around exploring at least half of the rooms.  Most of her time is spent in the main room downstairs.  However, the problem is that (despite a complete lack of atomsphere and horror of course) on several occasions, Sara and the geeky guy basically mock the supposed hauntings taking place here, and the scene with the two of them pretending to investigate a real haunting only to hide under the sheets and rise like a ghost was the breaking point for me- the Innkeepers HAS to be 2 stars.  If you're going to mock horror *in* a supposed horror movie, you're going to fail miserably.  Simple as that.The little bit of blood and suspense during the final 10 minutes isn't the least bit frightening either.  The surprise at the end *is* pretty good at least.  Unfortunately by that point, you have to sit through over 80 minutes of boring, plotless nonsense 
B006RECSBC Ti West has done his monster / zombie film w/ THE ROOST, his satanic-panic film w/ HOUSE OF THE DEVIL, and now comes his ghost story w/ THE INNKEEPERS. This is another throwback to earlier, simpler times, when horror was built upon a firm foundation of ever-increasing dread. West captures the essence of the haunted inn, making the place itself a character, and not just a setting. The human characters are believable, the spectres are jolting, and the atmosphere grows thick w/ gloom and impending death. Don't go into INNKEEPERS expecting a HOUSE ON HAUNTED HILL / 13 GHOSTS carnival ride. It's meant to get under your skin, not give you big, non-stop thrills..."
B006RECSBC I screened this film the other day and was totally surprised.  Pleasantly surprised.This movie is very funny and quirky, especially at the beginning.  As the film progresses it becomes more terrifying, but the director did a very good job of taking his time and building the suspense.  While watching, I actually started thinking about the whole \"found footage\" (FF) genre, if that is a genre.  Now, this is surely not of that genre, thank god.  I have to admit, if I see another FF movie I am going to, well, scream.  Not scream from fear but scream from boredom and pain.Probably the reason I thought of the whole FF genre:  the two main characters here - a guy and a gal who have temporarily taken over running a hotel just before it closes - have their own video cameras and equipment, and are trying to record evidence of a ghost in the hotel.  Now, Sara Paxton is very good here and very funny; and Pat Healy is excellent as well.  Even Kelly McGillis gives a nice performance as a, well, psychic, I guess.I guess the critics really liked this film but the average viewer did not.  I think that I know why.  This film plays it straight; it doesn't rely on some lame twisteroo at the end.  I liked that alot.  If you are a twisteroo fan - there are many of those out there and twist away - you probably won't like this film.  But for me, this was a very refreshing idea:  no twisteroos!  Whoda thunk it?A surprisingly big recommendation here."
B006RECSBC Ti West really is one of the best... He builds suspense so well, and with The Innkeepers the story cracks you up as much as it makes you crap your pants. I love this film... I saw The Conjuring last weekend and I could only compare that film to this... Same film making style... I feel like James Wan and Ti West are the only ones right now reading the same \"No Cheap Tricks\" horror playbook... Seriously, the best horror is like a good boxer, full of jabs, fake outs, and ultimate surprise KOs.P.S.I know you can stream this one on Netflix, but the two commentaries on the DVD are worth the price. They are really funny and insightful ... You really get the feeling that this cast and crew bonded while simultaneously getting cabin fever in the hotel while shooting."
B006RECSBC For months leading up to my viewing of this film, all I heard was how clever and creepy and worth-my-time it is.  Am I missing something?  This seemed like pretty run-of-the-mill stuff.  I agree with many fans of Ti West that he is a talented director who knows how to exercise restraint (House of the Devil was really good) and give his films character.  However, despite the good direction, atmosphere and acting, I can't get past the fact that the ghost story in The Innkeepers was nothing I haven't seen before.  Unless, like I said, I missed something.  I watched this with a good friend whose opinions are pretty close to my own, and he agreed with me that House of the Devil was much better than The Innkeepers.  If you're a fan of this type of ghost story, and you're a bit older than the twenty-something set (like me), then you've probably spent a lot of time watching ghost stories just like this.  Throwing a bit of ambiguity into the story near the end didn't do much to help its plot, either.  I don't know, maybe someone out there can tell me what's sailing over my head because I just don't get why so many people are rallying around this movie.  I just felt it wasn't that good even though I really, really wanted to like it."
B006RECSBC Movies revolving around the supernatural have always felt lacking. Of course, the most recent ones are mostly remakes so they already have an uphill battle ahead of them but there are very few movies featuring ghosts or the supernatural that I feel are worth mentioning in a conversation about great films. Ghostbusters, The Orphanage, The Shining, Shutter (the Thai original), The Ring, The Frighteners, and The Devil's Backbone are about it for me. It's a sub genre of horror that just hasn't meshed well with me over the years much like exorcism films. In the same breath, I still haven't been able to get a clear read on what I think of Ti West as a writer and a director. The House of the Devil was really disappointing. Its slow pace made the film seem practically uneventful and didn't really feel worthwhile in the long run. The Innkeepers has a similar pace as The House of the Devil yet feels slightly more methodical on West's part in comparison.Luke (Pat Healy) and Claire (Sara Paxton) are the only two employees working during the final days of the Yankee Pedlar Inn. This hotel is rumored to be haunted by Madeline O' Malley, a woman who hung herself in her room after being stood up by her fianc&eacute; at the altar. Luke and Claire try to make contact with the paranormal through EVP recording devices in between watching the front desk and handling the few stragglers who come to stay during the hotel's final weekend of operation. Needless to say, Luke and Claire begin to see results as the guests at the hotel become a bit stranger.I'm surprised the score to The Innkeepers was as good as it was. It's a little bizarre to have such good things to say about movies coming out in between January and March since these are the months that studios decide to push whatever's been sitting on their shelf for a long period of time or release something they expect to do poorly at the box office. The score is really fantastic though, especially during the opening credits. It's usually very strings heavy and puts you on the edge of your seat on more than one occasion. It helps add that extra bit of tension. At other times, a lack of music speaks volumes. The way the film encompasses the importance of sound into t
B006RECSBC Quaint, enchanting, cute - these aren't words normally associated with films about a haunting, but they are more than apt for describing The Innkeepers.  If you're wondering if this can even be considered a horror movie, I can assure you that it does earn its horror chops when all is said and done (although I think the trailer oversells the scare factor).  What I took away from the movie, though, was a rather poignant sense of melancholy.  You aren't going to find many horror films that run you through such a gamut of emotions as this one.  It's an unconventional but really impressive piece of work from writer/director Ti West.The setting is the historic Yankee Pedlar Inn, on the final weekend before it closes its doors forever.  With only one floor open and three rooms booked, young Claire (Sara Paxton) and Luke (Pat Healy) are all the only employees left to see the inn through its final days and hours.  Their focus, however, is in trying to prove that the venerable old hotel is indeed haunted - supposedly by the ghost of Madeline O'Malley, a young bride who reportedly hanged herself when her lover abandoned her on her wedding day.  Luke has created a web site about sightings of the ghost, but it is Claire who seems fixated on making contact with Madeline before the inn closes its doors forever.  Claire is quite a character - young, unfocused, highly excitable, and just incredibly cute.  She definitely doesn't seem to have the temperament of a ghost hunter, as several comical scenes early on make clear.  Personally, I found her infatuating, and I thought Sara Paxton's portrayal of her was almost magical.  Kelly McGillis also turns in a strong performance as actress turned new age healer Leanne Rease-Jones, a character who comes to play a crucial and prophetic part in the story.The Innkeepers is devilishly hard to describe.  In a way, much of the story is predictable, yet at the same time it's also rather shocking in the end.  The writing is subtly brilliant.  The significance of some lines early in the movie only hit you later on, even after the film is over.  It sounds stupid for me to describe the story as both conventional and unconventional, but I think that is a true statement.  Those who like their scares blatant and numerous probably won't like the film, as it's really not a scarefest.  The Innkeepers is a ghost story in the traditional sense, full of subtle nuance and dare I say intellect, playing out in a little world where the characters are more important than the events that befall them.  I loved it."
B006RECSBC A lot of people have reviewed this flick and some thought it pretty much bit the big one, while others thought it went more for spooky nuance than the big scare. For the most part, it did go for nuance, but there were still some cheap scares. So I'm siding with the former.Here's the scoop. A vintage New England hotel, the Yankee Pedlar, is closing down. The owner is in the Barbados, and two young folk are left to man the place on it's final weekend. The only guests are a mother and son, a one-time actress turned psychic and an old fellow with fond memories of the place. The hotel has a reputation for being haunted by a ghost tied to a particular incident. The kids want to record evidence of the haunting. Of course, things get out of hand.The only other film I've seen from writer/director Ti West was \"The House of the Devil\" and I liked it quite a bit. This outing, however, is a real stinker. There were individual scenes, between the two leads, that I liked quite a bit, but the sto
B006RECSBC Ti West does it again with The Innkeepers. Just like his The House Of The Devil, he spends the first 2 acts building tension with mystery, intrigue and a bit of comedy, then slapping it on heavy in the third act with the reveal and real horror. The House Of The Devil was a throw back to 1980's occult horror, this movie is a throwback to classic films about haunted buildings, like The Shining. Sara Paxton pleasantly surprised me as charming, cute and funny in this movie and really carried the film. While this movie may be predictable like most movies about ghosts, there is a nice kind of twist at the end that weaves everything together well and If you aren't looking closely at the final shot, you may miss a very nice little treat. Way better than I expected it to be, especially since most horror movies are a let down. I should have known better because I thought The House Of The Devil was brilliant, and this movie is no exception. I thought this movie was great. On Blu-Ray it looks clean, crisp and sharp. There is no visible DNR, blacks are deep and there is visible film grain. There is also a little bit of specks on the film b
B006RECSBC The first 20 minutes or so the dialogue and acting led me think that a creative, well written and produced haunted movie was in the works. Wrong! They either quickly ran out of writing inspiration or money or both. It quickly fell into a cheap formulaic abyss. The rest of the movie moves like redundant molasses.Proof?(1.) Well, lots of newspaper clippings is a cheap storyteller and in this case it was newspaper clippings on a web page - shown over and over.(2.) Usual cheap prop of an army surplus recorder with analogue vu display to indicate some unknown sound. Duh, digital has been around for decades and, anyway, they have a limited frequency and amplitude range, so what's the point.(3.) Usual, couple of guests that add nothing to the story and you're left wondering why they were even in the story. Well, one guy decides to slit his wrists, in a bathtub, of course.(4.) Usual, mysterious sounds - well, they are in an old hotel!(5.) The usual mysterious self-closing door. Actually, a prop person standing behind and pushing it. Scary!(6.) Lack of details such as why the two inn employees are there; why they are closing such a expensively appointed and well maintained inn. Their dialogue dominates the rest of the movie and although it started out interesting it simply got tiresome after 90 minutes.(7.) Usual chain locked cellar door.Spoiler follows:(8.) Usual girl starts imaging ghosts and locks herself in the basement to subsequently die of fright complications thinking a ghost is chasing her but it's her co-worker banging on the door."
B006RECSBC I definitely think Ti West is one of the best directors working today after seeing this movie.I used to have mixed feelings about him before because I loved Trigger Man but hated House of the Devil and The Roost.  I thought Cabin Fever 2 was okay.The Innkeepers is just an excellent movie through and through, though it seems like nothing happens until the very end the build up is just as enjoyable.The fact that the characters are so likeable and so well developed makes what happens at the end so much scarier.Normally i hate ghost movies but this was just great.Sarah Paxton carries the movie almost entirely by herself and gives one of the best performances I have seen in any movie in years.This comes right after seeing her in Shark Night, a decent movie which is improved by her presence alone.From now on I will look forward to any movies that Ti West or Sarah Paxton do.The Innkeepers is brilliant."
B006RECSBC Ti West's \"The Innkeepers\" is a tour de force, certainly superior to his debut \"House of the Devil\".  It seems to be a bit under appreciated judging by both the comments here and it's critical reception.  I'm not sure why.  It is a bit like peeling an onion but once you do, you don't cry--you scream.  This is psychological terror at it's most refined and disturbing.Sara Paxton plays Claire, a twenty something working at a reputedly haunted hotel just about to close.  Pat Healy plays the distant and sort of strange Luke, a middle aged man who also works the desk and claims to be interested in using EVP to uncover the hotel's infamous ghost, Madelin O Malley.  Madelin was stiffed on her wedding night, killed herself, and her body was stuffed in the trunk of the hotel's basement.For the first half hour of the film, none of this is given what one would call serious treatment.  Claire and Luke goof around, gossip about the famous aged actress played by Kelly McGillis, and it isn't until Claire begins to take the EVP quest seriously that it gets serious.This may lead the viewer to conclude the tragic ending of the film to be a consequence of Claire's overactive imagination or her asthma.  There are a few other things to consider, though.  Why does Lee, McGillis' character, arrive at night just before things get ghostly?  Why, before urging Claire to leave, does Luke say \"I have something to tell you\"?  Was his skepticism a mere front for something else he knew?  Why does Lee's facial profile look so much more youthful the last time we see her?Without giving anything away, it seems to me this is an infinitely more complex movie than most seem to realize.  Absolutely recommended for lovers of horror.  Watch carefully."
B006RECSBC By Jim Clark, publisher, Lee County Courier, Tupelo, MSThe Innkeepers is not a typical horror film, and I've got to believe that's the reason it's got a 76% rating at Rotten Tomatoes.Two employees, Claire (Sara Paxton) and Luke (Pat Healy) remain at the Yankee Pedlar Inn. The quaint hotel has fallen on hard times and is about to close. The two spend their remaining time making fun of any last minute guests and work to uncover proof that the old inn is haunted.The ghost is Madeline O'Malley. The story is supposedly true. Philadelphian businessman Thaddeus O'Malley courted her, and they were soon wed. The Yankee Pedlar was to be the location of their honeymoon.Just after the wedding, Thaddeus got word that there was a problem with the sale of a coal mine in upstate Pennsylvania and that he must come immediately. He sends Madeline, alone, ahead of him to The Yankee Pedlar. There's an accident at the mine which claims Thaddeus' life. He didn't change his will, so Madeline would go from rich to penniless. She hung herself. Thus a haunted inn where Madeline roams the halls, plays the piano, etc.What makes The Innkeepers different, is there is little gore. It lumbers along telling the story while introducing the two other guests, Leanne Rease-Jones (Kelly McGillis) a television has-been turned psychic, and an old man (George Riddle) who says he's come back to stay in the room where he and his late wife celebrated their honeymoon.Slow moving but worth a look."
B006RECSBC An entertaining dynamic between two awkwardly sweet characters steer this film into a unique mood.  I really enjoyed watching this movie and it made for a very different, satisfying experience.Claire (Sara Paxton) and Luke (Pat Healy) work at the Yankee Pedlar Inn and are determined to find evidence of the paranormal within its walls before it goes out of business in its final days.  They have a refreshingly platonic friendship that isn't blurred by the typical nudity-harbingering sexual tension so common among horror ilk.  These two have a natural and playful chemistry; you instantly know that they care about each other and, in effect, it makes viewers care about them.  Already this is a solid victory for any horror movie.Claire is a somewhat awkward but super-nice young woman with a childish verve who finds listening to others to be exhausting, instantly slouching like a dropped marionette.  Luke is a nice, quirky guy who likes getting to know the hotel guests.  Their dynamic is nothing short of cute and it comes with some funny accidental scares.  The director clearly went out of his way to make Paxton look childishly cute whenever possible.  The characters were so well written that I could seriously watch this movie as a dramedy without any horror elements, just to watch Luke and Claire's interactions.  It's all done very well and they're so likeable.They want to find proof of Madeleine O'Malley's haunting.  During the process Claire starts hearing things and some cheap scares really made me smile.  Claire does an overnight ghost recording and picks up on something spooky.TV star Lee Jones (Kelly McGillis) is in town for a convention.  She is a bit distant, in a superior way, but subtly maternal.  She offers her spiritual knowledge and turns out to be a medium.  Some limited communication with \"the other side\" reveals a room in the hotel where something awful happened that Claire must not enter because she \"cannot save\" Madeleine.  The tone shifts from light-hearted to serious as the style of the scares follows suit.  Stranger, graver things start happening involving the hotel guests and further investigations by Claire and Luke.The scares seem simple--like they're meant not to be terrifying, but only jumpy--as if this was made so that preteens could have a \"good\" horror movie that won't leave them traumatized.  This is still enjoyable to adults, though.  There's no creepy, dreadful vibe whatsoever.  It's more like you look forward to things, like with a good mystery novel, than dread them.  \"Spooky\" elements are simply clich&eacute;s executing perfectly; as if this movie was a \"how to\" manual for future horror filmmakers.The camerawork was good; simple, but well-placed and effective.  The movie demanded no more than they gave.Let's be clear.  The horror \"story\" wasn't very good. While I loved the character-driven premise and it carried the movie effortlessly, the horror story itself never really felt like it moved forward and it certainly met us with no resolution at the end whatsoever.  However, I really enjoyed watching this movie and it made for a very different, satisfying experience."
B006RECSBC The Innkeepers is a creepy haunted hotel film. Basically, Claire and Luke work at a hotel that's about to close and they want to prove it's haunted. Madeline O'Malley is the ghost and her design is amazing (the scene in the bedroom gave me chills!). The acting was fine and I actually liked both of the main characters. The comedy bits were also a nice addition (not a horror/comedy though). The music was also well done. It's a slow-burning type of movie; the movie generally moves at a slow pace.The tension it builds works for and against the film. Sometimes, the tension would be dreadful and lead to something terrifying. Other times, the tension would be too long and lead to a weak scare or nothing at all. Which leads to another point, it's not as scary as it could've been. The scares are limited for a 1hr 40min film. The slow pace may also make some people slowly drift away; I'm personally a fan of all horror, especially slow horror though.There is some blood and frightening sequences, no sex or nudity so it's tamed compared to other modern horror films. Definitely recommend to any fans of slow horror."
B006RECSBC Too slow-moving when the climax is there it couldn't get there soon enough and naturally predictable.Boring at times,and when the \"Horror\" did come it was gross in an bad and distasteful.The movie is more of an thriller than an horror movie,Glad I watched it on Netflix instant first than renting it or owning it.Not enough scares to be scary and not interesting enough for me to watch again."
B006RECSBC While I appreciated the generally positive reception Ti West's \"The Innkeepers\" received upon its theatrical run, I fear it may have been oversold as a fright fest. This is a small, but very appealing, piece set in a haunted New England inn that scores more from its human interactions than it does from its supernatural leanings. And that's just fine. If you're anticipating big scares and lots of horror mayhem, though, this may not be the film for you. Its charms are far more subtle and unexpected. In truth, I quite loved this movie. It has modest goals and, by keeping things intimate, succeeds quite admirably in feeling fresh and real. West keeps the effects to a minimum and allows the movie to come alive in the hands of his engaging cast. It's a wise decision as the screenplay is tart and funny and the actors are committed and enthusiastic.Sara Paxton and Pat Healy play hotel clerks spending one last weekend in the historic The Yankee Pedlar Inn before it closes down for good. The rooms are mostly vacant, so the pair of amateur ghost hunters plan to use the opportunity to get physical recordings of its alleged haunting. Most of the film relies on the easy chemistry and camaraderie of Healy and Paxton and they play off each other well. Seriously, I laughed constantly throughout the film--especially due to Paxton's deft performance. Only three rooms have occupants for all or part of the weekend. They contend with a mysterious man with history in the hotel, a wayward wife and her child, and a fading actress (and spiritualist). As the hours progress, Paxton seems to be getting closer to uncovering real spirits. What begins as a lark may be headed for a more serious conclusion.I wasn't particularly familiar with or a fan of Sara Paxton (her resume is populated by such fare as Shark Night 3-D and Lifetime Network's Blue Eyed Butcher), but this is a star making turn. She is so likable and so funny, I was more than willing to go on this adventure with her. Healy is also quite effective. Kelly McGillis (Top Gun, Witness) has one of her best roles in years as the actress. I loved every scene she and Paxton shared. The film ratchets up the tension as it pushes forward, but never attempts to overcomplicate or over-explain things. In the end, it may all be a bit vague in mythology. But truthfully, I didn't care. I so liked the cast and the movie had been so entertaining, I went with the ending even if it seemed a bit tidy (or maybe messy, I'm not sure). Again, this isn't about big scares or horrifying moments. It is largely about what is unseen and how real people react in creepy settings. \"The Innkeepers\" isn't revolutionary, perhaps, but it is funny and engaging. And I've become a huge Paxton fan! KGHarris, 4/12."
B006RECSBC After waiting nearly two years, Ti West's follow-up to his critically acclaimed genre masterpiece, \"The House of the Devil\", is finally here. Giddy with excitement like a child ready to rip open his biggest Christmas present, my expectations were sky high. The movie just had to be a masterpiece, it had to be a unique, one-of-a-kind thriller, and it had to be perfect. I am one of the horror faithfuls that believes that \"House of the Devil\" is THE best horror movie of the last decade and this movie had better come close to that sort of greatness. Does \"The Innkeepers\" reach those lofty heights or does it vanish into thin air like the ghosts it portrays?\"The Innkeepers\" tells the story of The Yankee Pedlar Inn. After over one hundred years of service, The Yankee Pedlar Inn is shutting its doors for good. The last remaining employees -Claire (Sara Paxton) and Luke (Pat Healy) - are determined to uncover proof of what many believe to be one of New England's most haunted hotels. As the Inns final days draw near, odd guests check in as the pair of minimum wage ghosthunters begin to experience strange and alarming events that may ultimately cause them to be mere footnotes in the hotels long unexplained history. Along with them for the ride is a actress turned psychic who may know more than she lets on and an old man who will stay in nothing less than the Honeymoon Suite and may have a connection the a devastating murder that took place years before.\"The Innkeepers\" is terrifically moody with some of the best cinematography I've seen in a movie in a long time. The Inn comes alive in a fresh way that never feels phony or cheap. The actors are also quite good, particularly Paxton as Claire who is headstrong and determined but also has a shy, vulnerable side. The being said, the movie is a lot a buildup for a conclusion that seems fairly ho-hum. I know people bashed HOTD for the same thing but the ending here seems both too delayed as well as rushed, if such a thing is possible. It all just plays kind of false and lessens the stylish chills of the film's first two acts. I don't want it to seem as if I didn't enjoy this movie. I liked it, in fact I liked it a lot. Maybe it was my fault holding this film up to an impossible standard that no film could possibly live up to. HOTD was a masterpiece, this one is a pretty good thriller. Nonetheless, in today's horror market, pretty good is definitely good enough. Just keep your expectations in check. 3.5 out of 5"
B006RECSBC \"You're just impatient! Ti West is a master at creating atmosphere! If you didn't like this movie, I'm sure Joel Schumacher will make a loud, angry horror movie one of these days! This is for TRUE fans of horror!\"These are just a few of the retorts you hear from fans when you complain about West's slow-burn spookiness. I will grant, as others have done, that West does excellent work with a camera -- he frames and tracks some really sumptuous shots -- but atmosphere is no substitute for a story. I don't watch movies for atmosphere. That's why I buy lounge music, or candles, or fake cobwebs in October. If atmosphere is all a movie has going for it, then it's no better than one of those looped images of flickering fireplaces you can pop on the TV during Christmas.So what about the story? Isn't it scary? Nope. Two twenty-somethings -- Claire and Luke -- are the only staff members at the soon-to-close Yankee Pedlar Inn. With cheeky self-consciousness, they spend their many hours of free time searching the old hotel for one of the ghosts that is said to reside there. It's a fairly standard ghost story trope, and the addition of a psychic who has \"reverse deja vu\" does little to twist the story into something intriguing or new. There is, essentially, no story, which was a similar flaw in the nearly identical West film, The House of the Devil (girl left alone for a long time, strange goings-on, some people are not who they claim to be, incredibly slow atmospheric build to a cheap-show ten minute conclusion of sloppily written \"chills\").So the story sucks. Movies can still succeed by virtue of the characters alone, even if the plot is confusing or sloppy. Unfortunately, Luke and Claire, while well-acted and realistic enough, are not interesting characters. They speak with the kind of canned dialogue that screenwriters pen when they aren't sure what's supposed to happen next in the film. Sara Paxton tries desperately to make Claire appear as cute as she can in every scene; she looks like she took acting lessons from a newborn puppy. On the very, very few moments when the movie lets the viewers glimpse something creepy, the effect is numbed by Claire's mopey mugging.I'm certain it's meant to be funny, as it is often accompanied by hokey sitcom music. West seems to be as confused by comedy as he is by horror, though. The movie thinks things are funny -- a girl in her underwear runs by a small boy! it takes Claire five minutes to take out the trash! the coffee girl is socially awkward! -- but even if they were, they contribute nothing to the story or the characters. All in all, it's like watching two boring people making a movie about themselves being boring. Dull characters who are authentically acted are still dull.West obviously has an eye for making movies but not for telling stories. He tries too hard to be subtle and artistic. An excellent example is the final shot of the film. My friends did not understand why the camera held for so long on the final shot, but I saw what all of them missed. I won't tell you what it is, but I will say this: if you don't know it's there, it's almost impossible to see it. I only noticed the subtle little parting shot that West included in the scene because I read a review, like this one, telling me to look for it. And that's the thing: if your artistry is so subtle, so careful, so minute as to escape the notice of nearly every single viewer of your film, then maybe you're focused too much on the background stuff (like West's highly touted skill at creating atmosphere) and not enough on the actual meat of your movie (characters, story, conflict).Dialogue that treads water. Dull and annoying characters. Almost no story to speak of. Cliched plot. More than your average number of fake scares (I counted three before the first fifteen minutes). Unsatisfying climax and conclusion."
B006RECSBC I was watching a documentary on horror films in the U.S. the other day and while I watched I realized something. There were actually few if any true horror films are being made these days. Granted there are films made that qualify for the genre, but most are more obsessed these days with how far they can push the envelope, how much gore they can include and how disgusting they can make the world seem. Far too many have chosen to go the Rob Zombie route of showing us homes in decay where dirt is far more common than cleanliness. I for one would find it more terrifying to see a serial killer in a well kept home than the unwashed, unbathed louts living in trailer parks more frequently seen today. Then I watched THE INNKEEPERS.The Yankee Pedlar Inn was founded in 1891 and has seen better days. The last weekend the hotel is to be open two clerks are working taking care of just three customers. Claire (Sara Paxton) is an early twenty something working at the inn with no outlook on her future. Luke (Pat Healy) is a laid back older guy who lives at home with his mother and has no future prospects as well. The pair has formed a friendship while working at the Inn and share an interest in the history of the locale as well. Said to be haunted, Luke has set up a web site based in incidents that he has recorded while working there.On this, the last weekend, the pair hopes to finally catch something worthwhile to include on the site, a real paranormal happening that can be verified with two people on hand. Checking into the hotel we find a young mother and her son, staying to avoid her possibly soon to be ex-husband. Later we have a movie star who's seen better days, Leanne Rease-Jones (Kelly McGillis), here to speak at a convention nearby. Lastly we have an elderly man (George Riddle) checking in to recall the good old days when he came here on his wedding night. But the guests are secondary for the most part though they play important roles as the film winds down. It is the spirits and the search for them that make up the scares here.Claire and Luke take turns watching the desk and taking care of the needs of their customers. When not working, they sleep or attempt to record EVP (Electronic Voice Phenomenon), recordings of spiritual voices in the room unable to be heard by the human ear. During the times when Claire searches for signs of the afterlife more happens than with Luke. It seems as if the spirits are trying to reach Claire for some reason.Star struck by Leanne, Claire displays the usual fan klutz attitude. But later the two have the opportunity to talk. It turns out Leanne isn't in town to speak at an acting class or fan fair but to speak about her newest calling, healing via crystals and the like. Assuming the role of medium, she tries to help Claire with the search for the main spirit in the hotel, one Madeline O'Malley. Murdered and her body hidden in the cellar for 3 days by the owners of the hotel at that time to avoid bad publicity, it is said that Madeline continues to walk the halls of the hotel. In attempting to contact her, Leanne offers sound advice to Claire: don't go in the basement. Any guess as to where Claire goes?Between bumps in the night, a piano that plays itself and several other scares the film does indeed offer some truly frightening moments as it plays out. The first third of the film offers little in the way of horror with the exception of a few jump moments, scenes where things make loud noises causing the viewer to jump. But as it progresses it tells a tale that evokes some haunting images and a story that slowly unfolds to bring about real scares.The acting is wonderful here, especially from the two leads. They don't appear to be actors at all but two people who work at the most boring of jobs, leading boring lives in search of something else outside of their own level of comfort. When the world they seek appears to be coming alive, their terror seems real as well.The movie is slow paced but wonderfully so, never rushing to get us somewhere but letting us take in the whole view of the hotel and its history given in bits and pieces. The need for gore is absent and that makes the scares even more disturbing. Horror films that allow you brain to fill in the gaps make for much scarier viewing than simple effects. This film offers the thrill of the old horror film and that's something it should be proud of. If you want to see how a horror film can be done right, then by all means check this one out."
B006RECSBC and that's something most people have forgotten how to use when watching a movie.As in my previous movie review about \"John Dies At the End\" this movie is a perfect example of what I mean when I say people don't like to think when they watch a movie anymore. This film was absolutely amazing for a ghost story and about as real as you can expect in this genre. An old hotel where a death occurred and two hotel workers just trying to put in their days work, loathing the decisions they made in life that made them hotel clerks, and just trying to find something more for themselves aside from their boring jobs. Luke works on his ghost hunting website and Claire is writing a book. To keep themselves entertained they depend on each other and have a strong friendship. Claire likes to support Luke and finds ghost hunting a fun way to spend her long work hours. It's not until strange things start happening that things change for the both of them. This movie has questions but ALL of the answers are given in the story. This movie requires attention be paid to detail and the characters dialogue. Even the ending scene holds a clue to the fate of the main character. EVERYTHING is in the film and that's what makes it so freaking brilliant!To persons that weren't listening,paying attention, or trying to piece together the clues and hints, all they can say is \"It was slow,it was boring,this is a bad horror film,it made me think and my brain hurts,I didn't get it what happened?\". This movie has so many elements to it you really need to PAY ATTENTION.So here it comes \"The story\" and yes there will be *Spoilers!*The Yankee Peddler Hotel is closing down. It's the last weekend of the hotel being opened. It's also the last time Luke and Claire get to find out if there is really a ghost or not in the hotel. It would be a real accomplishment for either of them as neither of them have accomplished anything truly amazing in their lives. It be their own personal victory to finally achieve something in the time they spent at the hotel. Finding the ghostly Bride is the perfect going away present for them. In the last days of the hotel Claire befriends an ex actress/psychic that gives her a small bit of assistance about the ghost of the hotel. The Psychic tells Claire to stay away from the basement and that there are 3 spirits in the hotel. Claire is clueless as to who they are but the psychic can sense it faintly. After some strange events occur on the last night Claire and Luke decide to kick up their ghost hunting game and venture into the basement to connect with the ghost. Low and behold they get what they asks for. Claire can sense the ghost because she is sensitive just like the Psychic ex actress. Except she can see them but she can't tell the future or predict events. For some reason these spirits are attracted to Claire and it's because they are sensitive to her. To Luke he doesn't see or hear the ghosts but the Claire she can. It's the time she spends with the Psychic that stimulates this ability in her. Before she was able to see the ghost she was able to sense then mildly or experience phenomenon where she heard them (like being attracted to the basement and the piano).The spirits were attracted to her energy. Towards the end of the film when Claire becomes more sensitive she is able to hear the ghost and begins following her voice thinking it's the Psychic. Claire finds herself in the basement where she was warned not to go. As she is sensitive to ghost the spirit of the \"Old Man\" finds his way to her energy and Claire being frighting falls down the stairs and hits her head. When she regains herself she sees is aware that the ghostly presence of the old man is following her. Clair runs to the back exit of the basement and closes the door behind her. The door starts moving and she hears banging and is even more frightened and the last thing she sees is the Ghost Bride before her and she blacks out and dies of an asthma attack. The 3 ghosts that the Psychic saw in the basement were The ghost bride,the old man, and Claire herself. Although the psychic said she see's events sometimes not as they are now but in the future. Her vision was of Claire's demise. In the final ending scene at the window we faintly see Claire standing looking out the window then the door slams shut. In reality the knocking and pounding Claire heard at the door was Luke trying to rescue her after he heard her screaming. Luke did not see the ghost or feel them because he was not a sensitive like Claire was. To him the basement was just a basement. There was no spirit of an old man or a bride there. To Claire who was sensitive she could hear and see them and they were attracted to her for that reason. Although the only thing that is never explained is what the ghost want from Claire and the Phsychic ex Actress never mentions anything about it as she is stunned by what she sees will happen in the basement with Claire's death.The Innkeeper's is a great movie with a very sad ending. It can be a reward for those that pay attention or a just a waste of time for those that weren't. This isn't exactly an upbeat film but a film that tries to add a bit of realism by creating realistic characters and more believable story instead of just bumps in the knight. In a way it's almost like some of the audience is Luke who doesn't see anything special or feel anything special from the movie and the rest of the audience is Claire that sees all these things going on and take in what's happening."
B006RECSBC I finally watched this on Netflix this morning and loved it. It's not some big budget scare fest but the certain scenes they did show were scary and I loved that old inn a lot. I think it was the inn and the quirky girl innkeeper that won me over. I'm gonna buy it from Amazon now for a great blu ray price."
B006RECSBC Ti West's THE INNKEEPERS is an atmospheric ghost story, relying on character and low-key shocks.  While I agree with fellow reviewers on the refreshing absence of gore and CGI effects, I find West's movies too formulaic and slow-paced.  INNKEEPERS seems padded and derivative---there's little we haven't seen before, and may seem more original only in comparison to today's more graphic, blood-heavy alternatives.Sarah Paxton (SHARK NIGHT 3D, ENTER NOWHERE) offers an inconsistent performance as the affectatious Claire.  She plays coy and naivete well, but exaggerates many gestures and expressions in her more dramatic scenes.  Pat Healy as Luke is too one-toned to incite any empathy.  TOP GUN's Kelly McGillis takes acting honors as the fading psychic actress, bringing a certain maturity to the film.The script itself is fairly predictable with a clumsy conclusion.  The violin-laden score is appropriately chilling.THE INNKEEPERS is a nice change of pace, b
B006RECSBC The script and dialogue had a cleverness that keep ones intrigue.  Character development was good and should not be overlooked.  Not a horror-teenfest by any means, but just a semi-creepy story that actually does not have super-cliqued ending that I would not ultimately have guessed."
B006RECSBC The Innkeepers (Ti West, 2011)Pretty much everyone I know with whom I have discussed The Innkeepers considers it a better movie than Ti West's previous one, The House of the Devil, and one of the reasons I have held off on reviewing it for as long as I have&#8212;I actually watched it for the first time well over a year ago as I write this opening paragraph&#8212;is that after I watched it, I vehemently disagreed. Nothing has happened in the ensuing fifteen months, including rewatching sections of the movie, sometimes obsessively, and discussing it to death with a few folks to try and get what it was I'm missing, but nothing has managed to sway me from my conviction that The House of the Devil is, quite simply, a much better-made film that is more successful at tapping into the homage it's going for than is The Innkeepers. Which is not, I should rush to add (but, curiously, I have not) to say that The Innkeepers is in any way not good. It is still, compared to most recent Hollywood horror fare, head and shoulders above anything else from a major studio you are likely to see within the next year, unless of course Ti West releases something (and doesn't suddenly revert to the guy who made such awful movies as The Roost).Plot: Claire (The Last House on the Left's Sara Paxton) and Luke (Rescue Dawn's Pat Healy) are the last two employees left working at a hotel that is slated for demolition, and all they have to do is get through their last weekend of unremitting boredom, go home, and then forget this place ever existed, right? Well, maybe not. They've never been swamped with customers, but for some reason, there's a steady stream of them this weekend. Well, a trickle, at least. More than usual. And some of them start reporting weird occurrences on the upper floors, leading to the conclusion that, perhaps, this won't be a boring weekend after all; Luke has long been researching the hotel's supposedly haunted past, and Sara finds herself reluctantly drawn into his obsession. But one of the cardinal rules of dealing with haunted places: you don't ever want to try to get the ghosts to talk to you...It's a fun little movie with a killer cast (Kelly McGillis, John Speredakos, Alison Bartlett O'Reilly, etc.) that spends much of its time suggesting, rather than showing, what's going on, and on that level, it succeeds just as well as its predecessor. But I mentioned the homage factor. I kind of have to dance around it here because saying what specific movie it pays homage to would give the entire final sequence away (but if you've got any exposure to the history of horror film, you'll know it the second you see it), but (a) it is obvious that West is once again paying homage here, and once you've seen the final sequence, going back and rewatching certain key scenes will show you it's not limited to the end of the movie, and (b) it's still a glancing blow, as opposed to the bullseye that was The House of the Devil vs. every Satanic Panic movie of the seventies (though if you want a specific movie, the one that always goes most through my head where The House of the Devil is concerned is The Night God Screamed, but kind of in reverse). Because of that, I think, that final sequence, and the denouement that follows it, got robbed of a lot of their power. (And oh, for the love of The Hills Have Eyes, did we really need that final shot? In case you're wondering, Magic 8-ball says &#8220;NO.&#8221;) Still, it's a great deal of fun; just remind yourself that the draggy sections are there for a reason. *** "
B006RECSBC Another nicely done creep fest that I missed in theaters last February, when it was given a limited theatrical run. The Inkeepers, now out on DVD and blu-ray from Dark Sky films, it combines elements of a 90's slacker comedy with a haunted house story. Starting out as a character piece and slowly descending into horror. This is a little more thoughtful than a lot of terror flicks, more leisurely paced, but all the richer for it.Written, directed and edited by Ti West, who previously directed the excellent old school shocker The House of the Devil (2010). This well written and often very funny movie has two twenty-something , the inkeepers of the title, working in an old hotel with minimal guests on the last week before they are closed and subsequently demolished. They are highly susceptible asthmatic Claire (Sara Paxton) and the slightly older Luke (Pat Healy), who have been tracking a ghost who is said to dwell in the hotel, for sometime on their live internet feed. Not much has happened, so far, so Claire decides to help the proceedings along a bit by trying to make contact with the help of a psychic and former TV sitcom star (played by 80's movie star Kelly McGillis) staying at the hotel.The movie works best when it is focusing on the two amiable main characters and there very humorous interactions. Not so much when the film takes a turn towards horror, but at least it is never graphic enough to completely spoil the feel of the earlier scenes. The ghosts are not well developed, we learn next to nothing about them, which frustrated me a bit. This isn't great, but better than a lot of recent chillers, but I still would have preferred anedy old school indie comedy over the admittedly limited spilled bloodcheck out my reviews at moviezonemagazine.com"
B006RECSBC Wow, what a boring movie, the cover had all these great reviews of how fantastic this movie is and that it's the best horror film of the year, what a let down, kept waiting for the horror to come, it didn't, my wife fell asleep it was the interesting, the characters were fine and the acting good, but the story was just not up to par, could not consider this movie as anything but a waste of time, sorry I bought it and paid full price, trying to hard, special effects were nothing special, no scares, they say old time creepy, not really, the old time horror movies that relied on atmosphere and story development are nothing like this movie, don't waste your time, though the movie might bore you to death."
B006RECSBC I find myself a bit torn in my opinion of The Innkeepers.  There's a lot to enjoy but there's also a fair amount to dislike about the film.  Director Ti West's story about an aging New England Inn in its final week of operation has a tone unlike most horror films.  There are a lot of elements that don't seem on the surface like they would mix together well, but the enjoyable cast makes the film eminently watchable.Claire (Paxton) and Luke (Healey) are a couple of twenty-something loafers who work at the Yankee Pedlar, a New England inn that is over a hundred years old.  With the owner on vacation, Claire and Luke are the only employees still working at the near-empty inn during its final week of operation.  With few guests to attend, and having to work 12 hour shifts the pair do what they can to amuse themselves and pass the time.  Fancying themselves amateur ghost hunters, they've setup a website to explore the legend of the Yankee Pedlar which is allegedly haunted by the spirit of a Madeline O'Malley, a woman who hung herself on her wedding day when her fianc&eacute; jilted her.As mentioned, The Innkeepers has a strange vibe to it.  The early part of the film has a good deal of comedy as the pair of Luke and Claire engage in various pursuits just to get through the day including drinking beer at the front counter, telling ghost stories to the young son of an annoying guest, just to get under her skin, and dealing with the wacky counterperson at the nearby coffee shop.  This, along with a slow pace doesn't fit with what you expect out of a horror film.  The tone changes abruptly with the arrival of Leanne Reese-Jones (McGillis) a former actress turned psychic.As Claire explores the inn at night with recording equipment, looking to pickup some EVP (electronic voice phenomena) she encounters voices whispering within the walls and the playing of a piano in the front lobby.  A terrified Claire runs to Leanne for help.  The psychic uses her ability to channel the spirits in the inn and warns Claire to stay clear of the basement.  The arrival of an elderly guest who wants to spend one last night in the honeymoon suite completes the transition from slacker comedy to full-on horror culminating with Claire's terrifying encounter with the inn's spirits.I suppose it depends on your outlook as to whether The Innkeeper's faults can be overlooked due to its positives or if it's positives are neutralized by the faults.  West's slow burn of a film develops the characters of Claire and Luke to the point where you can certainly relate to them.  The pair apparently have no prospects once the inn closes.  Claire's redoubtable spunkiness drives much of the action.  Last seen in the horrible film \"Shark Night\", Paxton appears here, sans tiny bikini and without make-up in a huge contrast from that film. There's a brilliantly funny scene as she is trying to open a dumpster lid with one hand and toss in a leaky plastic trash bag for the other...that is just a little too heavy for her to lift with a single hand and avoid whatever noxious contents are spilling out of the bag.  The dialog sparkles with a casual wit.  You feel like you're eavesdropping on a couple of real people when they are talking.But The Innkeepers has a major Achilles heel.  Too many questions are left unanswered at the film's conclusion; so many, in fact, that I found myself re-watching scenes to see if I missed the \"Shamalayan\" moment.  What did Leanne really see when she channeled the spirits?  And what was with her strange staring out of her room's window at the end?  For all of the development of the two leads, West is woefully short on any exposition when it comes to the spirits.  What are their motivations?  Why are they after Claire?  Why was it that Leanne's arrival seemed to have triggered the spirit's activity?  These issues prevent The Innkeepers from having the clean ending that most viewers desire.  But maybe that's what West was going for all along.Blu-Ray ExtrasTwo Audio commentaries: One with Writer/director/editor Ti West, producers Peter Phok & Larry Fessenden, and second unit director/sound designer Graham Reznick; and the second with Ti West and stars Sara Paxton & Pat Healy.Behinds the Scenes Featurette"
B006RECSBC I was looking for a good horror movie, that fell under the radar, to promote for halloween, and I was told that the Innkeepers was that film, but it wasn't. This film is so clique, stealing almost everything from other films of the same genre. They had the nerve to give this movie an R rating and call it the must see horror movie of the year, but truthfully, its slightly more scary than a Disney movie! An old hotel is going out of business and the two remaining employees decide to investigate the long history of ghost sightings at the establishment. There are only a couple guests, giving them the perfect opportunity to investigate. The only thing this film uses in order to frighten you is random things jumping out at you, which most of the time aren't what you expect them to be. There is also a creepy old woman staying there who can talk to the spirits and predict the future, but if that isn't bad enough, there is of course the investigations themselves. Using nothing but a s***ty old tape recorder, they go looking for EVPs, using every phrase and question they could steal from Ghost Hunters. Yeah, the Innkeepers really is that ridiculous and the only really shocking thing about this movie is that someone actually gave it an R rating! Was the MPAA associate a little girl or elderly woman, because honestly, Monster House was scarier than this thing was."
B006RECSBC \"This weekend's gonna be it. We're gonna get something good, I can feelit.\" During the final week at the Yankee Pedlar Inn the remainingemployees Claire (Paxton and Luke are determined to find out if thehotel is haunted. When events begin to happen that make them feel theyare right the two employees get more then they asked for. I have neverreally been a big horror movie fan. The ones I do like are the morepsychological ones with an actual story to them. I like the \"Saw\"series, but most of the \"torture-porn\" to me is not horror. All thatsaid I liked this movie. While this is not a typical horror and is nota fast moving movie at all it is still good enough to keep youwatching. For a lower budget movie the acting is actually really goodand there are scenes that will make you tense b
B006RECSBC It seems like every few years there is a new \"hot\" horror director who everybody thinks has found the magic formula, bringing the same level of thrills as the classics but doing it in a fresh new way. Most of these filmmakers fade away into straight-to-DVD land or into making survival horror video games. It's a hard genre to crack, but occasionally one director appears and proves he's truly worth keeping a close watch on. Although he's been around for years, Ti West's biggest break came with 2009's creepily retro The House of the Devil, which was so good a number of critics had it in their top 10 of the year. When was the last time that happened? His follow-up, The Innkeepers, is similar in that it's a twist on a familiar theme, that of the \"haunted hotel\". Even more, it shows that West isn't content to indulge in the gruesome, or fall back on lame jump cuts for cheap scares. Instead he relies on good old fashioned tension building and humor to make for a moody, effective thriller.The Yankee Pedlar has seen better days. The old hotel is creaking to it's final weekend before being turned into a parking lot. The place is basically abandoned, with even the owner not caring enough to stick around. Even his choice in who will manage the place to it's inevitable fate shows how little concern there is for the old, supposedly haunted building. Claire(Sara Paxton), a perky, asthmatic cherub with a runaway imagination; and Luke(Pat Healy), a smart mouthed wannabe ghost hunter struggle to even keep towels handy for the few remaining guests.  One of those is Leanne Rease-Jones(an unrecognizable Kelly McGillis) a former actress turned psychic/soothsayer, who puffs her cigarette and fingers her power crystal between disapproving glares at Claire.West structures his film in three short chapters, and those who are used to a constant barrage of loud \"booms\" and crashing piano keys might want to go home and watch their copy of The Grudge. The West has the feel of an old TV horror anthology, or an episode of The Twilight Zone. It relies mainly on atmosphere, and giving us a peek inside the minds of the characters we'll be terrified for later. In this case, boredom and idleness have taken over Claire and Luke's brains, with the emptiness of the building not helping the situation. Luke has put together an upstart website focusing on the paranormal, and Claire has become obsessed with the story of a woman who was left for dead in the basement and continues to haunt the hotel. While a little meandering, these first two chapters never fail to be attention grabbing, with West's script keeping the tone light,  the casual banter between Paxton and Healy often hilarious and even a little flirty. Well, as flirty as it gets for two such social outcasts. He clearly has a thing for her, but she's way too spacey to notice or care.There's a very thin line between comedy and terror when it comes to genre flicks like this, and West walks that tightrope with ease. His use of humor might seem out of place, especially for such an extended period of time, but by the time the final chapter rolls around you realize it was all done for a purpose. Your defenses lowered and all too relaxed, the genuine scares of the final chapter hit you like a sucker punch to the gut. West sets us up perfectly, with some fantastic camerawork, from long tracking hallway shots to some brilliant use of angles to keep us totally in the dark. Even when the film appears to be drifting along, there's a foreboding air just beneath the surface. When Luke starts warning Claire about the dangers of chasing ghosts, that she'll start to become paranoid, we know it won't be long before that very thing happens. But what fun it is to watch as it does!The best horror filmmakers are masters at playing all of the audiences emotions to maximum effect, and after only a handful of films, Ti West has proven himself to be one who can."
B006RECSBC Ti West's The Innkeepers (2011) spends most of its time in a small inn, immersing you in a strange reality where the emphasis is on the paranormal.  This slow burn is mostly atmospheric, as not a great deal seems to happen, but if you stick with it, you may be in a receptive frame of mind, for the unsettling conclusion.With a somewhat notorious history, the Yankee Pedlar Inn is about to close.  The establishment is supposedly haunted by the ghost of Madeline O'Malley, a woman who killed herself in the inn, after being abandoned by her husband.  While the owner is away, employees Luke (Pat Healy) and Claire (Sara Paxton) make up the entire staff for the last few days.  With not much to do, these ghost hunter wannabes pass their time looking for evidence of Madeline's presence.  The inn is nearly empty, with actress turned medium Leanne Rease-Jones (Kelly McGillis), being one of the final guests.Claire is the more active ghost hunter, and she confides in Rease-Jones after a spooked Luke flees from the inn.  With some psychic ability, Leanne is able to offer some assistance, as she and Claire venture into the basement, where the ghost is supposed to dwell.  Leanne advises Claire that they need to leave immediately.  Claire attempts to clear out the last of the guests, but discovers that he has already checked out.  Back in the lobby, she finds that Luke has returned, but Leanne is now absent.  The end is near, but will they all survive?The Innkeepers moves at a leisurely pace.  Claire and Luke have so little to do, that even providing fresh towels is a major undertaking.  Mostly free to do as they wish, and seemingly fascinated by ghosts and the paranormal, we come to know them as two different varieties of geek.  Claire is hyper, goofy, clumsy, and often behaves like a child.  Luke has a hairdo like Tin Tin, is something of a cynic, and acts like Claire's smartass older brother, although he is actually attracted to her.  Healy and Paxton bring a quirkiness to their roles, which makes them mostly amusing to watch.  Her role as a medium may be something of a clich&eacute;, but even with limited screen time Kelly McGillis manages to bring some credibility to it.With such a substantial buildup, you fully expect a paranormal incident of some kind.  Unfortunately, what occurs may not be quite enough to satisfy.  There are some creepy moments, cheesy jump scares, and decent special effects, but the magnitude of the horror isn't exactly overwhelming, and is sure to have some asking \"Is that it?\", when the film is over.Ti West's approach, reminiscent of some traditional 70's ghost stories, may be a fun change of pace for some.  Although rated R, what happens appears to fall well within the PG13 sphere.  The story holds together fairly well until the end, when the bottom falls out, and the door slams shut on the events at the Yankee Pedlar Inn."
B006RECSBC \"The Innkeepers\" is a thinking person's ghost story. That is what the latest effort from writer/director Ti West (\"The House of the Devil\") attempts to be. He would not resort to such familiar tricks as gores and loud noises to scare his audiences. That is a good thing. Unfortunately, the premise of \"The Innkeepers,\" good as it is, ends up being poorly executed. In short, the film is atmospheric and sporadically scary, but all in all tedious.\"The Innkeepers\" centers on two hotel clerks Claire (Sara Paxton) and Luke (Pat Healy) working for The Yankee Pedlar Inn that will close down soon. The hotel, it is rumored, is haunted by the ghost of Madeline O'Malley, a bride who died a tragic death many years ago. Claire and Luke, both enthusiastic about ghost stories and other paranormal activities, Claire and Luke, start investigating the legendary ghost, equipped with ghost hunting gear.Ti West as director employs a slow-burn approach for the first hour or so, keeping the pace deliberately slow with false alarms. That is not a bad idea. Then, while he ratchets up the tension towards the climax, he also leaves the interpretation of several key events open to our imagination. The problem is, most viewers would lose interest in what is going on before the film finally gets interesting.\"The Innkeepers\" takes too much time in setting up the characters and the inn's back stories. Claire is a college drop-out who does not know what she wants to do, while Luke is a self-proclaimed paranormal investigator. Besides that, not much is revealed about them. With the arrival of former actress Leanne Rease-Jones (Kelly McGillis) as a guest, who gives a warning to Claire, the story finally knows where it should go.Even then, without a compelling storyline and teasing details, the film keeps us waiting for the climax that is pretty good. Until then \"The Innkeepers\" is all about suggestions and insinuations about what to come in the end, but the characters' motives remain unclear and unconvincing, and the suggested mysteries are not intriguing. Not saying everything is a time-tested technique to build interest and tension, to be sure, but taking too much time to do so (and saying too little for that matter) is a different thing."
B006RXPUQ8 The folks who made this movie were trying for a scify horror story that,1,doesn't show any understanding of science ( you can't clone a human from red blood cells-they have no dna ),and,2, tries to go for horror with a 'The Shineing' rip off.What they do succed in is regurgitating anti abortion propaganda, and do the disapearing good christians in the rapture bit.A 'mad scientist' wants to clone people, why his project is protected by soldiers is anybodies guess. A woman fertility doctor who can't have children steals one of the cloned embrios and implants it in her womb in the womens toilet. Cut to 'seven years later'. The boy heals a dead mouse. Mother takes the boy to see the 'mad scientist' who by now has had a religous conversion and kills his family so they can go to heaven. He smothers his wife with a pillow and smothers his little girl with a teddy bear. Their bodies disapear leaving only thier clothes behind, just like all the people in the church did.'Mad scientist' was trying to clone jesus! Wants the boy to forgive him! Shoots mom whos body disapears. But, oops!, the boy isn't Jesus, he's the anticrist. Movie ends with him asking satan a 'knock knock' joke.Don't waist your time on this; theres nothing new or well done here."
B006RXPUQ8 Excuse the cheesy line, but I'm Not Jesus Mommy isn't a good film. The film is about Kimberly who decides to impregnate herself with a stolen clone because she's not capable of having children. The film quickly jumps around from her impregnation, 9 months after that, then another 7 years after that to the apocalypse; poor storytelling throughout the film may leave you lost. The story really doesn't bother explaining much. It's a slightly interesting story but the acting is terrible. Kimberly, the mother character, has no emotion in her acting and all of her dialogue sounds terrible; no heart whatsoever in her acting leading to a painful-to-watch performance, she has some potential though. Also, if you watched the teasers/trailers you might be expecting a film similar to The Omen, but it really has only a few similarities.However, I did enjoy the music in the film a lot. Also, David, the child, was often genuinely creepy. I didn't dislike this film because of its scientific or religious elements; I dislike this film because it's simply a poorly executed movie.I do not recommend directly paying to watch I'm Not Jesus Mommy. If you must watch this movie, it is available on Netflix streaming as of 6/17/12 to save some money."
B006RXPUQ8 Creepy, scary, suspenseful and love watching over and over. I love Amazing post apocalyptic movies and this one is a doozy."
B006RXPUQ8 When I read about the film in Redbox (Devil's Angel), it reveals information that is not revealed in the film until the last 5-10 minutes. I won't do that per se, but the film is so bad, spoilers won't matter.Full figured Dr. Kimmy Gabriel (Bridget McGrath) can not have a child, but keeps on trying. She is very pro-life and reluctantly accepts a position at a human clone project under Dr. Roger Gibson (Charles Hubbell). She steals a cloned embryo and implants it in herself. The film jumps to seven years later as the world is thrust into a post apocalyptic nightmare as Kimmy and her son David (Rocko Hale) live in a run down tenement living off government MRE handouts.The film has heavy religious messages as both lesion faced Kim and Roger are very religious and frequently read from the Bible and listen to radio preachers. This appears to be a \"come to Jesus film\" except the \"good guys\" do nothing heroic to save the day or themselves. Indeed, if anything they appear to be part of the problem which is to make a statement about the condition of human existence.This film is very low budget. The sets are meager. The acting is bad and dialouge has a religious corniness to it. It fails to get interesting until 10 minutes before the final credits and by then you pray for the end.Knowing the \"secret\" of the film by reading the by-line I couldn't help but think during the film...\"Funny. He doesn't look Jewish.\"Parental Guide: No f-bombs, sex, or nudity. Bridget McGrath cleavage."
B006RZZDU4 Action packed, intelligent, creative, fun to watch on Kindle Fire.  Great writers and great Special affects that keep you glued to your chair and Kindle fire, if your wife does not need anything for duration!"
B006RZZDU4 This is a very good animation of iron man and the characters and story line was very good also.  When I watched Iron Man 3 and they mentionextremis and I decided to watch the animation series again and I enjoyed it very much. But it is more for mature audiences than children."
B006RZZDU4 Show has elements from movie and animation is cool as a moving comic.  Great to be able to view on Kindle Fire HD."
B006RZZDU4 I ordered this movie series because of my little grandson.  He loves the  action but at 3 yrs he doesn't stay long on any one show.  The older grandkids will enjoy the entire series."
B006RZZDU4 This series ie worth watching if you like the minimalist animated Comic Book style.  I do and so its entertaining to me.  My wife on the other hand found it a bit boring.If you enjoy modern comic art this should be a treat, if not you probably won't."
B006RZZDU4 I actually like watching this animated series with my 4yr old.He likes all the super hero stuff though....but then so do I."
B006S0007E The so-called animation for this series was interesting.  I guess it's been referred to as &#34;motion comic&#34; and that's certainly a much more applicable term.  Basically, there's very little movement/animation, so it's like reading or hearing a comic book, but with some minor animations.  Normally, that's not my cup of tea, but I've given this four stars because the writing of this series was good enough to keep me interested in this motion comic series.  I would, however, caution you to expect far more Loki than Thor, so the title is somewhat misleading."
B006S0007E Interesting and boring all at once comic books have traditionally been meant as a moral compass for the youth of the US, and, in more recent times, for cultures world-wide.  So it is that the Norse god of thunder and his apparently \"adopted\" brother Loki are pitted against one another in a sort of Kane and Abel kind of story, where one has the unique opportunity to get rid of the competition.After much hemming and hawing the plot is finally put into motion, but with unsurprising results.  I say unsurprising because I have a hard time believing that a disgruntled brother, one who has a history of malfeasance, would transform so in the amount of time given to this story.  Particularly since he comes from an extremely bloody pantheon and society based upon combat and bloodshed.  But, that's the magic of comic books.The technical merits of the film are interesting.  Fully rendered comic book panels are rendered into CGI animation, and proves an interesting watch.  Moreover actually bringing the actual comic book experience to life, so to speak, perhaps not to ironically enough, shows how rediculous some of the stories actually are, and exposes the time twisting that comic book artists and story tellers use to convey their psychological message.  Think about how much time has passed in all four episodes of this saga, and think about Loki's resolution to his own dilemma.Not bad, really, but not amazingly good.  If you're into comic books, then this should entertain.  Otherwise I'd skip it."
B006SV4QFK I love books. And art supplies. And all things Disney. And... well, the list goes on.  So, I'll confess that I like shows about hoarding because they nudge me to weed out and reorganize. I never want my home to resemble what I see on &#34;Hoarders.&#34;However, at a certain point -- and Season 5 of &#34;Hoarders&#34; seems to be there -- the &#34;ah-HA!&#34; light bulb turns on. Instead of the cool, quirky, &#34;Wow... how very weird!&#34; intrigue of the cases featured on the show... well, this season seems sad.All of these people seem mentally ill. Most have experienced some kind of trauma that triggered the impulse to hold onto everything, or build an insulating wall of stuff around them as a defense, or both.  And, all of them have made their own lives a misery and had a profoundly negative impact on people they love.I'm not sure that should be on the TV as entertainment. Unfortunately, they're not actual documentaries, either. I mean, we all know the problems we're seeing aren't actually resolved in an hour, a week, or even a year, no matter how great the aftercare.So, while these shows still kick me into gear so I revisit my various personal indulgences (like books and art supplies), the subject -- as something to watch on TV -- has become less entertaining.  Instead of taking the show in the direction of weirder & weirder collections and hoarding efforts, this season seemed to head in an unhappy direction. They're featuring more deeply traumatized people with more devastating and tragic impacts on the people around them.I'll continue watching because I'm hoping the producers realized most viewers aren't there to see the train wreck.  We don't turn on the TV to pity others... do we?  Well, maybe I'm one of a minority of viewers who watch &#34;Hoarders&#34; (and similar TV shows) for two reasons: To see how very interesting people are when they allow collecting to run wild, and to recognize those impulses we all have, and clean house long before collecting becomes a problem."
B006SV4QFK I know people who are &#34;collectors&#34; but what they collect have value.  A person who collects junk definitely needs professional help!  Another thing I cannot understand is how people can live in such filth!  You have to have a mental problem in order to do so.I watch these shows and they reassure me that I'm still all right!"
B006SV4QFK We watch this almost like watching a train wreck. So many people with some kind of quirky genetic makeup! They could all be related. Always mention some tragic event which triggers the hoarding behavior. Not sure that makes sense when so many people handle tragedies every day. Love how the team manages to scoop out much of the mess and it always gives us incentive to drop off a load at Goodwill!"
B006SV4QFK It is amazing to me how some people live their lives. This show shows some pretty extreme cases of hoarding and the steps they take to fix the situation."
