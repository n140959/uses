B00002N674 Good USA company that stands behind their products. I have had to warranty two hoses and they send replacements right out to you. I had one burst after awhile, you could see it buldge for weeks before it went so no suprises. The other one was winter related as I am bad and leave them out most of the time. Highly reccomend. Note the hundred footer is heavy and like wresting an anaconda when its time to put away, but it does have a far reach.
B00002N674 This is a high quality 8 ply hose. I have had good luck with Gilmour hoses in the past. A good choice in hoses.
B00002N674 It's probably one of the best hoses I've ever had.Pro's:- It's good enough for most front yards, or small back yards.- It has enough flow (and with the right head) to water plants 25ft away from the nozzle, and water your garden.- It's light weight, and flexible (it does not pose as much of a problem unrolling this hose with kinks as with other hoses I've owned)- The hose is flexible, yet strong. I haven't cut the outside yet.- This hose has been in full sunlight for more than 3 months, and the rubber hasn't cracked yet! I believe it's good quality rubber.cons:- Like with every hose, keeping it outside in the sunshine, the water warms up and starts smelling.My dog don't want to drink from the water coming from this hose.- The hose is only in one color (I wished it was a little less visible in the gardenOtherwise this hose is an excellent garden tool!I bought 2 of them, one 25ft for my front garden, and 50ft for my rear garden.3-4months and still in excellent condition!
B00002N674 I probably should have bought something a bit more flexible and less rugged since I constantly coil/uncoil it for washing cars, but that's my fault not a product fault.
B00002N674 I bought three of these 5/8-inch Flexogen hoses--50, 75, and 100 feet--for different areas of yard around the house.  After a season of use they've proven to be good hoses.  Of course, it's very favorable that they don't leak.  But what particularly impresses me about them is their notably light weight and flexibility, which make them a lot easier to handle than my previous hoses.  The flexibility diminishes in cold weather, but a garden hose is less useful then anyway.They're not especially prone to kinking, but they're not kink-proof, either, nor do they claim to be.  They kink a lot less than one of my old hoses and more than a couple of others, but the latter were fairly stiff, so there was a trade-off.Bottom line:  this was a good purchase.
B00002N674 I aqm impressed with the cost and quality of this product, Also impressed on the fast shipment by Amazon as I received it in 4 days, Has not kinked and a great hose as I had one before which I left in the yard during all seasons and even ran across driveway, But it lasted 5 good years through all the abuse,  I would recommend this to anyone, Thanks
B00002N67P After using this hose I will never go back to small diameter garden hoses.  The water flows with much more force, which is especially useful when using the jet nozzle.  Most garden hoses are only 1/2\" diameter, and some premium hoses are 5/8\", but this is 3/4\".There is a significant water pressure loss with regular hoses because the smaller diameter means that more of the water is in contact with the walls, plus it flows at higher velocity further increasing the friction.  You'd be amazed looking at the charts, just how much pressure is lost with the cheap standard hoses.  For example:I'm looking at a plastic pipe friction head loss chart.  At 5 gallons per minute, the pressure friction head loss per 100 ft is 5.3 ft for a 3/4\" pipe (same size as this hose).  For a 1/2\" (regular hose size) pipe the head loss is 20.7 ft - that's 4x less height that the water can travel merely because of friction from the smaller inside diameter!I also noticed, this hose also has less tendency to kink.
B00002N67P This is one tough hose and it is thick and stiff.The connections are strong and the hose is industrial strength.I bought this to use with my pressure washer because it is 8 ply and 3/4 inch wide.My old hose was just rubber and it was flexing and twisting and there is no way this hose is going to do that.The hose is warrantied for life and unless there is a problem with a leak i don't think i will ever need to use it.The local big box stores do not sell a 3/4 50 foot hose and my pressure washer will not operate with anything longer than 50 feet.The price and delivery were great and Amazon is the best around if there is ever a concern.
B00002N67P I'll buy more of these come  Spring. Holding up very well to the extreme heat and cold of Idaho.  A bit on the heavy side, but that is what makes them last so well.
B00002N67P So far so good! I have not really had the time to test out the hose as it is cold weather time right now. I bought this Gilmour hose based on all the recommendations. I am looking forward to not having to wrestle the hose to use it.
B00002N67P Hey Gilmore I have been buying your hoses for years and only your hoses. You stand behind your product and provide great customer support..  But I am only giving you 4 stars  because this hose and the 100 footer I bought  a few months back seem to kink more than my older Flexogens not sure why ?
B00002N67Q This is a good quality hose that I use to connect to my &#34;Scarecrow&#34; so as to keep the deer away from my plants. It sits in the sun all day long and so far shows no sign of degradation.
B00002N67Q I bought a cheap hose that didn't hold the pressure after 2 days.  This bad boy hold the pressure and doesn't leak.  Its not even expanding.  Great quality hose.  I will be keeping them in mind when I need more length.
B00002N67Q I was worried about getting a short one, but this serves my need just fine, as it accompanied by a longer and more troublesome one.  I leave the sprinkler on it instead of switching heads - so much easier.  slightly stiff to lay out, but if it weren't, I am sure it would kink.  I got it with the gilmore brass 2-way hose connector - an excellent pair for me
B00002N67Q For everything I need for my lawn and garden work I try to find a Gilmour product.  They just can't be beat for the price and/or guarantee.  This hose is typical of a Gilmour item.  It is a strong and supple hose and like most other Gilmour products, comes with a lifetime guarantee.  I have cut hoses with my mower and they still replace them.  Quite a company!
B00002N67Q It's been outside in the hot (South Florida) sunshine 24/7, and still flexible. No crackles, and remains in great shape!A real bargain!
B00002N67Q I've always been one of those people that bought the cheapest kind of hose whenever I needed one.  I don't do much in the way of gardening, nor wash my car that often.  So investing in a really good quality hose didn't make that sense to me.  The only flaw in that logic is cheap hoses have a habit of breaking and leaking just sitting there on the reel, whether you use them or not.  So in the long run you don't save much.  That, and the fact that cheap hoses also make you feel like you are wrestling a snake when using them for they are so stiff and kink like crazy.  When I decided to buy a better hose I came across this one and liked it immediately.  It's very well made and just about as flexible a hose you can buy without going for one of those new fangled shrinking hoses.  (I'm not sold on the long term quality of those).  This thing is a pleasure to use, as well as making it much simpler a task of rolling it up when you're done.  It kinda reminds me of what my cheap hose felt like when it was sitting out stretched in the sun for a while.  It would feel much softer and more flexible.  Something this does with or without sun.  Though its true that getting that flexibility carries with it a little more weight in the hose itself, its such a pleasure to use that I feel the trade off is well worth it.  It only takes a short time to get used to it being a little heavier anyway, and I love being able to roll it up on the reel when done so easily.  A top notch hose that carries a generous amount of quality, convenience, all for a fair price that I highly recommend... : )
B00002N67Q I've been in the Landscape Industry for over 60 years and have owned my own company for 23 years. One of the odder phenomenons I've experienced is that client's will spend $1,000 on a garden sculpture or $100 for a bottle of wine for a garden party but then they turn into Scrooge McDuck when it comes to sinking ANY SUM OF MONEY into the items required to properly care for the garden!Gimmicks abound in any industry but it seems that in the Green Industry, a Fool and Their Money is Guaranteed to Be Parted! Curly hoses, shrinky hoses, pink & purple hoses...the very item that delivers Life Giving Water is dismissed and ignored and people insist on spending the LEAST amount of money on a hose. Aside from the very important matter of a hose needing double walls to withstand the constant P.S.I. (pounds per square inch), a good hose also needs to have solid brass couplings, and have enough plys to avoid kinking.THIS hose delivers! Yes, there is heft to it's weight...that's what you NEED from a quality hose! And, it refuses to kink, even when you try to kink it as a test. I've bought Gilmour hoses for clients and my own company's use for over 17 years and NEVER needed to replace a single one! The 25 foot length is excellent to extend a longer hose for occasional use, rather than dragging that extra length around your property 24/7. Also, for very small Urban Gardens, rarely do you need more than 15 feet of hose so the 25' length is perfect for city gardens or roof top decks.Here are some tips from someone that works for a living with garden hoses:1) Use a cheap rope that you pick up at the Dollar Store to get the MAXIMUM LENGTH of hose you need. Mark that length down. Then, using the same rope, measure the NORMAL LENGTH that you will need on a daily/weekly basis. If the difference is more than 10 feet, BUY TWO OR MORE HOSES! Yes, I know that sounds insane but hear me out.If on a daily basis, you only need a 50' hose to reach your 40' garden, WHY are you buying a 100' hose to drag around? If you only need that additional 25 or 50 feet for the few times you wash your car or windows or fill a pool, buy some quick-connects and the extention hose length that you'll only use rarely. Hoses come in 10', 25', 50', 75', 100' and 150' length; ONLY buy the shortest length you need 90% of the time and then an additional hose to attach when needed.2) To coil your hose easily whether you store it on the ground or on a hose wheel, turn OFF THE WATER and keep the nozzle OPEN to drain the pounds and pounds of water that are trapped inside the hose! If you hate getting dirty hands, use garden gloves to coil it up and using the natural curl of the hose, just continue to coil it, turning the hose as needed.3) During the Summer, attach a PLASTIC SHUT OFF VALVE to both ends of the hose: the one connected to your home's spigot and also to the nozzle of choice. WHY? Because plastic does NOT corrode like any metal will do and if you have high minerals in your water, there are times that the hose coupling will actually become permanently corroded to the spigot or nozzle, making it completely impossible to remove! I know that we're taught that Metal=Good and Plastic=Bad but trust me...when I have to tell a client that they either need to replace a $70 hose or hire a plumber to remove a sealed/corroded coupling, that $2 dollar plastic gate valve becomes priceless!4) ALWAYS DRAIN YOUR HOSE, DETACH THE GATE VALVES AND STORE YOUR HOSE, VALVES AND NOZZLE IN A FREEZE-PROOF AREA!!! If I don't do it for my client's and trust them to do it, it never gets done. And after the first hard frost, trapped water in nozzles, hoses and valves expands and can destroy all of the above in one night. It takes less than 30 minutes to winterize two hoses and attachments; figure out the cost of replacing everything in Spring when you find them all destroyed!5) One of the best ways to RUIN ANY HOSE, is to tug-tug-tug at the coupling, which breaks the weld and suddenly you have a leak that can't be fixed! I simply make a small loop in the end that attachs to the house which acts as a \"brake\" and takes the pressure off of the coupling and spigot.I only recommend landscape items that I trust to use with all my employees and on all my jobs. When I gain new clients, I teach them the benefits of a good hose and order it for them, never having to do it again. Buy one less bottle of good wine and use that cash for your hose. You won't be sorry! :)
B00002N67Q This little hose was purchased to add on to my other 50 foot hose due to the very humid and oppressive weather this last month in the Northeast.  It is very flexible and easy to handle and allows me total reach of the back perennial garden.  i would recommend this hose
B00002N68C There is only one thing wrong with this design:  the spray shape and the water volume can not be controlled independently. Better designs have one control for open-closed and another for spray shape. That makes this nozzle useless for filling buckets and other close applications. It is impossible to get high volume at low pressure output.That said, the simple design is almost bomb-proof and the price is fair.
B00002N68C This is definitely a good quality nozzle. It is similar to the &#34;old fashioned&#34; type nozzle we had as kids. It gives differing spray patterns depending on how far you squeeze the trigger.
B00002N68C It looks like it came right out of an episode of Leave It To Beaver but don't be fooled by this retro-looking nozzle. This feels great in my hand and functions way better than the plethora of nozzles I have tried in the past. The trigger has a real nice, snappy, feel to it.Unlike my other nozzles that are made from plastic, I actually think this will survive a winter outdoors in PA. The only thing I have to get used to is that the type of spray is determined by the pressure I apply on the trigger. Everything else about it is perfect.
B00002N68C I am very happy that I bought this nozzle. It is exactly what I wanted. Good quality and I highly recommend it. I really need it too.
B00002N68C I have bought many types of nozzle over the years and this old timer which I used to use when I was growing up served me well this past season.
B00002N68C This is a nice hose nozzle - simple design, sturdily made and inexpensive. It can go from high-powered jet mode to gently spray just by loosening your grip. It also doesn't leak at all where it attaches to the hose!My only gripe would be that when you use the widest spray pattern, it can come out unevenly &#8211;e.g., it's not an even &#34;circle&#34; of water coming out, which makes watering evenly a little challenging. But it's not a big deal.Get one, you'll like it.
B00002N68C Nozzles exactly like this have been around for at least 40 years--manufactured in a dozen companies--and sold under a wide variety of brand names---for a very good reason---they are the best design.  They are perfectly and easily controllable, durable, and don't leak.  You can get \"prettier\" versions with plastic covers over the grip and plastic handles, if \"pretty\" is your priority---but, functionally speaking, you can't buy a better designed garden hose nozzle.THUMB SCREWNote the little thumb screw at the end of the piston can be used to adjust the type of spray when the handle is maximally squeezed.  If you wish, you can tighten the screw (you may need pliers to do so, and/or you may need to grease the screw threads) back from full unfocused flow to the tightest stream for long throws---that makes long throws a little easier.LOCK-ON LOOPNotice the small wire loop at top---when the lever is complete depressed, you can rotate the loop back to prevent the lever from closing, and then you can release your grip.  So, this is a \"lock on\" device, which becomes particularly useful when you use the brass screw to adjust to the pattern you want.  For example, if you always want a medium cone spray, you can adjust the sprayer semi-permanently to that setting.NOT A VALVEOne reviewer complains that there is no \"medium\" strength, e.g., for filling buckets.  What do you expect?  The actual \"problem\", as far as that reviewer was concerned, is the nozzle is \"too good\"---it delivers full pressure, at all but the tightest mist setting.  Although it does have a \"closed\" position, this is a nozzle, NOT a valve. If you want a VALVE to reduce the PRESSURE, then install aMelnor 390S Hose Shut-Offor aGilmour Brass Garden Hose Connector With Shut-Off Valve 03Vjust before the nozzle.  Or, close your faucet part way.  Alternatively, to fill a bucket, loosen the thumb screw, then \"open 'er up\" (squeeze the handle all the way)---the result is is maximum unfocused flow, which is perfect for very quickly filling a bucket, etc.COMPLAINTS OF OTHER REVIEWERSMany reviewers (of this and other products) write reviews about different, but similar-looking, products.  Many of the complaints are about sprayers which are NOT \"Gilmour 572TF\".  If you find a sprayer that looks like this in \"bargain bin\" at your local hardware store---it probably is not a \"Gilmour 572TF\", unless the packaging says so.  Sometimes when you order from an Amazon Vendor (rather than Amazon itself)---you don't get exactly the product described.  I'm NOT saying that Gilmour is always the best, but only that THIS review is about the \"Gilmour 572TF\", and other reviewers 1-star reviews MAY not be.CAVEATSHere in the tropics (South Florida)---the year-round heat is hard on all garden tools.  After a year or two, the zinc metal body can seize on your hose and be difficult to unscrew.  I suggest greasing the screw threads with silicon grease when you install it on the hosePermatex 22058 Dielectric Tune-up Grease - 3 oz.If you don't have silicon grease on hand, buy a tube---it terrific for improving electrical connections and refurbishing rubber items, and even for lubricating things such as this.  While you are at it, lubricate all your hose connections (both the threads and the seals) to prevent leaking and to make it easy to screw-on and -off the hoses and accessories.Why not petroleum-based grease?  Petroleum-based grease damages rubber seals.  However even petroleum grease is better than no grease (besides most hose gaskets are now plastic, not rubber)After 2 or 3 years of abuse the action can get begin to get stiff, presumably caused by internal corrosion (or the original grease having deteriorated or lost).  The handle (the lever in back) is steel, and can rust.  Ultimately the stiffness plus the rust results in the handle breaking (after 5 years or so of abuse).  Ideally, keep the nozzle dry---at least don't keep it in a muddy puddle, or half-buried in acidic soil.  It is good idea to lubricate the piston with grease when you start to notice it getting stiff. (With the water off, squeeze the handle to expose the brass rod.  Apply a liberal amount of grease to the piston).  If the nozzle is very stiff, take it off the hose, spray it heavily with WD-40, let it soak for 15 minutes or so---that will probably adequately loosen it up, but is not a permanent solution---you still need to grease it.But those are the extremes---reasonably well taken care of (or at least not abused) a nozzle can last 10 years or more.ALTERNATIVES> Folks with arthritis or weak grips may be happier with traditional brass nozzles, such asDramm 12380 Heavy-Duty Brass Adjustable Hose Nozzle.  These are virtually indestructible, and hold any particular spray pattern until you change it.> Those \"prettier\" versions of the zinc nozzle with plastic handles I mentioned may be more pleasant to use in the winter, and might get the wife's approval.  Often these are only 50 cents or so more than the 573TF, and in that case are clearly better choices.Gilmour 572TFR Commercial Insulated Grip Nozzle with Threaded Front, Red,Gilmour Comfort Grip Nozzle with Threaded Front 593 Black,Gilmour 572 Insulated Pistol Grip Nozzle.> High quality all plastic versions are available for use around salt water.Gilmour Salt Water and Marine Nozzle 474S> There are cheap plastic versions you can get for $1--$2 in \"bargain bins\", which are a good deal for the price, but are not nearly as durable, and through an Amazon vendor when you add shipping your total cost is the same as a zinc or high quality plastic sprayer.> There are versions with spray-pattern or nozzle heads on the front---but that sabotages the virtues of the basic design, reducing the sprayer body into a mere valve.  You'd be better off with a brass nozzle sprayer mentioned above.  I find constantly having to rotate the head to select the 1 or 2 spray patterns I use to be very annoying.  For example (not recommended)Gilmour Pistol Grip Nozzle 327 Teal/Red> If you (or your wife) insists on a \"pretty\" nozzle with s electable spray patterns, I suggest the hybridGilmour Select-A-Spray Comfort Grip Nozzle 594 Black/Tealor Gilmour Select-A-Spray Metal Nozzle 584.  One setting is the full-action, and there are several selectable patterns.NERD CORNERThe zinc body corrodes through electrolytic action.  I.e., the zinc will \"sacrifice\" itself (and corrode) to protect iron or any other metal of lower electrolytic potential which it is touching, or with which it is sharing a conducting solution (such as a water-saturated acidic soil), or salt-water .  So try to keep it dry and away from unpainted, ungalvanized steel, or salt water.  (Galvanized steel is iron coated with zinc for this very purpose, to prevent the iron from rusting--not as a barrier like paint, but rather by electrolytic action).What about those other pretty, fancy, mostly plastic sprayer nozzles (which cost 3x--4x more) that you see at the garden center?---they don't work nearly as well, and won't last nearly as long.  I know this for a fact---my wife keeps buying them---indeed we have a bin of discarded (mostly still functional) \"pretty\" sprayer nozzles, which have \"fallen out of favor\" for various reasons.
B00002N68C I've tried all sorts of nozzles for my hose and they either break, get stuck on the end of the hose, or don't have enough power to really blast things with water. This nozzle is durable, easy to remove, and super strong!
B00002N68C metal too soft, its all wore out after light use, the thread on front already smooth out.lots rust on the back puller/handle part, need something with better material, rather buy once and be done with it for many year.
B00002N6AN I've always bought cheap sprinklers that would ineffectively water the lawn and me, too. It killed me to spend so much on a sprinkler, but I've probably sunk so much on junk sprinklers in the past 10 years and bit the bullet after reading the reviews for the Raintrain. Convenience alone makes this sprinkler really attractive, but it does a good job and that is a real draw.Operation is easy. Extend the garden hose where you want to water as the hose is the 'track' that the Raintrain runs on. By adjusting the time and the pressure you essentially control where you water and the degree of water used. Then sit back and enjoy as  the Raintree does the work.  No more moving the sprinkler or possibly getting showered. It doesn't get much simpler.The spray is low and slow so everything gets watered more effectively and there is less evaporation. My lawn really looks better than it had when I used my old sprinkler.I use this in my garden  and it does a good job keeping all my perennials and herbs staying healthy and lush.This sprinkler is well made and worth the higher than average price.
B00002N6AN There are some positive features about the Nelson Raintree Traveling Sprinkler that makes is an excellent sprinkler, and a good one to have if one has a large lawn. It's definitely sturdily built, and with a steel body, it appears nearly indestructible. Because it's a &#34;traveling&#34; sprinkler, once you have it set and have placed the hose in the middle of the track you want it to cover, it will move on its own and give a wide area of lawn a thorough sprinkling. One doesn't have to run out every little while to move the sprinkler so that it can water another patch of ground. Also, there's a little ramp you can run the hose through so that when the sprinkler has completed its intended course it reaches the ramp and shuts off on its own. This is particularly useful if you're not going to be around to monitor it.Now, a couple less positive features. First, this is an appropriate sprinkler only for those parts of the lawn that are relatively wide open and devoid of obstacles. We have a number of large trees in both our front and back yards. Also, we have tree rings and the like, which mean that parts of our lawn are isolated from the rest. We need a second sprinkler to cover these parts. So, buy this only if you have a large enough amount of open space to make having one worthwhile.Second, it is a very heavy sprinkler. I realize that this is the price one pays for a large metal object. But if you want a light-weight piece of equipment, this isn't it.
B00002N6AN I've had my Raintrain for a little over a year now.  I was initially very enthusiastic about it, but over time, I grew less satisfied with it.Pros:>For some reason, it's mesmerizing to watch.  After I get it set up, I always watch for a few moments to make sure the water throw is adjusted properly, and then I find myself watching it longer than necessary.  There's just something cool and relaxing about how the arms spin and the wheels turn and how it slowly moves along.  From talking to some other people who own this and similar products, \"sprinkler watching\" seems to be a common phenomenon.>The coarse spray is ideal for use in windy areas.  You'll get a lot less drift and evaporation using this than you would with a finer-droplet sprinkler.>The adjustability is impressive.  I have a long, 4-foot swatch of grass that would be difficult to water with most other sprinklers, but on the Raintrain, I can point the arms way down and keep the water where I want it.  But I can also point the arms way up and throw the water for at least 50 feet.>It's quiet.  The only sound it makes is the water hitting the grass.>The shut-off feature is very handy and worked quite well (initially).>It stands up well to neglect.  I left both my sprinkler and the stop block sitting outside in the sun and snow all winter, and come spring, they seemed no worse for wear.  Also, you are supposed to disconnect the sprinkler and let it drain after each use, and I've never done that, with no apparent effect yet.Cons:>This thing is really heavy, as it needs to be, but when you're hauling it out to the north forty (okay, the back of a 6500-square-foot lawn), it's a little cumbersome.>The hose connection is awkwardly placed.  It's in the somewhat narrow space at the back between the wheels, so I find it a little difficult to get a good grip on the connector.  There are also two inexplicable protrusions in the body of the sprinkler right next to the connector, and this makes it even harder to grip.  This is why I never drain my sprinkler like I'm supposed to; I hate connecting it.>The connector always leaks, even after I put in a gasket, and the hose sometimes loosens while it's traveling.>Getting the water to throw just the right distance is a pain.  You have to turn on the water, see where it's throwing, turn it off, walk out to the sprinkler, adjust the arms, walk back to the faucet, turn it on, see if that's right, and then repeat until you have it where you want it, which might involve several tries.>The water is thrown in a circle, but only to the outside of the circle.  This is easily seen if you have the sprinkler set where it will be thrown on concrete.  You can see the arc of the circle and the dry area inside it.  The way the Raintrain gets all the ground covered is by advancing this outline through the yard.  For this reason, the stationary setting on the sprinkler is useless.  It will water the outline of the circle only.>Because of the circle outline problem, the area at the beginning and end of the course will get half as much water as the rest of the yard (the beginning of the course will only be hit by the trailing edge of the circle, and the end of the course will only be hit by the front edge).  To compensate for this, I turn off the water, pick up the Raintrain, and move it back at both the beginning and end so that the areas get covered by the half circle twice.  This creates a lot of extra work for what I was hoping would be a labor-saver.>I found that the Raintrain doesn't deliver nearly as much water as it says it will.  The farther you throw the water, the less depth of water you'll put out (because the same amount of water is being spread out over a bigger area), but when I had the arms adjusted for a pretty narrow path, I only measured about a quarter inch of water (even on \"low gear,\" which makes it travel more slowly).  This likely explains why I've struggled so much with keeping my lawn green since I got the Raintrain.  With stationary sprinklers, you can leave them running as long as necessary to achieve the water delivery you need.  But with the Raintrain, if you need more water than it delivers, your only option is to lay out the hose again and start it over, which is a lot of extra work.>While the sprinkler se
B00002N6AN This looks like it will be a great piece of equipment.  I've used it a couple of times so far and have been impressed.  The only problem is if it hits a soft area of the yard, the wheels can sink in and it gets stuck.  You certainly can't just set it and forget it.  It needs to be babysat every half hour or so to ensure it is still moving.
B00002N6AN This sprinkler seemed to be a perfect fit for what I needed but unfortunately I had to return it.I have about 4500 square feet of grass including backyard and my yard is someone weird shaped, so I figured this sprinkler would work well for me.My first complain is its very slow so I am unable to track how much water this is really consuming. I am a college student and stay at home dad, I don't have the money for a high water bill.Second complain is that's it a heavy piece of metal and I don't understand why it needs to be so heavy. I don't mind lifting weights but I don't wanna lift while I'm working in my grass, this is an expensive sprinkler and I'm not leaving it outside at night so carrying this inside every night is somewhat of a hassle.Pros- I like the coverage it gets, it covers a lot of space and it left me having to only use it a few feet of hose.Setup was pretty simple, I can recall a few times adjusting the sprayers and running off getting my pants soaked lolOverall I give it a B- I think you should just stick with your regular sprinkler, save yourself the hassle and skip this purchase
B00002N6AN I remember my dad using a sprinkler like this when I was a kid (I'm 61).  We are in the middle of a drought here in Texas and I was tired of having to move the sprinkler and thought this would solve my problem.  First of all, this is a VERY heavy sprinkler and is awkward to pick up and move.  If you have any trouble lifting heavy objects, get something else.  It has to be moved.  You can't drag it and you can't turn it around and make it go the other direction.  I have found I have to check on it as often, if not more often, than I was moving my oscillating sprinkler.  First, it jumped off the hose/track and was climbing the fence.  Then, it kinked the hose and cut off the water.  Finally, it dug itself a hole and had mud all over the back wheels.  Tried it another time and it just stopped spraying water.  No kink this time, checked the button on the bottom, couldn't get it going again.  I went back to my oscillating sprinkler.  At least it's easy to move around.  I think you need to use this on a very flat, very straight lawn.  Mine is bumpy and I need it to make a couple of gentle curves.  It didn't work for me.  I like the spray it puts out and would use it as a stationery sprinkler if it weren't so heavy to move.
B00002N6AN After hearing so much about this unit, and seeing a couple of them in my neighborhood, I decided to give it a try, even though the price was higher than I ever expected to pay for a lawn sprinkler.I now know why so many  people like it.  It is very effective in watering the lawn, without  spraying water high up in the air (less chance for evaporation, and not  affected by wind as much), and it has hands-off operation once you set it  up.Adjusting the spray diameter is easy, and using the hose as a way to  set the travel path for the sprinkler to follow is a great idea.  The  adjustable speed allows you to decide how much water to apply and how much  ground you want to cover in a period of time.Inspecting the yard  afterwards shows that the ground is nicely saturated, and not needing to go  out and move hoses is a welcomed change. This sprinkler is worth the  purchase price!
B00002N6AN Update/Tip: The way our yard is this shoots too large of a swath so I went to Lowes and got a 3 foot piece of 1/2 inch aluminum pipe and made some new arms. I can now get as small as about 2 1/2 feet to around 40 feet. What's cool is that they can be adjusted or I can use combination of any of the arms. For instance, I will use one of the original with one of my new ones. The new one will get the center which the originals don't do that well. I drilled 1/16 inch holes which are plenty large enough. See my photos for a better idea.----------------------------------------------------------Unfortunately it's a little early for us to be watering here in the NW. In fact, we don't always need to water except we set a record last year for something like 80 days straight with no rain. But even in July and August the rain is limited so to keep things green and the garden growing we need to water. Sprinkler systems being too expensive for how often we use them sprinklers like this can be a time saver if they work.I tried it out and it did work. I found I could get down to about a 5 foot width by turning the heads down. But you are limited how far to turn them down or they will hit the tractor.The sprinkler heads need to point a certain direction or it will go backwards...I thought high speed was perfect for my needs. Fast enough I watched it travel 5 feet for my test and it shut off as expected.It does look cool and is fun to watch!Over having to move a sprinkler this really is awesome and compared to a sprinkler system the cost is great. I didn't open it up but if it does indeed have plastic gears how long will it last? As often as I will need it here it may last me a long time. Hopefully a decent investment.
B00002N6AN I own a yard where either the person who planted the trees or the one who ran the irrigation pipes needed a few more lessons about what happens ten years later when that 6' tree becomes a 25 footer and the roots are wrapped around the pipe that was laid 12\" away from it.Because of a variety of issues from shallow topsoil with an uneven granite underlay to existing water/sewer/power lines to heavy tree and root growth, new pipes just aren't in the cards.  Every year I turn on the sprinkler system and start fixing busted pipes and sprinkler heads that have been pushed off by a root.  I've been very lucky so far, I've been able to repair all but one of them.  Once I found myself up to my armpit in a hole not much bigger than my arm, through dense roots where I managed to glue a new pipe piece in.Clearly this sort of stuff takes a lot of time to fix sometimes, and in the meanwhile hand watering my half acre in 100 degree, 0% humidity summers is just a no-go.Enter the Rain Train, because its time to make it rain! :)You lay out a hose path for this, no sharp turns, and only on grass not on pavement or any other type of surface as this may destroy the gears in the unit.  Place the little yellow plastic ramp over the hose where you want it to stop, and insert the metal rod in the ground to hold it.  Turn on the water and set to high or low (high goes faster, disperses less water per square inch) and go do something else for a while.  You can adjust the two spray wands to an angle that gives you the desired coverage, then use the faucet to fine tune it.I have a very hilly yard and after hefting this I was concerned it wouldn't make it uphill, but it appears to move at the same speed regardless of the terrain.  On high you have to stare hard at the wheel spokes for a bit before you can detect movement.  How this works is water comes from the hose into the rear of the unit, then through the two wands which spin, turning a gear that turns the wheels.  Simple and ingenious.I've only had it jump off the hose once, and thats when I made a real hairpin turn to see if it could make it.  Do note that if it jumps the hose it'll go off in some semi-random arc until it runs out of hose.  So while its tempting to set it and go to bed or leave for the day, you might want to check on it once in a while.This is also very handy for those really dry areas where I want to apply a lot of water to a decent sized spot but I dont want to have to remember to keep moving a sprinkler and to turn it off.  This is a nice time and water saver.For those times when I lose a pipe, its also nice to know I have a week or so to fix it and can get the coverage I need from the Rain Train.  This wont ever replace a full sprinkler system, but it'd be fine for watering a really large area that hasn't been fitted with an irrigation system yet, or as I use it for large spot overwatering and temporary irrigation replacement.
B00002N8K3 It's hard writing a review for this Flexogen garden hose because it has a couple big problems, but something else about it makes up for that one problem. Read on:One thing you have to know- pretty much ANY garden hose you buy will tangle if you don't wrap it the right way. However, some hoses it won't matter if you don't do a good job wrapping it. Unfortunately, others (like this one) are sort of cheap and get knotted easily, so you DO have to take the time to wrap it correctly or else the hose will be damaged over time. I guess if you're not the type of person that wraps the hose when you're done with it (and just leave it sit in the yard) none of this will matter. But in my house we have to wrap the hoses.This means, if you drag the hose across the yard, you might have to go back and straighten out the knots because knots WILL most likely happen. And they will happen in three or four different spots on the hose. To me that's a sign of a bad hose. If one knot occurs that's ok. More than one knot and the hose is bad.However, the one thing that makes up for the knot problem is that I've NEVER had a problem with this hose squirting water where it shouldn't. You see, it's hard for me to say whether this Flexogen hose is bad or good. It has problems, but if you can deal with the knot problem you will have a good hose that will last a long time.I'd say using it just to wash your car isn't a bad idea, but dragging the hose across the yard to rinse off things (and water the garden) IS a bad idea because the knots will continue to occur, so you'll have to keep walking all the way back to where the hose begins to straighten it out.  If you think that's not a problem go ahead and get one.
B00002N8K3 I always like this hose, it's reliable, less prone to kink and stand up a lot better than any other garden hoses I ever bought!
B00002N8K3 The Gilmour Flexogen is definitely the best hose I've ever had, and they are made in the USA.  Thanks Gilmour!  Mine stay outdoors year round (we have mild winters with only a few freezes per year, but very long, hot summers). They are very durable and don't kink.  I have never had a reason to take advantage of the lifetime warranty, but other reviewers indicate that Glimour makes good on their promise even decades later.  I've noticed a few negative reviews here where the reviewer is mistakenly commenting on a completely different hose.
B00002N8K3 Short review:  This hose is amazing, Made in the USA, tough as nails yet flexible, will not kink EVER, and I love it.  Buy it now.Longer review:I bought a home depot memorial day special hose for $19.95 (same size as this one) and thought \"how different can hoses be?  this one says kink free.\"  Three months of hose torture ensued, with me trying various tactics (e.g. only moving hose when it's pressurized) to try to keep it from kinking.  That damn endless kink hose is now in a pile in a garage ready for donation.  It has more kinks in it than a Russian porn movie.  Every time I used it I became more and more frustrated and thought longingly of this twice the price hose.Take my advice, buy this hose, it is worth it.  It's also nice to see it's Made in the USA - at least something is.  Amazing warranty. Even in cooler weather it stays flexible.  Great brass fittings.  They are right, this is the last hose I'll ever buy.  Please, Gilmour, don't try to save on cost in the future - keep this hose just the way it is!Hope this helps.  Did I mention I love this hose?
B00002N8K3 I thought I had already reviewed this hose.  We love it!  It is strong and it attaches easily and smoothly to each other (we bought TWO 100' lengths) without leaking.  I expect these hoses to last us a terrifically long time.
B00002N8K3 UPDATE:  Originally, I gave this hose 5 stars but after using them (I bought 3) for a while, I've changed my opinion. Yes, the hoses appear to be well made and are lighter weight than my old professional grade rubber hoses, but Flexogens are still heavy. These Flexogen hoses DO kink, and they kink easily. The only way to reduce the kinking is to completely unroll the entire 100 feet of hose from the reel, lay it flat on the grund, and then turn and turn and turn (twist/rotate) it until it lays completely flat -- make sure there are no \"waves\" or loops. I pulled about 50 feet off the hose reel and, holding the end, walked across my yard. I did not stop to twist out the waves and loops that it formed while unrolling. The hose formed 9 kinks! What a pain in the hand, elbow and shoulder to straighten it! This process wastes time.The second problem is after I screw on my hose wand and turn on the water, this hose becomes unwieldy. The hose turns so that my wand is upside down. It requires a LOT of effort to twist the hose and hold it so the wand sprays downward--requires using both hands. Fighting this hose is painful, very tiring and aggravating.When you rewind it onto a hose reel, the hose twists and turns, causing it to again form waves and loops, which become kinks. Again, you have to twist, rotate, etc. to get all the waves/loops out so the hose lays flat and straight on the ground. As you reel it in, you have to stop and repeat the process. My old commercial-grade hose never did anything like this. You can buy the professional/commercial grade hoses (100 ft) at big box stores and clubs for about $25. Don't buy the Flexogen.Due to age and arthritis in my hands, I needed to replace my heavy, rubber commercial-grade garden hoses with lighter weight, easier-to-maneuver hoses. I was barely able to wind the old rubber hoses on the hose reel or drag them around the yard. After reading reviews on Amazon and other places for garden hoses, I chose this hose. I'm glad I did. While it's still heavy, it weighs considerably less than my commercial-grade rubber hose. It's easier to wind on the reel and easier to drag around the yard.The Amazon description calls this a \"lightweight\" hose. It is NOT  light. It's substantial. I found a local store that  had this hose in 25-, 50- and 75-ft lengths. I was able to lift each and compare to heavy duty hoses of the same length. I couldn't feel much of a difference, so I definitely would call this a medium- to heavy-weight hose (but lighter than my rubber one).This hose is easier to handle than my old rubber ones because it's more flexible. (I suspect that my old hoses have stiffened over the years.)I've only used one (I bought 3 of these) for about 1.5 weeks. It's been too hot, too muggy and too rainy to use it much, but I'm pleased so far. I believe this hose is a very good quality and should last many years. The solid brass fittings are thick so they won't get dents that cause leaks. Because I haven't dragged it around the yard yet, I cannot say whether it really is a \"no-kink\" hose. I recommend this hose because o the quality.
B00002N8K3 This hose is 100 feet and it makes it halfway around my house.  A high quality hose for the price.
B00002N8K3 I purchased 6 of these hoses with what was supposed to be a lifetime guarantee. After a short time, the end on one of the hoses started leaking so I contacted the manufacturer and got a replacement. A year later another hose started leaking and I got another replacement. Then another hose started leaking but the company would no longer honor the warranty! Now Gilmour is selling them. But it's the same hose - \"Flexogen\". The hose itself it actually quite good if you don't mind replacing the hose ends eventually, I've had to replace every end on every Flexogen hose that I have.Keep in mind that I bought hoses from Flexogen but that company no longer exists and Gilmour would not honor the warranty on those hoses even though Gilmour is now selling them. Also note that Flexogen is a patented hose. Lifetime warranty isn't much good when the company gets bought or taken over by another company and the new company (Gilmour) won't honor the warranty. And who wants to have to keep sending in hose parts to get a replacement every year or two.Let me reiterate, Gilmour would not honor the warranty on my Flexogen hoses. I wrote to them multiple times and was told (without explanation) that Gilmour would not replace the defective hoses. If you buy these hoses expecting a lifetime warranty, you may not get it.On the Gilmour website, there is no longer any information relating to Flexogen hose warranty or on how to have a Flexogen hose replaced.  On Amazon, it does say \"This heavy-duty garden hose is made in the USA and backed by a lifetime guarantee\". It also says Lifetime Guarantee on the front of the hose package. Gilmour is now owned by the Robert Bosch Corp., so probably even less chance of getting a warranty replacement.
B00002N8K3 Even my landscaper said the Gilmour Flexogen 10058100 8-Ply Hose 5/8-inch by 100-foot is the BEST! YOU JUST CAN'T KINK IT!
B00002N8K3 BEEN USING NOW FOR 3 YEARS.  SLOWLY REPLACING ALL HOSES WITH THESE. KEEP THEM WRAPPED IN A WIND UP STORAGE CONTAINER AND IT LOOKS LIKE I SHOULD HAVE MANY YEARS OF QUALITY HOSES.
B00002N8NR I really like this sprinkler. It works great, the pattern of water covers the distance that they said it would. Others I have purchased did not do so well and some did not last very long. I think Rain bird is a good company that I can rely on for good quality. Kind of rare now days.
B00002N8NR For years I have purchased impulse sprinklers that work for a while, then plastic parts broke.Now that I have the Rain Bird I am certain that this well made sprinkler will outlast all the others.It is easy to adjust and gives good coverage.
B00002N8NR I read all the positive reviews and was excited about it. Now im excited to replace it with a plastic rain bird sprinklerPros: Solid build, strong material construction, quick performer, very easy to adjust the spray pattern.Cons: It does not have a gasket on the bottom thread so youll need to add some plumber's tape to get a solid seal. It has some overspray that goes beyond the spray pattern which is disappointing if you wanna keep from wasting water. Expensive! At this price, I could have purchased two plastic Rain Bird sprinklers.Other: I recently tested three different impact sprinklers (on video) and so far the best seems to be the plastic rain bird, youll see my video review from youtube this one and the plastic one if you view the plastic one.
B00002N8NR I've had 2 of these now for 3 years and they work really well.  The range is not quite 41 feet, but that's probably due to my water pressure. i'd say its closer to 30 at most.  another impact sprinkler i have goes a few feet further, but it's not the biggest deal.  The positives about this are that it's very solid- i've never had a problem with it not operating properly, and it seems to spray the area very effectively. Considering that they're going on 3 years now, i'd buy them all over again with no hesitation.
B00002N8NR We have unfiltered irrigation water - and the sprinkler heads get clogged with weeds, etc.  This one seems to be more tolerant of that - and it really has a reach for distance.  Good weight also helps keep the sprinkler in place
B00002N8NR These sprinkler heads are well made, very functional and easy to use; changing the settings is quite simple; highly recommended
B00002N8NR IMO, the gold standard in impact sprinklers.  Buy one (OK maybe four) and be done with it.Rain Bird has built this right for decades and it's a wonder why so many other companies cheapen this simple design.
B00004DTNH I used to use a really primitive manual edger that I inherited from my father. Blistered hands and time wasted, I decided there had to be a better way and this is surely it.Edging is one of those necessary evils if you want a great looking house. I don't edge every time I mow. Usually I do it every other time. The first time out after a long winter, edging usually takes a little longer. After that, edging is a snap because you are basically in maintanence mode.I also use this around my landscaping and flower beds with equally great results.The blade on the Edge Hog is easily replaceable and the tell tale sign to replace it is when the edge starts to look a little rough and the machine seems slower.
B00004DTNH At the risk of sounding like an idiot...I am 45-years-old. I have been a homeowner for nearly 20 years. And I have NEVER had a power edger. I have edged my lawn for almost 20 years with an old-fashioned, manual edger. Finally, after too many blisters, a sore back, and just plain old laziness, I decided to treat myself to the Edge Hog. And boy...Am I glad I did! Right out of the box, I could tell this was a quality product. Assembly couldn't have been any easier. Just attach the top handle to the bottom handle. No tools required! And everything else is pre-assembled. I had used a power edger in the past. Like maybe 30 years ago when I borrowed one from a friend so I could get the lawn done quicker and go play ball or something. But for all practical purposes, this was my first time. And it was easy as pie. I had no problem getting the hang of using the Edge Hog. The edging was done fast and easy. What a difference, too! No more raggedy edge like I got from my manual edger. Instead I now get a nice clean \"professional\" edge. Finally! And my back is so much happier!! The price on this product is competitive with other retailers. I had a $25.00 gift certificate and am an Amazon Prime member. So for about $65.00 total, I am now the proud owner of this quality Black & Decker edger. I highly recommend this product. If I could give it 6 stars, I would!
B00004DTNH I had a previous Edge-Hog for a little more than 8 years when the motor brushes finally wore out.  I could have bought the replacement parts and changed them out for $30, but then I decided to just get a new one.  There are a couple of changes between the older and the newer model.  The new unit is lighter and seems to have more power, though that may be because of the new brushes working better.  The one BIG change is the guard over the blade.  It is too soon to tell if this is an improvement or just a way to save money on their part.  It certainly is less safe.The older model had a &#34;swing open&#34; cover which protected the blade almost completey above the ground level.  Good part about that was not being able to get fingers or toess into the cutting area.  Bad part was having to stop for built up grass, or when the ground was wet, built up mud.  You'd have to stop and open the door to clean out the area.The newer model doesnot have a cover and most of the blade area is open.  There is something akin to a bicycle fender covering the blade for protection.  The first day I used it, the ground was wet and dirt built up in the shield, but not enough to really bog down the blade.  I unplugged the unit for safety sake, but unlike the older model, you needed a big screwdriver to pull out all the mud.  If you use it on dry ground, the newer model will have less build up of grass than the older one.I am hoping to get at least eight years out of this unit, like I did with my last one.
B00004DTNH The Black & Decker LE750 Edge Hog 2-1/4 HP Electric Landscape Edger is so easy to use and does a great job of edging my lawn. I purchased this edger because I became so tired of trying to edge my lawn with a string trimmer. The string trimmer did a choppy job, but the B&D edger makes a nice and neat edge on my lawn. Before this purchase I dreaded the job. The fact that this edger can also make trenches is a big plus. I am a female senior citizen and care for my lawn myself. Anything that makes that job easier (like this edger) deserves five stars. I highly recommend this product to anyone who needs an edger that is easy to use and does a good job.
B00004DTNH It wouldn't be too difficult to design a wider cutting blade that would create a wider 'trench' (although the motor might need some beefing up to handle the additional load) and it would be great if it was easier to get more depth too (it's possible but requires a little backyard re-engineering).  It's worth what it costs, though...I'm basically satisfied.
B00004DTNH dang this thing does some work, i just grab the handle and off i go, my lawn edges never looked so good.
B00004DTNH This is the latest version of an edger B&amp;D has been making for at least 20 years, and there are plenty of the 20 year old models still in use. It's nearly silent, much easier to use than a gas model, and seems to  cut better with less stalling than my neighbor's 3.5HP gas model.
B00004DTNH This edger does the job and more.  I give it my highest recommendation.I hadn't edged my lawn since last Fall when my gas-powered edger bit the dust.  We have St. Augustine grass here in Florida.  It propagates by spreading tough, vine-like runners.  I had these in spades creeping over my driveway and over onto the concrete rain channel gutter in front of our house.  This edger cut right through them, which I didn't expect, given the toughness of the grass.  But it never hesitated, except on some very stuborn growth.  I just backed up and hit it again and away the edger went, without even breathing hard.  Even the gas-powered edger wasn't this good.The secondary handle and the adjustable edge guide are quite helpful.  I never felt like this edger had taken control and gone where I didn't want it to go.  Its light weight, easy rolling wheels and great cutting power more than compensate for the 100-ft extension cord it's tethered to.  I think it took me as long to rewind the cord as it took to edge the grass (total edging is about 200-225 linear feet).  Also it has two large wheels in the back and one at the front, so it stays level and makes it easy to push in a straight line.  With the edge guide that rides against the driveway or walkway there was very little of the sparking caused by the blade hitting the concrete.This is about as easy as it gets.  No more gas and oil mix, no more new spark plugs, no more 15-20 pulls to get the engine to start, and it's relatively quiet when running.  Just press the trigger and go.  Love it, love it, love it.
B00004DTNH I love this edger!  I have been using it for almost 2 years, and it is still going strong.  It has plenty of power, yet is easy to maneuver.I get a beautiful, straight edge along my sidewalk from using this tool.  It is so easy to guide in a straight line.  I also use it to keep a trench space between my grass and my landscaped areas, which has worked much better than a trimmer.We had a gas powered edger before this one, but it was too heavy for me.  I actually enjoy yard work, but rarely did it because the tools we had were difficult for me to manage.  Now that I have this electric edger, which is significantly lighter without the gas tank, as well as a manual mower, I do most of the yard work, and love it!
B00004DTNH I've purchased a lot of B&D product and edger is one of the best! The trench feature is a great addition and it works great.  I can edge my small yard in minutes and I don't have to worry about mixing fuel or having to winterize my equipment.
B00004DTNH If you need an edger, and don't want the trouble of maintaining a gas-powered edger, this is the electric edger for you. It's more powerful than most, and sturdy as all heck. But it's also pretty light, too. Very easy to move around the yard.This tool is as indespensible as my lawn mower. If you're edging your lawn with a string trimmer, or not edging your lawn at all, you'll love the results you can get so easily with this edger.
B00004R9TK So what did you want to know? I started my trimming carrier with the Black & Decker Automatic Feed Spool (AFS). It is just plug and go. I prefer my trimmer string to come from Black & Decker. This way I will not come unraveled trying to use some cheap substitute. The spools last longer than expected. But all good things come to an end and you don't want to be half way through the yard when you find your self strung out.
B00004R9TK This &#34;Black & Decker AF-100 String Trimmer Replacement Spool&#34; is exactly what I needed for my Black & Decker cordless weed trimmer. This is east to install and it works as well as the original spool that came preinstalled on my trimmer.Works as expected!Highly Recommended!CFH
B00004R9TK If you have a Black and Decker string trimmer that uses auto-feed string, this is the spool to buy. The string works well. The spool snaps in easily and you don't have to mess with rolling a spool with bulk string.
B00004R9TK This is the direct replacement part for the B&D; Grass Hog model NST2018.  I love that trimmer as it is easy to use and I don't have to fight with a gas powered trimmer and all the problems involved with using one.  This replacement spool directly fits onto the trimmer and is easy to change.  The trimmer is designed to automatically feed the trimmer line and I didn't want to mess with rewinding line onto the old spool.For me the 30 foot spool will last a whole cutting season or more and it is just easier to deal with than buying trimmer line and winding it yourself.  This is a good buy and works well.  I recommend it to you!
B00004R9TK This is a direct replacement and works great. My only gripe is that this particular weed eater uses way to much line.
B00004R9TK I bought this for my black and decker trimmer and where else would i buy these? its not worth driving to the store and look in different eisle to find something simple as these. Also amazon always seem to have the better price.
B00004R9TL GOOD
B00004R9TL At the time I purchased these replacement spools the official Amazon description listed only GrassHog NST2018 as compatible model. I can confirm that it works with the new GrassHog NST2118Black & Decker NST2118 12-Inch 18-Volt Ni-Cd Cordless Electric GrassHog String Trimmer/Edger.The automatic feed spool on GrassHog advances the string without needing to bump on the ground. The benefit of this system is that cutting is easier as it constantly replaces worn out string, the down side that the usage of the string is faster than when done manually.I have tried wounding the string by hand and found it a bit cumbersome and a bit time consuming, so I figured less than $5 per spool is not to bad to save me 5 minutes of time wounding and dealing with jammed string. Each spool contains 30 feet of 0.065 inch diameter round line. It is factory spooled and is wound tighter than when I wound the spool by hand.To replace the spool:1. Remove battery2. Squeeze the tabs on the spool cap to release it3. Pull the empty spool out by pulling directly away from the housing4. Clean out the housing from debris5. Make sure that the level that controls the spooling  is aligned with the edge of the housing6. Take a string from the new spool and feed it through the eyelet in the housing7. Push the spool into the housing and rotate it until it feels seated and the tabs of the spool align with the holes in the housing8. Put the cap back on9. The string outside the housing should be 5 3/8 inches, if it is longer than this length use scissors to trim itCollage of two different views of the spools in this package attached under customer photos.Overall, I am pleased with the spools - they should take me through the next couple of summers!Ali Julia review
B00004R9TL -Quick and fairly easy to install- Seems to be of good quality- Only option I know of for replacements for the B and D trimmer- Too expensive as someone already noted. The retail price is even more out there so I'm glad Amazon cuts the price in half, but still expensive per roll.
B00004R9TL So what did you want to know? I started my trimming carrier with the Black & Decker Automatic Feed Spool (AFS). It is just plug and go.

B00004R9TL Works as expected, no surprises of any kind. I'm now on my 4th three pack and will get a 5th when the time comes.
B00004R9TL Bought for the following trimmer...This little trimmer really eats up the weeds and tall grass. Much better than any other cordless trimmer that I've tried. Battery life is above average and charging is fast. I do have the B&D; Blower that uses the same battery so I have a back up should I need it. I'll edit this review and add to it after I've had the opportunity to use it longer but so far, I am very pleased with the product.
B00004R9TL so good, Bought these as extra to have them on hand and the one my weed eater came with is still working. Will order more as needed, I am all for no muss, no fuss......
B00004R9TL I easily get two years out of a spool of this string while cutting both grass and weeds on my 18v trimmer.  It cuts clean and level and does not shred even on the harder stuff.  On rare occasions you may just break a little of the end off but that just tears away cleanly on your next trim, so no cutting of the line is necessary.  Yes, it is cheaper to just buy the line and wind it yourself, but for roughly $4 and some change it is hardly worth your time and effort.
B00004R9TL I looked around at several websites, and multiple options on Amazon and this was the best deal I found.Fit into my Black and Decker Trimmer perfectly. Just snap in and go.
B00004R9TL For years, I lived with a Black & Decker trimmer that required hand-winding of the line spool.  What a fiasco!  Once the factory-wound spool ran out, the line never again fed properly.  No matter how much care one took with the hand-winding, the line always broke off prematurely -- from having gotten jammed up.  I spent at least as much time rewinding the spool as I did trimming grass.  Then I found the model Black & Decker trimmer that takes disposable spools -- like these.  They're a godsend.  Perhaps it's more economical to wind your own spool, but if your time (and blood pressure) mean anything to you, disposable spools are the way to go.  (And the manufacturer says you CAN hand-wind these spools if you like -- so you won't be stuck if you don't happen to have a fresh disposable spool on hand.)
B00004R9TL Simply - these reels are inexpensive and easy to replace and install. They seem to last pretty long also. Highly recomend
B00004R9TL It took many years for my Black and Decker Gross Hog trimmer to use up all of its string.  Changing the empty string spool was a snap, and the new one works perfectly, just as I would expect.  No complaints.
B00004R9TL My string trimmer is a great light duty tool and works very good. I bought the extra spools of string for two good reasons it is much cheaper through Amazon than our local retailers and with fuel for the auto's being at $3.35/ gal. this saves 3 trips to get the string and luck being what it is chances are when you give out of string the retailer will be out also. Good Buy from a good outfit to do business with(Amazon.com).Thanks again,Denny
B00004R9TL These are the refill for my weed whacker.  They work fine and are easy to install.  It is always good to have a few extra to replace the spent roll.
B00004R9TL I've started winding my own spools now.  These are very convenient, but you really pay a hefty price for that convenience. I'm buying bulk string now and use my drill motor to wind it onto the empty spools.
B00004R9TL ...I wish B&D would make a refill that held more than 30 feet.  Otherwise, it's a good product.  I would give 4.5 stars if I could.
B00004R9TL super easy to swap out and last a long time, unless you are chopping concrete!  I use these all the time, as I feel they are worth the extra cost for the convenience.
B00004R9TL got these for my b&d 20 volt trimmer- fit perfect, and no problems. a little expensive, now rewind myself, but will purchase more in the future for my lazy days!
B00004R9TL I use this on my 18v trimmer.  It seems to last forever.  Changing spools is a little tricky, but once you do it the first time, it really isn't an issue.  Three spools will probably outlast the life of the trimmer - which I think is pretty well made.
B00004R9TL I know it's a lot cheaper to re-string your own spools but these are really convenient, and without the hassle of doing it on your own.
B00004R9TL It installs easily, and it works.  What more is there to say about a product like this.  When you have a weed-whacker, eventually, you will have to refill the spool.
B00004R9TL This is the easiest replacement string to install on a weed wacker. No mess ,just place it in lock it and then go tackle your yard!
B00004R9TL Easy to replace. Summer worth of string in these three spools. Carefully handle so that the string doesn't be OEM uncoiled prior to install.
B00004R9TL What can you say about replacement string. But, in 3 packs, more economical. It is fairly easy to replace. Good product
B00004R9TL I put these in a cordless 18 volt Black and Decker trimmer and they have worked flawlessly.  Just have to put them in the same way the old one came out with no tools just snapping them in place and letting about 4&#34; of string out and they feed the same way.
B00004R9TL Works great and is easy to replace spool of line string for my Black & Decker 20-volt battery/cordless weed trimmer!  Good value when purchased in package.
B00004R9TL I made the mistake of taking the spool that came with my B & D LST136 cordless trimmer and experienced what it would be like if I tried to save money by buying cord in bulk and winding my own spools.  I painstakingly wound the cord from left to right and from right to left as instructed in the manual.  I dropped it a few times and had to begin again.  I did it right because the cord does advance automatically in my trimmer, but I have to say I am glad I purchased spools that are already wound.  When I have to replace the spool that came with the trimmer, I will be careful to hold the cord tightly against the spool!
B00004R9VV BZZZZZTTTT.... ZAP ZAP.  Dead bugs all over the place.  I didnt use any of the mosquito attractant packs or anything but this thing does get rid of all the bugs around that are flying around if you have any lights on outside.  Its fun to catch beatles and throw them into the zapper  :D
B00004R9VV I bought this hoping to kill mosquitoes. I plugged it in and watched the beautiful zapping. After a few nights of this, I did some research and found that 99 percent of those zaps were useful bugs. I decided to return it after killing hundreds of useful bugs in my yard and maybe...maybe a mosquito or two.
B00004R9VV It was a little smaller than I expected, but that was actually a plus in my book. It feels durable and I like the fact that there is not a bug tray for collecting dead bugs. If you were using this on your deck or something, may that would be a different story, but you are really not supposed to use it where you will be sitting anyway. I sprinkled a pile of dietamaceous earth underneath this on the ground so that any crawling bugs like ants that come to feast on the new fried bug bits will meet their demise as well.
B00004R9VV This one has one bulb (versus 2 in the larger units).. I've found that these last a couple of years with regular (daily) use.. My last one lasted about two years - and when it went out, the problem wasn't the bulb - it was the transformer in the top of the unit.  It runs silent (no audible humming from more than a few feet away).
B00004R9VV There's not too much I can say about something as simple as a bug zapper other than -- it works well, it's silent (except when zapping bugs), it DOES attract and eradicate mosquitoes and other flying insects, and it's only 15 watts.Happy with my purchase.
B00004R9VV I recently received this product and just put it out yesterday.  It seems to be working wonderfully and there was a pile of dead insects this morning to show for it!!  I will post again if I have any compaints...but don't really anticipate any.  12/30/08  I now have a complaint!  The light in this unit was faulty.  It still comes on but the light is yellow and not white like it's suppose to be and it doesn't attrack the insects now. The light went out about 2 months ago so it wasn't but maybe 4 months old. 7/27/09 I ordered a replacement bulb on March 22, 2009 to get ready for the mosquito season...today is 7/27/09 and that bulb burned out 2 days ago! 4 month life span...AMAZING!  Needless to say...I WON'T be replacing it again at a cost of $21.99.....and will be looking for another bulb that will work in this unit.
B00004R9VV All products of this type are not effective for mosquito control, so if that's your intent, you must look for an alternative type of apparatus.  Bug zappers like this use UV light; it's been proven time and again that mosquitos have 0% attraction to UV light!  Oh, sure, the octenol attracts SOME types (not all) mosquitos, but the way this device is designed, the octenol cartridge hangs on the BOTTOM of the unit, away from the electric grid.  Mosquitos that are attracted have absolutely no reason to go inside the grid, because once again, they are NOT attracted to UV!All this device will do is kill a bunch of UV-attracted bugs, such as moths and mostly harmless aquatic-type insects that would NEVER have come near your home anyway if you didn't have a bright UV bulb shining in their faces.  Oh sure, by statistical chance, you'll kill a few mosquitos just by chance one flies in there by random but we're talking about less than 5% of the mosquito population will do that.  5% erradication is not going to solve any of your mosquito problems.  Folks, this is all scientific proof, so please don't believe the huff and puff of marketing schemes to make you believe otherwise.  If you need to control moths or non-mosquitos, then this unit might be good for you.  Otherwise, look for something else.
B00004R9VV Only draw back I could come up with is my girlfriend is convinced the light is attracting more bugs from the neighborhood. lol.  We have a pool and a pond, along with wetlands on our property, so we simply have a lot of bugs.  This thing is working constantly while it is on.  The zapping can get quite loud, but it is doing its job.  We have it set up about 20 feet from out deck, and 15 from the pool.  You don't want it closer, as it will bring bugs around.  They are attracted to it...which is exactly what you want! Just not right next to you.  Cord it short, so you will need a heavy duty extension cord.  I hung mine on  a trellis, but if you don't have something to hang it from, you may need a sturdy stand...this things is pretty massive, and has some weight to it.
B00004R9VV After a major fly infestation in Southern California this summer, I wanted something a little less offensive (smell-wise) than theRESCUE! FTD-DT12 Disposable Fly Trap(s) I'd been using to great effect. I did my research on Amazon and Flowtron was the hands-down winner. Although our entire lot is only 2000sf, I decided to spend the extra few dollars on the 1-acre model.It seems to work well, because I hear the thing buzzing all night long, and the housing definitely leaves a lot of space for insects to get in--one morning I found a praying mantis stuck in it. My major insect concern, though, was flies, and because they're only active during the day, the Flowtron is moot. And I was really looking forward to seeing some of those biting flies get their just deserts. If the mosquitos are getting theirs, maybe the ants are hauling the corpses away before I can do a body count.So what insect population am I decimating? Moths, evidently. The problem is, I don't mind the moths! One day I'll have a bigger backyard and then I'll give it a real workout (and an updated review). Still, I have no regrets about buying this unit.
B00004R9VV Let me start by saying DO NOT BUY STINGER!!!  I bought 2 from Wally World and both are dead within a week.  I mean the light is barely visible already and it is no longer attracting insects.  I bought them because they were less expensive basically to save a buck.  I ended up throwing them away and buying 2 of these to replace them.I already have been using a Flowtron 1 Acre in one corner of my house for the past 4 years and it is on all the time.  It has been incredibly reliable and effective.  These are the only Electronic Insect Killers I recommend.
B00004R9VV The unit is certainly getting a workout after the wet summer.  I have not had any issues with the unit becoming clogged.  I used a timer to save the unit from operating during the day to limit electricity use and save the bulb life.  An unintended consequence of this unit was that I was able to light up a fairly dark area in our yard that gives an added sense of security.  I would recommend.
B00004R9VV ....to really tell if it works as we are short of mosquitos this year and I have not attached the bait that comes with it to attract what there are.  I have had several of these in the past and they proved effective and this should be the same.  Bulb cost is minimal thought limits advertised effectiveness to a half acre.  I'm not sure how they figured that out but our deck is 20 feet from a small pond that hatches these guys and this little machine should be OK to zap 'em.
B00004R9VV Great price and it attracts bugs. It is on the side of our house and it seems to be helping.
B00004R9VV I am with a very small number of reviewers here that I have to wonder how this silly thing got that many positive reviews. I have a small backyard, but was constantly attacked by mosquitoes everytime I went out. I have no standing water or what so ever. My neighbors might, but this thing is supposed to cover an whole acre.I followed the instruction, hung it a good distance from the porch and let it go. Oh, I also add the flowtron tape that came with the device to the bottom. A few zaps here and there, but nothing spectacular. I left it on out there for a week, and saw no difference. Still got attacked by mosquitoes. Two weeks, same thing. After a month, I gave up and took it down. There is no point to waste electricity. Oh, it served one purpose: light up that corner of the yard some.So, don't waste your hard-earned money on this thing and electricity. I am almost sure you will be disappointed. This thing will go on my next trip to Goodwill.
B00004R9VV Can't say enough good about this unit. I did a LOT of research before buying one and have to say i'm very happy with this choice. It make a big difference on our back porch so long as you follow the directions. You want it mounted AWAY from where you're relaxing so it attracts the insects away from you. This thing zapps them non-stop. Sometimes we just sit on the back porch and laugh at zap after zap. :)
B00004R9VV This light is pretty worthless.  It kills lots of moths and other non-biting bugs but didn't put a dent in the mosquito or fly population.  I got this as an alternative to my unreliable SkeeterVac but it does not work and is equally unreliable.  The bulbs blew after 1 season.  Replacement bulbs are $40 each plus shipping.  It takes 2.  That is $90 for 2 bulbs and I only paid $80 for the whole unit.  Thanks but no thanks.Unfortunately, the only thing I've found that actually catches mosquitoes is the propane powered devices.  They are all unreliable too.  Skip the zappers and traps and use deet.
B00004R9VV Thus far after a week has done a good job but have to use a blower every day to blow out the debris, Bulbs are good and I run it24/7 thus a good buy, Having lots of mosquitos I bought to ofthe 1/2 acre ones thus put them in different places around the home here, Big plot of land here in rural area of gulf coast, Does not get them all but sure helps a lot
B00004R9VV I purchased one of these for my backyard that is about 1/2 acre and has lot's of foliage and a koi pond.  I built a stand for it and placed it about 20' from our patio, on the oppsite side of the koi pond and it seems to work very well.  It utilze's an arc of electricity to kill the insects that are unlucky enough to go to the light.  There are verticle bars surrounding the lamp that when a insect touches two of the bars, the flowtron utilizes the insect to complete the circuit until there isn't sufficient insect left (burnt up) to continue the arc.  Generally this is a fairly quick process (ZAP) however the occasional moth or larger bug will fly in and you'll hear a nice zaaaaaaaap or sizzzzzzzle until enough is \"gone\" to break the arc.Maybe it's morbid - I enjoy hearing the zap and the occasional sizzzzzzzzle because that is one less nusuance bug to bite my family, my guests or my dog.  I can whole heartedly recommend this product!
B00004R9VV For instance, if you want the bugs off of your patio, do not install it on the patio.  Install it about 25 feet away, and you will be amazed at how well it works.
B00004R9VV SO living on a mini ranch I got this to cut down on flies and mosquitoes.  The mosquito attractant did a good job, but didn't last that long, and was expensive to replace. The pesky \"flies\" go to bed at night so they aren't attracted to it.  Otherwise it would just attract \"non pesky\" bugs in my opinion like moths and I felt really bad hearing them sizzle and zap when they didn't bother me. One night I went out and noticed there was a lot of moths and huge ones all around the bug zapper. I felt like they were trying to tell bugs and moths to stay away, so I took it down.. I know I am crazy and too kind but I kinda believe in Karma and not hurting anything unless it hurts me so I will just use it for bbq's and times where I am outside, and make sure I have the mosquito attractant.. I know I am crazy, but that is how I feel :)
B00004R9VV We have had a very wet summer here in Georgia and the bugs have been horrible. This was a great price for what you get and does the job.
B00004R9VV I just threw away one of these  that I've had for over twenty years. I later found out that what I thought was an electrical issue, was really only a bulb gone bad. Well, anyway, I bought a new one and it looks a lot better than the old one, and seems to work just as well. Not sure just how many mosquitoes it's killing, but there's a pile of insects on the deck below it every morning.
B00004R9VV received this yesterday and installed it. it replaced an old one by flowtron I have had for 10 years. this one is for 1 acre and the light appears to be very intense. it was zapping last nite.
B00004R9VV Not sure if this really gets mosquitoes.  It does kill everything else. It is like a redneck carnival outside!  It goes crazy the first few nights it is outside and then tapers off.  So it does a good job of keeping bugs down.  Unfortunately it kills good bugs and pesky bugs.I bought the mosquito sent, but they don't stay stuck to the bottom well.  There is not enough surface area for the sticky part to adhere to.It is also pretty bright.  I had to close the blinds at night as it lite up the whole room.
B00004R9VV I have my old machine from Sear Lure is not reguire it was heavy. Sorry to get rid of it. The new one was not really working right. hardly kill bug.
B00004R9VV i have not taken this out of the box yet but it looks great. note: it is recommended that this be located a certain distance from the house it protects...and it requires power.
B00004R9VV I do love this bug zapper, but I noticed there weren't as many dead bugs around it as I thought there would be, seeing as we have a heavily wooded property complete with creek (lots of bugs!).  One late night, almost midnight, I went out into the side yard with my dog so she could do her business, and saw BATS flying from the woods and zooming by the bug zapper, then back to the trees again.  The bats were picking off the bugs that were attracted by the bug zapper!  How cool is that?!?  I am such a city kid that I made myself a cup of hot cocoa and sat by the back door with the porch light on, just watching the bats go back and forth.  Since that evening, I've seen the bats almost every time I happen to go outside late at night, so I guess my bug zapper is doing well to keep our local bats fat and happy.  (I'm glad to say the bats are in no danger from this zapper due to the grid guard, btw.)I've had this 80 watt model for over 3 months now, and it works beautifully even though it's exposed to the wind, rain, and hail.  Depending on how warm the weather has been, I'll take the leaf blower to it to clean the bug zapper every week or two.  With the leaf blower, the bug zapper swings around wildly, but it doesn't damage this sturdy bug zapper!  All bugs come off easily.I also have this zapper on a light-sensitive timer, so it comes on at dusk, and off again at dawn.
B00004R9VV I love hearing the zap zap zap.  Have been using this thing in South Florida for over a year now, and left it out to brave quite a few storms, and it's still going on strong.
B00004R9VV For all the negatives, I am giving it 4 stars because it does it job so well.Pros:-It does it job well.Cons:-Power cord is not even a foot long.  You will always need an extension.-Loud, but I don't know any effective zappers without that kind of noise especially when it get bigger insects-It does not have a pan to catch the insects so expect to see a little mess at the foot of the zapper.-Not a very attractive design
B00004R9VV This thing is a bug terminator zapping any bug that comes in. At first it got pretty clogged up (lots of bugs in FL) but the lizards and frogs have done a nice job cleaning it up for me. It&#8217;s to me a necessity here if you want piece from the mosquitos.
B00004R9VV 
B00004R9VV July 18th, Just received the first bug zapper. Currently giving it one star rating r/t it being DOA. As always, Amazon stands by its products and has excellent customer service. I also bought the shepherds crook that is 48\" tall that was purchased by many others, and IMO it is too short. The instructions state to hang it 6-8' in the air. If this is  true, this crook will be insufficient for optimal bug zapping. Hopefully I'm wrong with this one!I'll update when I receive my replacement unit.UPDATE JULY 20thAmazon got me the replacement device with enough time to spare for the party tonight, which I'm exceptionally happy for. The first bug zapper is back in the box waiting to ship back, and the new one is out waiting for tonight for some bug carnage. When I opened the package (which was NOT damaged) the first thing I notice is the electrified grid is bent and misshapen. I tried to push bend it back, but it looks like it is a factory defect. The bad thing is because of this defect, the safety of the device is decreased - I can tough the electrified grid with my fingers without a problem! I'll see if later I can remove the lightbulb so it'll allow me to correct the metal bending a bit more. I luckily don't have children, however if I did they would have zero problems zapping their fingers.Flowtron is DEFINITELY not scoring big points with this device thus far! We will see how things go tonight.UPDATE AUGUST 1stThe bug zapper has been working out great. I can't tell you the thousands of annoying insects this thing has fried. On a cooler night it went crazy. It was the best serial killer I've ever seen. The Mosquitos have had a severely noticeable decline. Previously I couldn't leave the back door for more than 5 minutes without receiving multiple bites, and now can sit outside for 30 minutes with a rare bite attempt. Huge improvement! The zapping grid is still a bit bent out of shape, but its obviously working, so no complaints!One note: In the directions it states, \"The (product number)15 and (product number)80 are designed with a three pronged (grounded) plug). The (product name)40 is made with a two pronged plug and should be installed with the appropriate plug recepticle. ... NOBODY sells 2-prong extension cords anymore! And with the literally 1' cord that it comes with this is KIND of a huge thing! I guess we'll see what happens with the 2 hold cord in a 3 hole plug!
B00004R9VV Can't speak to the 1 acre coverage, but, it does the job for the back deck. Not as loud as other bug zappers we've had and that's a good thing.
B00004R9VV We just received this unit this week, and can already note an improvement in our yard. We have used dunks for some water gardens we have, and have been impressed with the Flowtron unit thus far. A lot of dead mosquitoes every morning. We hook it up to an outdoor timer and run the unit automatically from dusk to dawn.  It will take about three weeks for all the eggs to hatch and mature then we'll see a great reduction in mosquitoes.It's been a very wet in North Texas and we have a bumper crop this year. Am going to explore mixing up some hot pepper and garlic--recipes are available online as a barrier. We hope a combination on factors can help rid us of a heavy mosquito population. Have not noticed any beneficial insects on or under the grids.We compared brands and sizes and selected this one due to reviews of others on Amazon. Recommend the bigger wattage for better attraction of flying insects--with mosquitoes being our main target.
B00004R9VV We found the 80D not much more to buy than the 1/2 acre 40D, and it likely does provide a wider area of coverage.  It will use more electricity, but I intend to put it on a sensor, so it will run dusk to dawn.  As others reported, we found a pile of carnage after the first night....mostly mosquitoes.  Read the instructions about locating and baiting....ours is forty feet upwind of our hot tub, patio, and screened porch so the black light and scent bait draws bugs away from us, and intercepts those coming from upwind.  Far enough away from food and guests to avoid the health hazards reported, and the &#34;zapping&#34; is not obtrusively loud.Ours arrived with a small plastic tab laying in the bottom of the tray.  Investigating, I discovered a self-tapping screw had cross-threaded during assembly, breaking off one of four tabs used to secure the safety cage.  This would not have easily been detected by Quality Control at Flowtron.  I contacted Parts and Service.  They had me email my Amazon receipt, and immediately sent me a replacement cage.  Nice service!
B00004R9VV This does not make a huge difference in mosquito's bothering us.  It just lets us hear them die once in while. There is a perverse pleasure in that.
B00004R9Y2 We use these loppers for our habitat restoration work at the Nature Conservancy's Ives Road Fen Preserve.  They can cut a fairly large bush or sapling.  After 100 hours or so of use the linkages wear.  After more hours the fiberglass handles become flexible and fracture where the rivets go through them.  We have figured out how to rebuild/repair both of these areas.  In seven years two blades have broken.  Replacement blades can be purchased from the Corona website.  A homeowner using these would have no problems in a lifetime of use.  These are the best combination of high capability and low cost that we have found.  The anvil type blade can be easily sharpened with a hand-held angle sharpener.
B00004R9Y2 At first I didn't like this Corona pruner because it didn't seem to cut well.  Then I realized the source of the problem was me.  I was pruning deadwood inside a hedge with little clearance for the handles, so the jaws were not fully open and the cuts were being made near the tip of the blade and anvil.  User error.  Not only did the pruner cut poorly in this position, but also the blade tended to twist.  Finally I figured out this pruner comes into its own when cutting deep in the V.  That is where its power comes into play and that is where the pruner works very well. Not sure why the difference, but there it is.  So now I know to reserve this Corona pruner for when its jaws can be opened wide, and to use a smaller pruner or a small saw for tight spaces.
B00004R9Y2 the first thing that happened was that the two end caps fell off. where? i don't know. but i hope to find them. i really think this is a 1 inch capacity lopper. in my experience there is no way this can cut 2 inches of wood. what kind of wood can it cut 2 inches of? yes it is a great tool but for 1 inch branches or less. i am happy that i bought it but it is for light duty and it does a great job of light duty work. i have been outside clearing a lot of branches and brush and i cannot ever see this cutting 2 inches of anything.
B00004R9Y2 I needed some loppers to cut some branches on some trees, decided to go with these because of the price and all the positive feedback.  They work flawlessly and now I can keep my house trees trimmed to where I want them.
B00004R9Y2 On a brisk February day the mighty Spudman purposely trod to the extremes of Spud Acres to cut some kindling for his fireplace and test out his new 32\" Corona anvil lopper with a stated two inch capacity. He laid out some fallen branches of varying diameters and with arms like pistons began to cut. On smallish one inch wood he was mostly successful with few drops of sweat shed.An intimidating 1.5\" branch tested his mettle and the lopper's metal, but with his brute strength Spudman prevailed. However he met his match with the imposing two inch diameter branches, stubborn wood that even he with his new Corona couldn't master. Frustrated, he tried his tool on a thick piece of rotted wood. Success! But just barely.The dejected Spudman walked back to the house, sat down, and read the glossy attachment that had been tied to the Corona.32 inch compound action - check24 inch fiberglass handles - check8 inch non slip foam grips - checkCuts up to 1.5 inches - chabonga!He returned to Amazon and read the product page again. \"It don't say nothin' bout 1.5 inches,\" he griped.Since he had scored a warehouse deal and bought his loppers for pennies under 20 dollars, he decided to keep them. IThe Corona will keep company with his little Fiskars and the Ace telescoping-handle loppers in the garden shed. Spudman will continue to use his Corona loppers for the one inch wood. For the thicker stuff, he'll use his little Black and Decker 18V battery powered chainsaw or just snap the sticks into pieces with his Herculean arms.\"Made in Taiwan to Corona's exacting specifications.\"
B00004R9YQ Corona makes the best quality gardening equipment.  I own pruning saws as well as the hand pruners.  Most importantly they last forever! I have experienced so many other brands that give out after just a little use.
B00004R9YQ I have used a number of pruners, but these are my fav.  Sharp and powerful.  Like the fact that you can sharpen them rather easily extending their value and lifespan.  Great for all my needs.
B00004R9YQ I really love these pruners. They are heavy duty (up to 1 inch). They are more reasonable than some similar Felco pruners I bought (which are also good). I recommend these.
B00004R9YQ These clippers are great.  Easy to grip and sharp enough to really get the job done.  I like the locking hook that keeps them closed when not being used.  Also, the red handles are a big help to spot them when you've laid them down among your clippings.
B00004R9YQ I lost my pruners in a move and had let my plants get sadly overgrown while I was SURE I was going to find my old pruners. Finally, my front yard looked pretty ridiculous and I came here in search of relatively inexpensive bypass pruners. I read lots of reviews and decided to go with this, and I'm glad I did. I had no problem using these to cut small branches and bushes. The handle felt comfortable in my (fairly small) hands, it hasn't stuck or jammed, and they feel like they're made to last. Thanks for steering me right, other reviewers. :)
B00004R9YQ I recently purchased these pruners in a package that contains a second pruner that also cuts string and opens boxes. Lifetime guarantee, and both at the local Costco cost the same as the one on Amazon.
B00004R9YQ I am a landscape contractor and we use a lot of different hand tools. There are a number of very pricey pruners out there but I have found that these operate extremely well at a fraction of the cost of some others. They are forged heavy grade pruners with nice grips. Just keep the blades oiled and clean.
B00004R9YQ This pruner does not even remotely cut 1&#34; branches, wet or dry.  Does not cut 3/4&#34; branches.  It may cut SOME 1/2&#34; dry branches but at least the one I received was not sharpened and I was forced to return it.  Have not decided on a new one yet, since I was so disappointed after reading all the great feedbacks and finding different.
B00004RA0O this is a very good product.  i laid it on top of 4 metal fence posts at the corners of my strawberry bed.  it is surprisingly strong.  it gets snagged on just about everything, but does not rip.  it keeps the birds and cats out of my strawberries.  i will be buying more in the future.
B00004RA0O I originally purchased this to keep stray cats out of my raised beds.  The material, however, is too flimsy and if the cat (or any other large animal) really wanted to get into the beds, it wouldn't have too much trouble cutting through the netting with its claws.  So I had to pursue a different path to keep the cats out.I did, however, keep using this material to keep birds and other unwanted pests (moths, butterflies, etc.) out of my garden.  Having another pair of hands around to help with installation is good because this material tangles easily and snags on just about everything, including itself.  So you need to exercise care when putting it on otherwise it will rip.  I also realized after a few months of use that the mesh size is too large so moths and butterflies can easily squeeze themselves through the netting and make their way to the plants.For the price, it's a decent product.  I'm thinking I can get at least one, maybe two, season's worth of use before I have to throw it out and start with fresh material.  Next time around, I will look for a stronger material that I can reuse for more than a couple of years.
B00004RA0O The local bird population was eating all the raspberries a day or two before they were ripe enough for us. This thwarted them!It is a bit tricky to put on by oneself. I recommend at least two people if you have much of a span to cover.  We will be buying more.
B00004RA0O I managed to get this stuff wrapped around all my fruit trees last year (quite a job - it snagged on all the branches and even my buttons, but with the help of another person and two long poles, we did it.)  I guess it worked well enough but I will never use it again since it doesn't just keep birds away, it traps them.  I managed to spot and free a bluebird and a cardinal that had become entangled, before they died of thirst or were found by cats.  But then one day I found a bluebird all dried up hanging from the netting - poor thing, what a horrible way to die.  :(  I want to protect my fruit, but I don't want to kill songbirds, certainly not slowly over a period of days.  So I am going to try some of those products that are supposed to merely scare them away, not kill them.
B00004RA0O We made a PVC \"greenhouse\" framework and stretched this over it to keep birds and hornworm moths out. So far, it's working pretty well.Great stuff. Can get hung up on the roll when you're rolling up what you don't need. Cheap enough to throw away at the end of the season without pain.
B00004RA0O Okay, I'm not using this netting like the other folk, but perhaps you too are  looking for a solution to THAT deer that's so bold he doesn't hesitate to come up onto the porch to nibble the delicious buds off your potted plants.My particular problem this year wasn't that, but it was that someone was dining on the new garden I put in the front yard.  Now, you can't exactly put up deer fencing -- at least not attractively-- at the front of your lawn, but you can protect your plants, it turns out, with this netting.What I did was cut the netting into small swaths which I lay over the plants.  LOL, it apparently has an unpleasant feel on the tongue.  The dear deer hasn't even eaten the lettuces I've got tucked in here and there.  And the best part is that the netting is invisible.  At least I can't see it.So try this out and see if it works for you.  It's allowed us to grow plants that none of our neighbors dare try here in deer-country Virginia.One note of caution:  You need to check periodically to make sure that blossoms don't work themselves into the netting.  I've had to work some free so they could open.Pam T~happy gardenerI'll report back if there's a failure at any point
B00004RA0O Easy to handle but came with no stakes or any kind of tie-down. Also, no directions about how to wrap tree. Spaces seem small enough to keep out birds but it really should come with sample pics or directions. We had to take ours down because we wrapped it too tight and the trees were dying.
B00004RA1S When I first got this thing, I must admit, I was really dubious. It looks odd and gimmicky. Well, using it in my garden has turned me into a believer! It works great on my thick, clay-heavy soil - quickly cultivating the ground, breaking it up and preparing for my attentions. It works great and I highly recommend it!(Review of Garden Weasel Gold Garden Claw Cultivator #91306)
B00004RA1S I planned to use the Garden Claw for stand-up cultivation of my raised beds, and it will be great for that; it's perfect for SFG-style beds.But this is the best part: I've discovered it's perfect for helping me dig post holes for my grape and kiwi trellises. I'm a 4'10\" disabled woman with bad knees and a bad back. I just don't have the upper body strength to ram a post-hole digger into the clay soil in our fescue-matted field, and the two big, strong men in my household always have something more pressing to do.I discovered the Garden Claw makes a circular hole that's just a tad wider than the post-hole digger does, and I can loosen six or more inches of clay soil and roots in no time. Without strain! Then I can use the post-hole digger to lift out the loosened soil, or I can just spade it out into a bucket for use somewhere else. As weak as I am, I can get two 2-foot holes dug before I have to rest.I've been frustrated because I've been too broke to pay someone to come put these trellises in and worried because I know the vines will be here before I know it. Thanks to the Garden Claw, I can put in my trellises all by myself! It paid for itself the very first day. So far, I'm delighted with it.
B00004RA1S I bought my garden claw several years ago. I was looking for something to help turn compost into my vegetable gardens.The criterion I was looking for was something inexpensive that wouldn't break the bank the way a tiller would. But would still get the job done without causing me to be laid up with back pain for a week. For the most part I have been very pleased.We have 2- 12'x12',and  2-8'x8' beds  along with a few smaller freestyle plots, and we mainly use the claw to add compost and cow manure to them every Spring . With the claw I am able to quickly mix in my amendments, and to loosen up the soil about a half foot down in next to no time. If I want to go extra deep, it does take a double dose of clawing , but it is worth it in the end. And it really is not that much extra work since the soil has been pre-loosened a bit by the first go around.As far as starting a bed from scratch, I have used it to start new plots, but only after the sod has been removed. I do think it would be a tough chore to try to do a new bed from start to finish, with only the Claw,and without removing the grass first, but not impossible.When weeding I find it invaluable for use in between rows. It is a breeze to simply stick the claw into the center of a clump of weeds and give a twist and a tug and be done.My one complaint is that the handle has come a tad bit loose. It is still perfectly functional and it took about 5 or more years of good solid use for that to happen, but for someone with a larger plot who uses it more often it may be a concern.
B00004RA1S We bought the Garden Claw several years ago at our first house and never used it, because the handles are mounted for lefties.  That is, the two hand-grips are each curved to the side, giving a feel of turning a wheel when you use it.  This would be great if you put your hands on the grips and turned it to the right to dig.  But the tines on this gadget are positioned so that you have to \"steer\" the Claw to the left to get them to dig.  Since us righties have more strength in our right hands, it was very awkward to \"steer\" the Claw to the left.  We spent about 20 minutes with it in the garden that day and haven't used it since.
B00004RA1S This is a handy tool for cultivating small areas, but it is not appropriate for anything more than a medium sized flowerbed.  The handles work well to gain leverage, but you will feel it in your muscles if you  attempt to do too large an area!The fact that it isn't powered lets  you get into areas you wouldn't want to go with even the smallest of  tillers, and it does a great job of breaking up the ground to a depth of a  couple of inches, which is perfect for flowers.For larger projects, use  a mini-tiller, and use this tool for the detail work and the smaller beds.  Both tools are a good combination to have at your disposal.
B00004RA3E Currently I hate this thing.  I may need to oil it/adjust it or make some other modifications but it squeaks of metal on metal and cuts about 1/3rd of the grass I pass over with it.  I found a manual mower like this in the yard of the first home I bought and used it for years.  It was better than any mower I've ever owned.  This seems to perform like a cereal box toy imitation of what a manual push mower is supposed to be like.  Pooptastic.  I will update this review if I am able to modify it to actually cut grass, but out of the box it seems to make far too many blade passes per distance traveled to ever perform well.  Also the last model I had had two counter-rotating blades and this only has one rotating in one direction against a stationary blade/block.
B00004RA3E I'm not sure how I missed that important point, but I did.  I don't see that clearly mentioned from scott's, either.  This particular model with the four wheels makes it nearly impossible to use on hills.  It just doesn't have the leverage to cut the grass.  So I'm back to the mower.  One thing I will say is that it cuts well on flat surfaces, but it does require a bit more effort than I thought to push.
B00004RA3E A couple of years ago my husband decided to shove our old mower in the shed and buy this push mower with the sharpening kit and grass catcher. His motivation was that this mower would not pollute and was ecologically responsible.While it isn't hard to maintain or use and it can be adjusted for height easily, I am a finicky type and I really don't care for the job this mower does. I miss the good old days when my lawn looked perfectly manicured with neat paths of freshly mowed grass.The positive in regard to this mower is that it cuts a wide path which theoretically is time saving and efficient. The negatives are more numerous. The handle on this mower has fatigued 6 times in two years. I have ordered replacement handles a couple times after duct taping proved to be a poor fix at best. The grass catcher has been replaced twice because it fell apart. We are on our second sharpening set. The most irritating aspect  of having this mower is that it does a poor job if the grass gets too long between mowings. The weird weather conditions this spring has resulted in my grass seeding twice and growing like crazy. Long strands of germinating grass stand in contrast to the parts that actually do get cut. Most of the time, my husband mows the lawn twice in an attempt to get it even. Usually that makes little difference as to the law
B00004RA3E Everyone I know advised me against getting a reel mower.  I was cautioned that they don't cut well and they're hard to push.  But I didn't consider a gas mower an option (too expensive, noisy, hard to maintain, and dangerous), a corded electric would be too cumbersome, and a rechargeable would be impractical because there is not a convenient place for me to charge it.  So I took the plunge and bought this one.I'm completely intimidated by all things mechanical, so I was worried about assembling this mower, but it really is easy.  The only thing you have to do is screw the five sections of the handle together, then clip it onto the mower body.  The instructions were adequate (3.5 stars there), even for an assembly-phobe like me.  The current configuration does not require any tools for assembly, but there was an add-on bag of washers and nuts included with my mower that are recommended for a more securely assembled handle.  If you opt to use the new nuts instead of the original wingnuts, you'll need a wrench.After just fifteen minutes or so, I was up and running.  To my delight, the mower pushes easily, even through long grass.  And it's very entertaining to watch the grass being rapidly snipped off.  I felt like Edward Scissorhands.  Who would have thought mowing grass would be so fun?  I was a little tired and winded when I finished (in a good way), but I had been practically running with this thing because I enjoyed it so much.  I kept looking for stray patches to go over again, but, alas, the mower did such a good job, when I was finished, my yard looked like a golf course.A few facts about me and my lawn to see if my wholehearted recommendation will apply to you:  I'm female, plus-sized, totally out of shape, and usually quite sedentary (one reason I thought this would be a good idea).  I had never mowed grass before in my life (didn't have a yard before last summer, and then I accepted the fine services of a neighborhood girl with a ride-on mower who worked cheap).  My yard is about 6500 square feet, level, fairly flat, and covered with long pine needles all over the place (the mower didn't even notice them).Some older reviews address a couple of problems that are no longer an issue:  Scotts now (late April 2007) packages the mower with the cushioned handgrip already on, and the apparently easily loosened wingnuts (as already mentioned) can now be replaced with regular nuts (not mentioned in the current manual, but included in the box with a note).  Scotts should have included shorter bolts with the new nuts (since you now don't need the extra length the wingnuts required), but this is a trivial point.  Put your wingnuts on after the new nuts for a more \"finished\" appearance.A reel mower might not be suitable for everyone and every yard, but for me, it's fantastic.  It's quiet, easy to maneuver, non-intimidating, good exercise, fun, environmentally sound, and inexpensive.  I couldn't be happier with this mower.UPDATE 1-17-13I used my mower for the whole season and never had any problems with it.  The next year, health issues forced me to again use the services of the neighborhood girl to mow my lawn.  Then I got married, and my husband wanted nothing to do with a reel mower (though he admitted that it was cool, he'd always used a gas mower, and that's what he wanted to stick with, though I HATE the noise and smell when he mows).  So my Scotts sat in storage for years, and last fall Hubby finally convinced me to let it go.  I sold it for $50 to a single mom with a tween daughter who was going to mow their small lawn.  I let them try it out on our grass, and they were both immediately thrilled and couldn't wait to get home to use it.  I felt like I was kind of passing on a torch.  There's something wonderfully enabling about this mower.  If I found myself again being the person responsible for mowing a small-to-medium-size lawn, I would definitely buy another one of these.
B00004RA3E It's a classic all right, but a clever classic.  This mower is a straight forward push reel mower with a few nice touches.  That second set of wheels replace a roller all right and the clever height adjustment let's you know that someone gave some thought to this device.  One of the one-star complaints regarding this mower involves the difficulty pushing it.  Well, you can alleviate that by simply adjusting the closeness of the blade  or even the angle of the cut; mine was initially a real bear because the blade was factory adjusted to such a closeness that the reel blades added enormously to the drag, far more than the grass did.  Once you've tapped in an adjustment to the closeness of the blade to its stropping plate (remember just 1/4 turn at the most and oil all the blades) it'll be close to effortless.  The main thing, however, is that reel mowers do such a pretty cut.
B00004RA3E Works like a charm. Put it together in a few minutes and cut an overgrown yard at a cabin. Had to make two passes - one at the highest length and one at desired length. The tall weeds did not cut, but I cut them with a lopper. Much easier to maneuver than my power mower and trimmer-mower.
B00004RA3E I have had many people look at and watch me as I mowed our lawn for the first time with this reel mower and all I could think is that these people think I'm going green... well I'm not. I have always lived a conservative life, recycled (still do), and so on. And not because some celebrity told me I should or whatever, but because it just makes sense to do so. So with that out of the way, onto the actual product.When gas prices peaked last summer we stopped using our lawn tractor because it used just too much gas (and it didn't cut the grass all that well to begin with) and just used our self propelled Honda mower. Well after the tractor sat all summer we decided to just sell it and buy a reel mower and so far it has more then paid for itself.The first question EVERYONE asks is, is it hard to push? Plain and simple, NO. These new reel mowers are lighter and are better designed so they are much easier to push then the old Leave It To Beaver style reel mowers. Also the rear stabilizer wheels also makes it easier to handle.The second question that is asked is, how well does it cut the grass. Well that depends on how tall the grass is, how wet it is, etc.. A reel mower cuts with a sheering action (like scissors) instead of a tearing action that is associated with a rotary mower. This leaves your grass in a much healthier state then the tearing action does. Now I will say that it is harder to cut tall grass and we have to mow more often, but that's the nature of the beast.After mowing the lawn for a few weeks with the Scotts 20 inch reel mower I can actually tell a difference in the grass, much better and healthier looking.The only gripe I have is the handle is a bit flimsy and wobbles a lot... kind of a pain when you execute a turn. We'll probably end up welding it together so it doesn't wobble.All said and done it's a bit more work then using our self propelled Honda, but produces a much better looking lawn.Pros:Fairly cheap upfront cost.Little to no upkeep.Leaves your lawn looking awesome.At least ten times quieter then pretty much any rotary mower, thus allows your to keep your windows open when you are mowing.No fumes (darnit I love the smell of gas!).20\" mower path.Cons:Made in China...Some plastic pieces, not sure how they are going to last but we'll see.Wobbly handle.
B00004RA3E I really like this mower a lot.  I have owned a Brill and Sunlawn, but I like the Scotts classic better than either.  I do have a 40 year old Scotts Deluxe that is substantially heavier and which I like the best of all.  I use the old Scotts Deluxe for mowing my own yard and leave the Scotts classic in my trunk to mow rentals.  Here are my pros and cons.Pros.1. Heavier than others.  That makes it less likely to slip when going over uneven lawn or wet grass. It also has more reel momentum making it cut tall floppy grass and leaves better.2. Handle comes off easily.  There are little clips that hold the handle in, but I do not use them. I just pop the handle on and off, making it easy to store in my trunk and use any time.3.  No gas, much, much lighter and smaller than a gas mower. Of course this is true of all reel mowers, but it is an important point for me.  I can leave this in my trunk and not worry about gas fumes or about refilling gas.  It is always ready to go.  With the handle off, it does not take up too much of my trunk and it is light enough to easily take in and out of my trunk.4. Durable.  You might not think of this with a reel mower, but it saves me nice money in maintenance.  I actually mow several rental lawns weekly.  With that much mowing I have to take my mower in for maintenance every year.  Also I have bent the crankshaft on multiple mowers.  The only maintenance on this is sharpening the blade.5.  Easy to sharpen the blade.  This mower is made by American Lawn Mower, which means it can use the very easy, very cheap american lawn mower sharpening kit available from amazon and tons of other places for under $20.  I like the kit and feel I get a better cut with this mower than I did with the brill or sunlawn models.6. Quiet. Maybe it is a little louder than the brill, but it is still super quiet.  If I feel like mowing in the middle of the night, just because I can, I do and it bothers noone.  Now when I use a gas mower, the noise really bothers me.Cons.1. Handle is super flexy.  They really cheaped out on the handle. The sunlawn and brill models are much stronger.  It works and lasted a heavy use season, but it will not last as long as the body.2. Tough time with weeds. Like all reel mowers, this thing does not like to mow anything that is tall and floppy. This one handles weeds and tall grass much better than average, but you should still try to hold down the weeds and cut weekly if possible. That being said my sister often forgets to mow her weedy lawn for a few weeks, and I am able to mow it with my Scotts classic when her sunlawn would have more difficulty.
B00004RA3E I hate gas powered tools! I bought this as a hopeful solution to that problem. Obstacles are a definite problem. The maneuverability is quite limited. With a gas mower you could tilt the back end up and over some small obstacles. That wasn't the biggest problem. A little extra weed whipping to be done. The biggest problem is the quality of the cut. If your grass is not perfect plush growth like a golf course the cut will be OK not great. This mower is for people who LOVE grass. Not for people who HATE gas powered tools because you have to mow almost every other day. I hate mowing and grass. I mow mine down to the ground every time and hope it doesn't rain so I wont have to do it again for 2-4 weeks. Some people coddle their grass. They think of it as a family member. They talk about their grass non-stop. They can have a discussion about bagging over mulching for over an hour. They have chemicals for weed control, ants, grubs, PH balance, feed. They seed and water regularly. They spend several hundred dollars every year on their lawns. Their passion for their grass is second only to their family. If this sounds like you, great! It's great to have a passion and this mower is for you. If you mow your lawn down to the dirt and curse at gas powered tools and HATE mowing. This mower is not for you.
B00004RA3E I wish I could say that I purchased this mower after seeing Al Gores \"inconvenient truth\" and my life was changed by it.  The truth however is that I finally got fed up with my old power mower failing to start for the ump-teenth time after repeated repairs and promises of it now \"running like a champ\".  This old time mower will take some getting used too, and also don't kid yourself, it doesn't do the job as easily as a power mower by any means.  However on the plus side you will never again suffer through a mower that fails you, needs fuel, requires any real maintenance like oil changes or plugs, and best of all if you take care of it, will be the very last mower you ever buy.  The only way this mower will up and quit is if you do.  Any maintenance it does require is easily handled by a screwdriver or wrench.  Even for those whose knowledge of small gas engines doesn't go much beyond kicking it and swearing when it disappoints you. I fully agree with the reviewer here who stated it is best used on pristine lawns with lush healthy grass. (Unfortunately a lot of people that have lawns of such quality often don't cut their own lawns. If you happen to be the exception, read on) This mower cuts thick grass of reasonable length straight and evenly very easily.  Where it fails you is on long loose weeds fluttering in the wind.  The mower passes right over them no matter how many times you try again and again to sever it.  I solved that problem by putting a little more effort into trimming with the weed whacker, and leaving the heavy grass to the mower.  And it by far is most efficient when used regularly once or twice a week.  A time table you will find effortlessly fits most peoples lifestyle since the mower is so light and easy to use that mowing the lawn will no longer be an all day Saturday event.  Unlike lawns where power mowers are used that usually get long and seedy looking in between jobs, you will find yourself taking this mower out far more often just to hit the \"high spots\".  Thus your lawn comes to have the appearance of a man that gets his hair cut every three weeks and thus never looks like he is long overdue.  You can also get away with using this mower early in the morning or late in the evening since it makes very little racket. And one last thing, I didn't notice much difference in the physical effort needed to push it considering that most people use walk behind push mowers in any event.  Aside from having to use it a little more often, and its lack of cutting power on long weeds, I consider this mower to be well worth one's investment.  You will eventually come to find your lawn never looked better.
B00004RA3E Cuts well, etc.; but was missing some Nyloc nuts from the hardware baggie so my dad went to the store to get more.  After assembly it was fine.  But who needs that added hassle?
B00004RA3E I was really looking forward to trying out a reel mower and living a life of maintenance free mowing. It didn't work out. The second time I used it, the grass had gotten a little high, so there was a lot of back and forth action. It took forever, really. I know that this product isn't meant for that, but that was my situation. Anyway, as I was finishing the handle came apart. There are four wingnuts and bolts holding the assembly together, and one on each side had apparently worked their way off while I was mowing without me noticing. The third one came off as I was putting it away and the handle came apart.Yeah, I was putting a lot of stress on it compared to a regular mowing, but that should not have happened. I followed the assembly instructions to the letter. It was really a very simple assembly. I didn't miss any steps or try to do it without reading the instructions, though. I was very disappointed with this product.If you have a flat yard and are going to be able to keep it mowed short without ever letting it get out of hand AT ALL (like leaving town for a couple weeks), this mower may be for you.If you have a sloped, lumpy yard, do not buy this product. Just don't. It is so hard to use. I honestly think I would like it if I had a nice, flat yard, but as it is this thing was worthless to me.
B00004RA3E I ordered my Scotts 20\" Classic Mower on Earth Day and because I had to put it together, I finally used it for the first time in mid-May. I wish all I had to do was put in two screws and be done but there were 5 big pieces to the handle and lots of little pieces (fortunately almost all the same set of pieces). I could put it together with only a little difficulty and I don't have much practice at putting things together. I couldn't get the E-rings in. My husband managed that.The handle flexes. I wondered if that was needed to handle the bumps, but after using it I don't think it is. I think it is just cheap. The mower part feels more substantial.  It is made in China. I wonder how many years of not using my gas mower it will take to make up for transporting this from China.In the reviews people talked about it stopping suddenly. I had the same issue. I have a very small yard; it is level except for a few odd little depressions. At those spots as well as at random moments the mower would freeze up. It happened some times when the clippings kind of got clogged on the back guard. Other times, I could not see why it stopped. It went right over the small sticks in my yard, which I was happy about. On the other hand, all the dandelions just bent over and snapped right back up after I passed over them. I had a few spots where I went at the grass from a few directions before it mowed. Once I got it going it tended to keep going, but every corner meant a full stop and then had to try to get `er rolling again. Next time, I'll see if I can figure out a way to mow with less full corners. As I said it is a small yard, so I'm not sure it will work.Overall I am happy with the product except for the issues I mentioned above. I didn't want to spend too much, so for the price this is about what I expected. I plan to use this every other time I mow. I'm keeping the gas mower to get through the weeds and plants that are out of control. As I'm growing more native plants and food, my area of grass is decreasing.
B00004RA3E I was not sure if this mower would work for me, seeing as my lawn is &#34;too big&#34;, bumpy, and pretty weedy as I don't use chemicals on it.  But I took the chance and am very glad I did.  It's much easier to manage than the gas mower I was using (not self propelled),  and does a good job on the lawn.  If you are looking for a perfectly even lawn this may not be for you, but I don't mind an occasional weed sticking up here or there.  The higher height setting seems to allow the mower to go over most small twigs, which was another concern of mine.  I mow each &#34;section&#34; of my lawn once per week, so the grass does not get too high.  Also I switch mowing directions each time.  If you are not able to keep up with your lawn this probably isn't for you as it does best when cutting about 1/3 of the length of the grass.  Using this mower might take me a bit longer than using the gas powered one, but not by much.  And it's a whole lot quieter and easier to maintain.
B00004RA3E I am a great fan of manual mowers for small yards, although that wasn't always the case. When I was a small lad one fo my shores was to mow a double lot with an old, heavy manual mower, something that soured me on manual mowers for decades. But a few years ago I discovered the new generation of manual mowers, and now I mow my lawn in about the time it took with my gas mower, but without the noise, the vibrations or the fumes. I can mow at 7 in the morning, or 9 at night without bothering the neighbors, too.The Scott has a number of good things going for it: It's light, easy to push, fairly easy to adjust, and you can sharpen it yourself with a simple kit. That alone will save a bit of money. It's my favorite unit in its price class. (My favorite mower is the Brill, from Germany, which is even lighter and easier to push  than the Scott and doesn't require sharpening for 8 years, but which Amazon doesn't carry... yet.)If you do buy the Scott, get the sharpening kit, as when you do need it you'll want to have it on hand. And get a can of Boeshield protectant spray (also available from Amazon). A quick once over with the Boeshield from time to time will greatly extend the life of your mower and keep it easy to push.
B00004RA3E I have about six-thousand square feet of lawn.  This mower handles it quite well.  There's some effort to push it, but it's actually easier in some ways than using a power mower; for example, the lighter weight of this mower makes it far easier to change directions in a tight space.  It's easy to adjust the height of the cut, as well.I'll just note one small problem that I've had and two limitations of all mowers of this type.  There is a thin foam pad on the top of the handle.  On mine, it split on the left side the first time that I used the mower, which isn't a big deal.  Mr. Shenker in his excellent review reports that his mower will cut long grass.  Mine leaves long grass uncut.  I believe that this is simply a limitation of reel mowers in general.  Also, it's probably more important to make sure that the ground is dry with any mower that you power yourself, simply because you need traction on the ground to make the blades turn, and this, in turn, makes it more likely that you'll skid on any mud.  With those limitations, however, I can unhesitatingly recommend this mower.

B00004RA3E It's 9:00am on a beautiful Saturday morning.  The air is a little cool but the sun feels warm on my skin.  The Northern Cardinals are singing and I hear a Golden Fronted Woodpecker chirping in the tree above my head.  As I sit on my back porch and sip my coffee I feel content and happy.Then, my next door neighbor fires up his ridiculously over-sized riding lawn mower.  A few minutes later the guy behind me joins in.  I head inside.  Another Saturday morning ruined.  I decide to make a  point.  Later that day the neighbor is hosting a bar-b-que in his backyard.  As he is tending the grill I chat with him for a while.  He has over 30 guests and they are all having fun talking to each other and laughing.  I announce that it is time for me to mow my yard.  His eyes get big and he stammers \"N..n..now?\"  Yep.  I roll out my brand newScotts Push Reel Lawn Mowerand start mowing right next to his fence.  None of his guests even noticed.  He happily offered me a beer and a brat when I was done.  This mower makes life better.EDIT:  I received aFiskars reel mowera month ago through the Amazon Vine program and, to be honest, I like it better.  I still like the Scotts but the Fiskars is easier to use and requires less maintenance.
B00004RA3E I love push mowers - quiet and when the blades are sharp, they do a great job. This goes for this mower, too. It is ideal if you have a small lawn or want to get a little exercise while mowing. The downside to any push mower is that apparently they require a special skill set to sharpen the blades & most garden shops do not sharpen the blades.  I was able to find one place that sharpens blades in the entire area and it is not cheap. It's not a good idea to do it yourself, quite dangerous, & dull blades are useless. The blades seemed to dull very quickly, if that is possible - maybe they weren't very sharp to begin with. I hope more people will buy push mowers, which will force more shops to consider getting the tools so they can offer sharpening. I have 4 friends who all have the same problem. This has nothing to do with the mower itself, just know that before you buy it, research your area to make sure there is someone who can sharpen it for you.
B00004RA3E I like this.  No need for gas and it cuts very nicely.  I use it in south carolina and my yard is not big.  It is good for my application.  Good work out!
B00004RA3F We purchased a chicago 2-flat about a year ago.  I bought a used $10 reel mower that was awful, but got us through the dry summer last year.  I knew we would need a new one this year.  After watching for sales that never happened I turned to trusty amazon.  So far, I'm completely satisfied with this lil guy!  We have a relatively small yard, so the 14 inch width is completely appropriate.  I also was super impressed at the way it handled long grass.  I know these mowers are notorious for not being able to handle it, but I was pretty pleased.  It may not have cut the long grass like a gas mower, but it really was completely acceptable.  Like a few other reviewers have said it does get stuck on any little twig.  So you might have to stop a few times to bend over and pick them out, but if you're the reel mower type I would assume bending over a few times isn't out of the question.  You can't beat the price either!  I had no issue with the assembly, it took just a few minutes.  After watching my neighbor reel over his in short strokes to get through the yard I was even more glad that I have this guy!
B00004RA3F Couldm't cut my grass very well.  Misses some spots because it just didn't cut it.  if the grass is taller than 2 inches, this is not mower for you.  Need to spend the money and get something that works.
B00004RA3F Who is willing to buy a new product that only has a 90 day warranty? That is the typical warranty on used product. If the manufacturer has little faith in their product, then neither do I.
B00004RA3F I am a avid gardener, I take care of the flowers and my husband takes care of the lawn.  We have had too many cases of lawmmower blight;by definition - the weed wacker or lawn mower cuts down my flowers and bushes.  After too many cases of lawnmower blight, I bought this little mower for trimming near my flower beds that are naturalized (lawnmower blight does not happen at mulched beds).This is a great tool!  Very sharp and easy to push, perfect for what I need it for.  At first my husband was slightly insulted by and for the reason of this pruchase, he even snickered when it came out of the box, but when he tried it he loved it and is now using it to trim by our driveway as is cuts lower than our \"big\" mower.Highly recommend for very small lawns and trimming, remember it is 14 inches wide.I JUST LOVE IT1
B00004RA3F Winter is not the most appropriate time to review a new lanmower, but the truth is that the (coarse) grass was around 6 inches tall. It took two passes but got mowed very nicely. I think this one's a keeper.
B00004RA45 Have a good place to put it. It certainly isn't mobile. But you can put a lot of seeds in here.
B00004RA45 I had never grown from seed before, but I wanted to plant some morning glorys this spring.  I tried to direct-sew last year but that was an epic fail.  I realized if I really want them I need to start them indoors.Off to trusty Amazon I go!  I sort of hastily bought one of the top seed starters that showed up in the search.  I did what it said, and alas I have (some) morning glorys in addition to some basil and cilantro seeds I had sitting around.  I had average sprouting, but I would always attribute that to the seeds more than the plastic trays!I did feel that the plastic cover is VERY flimsy, it actually doesn't fit on the top very well.  I suppose its not that big of a deal because the top isn't really on very long, but I would have appreciated it being a little more sturdy.The bottom tray is a bit more robust and I haven't had any issues as I've moved the full tray a few times.So far its served its purpose, but now as I've done it once I might look around for some different/better options in the future.  Try a few things out, etc.With that said I wouldn't mind using this one again, especially as its inexpensive but I would like to see what is out there.
B00004RA45 Works great, I needed this to start impatiens seeds from Burpee -- they're so small they resemble grains of sand, you actually dip a toothpick in water and use the surface tension to pick up and deposit each seed -- THAT'S SMALL. Keep the transparent lid on until the seeds have mostly sprouted, then remove the lid and slowly \"harden off\" the plants by exposing them to the outdoors and eventually sunlight over time.I wish I'd ordered two or more of these. It's much, much cheaper to start flowers from seed on your own versus buying them at the local Home Depot or nursery. I already ordered more impatiens and I have some vincas I want to get started for the warmer months. Buy some decent potting mix or seed starting mix, or if you're really crunchy granola run some garden soil through your oven @ about 350 degrees for an hour to sterilize it. I like to add some perlite to soil mixes. I also like to water the soil BEFORE THE SEEDS ARE SOWN with Miracle Gro. The transparent dome will maintain humidity while the seeds are sprouting. I'd use a decent plant mister (Couldn't insert product link, URL is http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0010H748S/ref=oh_o00_s00_i00_details) to keep the seedlings content.Great product. I really wish I'd ordered two or three of them.
B00004RA45 Very convenient and easy to start seedlings.  They are sturdy and I have reused them more than once.  I recommend these.
B00004RA45 Save your money - Use Styrofoam cups with a blend of soils - this was a ridiculous and very expensive attempt at greenhouse gardening .............
B00004RA48 I purchased this item locally at a discount store for much less, so be sure to check around before you buy.I purchased two, knowing that with my history I'd be lucky with 10 percent actually sprouting. But I was wrong! My granddaughter and I did the first tray together. She poured the water, then I counted out the seeds for her to plant. Her Mom and I did the second tray after she got bored. Within three days the first of the plants were up. It has now been 8 days and nearly every pellet has seedlings. I have already had to move the first ones (cantaloupe) to a large peat pot since they are five inches tall! I am using one of the top covers under the four large peat pots.Almost all of the others are 2 inches tall, but still fragile.This will be my first garden grown completely from seed, and I will definitely use this again next year!Edited, All of the plants are in the ground and doing well! Tomatoes are sprawling all over the place, Zucchini have flowers, even the cantaloupe are starting to perk up now that the weather is warmer.
B00004RA48 This is my second germination set I've ordered in the last two weeks.  This one is even flimsier than the other one by Hydrofarms.  However, the concept works:  place peat pots of seeds in a warm, humid environment and seeds will sprout.  I have mine on a heating pad under a grow lamp.  The peat pots only expanded to just under an inch.An aluminum pan with a clear lid would work just as well, as the metal would distribute the heat better.  I found the lid popped off easily so I check on it several times a day.  I have beans and turnips growing in my peat pots.With care I intend to reuse the pan and lid for multiple uses.  For new gardeners this is an effective way to grow seeds.  I could also place peat pots in sealed plastic bags for cheaper, though. I will report back in a week when the first seeds sprout.
B00004RA48 This is a decent item, but a little flimsy. The holder does not hold the soil discs well and the plastic container bends very easily making it hard to mve without caution. It gets the job done, is a good price, but I might try a different brand next to see if it is sturdier.
B00004RA48 You can't beat the price for this kit and it's so easy to start seeds. I used this for the first time last year and followed planting and disk instructions and had over a 75% germination rate! Between the cost and ease-of-use, this is a great way to start seeds for outdoors. Just keep the little pellets moist and you'll be good to go.Some seeds need dark to germinate, so make sure to read your seed packets!
B00004RA48 I've used this and a few other similar Jiffy products the last several years to start seeds for my garden. They are very easy to use (add hot water per the directions to expand the included pellets, then plant seeds per packet instructions) and less messy than using seed starting mix in flats--and perhaps even easier as well, though probably a bit more expensive. A clear plastic cover/dome is included to help germination. When the seedlings are ready to pot up or transplant, the netting tears off very easily and allows for transplanting with minimal root disturbance. Some people also leave the netting on and I seem to remember reading that it's supposed to disintegrate, but that hasn't been my experience. You do have to be careful with larger-rooted plants (squash, etc.) that you take care of them before their roots start to grow through the netting, otherwise you'll probably shock them more if/when you remove it. Finally, I like the square shape of this tray because it allows me to evenly rotate the plants under my grow lights.However, there are a few things you should know that don't seem to be made clear. Jiffy sells refill pellets so you can use the tray again, ideally saving money--but they have several similar-looking products that take different-sized pellets, so you need to know which ones you need. This 25-cell tray takes 42mm pellets (not 30, 36, or 50mm, which they also sell). Jiffy sells the 25-pack ofJiffy 5777 Refills, which are the right size. They used to be almost as expensive on Amazon as this complete kit, but as of my writing they are now an add-on item for about half the cost. Beware of third-party sellers; for example, I see a 200-pack of supposedly 42mm pellets,Jiffy 7 Peat Soil 42mm Pellets, but they were actually the wrong size, so I had to return them. You may also be able to find them locally. Just be sure you get the right size, which is the 42mm size, sold under the \"Jiffy 5777\" name. Jiffy does not make sizing clear on either the original product or the refill, both of which would be a great help.Finally, I will note that because of the availability of refills, I was hoping to save money by re-using the tray for a few years and just replacing the pellets. However, after saving two trays from last season (both inside under good, climate-controlled conditions), one became slightly warped and curled up towards the outside, making it undesirable for use since I'm not sure if my plants would fall over with this slight curl of the tray. It also developed a small crack in the bottom, which is important to be aware of if you're using (and watering) these inside as I assume most people do. Obviously, these are just thin plastic and not something I'd expect to keep for years and years, but I was hoping to at least get a couple years' use out them. This works better sometimes than others.In summary, I've used this product for a couple years now, and it's definitely become my favorite method for most plants. I plan to continue to use this product for as long as it's available--just be warned about refill sizes, and perhaps be careful about how the tray is stored if you're hoping to re-use it for the next season.
B00004RA4G In theory, this should work. I don't like how you can't see if there is anything in it. It sometimes will get knocked down so will look like its trigger and there's no real way to tell without opening it. This morning trap was knocked down, and I walked it all the way out into the wood to release oocupant only to discover it was empty.This trap might work okay, but I think the mouse cubes are alot better.
B00004RA4G A family of field mice moved into the house.  They are soooo tiny I wasn't sure what trap to use but this looked the lightest.  I caught the whole family within a few hours - even the babies. The secret as many have already said is keep in in their path and along the wall - I knew where they were coming from so it made that part easy.  Also, like already mentioned - just a dap of peanut butter - especially if trying to catch small mice.
B00004RA4G Recently I've been researching mice and other vermin as they pertain to farmstead habitation.Knowing that they must be removed from chicken coops and feed storage areas, it's nice to have options that do not require poison, nor snap a mouse/vole/rat to death and leave it for animals to pick at and possibly get sick from.Your cat, dog and other pets may get access to dead animals in traditional traps, so these enclosed live catch traps seemed like a great idea.I purchased four and placed them on a shelf where mouse droppings were noted.  I also places a motion activated camera so I could better see how they were or were not being trapped by the device.Within one 24 hour period, three out of four traps placed were tripped with nothing at all inside.  Upon video and still image review, a Deer Mouse had trotted over the top of the three traps that were tripped and of course activated them without being inside.The third trap remained unsprung, but the Deer Mouse only sniffed the opening and failed to enter.With all four traps re-set for another go, the Deer Mouse now just scampers around each trap and doesn't bother with them at all.I have added a photo of the setup and mouse to the collection of photos submitted by buyers/reviewers.I like the idea of the tilt trap and in theory it's great, in practical use it's simply not effective.  There are many solutions to this problem:The most popular is to simply put a cardboard box over the tilted UP end, through a hole that is cut just slightly taller than the trap at the fulcrum.  This allows the trap to activate, but does not allow the mouse to stand ON the tipped up section.  As this is an innovation which isn't already a part of the trap, I am giving my two star rating on the traps as designed.It also wouldn't hurt to make them larger with an adjustable balance weight... the buyer can of course make any number of modifications and the system is already being copied and improved by other companies... I guess this is an example of another weak patent registration process.So, I sadly would not recommend these to friends and others wanting to rid themselves of mice quickly.... but IF you enjoy the process of problem solving and using these as a starting point, you will certainly foil the mice and end up collecting them in short order.Look for the design which has a housing over the tipped up portion... it's better.
B00004RA4G We have several traps to deal with the mice that love our garage - this trap works well, but the one improvement would be to have the case transparent so you can see the contents.  When the mouse goes in, the trap rocks and the door closes and latches - this all works well, but the trap frequently closes without a mouse.
B00004RA4G I read the negative reviews and bought the trap anyway because I wanted a humane trap; just couldn't bring myself to kill the one mouse that seemed to have snuck into my house.  I posted a picture; the trap is smaller than a dollar bill.  I found that I was \"waiting up\" and checking the mousetrap every half hour, because any mouse that it caught would certainly die rather quickly in there.  A traditional mouse trap would be more humane if one couldn't release the catch within minutes of a trap.  I never did catch a mouse with it; I grew tired of checking the thing too often...I wish the trap were just a little bit bigger... but as it is, it is too small for a mouse to live for more than a few minutes.
B00004RA4G Having read reviews of several different live traps, had no idea which was best.  So, bought about 4 different ones.  THIS ONE WORKED.  Put them all out with peanut butter and had no sign of any activity except this one.  Didn't know how many mice we had, but caught three with this one and zero with the others and no escapes, it seems, from the others.  They were all put in the same general area.  This one worked, was easy to set, easy to bait and easy to release the mouse.
B00004RA4G This works well, but you cannot tell if it just tripped or if caught any.Sometimes it is tripped empty and that locks the door so it has to be reset before it can catch again. On the other hand, this is really low-cost and you can buy a lot more.
B00004RA81 This chain fit great for my Poulan Pro electric saw. This is also an older company that has a great website to help identify exactly what model your specific saw requires. It is not directional, so you don't have to worry about any arrows facing the right way. I just used it and I forgot how powerful my saw was. Getting old ones sharpened can be questionable when new ones are this cheap.
B00004RA81 I HAVE A 18\" CRAFTSMAN CHAIN SAW THAT CAME WITH A OREGON CHAIN THAT I HIT DIRT AND DULLED IT REAL FAST.THIS REPLACEMENT CHAIN FITS AND WORKS JUST AS WELL AS THE ONE IT CAME WITH AND IS ALSO HALF THE PRICE OF SEARS.
B00004RA81 This chain fit my Poulan 18&#34; chainsaw perfectly and was wicked sharp. The price was just a fraction of what I would have paid at a hardware or Tractor Supply store.
B00004RA81 as advertised..... Oregon Chainsaw always delivers a good product. I've bought lots of their chainsaw chains over the years and haven't ever been disappointed with the quality...... good product..........
B00004RA81 Nice quality replacement chain and fit perfectly. Seems to hold its sharpness better than the chain that came with the saw. I find it less trouble to just replace the chain rather than try to sharpen them.
B00004RA81 It was half the price of the same chain at Sears and came in two days. It saved me a ride and I have a pile of wood.
B00004RA82 Bought two for different chainsaw models and am pleased with the quality of the chains.Sharp as new!Excellent price. Just be sure your chainsaw is compatible!
B00004RA82 I switched from a skip tooth chain to this semi chisel and it cuts much faster and less vibration. On my 40 volt electric saw it really makes a difference.
B00004RA82 I buy these chains at my local hardware store for about the same price as Amazon charges. They work perfectly for my Husqvarna chain saw. Be careful to make sure you get the correct chain. There are many different variations on 16\" chains, and just knowing the brand of the saw doesn't tell you which will be the correct one.
B00004RA82 This S56 chain fits my Makita UC4030A electric chain saw. Price is cheaper than Home depot by about 6 dollars. At this price I will keep a few on hand and sharpen them later. Oregon's web site lists what chains fit which saws.
B00004RA82 Do not assume from this listing that the S56 16-inch saw chain will fit your 16-inch saw!!  If a photo of the back of the package were also included in this listing, you could zoom in and verify which models of the brands listed on the front view it will actually fit (Well Duh!!).  Additionally, while listings for some other Oregon chains advise we use the selector guide found at Oregonchain.com, most do not!  Oregon makes an excellent saw chain. Each and every listing should prominently provide explicit instruction that potential buyers need to first verify the correct selection for their particular make & model, before ordering.  Do they look at all those questions customers post (will this fit my xxx model of my xxx brand)?My father's Remington 16-inch electric, Model 1630A actually requires the S58, even though entering that make and model into Amazon's Search field brought us directly to this listing.  Unfortunately, we only discovered the mismatch when our shipment arrived and we found that it was not listed on the back of the carton containing the chain.  A visit to the Oregon website (also suggested on the carton but nowhere in this listing) revealed that the S58 is the correct choice.....even though the description and photo of the S58 at Amazon states \"Fits Echo, John Deere and Sears Chain Saws\" with no reference to Remington!!! The Amazon listing for S58 contained an advisory to first check the selector guide at Oregon.  That advisory is not included on this listing!  So, it did not do me much good to shop on Amazon versus visiting the local \"big box store\" when their listing resulted in the shipment & my return of the wrong product!  Are you going to reimburse my time/$$ to return 3 chains?  Come on guys!  Do you really monitor the responses to your \"Did we miss anything?\" links?UPDATE  (12.7.2013): Well!  I have already heard back on my return (it really pays to use the \"return function\" that can be found under your \"orders history\")and have received a complete refund!!  The email reply also promised this issue would be forwarded through channels.  Hopefully, this will result in a hyperlink being inserted below, with an advisory to first verify exactly which chain fits your saw make and model.  BIG TIP NOT EMPHASIZED ENOUGH EVEN AT THE SELECTOR SITE:  \"count the number of drive links in the chain you have now, and write that number down someplace where you can find it\".  S56 chain has 56 drive links while S58 (and our Remington's old chain)has 58!!I my case, the selector guide gave 4 different alternatives of 58 drive link chains for the electric saw we use behind the garage to cut up wood for splitting.  Since I have years of seasonal experience, and use a large, gas-powered, chain saw with an aggressive style of Oregon chain to fell and section trees in the woods, we chose the aggressive style chain (WARNING: this = \"far greater chance for kick-back and IS NOT for the unwary user\") which was also available at Amazon.com (not the S58 but the 91VXL058G).Lastly, this disappointment is one of the very few I have experienced in my many years and many $$ spent as a customer of Amazon. I use Oregon chains on my big Stihl saw, and have found that they cut a long time before dulling, and can be filed or re-sharpened many times over.  Recommend them highly.PS to the guy with the Poulan Pro...OMG!!!  For kicks and giggles, I looked up your saw on the selector guide.  There were some 15 or more choices and some were 56 link and others 58 link.  Yours is the best example I can see, where knowing to count drive links on the current chain is soooooooo important.
B00004RA8P I've owned two of these feeders and my only complaint with the first one is that the yellow &#34;flowers&#34; come out too easily and get lost.  This resulted in wasps, bees, etc being able to drink the liquid.  I had used it a few years and am supposing they aren't meant to last that long.I bought another one just like it and have had no issues so far.  Otherwise, great feeder with large capacity.  It is very heavy, so I suggest hanging from your porch or a limb.
B00004RA8P I don't have any problems with this and neither do the birds. We fill it with a sugar/water mix rather than feeding the poor little critters a load of crummy additives, they really don't care that the water isn't red and the artificial coloring is suspected of giving them health issues.Anyway, I just unscrew it from the cap when I want to clean and fill it, then empty any remaining solution down the drain in the yard and wash it off with the hose before taking it indoors (sugar water really attracts dirt in a carpet, ask me how I know).I have not found it difficult to clean. Once refilled I take it out again, still upside down, and then turn it over before anything significant can leak out. Then just screw it back in to the cap.

B00004RA8P We have  been feeding hummingbirds on our mountain in North Carolina for years now. The hummers have 2 clutches a year and, by late in the season, we will have 30 or 40 of them circling the feeders, claiming their territory and buzzing each other in some mock \"hummingbird wars\".  In August, we will empty one of these in a day, so we have to have multiple feeders to keep up.  This is the feeder we have always bought and they are pretty durable but once in a while a black bear will wear one out for us-so we keep a couple extra.  The feeder hangs on a piece of electrical wire that goes under the lid on top and the other end gets bent into a loop to hang on the hook.  But now they have decided to shorten the wire until it is just a few inches long after making the loop and tying the knot under the lid. I know the company must have saved about a penny on the wire length but it doesn't work for us now - I have to use a 2-step ladder to hang it.  So, I'm off to the home store to try to find some red electrical wire that I can use to replace the one that is way too short.Beyond that, this is the feeder to use.  The glass jar cleans easily with a jar brush and the yellow flowers at the bottom pop out so you can reach in with an old toothbrush to clean the inside. The 6 positions works way better than the 4 place feeders for us due to the number of hummingbirds that are trying to feed simultaneously.  Just giving it 3 stars - hoping the company rethink their board-room decision on the attachment wire.
B00004RA8P I've gone through so many hummingbird feeders that the hummingbirds have stopped being cautious when a new one appears.  I've tried decorative blown-glass ones, lightweight plastics ones, and glass/plastic combo ones manufactured by various companies, including Garden Treasures and this one, Perky Pets.  I've tried models with built-in ant moats and others with bee guards.  If I could keep away ants, then I couldn't dissuade the bees.  And ultimately, each model either leaked or crashed to the ground due to the included but inadequate hanging methods.  Finally, however, I think I've found The One, although I combine it with theNectar Protectorto keep ants away -- more on that later.First the details:  the 30-ounce glass bottle holds a lot of nectar, far more than my single family of hummingbirds (now four in all) can consume in a week, the maximum amount of time you should leave a batch of nectar outside.  Its size, however, gives it some heft and a wider opening in the jar to aid in cleaning.  The single-piece plastic base has six, yellow-flowered ports that are too small for bees to enter and a perch that circles it.  It comes with a short piece of red-plastic wire for hanging.  It does not have a built-in ant moat or anything else to dissuade those pests.The base will not leak, as many other models do, because it is constructed of a single piece of molded plastic.  The disadvantage of that is, of course, that you cannot get inside of it to clean.  I've found that if I change the nectar twice a week -- or even, in rare cases, only once -- and rinse out the feeder thoroughly before refilling, the inside remains clean and mold-free.  I also have a set ofDroll Yankees PLB Perfect Little Brushesto clean out the ports.  Like many hummingbird feeders, this one only addresses one pest problem, bees, so you'll probably want to get a separate ant-guard.  Because this feeder hangs with a wire, which I twist several times around itself to keep it from undoing, I have to attach it more or less permanently to the ant-moat above it, making it necessary to remove both, as a single unit, when refilling.  Also, when you tip it upside down to unscrew/empty it, you'll get sugar water on your hands and on the ground, so do it in a location where it doesn't matter.  To continue keeping bees away, make sure you also rinse the outside since the dried sugar will attract them.I do not use colored nectar and instead make my own clear version (4 parts water, boiled, to 1 part sugar).  There is enough red on the feeder to attract the hummingbirds without using colored nectar.I'm giving this feeder five stars because it's the best I've encountered after eight or so attempts.  It's not perfect, but it's darn close.-- Debbie Lee Wesselmann
B00004RA8P I am using this with the Audubon Hummingbird Food packets. It is easy to assemble and disassemble for cleaning. I am in a serious competition in my neighborhood with many hummingbird feeders and mine is quite popular. We can sit on our deck and within a few feet the hummers come and feed and are interested only in that and hassling each other.
B00004RA8P This product is well made and works well; however attempting to clean both the bottle and the base is very difficult. The base is sealed and with many small hard to reach spaces inside I can't see how it can be cleaned. The neck of the bottle is very narrow. Even with a bottle brush it's hard to reach all the area inside.
B00004RA8P THEY LOVE THIS ONE. IT'S THE CADILAC OF FEEDERS. IF MOLD BUILDS UP IN THE GLASS JUST FILL WITH DILUTE CLORINE BLEACH AND LET STAND FOR A FEW HOURS. IT WILL CLEAN IT UP.AND WHEN YOU FILL IT TRY AND STAND VERY STILL BY THE FEEDER AND YOU CAN OBSERVE THEM FROM ONLY INCHES AWAY. IF YOU DON'T MOVE, THEY CAN'T SEE YOU. BUT DON'T TOUCH. THEY'RE MUCH TOO FRAGILE.
B00004RA8P July 28, 2012 Update\"Talk about discrimination.  Our bunch so far this year has grown to 5 and they are just as much fun to watch as before.  This year they have their eyes and tastes set on the two Perky-Pets in the back yard and not so much on the front yard's other two feeders.  The key to this year's success for them and us is changing the solution every two or three days and putting fill the glass to about 1/4th full.  I am here to simply order two more.  I hope you enjoy yours as much as we enjoy ours.April 29, 2012:  They're back and still as beautiful as ever.  This year so far only two have shown up and I cannot determine their sex or anything.  They are still skittish and will not come to me as in the past.  It takes time.  They use these Perky-Pet 209s almost exclusively even though there are 2 other brands up.November 18, 2011:  Just a quick update.  The feeders are down, the hummers are on their way to Mexico and all is well.  After a full season of use and feeding a whole bunch of hummers I am happy to say these are the best of the best.  I usually changed the feeders every two to three days and have yet to have the first second of any problem except on some mornings the hummers would be a tad impatient with my schedule.  No leaks.  No broken roosts.  Nothing negative.  My homemade ant trap/chaser kept the glass clean on the inside.  I heard that a hand full of dried beans dropped in the glass and a few vigorous shakes would help keep the insides clean and it worked well.  Can't wait for springtime and their arrival.In recent years we have bought several feeders and this is the best yet.  We have had 4 to 5 feeding stations set up and the first one to empty is this and its twin even though one is out front and the others are in the back.  With all factors the same, i.e., sugar water in a glass container this one just has more appeal and frankly I do not know why.  They will not tell me.  When it is empty they do let me know while I on the way to refill it that it sure took me long enough to get there.  I always alternate feeders and will set the empty on top of the trash can while installing the new batch of food.  When I put this one on the can they go to it even though the Brand X has food.  When I set the one with Brand X on the can they could not care less.  Right now our population has grown to about 6 but there is no way to be sure with all them mostly the same colors except the male ruby throated ones.  The like the perch better than the rest and even though the holes are the same as the others they just seem to enjoy sitting there taking a sip.  If simple, hour wasting watching appeals to anyone buy a feeder and check out several of the hummingbird websites for recipes and care.  We use 1 cup sugar to 4 cups boiled water cooled to room temperature.  The hummers are absolutely delightful and thank you Perky-Pet for the 209s.
B00004RA8P I bought 2 of these to replace 2 older Perky Pet, 4 flower models.  The old 4 flower model has a design flaw which sometimes led to dripping and also attracted ants and wasps.  The bottle is large but the plastic bottom holds a lot of fluid as well.  It is over-sized for our needs, so I just fill it with less food.  Perky Pet should consider creating a new model based on this design but smaller.If I had a complaint, it would be with the wire for hanging the feeder.  A great solution for me was using a wire coat hanger and with pliers, fashioned a loop at one end and making a square shape after passing the wire through the hole in the feeder top. It works great, the wire is the perfect diameter for the hole in the feeder and very strong for windy days!I should mention the packaging is poorly done but it wasn't a problem for me. I can imagine a case of these in a store sitting on a shelf, with customers reaching for a box could easily result in a few being broken, as the glass bottle can easily come out of the box.The price is excellent, highly recommended.Update 7-7-2010, Just bought my 3rd...
B00004RA8P I bought 2 different feeders at the same time and this one is holding up much much better. It is solid and easy to clean. I didn't use the wire that came with the feeder as it was too short. But I threaded a pipe cleaner through the top hole and it works great. The hummers love the feeder and I can see it lasting for many years to come.EDITING: I am going to have to lower my rating on this. The hummingbird feeder works fine. The issue is the yellow \"bee guards.\" Did you know that bees and wasps are attracted to the color yellow? So if these \"bee guards\" (dumb name...should be called bee attractors) were any color other than yellow...like RED...then I wouldn't have a nectar feeder in my yard right that I can't even get to because it has so many wasps and yellow jackets on it.one more issue. I woke up one morning to find all six yellow bee guards removed. We searched the grass below and found 3 of them. There were no gnaw marks, chew marks, bites or scratches anywhere on the nectar feeder or yellow plastic flowers. What removed them? I don't know. But now that they are gone, the wasps are actually able to crawl INSIDE the darn nectar reservoir. Like I said, this nectar feeder is all but useless and the moment I can actually remove it without getting attacked by flying insects, I will and never put it back up again.
B00004RA8P This is difficult to clean.
B00004RA8P It's spring and time to bring out the hummingbird feeder.  This is one of the most popular models and there are lots of reasons.  It's a simple design, has six feeding stations, has a shatterproof glass cylinder and holds a whopping 30 ounces!  I've never had a problem with ants climbing down the wire to the feeder (wires are better than string and hold up better in the wind).  Depending on how hungry your many hummingbirds are, the more you'll have to refill the syrup.  Perky-Pets 'high energy nectar' is good stuff, but seriously, a high concentration of sugar and red coloring does the trick.  Hummingbirds are attracted to the color red.To enhance your hummingbird traffic, supplement it with plants that look great.  The following are some of my favorites for various reasons:Butterfly Bush - comes in blue, ruby, pink and purple and attracts butterflies and hummingbirds.Bottlebrush - small evergreen tree or shrub.  Attracts hummingbirds, but can be messy with its flowers.Fuchsia - comes in bright red or purplish color and is great to hang next to your feeder and attracts hummingbirds.Morning Glory (vine) - multi-color attracts hummingbirds and grows quickly.Flowering red Currant - colorful background shrub that attracts hummingbirds, as well.Note that all these plants grow well in California, so check your local nursery for other suggestions.
B00004RA8P I like the product being glass and so do the hummers. It would be nice to see PP improve the rim or perch to a more durable one as it becomes flemsy and easily breaks away from the base over time. Also the the yellow ports should be changed to red so as to discourage bees.
B00004RA8P I swapped out my old plastic hummingbird feeders for this glass one because the plastic ones kept getting moldy and were so hard to clean. This feeder is way too large for my liking, you need a lot (tons!) of sugar syrup to fill it up. It also took a week for my hummingbirds to go near this feeder and even now it's their second choice to my other smaller feeder. I don't think they like the perches, as they loved my old feeders which didn't have perches. And I don't think they are very attracted to this feeder due to its flat yellow flowers, instead of the pretty raised ones you get on other feeders.
B00004RA8P Works as expected.  Attracts humming birds and others.  Decent value.  As stated in many reviews needs a hook system and requires you to figure that out.
B00004RA9A Purchased these replacement yellow bee guards (which differ in shape from the image on the Amazon site &#8211; the guards now have a semi-globe shape), because I have the careless habit to walk out of the house and walk across the lawn, with a newly cleaned and filled hummingbird feeder held upside down.  On occasion, after a forgetful moment, I re-install the freshly cleaned bee guards before I reach the hummingbird location.  Once in a while, the bee guards have dropped out (and customarily I located them again.)  The last time I didn&#8217;t.  Long story, irrelevant to the product review, I just realize.  Be it as it may, I have no issues with the bee guards, nor (more importantly) do the hummingbirds.  This past season, the guards functioned flawlessly, to the delight of our hummingbird population (and frustration of the yellow-jackets.)  The only time (no joke) the bee guards didn&#8217;t &#8216;make it&#8217;, was when a black bear roamed the property and totally demolished all of our hummingbird feeders (no joke &#8230;)  I don&#8217;t expect Perky-Pet to take that into consideration (sarcasm.)
B00004RA9A These guards look like they would work well to deter bees.  However they do not fit most of our feeders.
B00004RA9A The bee guards worked great but the reason I gave it only three stars is the price. Over a buck a piece is more than it should be in my option. If it wasn't a gift to my dad who enjoys his hummingbirds I would have kept looking for a cheaper place to purchase them.
B00004RA9A Tthese little gems are O.K. and do work well to keep bees of most kinds out of the nectar; however, there is just no humane way to rid one's yard of bees.  Even though bees are a pain and create a problem for some hummingbirds these guards manage to keep the bees at bay.  Our hummers just look at the bees gathered around the guards and laugh at them while eating the nectar.  Typical of most predators the bees attempt to chase the birds but success falls to the birds.One minor problem with the guards is that some insects are small enough to enter the mesh but too stupid to figure a way out and thusly meet their demise.  When cleaning the mesh of the guards be sure to clean the inside as well.
B00004RA9A These did not fit my feeder, but I super-glued them in place. The \"basket\" part also falls off of the \"stem\" part ...but I super-glued them in place. The bees will find any small place not covered by glue, so if you try this work-around, be sure to put it on thick...a gel works best. I secured with masking tape to let it dry, too.I like feeding bees, and they have their own plate of sugar water, but I also want my hummingbirds happy. I also hate it when the bees get carried away and drown themselves. Trying to get them out while they are still alive is tricky, although they don't sting when wet with sugar water. This is helping.Today, a new problem: my tall dog can reach the feeder with his nose and is tipping it to drink from it, bees and all. These guards won't solve all problems, I guess!
B00004RA9A For the appropriate hummingbird feeder(s), these little guards are a &#34;must have&#34; if you are going to keeps bees and other insects from seriously messing up your feeders.
B00004RACK My order arrived promptly and in perfect condition. Excellent packaging!Quality of Gauge was evident -- solid brass fittings, clear 0-200 lb. increments and metric scale (atmospheres).A special Flat Rubber Washer (included) prevents leaks and helps keep water out of the housing. BE SURE the flat rubber washer is in place and fitting is tight to the spigot or manifold before water is turned on !! Don't dare lose that Flat Washer, 'cause a regular Hose Washer won't work !!IF you have installed the Flat Washer and tightened the Fitting properly before turning on the water -- and you see water inside the gauge, turn it off and SEND IT BACK as defective. Amazon's Returns Policy is the best in the on-line retail business, so it's a hassle-free deal to get an exchange or refund.Good Luck !!
B00004RACK This pressure gauge was almost half the price the one from home depot, but so much nicer - solid construction and does not leak. Seems to be accurate too.
B00004RACK This is a great little item to have when traveling from place to place.  I have a regulator on my hose but it is nice to know what the water pressure is  in cases where I had to take my regulator off to service it.  Gives one a little peace of mind so you don't worry about blowing your lines.
B00004RACK Attaches to any regular outside spicket or your washing machine line.  Seems to read ok, but I'm not 100% sure because I do not have anything to compare it too.  I think it would be beneficial to have a professional with professional tools measure the pressure as well to ensure the most accurate reading.The one negative I have is that the gauge fills up with water under the glass.  I'm not sure if mine is defective or if they are all that way, but I would think the water should not seep in like that.
B00004RACK If you are going to install a sprinkler system than you will need to know your PSI. This does a great job at letting me know where I stand. Now I can plan out my system.
B00004RACK This was purchased to measure my water pressure so that I know what the psi in order to install a back yard irrigation system.  This gave me an idea on what to spec out during the purchasing of sprinkler equipment.  The gauge is made of metal and can be screwed into your garden bib or faucet.
B00004RAGL I needed a relatively short garden hose and this APEX REM 15-foot hose fit the bill at a reasonable price. This Amazon item sells various remnants (i.e. left-overs from longer hoses) so what you get is not necessarily matches the stock photo. I am attaching a photo (under customer photos) of the hose I received - a green light-duty 3-ply hose. It looks just like many longer hoses I bought a local home improvement store. It is 15-feet by 5/8 inches. The hose is reinforced and comes with standard brass couplings. The couplings made good connections and do not leak even without Teflon tape.The hose came tightly wrapped which caused some kinks in the hose - I highlighted two of them in the attached photo. However, after several days in the sun with water running through the hose the kinks are working themselves out and the water flow is not impeded significantly.Overall, I am pleased with this purchase.Ali Julia review
B00004RAGL Hose remnants at the local big hardware stores are insanely priced.Not so with this unit! Great price and solid quality!
B00004RAGL This is a very well made product and is a good length for connecting portable hose reels to the spigot. I will buy this product again when needed.
B00004RAGL I purchased three of these via Amazon (free delivery) for $8 each and back for more. Great value! I use them in combination with a 4 way connector set and adjustable sprinklers to water each of my raised garden beds with just one quick turn of the hose. Not only are they a much better quality than the sets supposedly created to do the same thing but the price is competitive too. Just the right size to daisy chain sprinklers and reduces the time required to tend the garden...perfect for raised garden beds where regular sprinkler system might be over-kill.UPDATE - I noticed many people complaining over quality...for the record I received the Black hose remnants as pictured. From the sound of it, there are various colors and quality issues. The black ones are very good quality with brass fittings.
B00004RAGL i guess for the price all you can ask is that it works but barely. hose kinks very easy disrupting water flow and leaks where connected to the spicket, but water does get from point a to point b so i cant give it one star.
B00004RAGL Our 50-foot Gilmour hose was just slightly too short to reach the garden, so I picked up this \"remnant\" for those additional couple of feet - it works like a charm.  Pretty good price.  Not the highest quality hose out there (thin, rubbery and could kink), but is perfect for my use and great VALUE.  The one I got was just like the picture - black in color.
B00004RAGL I read the other reviewers who had similar problems before I bought this.  I also read the reviews raving about this hose.  Since these hoses are maid from remnants; I suppose its a matter of luck as to which hose you get.  My luck wasn't good.  The hose had permanent kinks and the vinyl skin had bubbles where it was separating from the hose.Returned it immediately.
B00004RAGL For a reasonable price these remnants proved fine for extending one pesky hose that was just a little bit too short.
B00004RAGL This is a short piece of hose.  It may not be the colour shown, so don't buy it if you're using it for decorative purposes.  If you want it to function, it will.Yes, it has a plastic washer instead of rubber.  If you would happen to have a leaking problem, just add some teflon tape (which you should be doing to all your pressurized hose joints anyway as a precautionary measure) - it only costs a few cents a roll.As this is the cheapest such item to serve its purpose, it gets my recommendation.[Mine is red and green, apparently for Christmas].
B00004RAGL I bought this to relocate my hose reel in the backyard, and it has proven to be a decent buy. I have had no issues with leaking, and that's all that I can really ask for here.
B00004RAGL Use these to hook up various pvc connections in my garder watering system.  Great length and price on these remnant hoses.
B00004RAGL This was a recommended addition to my purchase of the \"Frigidaire FAD704DWD Energy Star 70-pint Dehumidifier\".  I use a gravity drain to a French Drain in the basement.  The dehumidifier is about 10' from a hole into the drain and this hose did the job nicely.  It comes rolled up and I had to run hot water thru it and then lay it out on the blacktop driveway in the hot sun to get it to lay straight.
B00004RAL9 I used this in the shower because it is a tough brush for skin, but don't use it on sensitive areas because it is a strong wire which can damage the pores of vital areas if you know what I mean.
B00004RAL9 I used this in the shower because it is a tough brush for skin, but don't use it on sensitive areas because it is a strong wire which can damage the pores of vital areas if you know what I mean.
B00004RAL9 Absolutely the best brush I've used.  The brush head doesn't go flat like others I've used and it does a great job at keeping my Weber clean.
B00004RAL9 As grill brushes go, this is pretty nice. The extra-long handle is great for doing a burn-off cleaning, and the metal clip is perfect for cleaning off the cast-iron grills available on the Genesis.Amazon's price is also 50% less than every store I've seen this at (Sears, True Value, etc.), so I may pick up a couple more as spares.
B00004RAL9 I've had the same brush for 4 years now. This brush is great. The wooden handle is sturdy, doesn't heat up, and is long enough that you can clean your grill while it's hot (how I usually do it) My one complaint with it is since there is no angle at the head, you end up putting the brush at an angle (since you can't hold it perpendicular to the grill as that would defeat the point of the 18\" handle) which means only the bristles at the very front get used. My brush has the front brass bristles worn down and full of grill gunk but 2/3rds of the bristles in the back look brand new. If the head of the brush was at an angle to the handle this brush would be way better.That said, it's still a good brush.Be careful though as it seems Amazon is combining the reviews between the version of this brush that has brass bristles with the version with steel bristles.
B00004RAL9 Before, when I went to buy a new brush I would always get the cheapies; I thought they were all the same, except some came in plastic while others came in wood or aluminum. I was wrong. You do get what you pay for when buying a grill brush, so buy this one! The bristles are stiff enough to clean up all the grit, yet soft enough to not damage your grate. The brush feels nice and sturdy, it feels well built. Also, this brush has a handy scraper on the end which is extremely handy with the really tough crusties (on your GRILL silly).
B00004RALJ Bought this specifically for tailgaiting and it was perfect. We made sliders then made hot dogs and it cooked very well. Nothing but the best from weber!
B00004RALJ I bought this grill primarily for when we go camping. This grills is ultraportable and it's a Weber so it will last.priced right with free shipping is a winner in my book!
B00004RALJ There is plenty of grill space to hamburgers, hotdogs, chicken, steaks or shrimp kabobs. Easy to regulate the heat using the vents.  Love that the lid can hang on the grill to block the wind or just rest there while flipping your food....frees both hands!
B00004RALJ We love charcoal, we just do!  This little grill is good for our camper and the bottom feet fold up to hold the top on while in transit.  I love Weber, and this is a winner.
B00004RALJ Bought it for camping and it is perfect.  The legs hold the lid down for transport.  And it has Weber quality construction.  Love it.
B00004RALL For years, I've been using a larger 22\" weber grill, but when I moved recently I decided to get one a bit smaller to conserve charcoal.  After doing quite a bit of research and reading reviews, I decided to go with this Smokey Joe Silver.  It is absolutely unbeatable, and I would have paid double for it without blinking an eye!  While it doesn't have an adjustable-height grilling surface, it's quite easy to properly place the charcoal in such a way that you get exactly the heat you're looking for.  I've been able to sear fish, or slow-cook buffalo wings, just by estimating the charcoal amount and placement.  I should also note that I usually use the lump type charcoal, not briquettes, and both work equally well in this grill.  Cleaning is a breeze, and so far after using it 12+ times since I got it a couple weeks ago, hasn't even come close to needing it.As far as build quality goes, I really like the solid feel of the gr
B00004RALL In my opinion and as well as thousands of other Weber owners, this is a great product. I have had 3 or 4 of these little units that I just leave behind and have never had a problem with one.
B00004RALL Probably the best grill for this price range! Got one for my parents and compares well with my Weber 18\" for grilling! My only nit pick are the legs! You may have to tighten them down from time to time to keep the wobble out! But, back to grilling! This is one nice little unit, burgers and steaks cook up quite nicely! The secret is knowing how to use the upper and lower vents for heat and smoke adjustments! Once you have that down, you can whip up some serious munch with this puppy! Have done some excellent k-bob's and burgers and steaks have come out just as nicely! Have used Webers hickory chips for smoked meats and the flavor was delicious!After each use, clean out ashes and you will have consistant bbq! Put a piece of aluminum foil in the ash pan to catch the ashes! Wrap it up and dispose of neatly. To  help season the upper and lower grills and get rid of that metal taste and smell, I placed the grills in my oven! Preheated to 325 degs. and baked for about an hour! House stunk like hot steel for awhile, but no metal taste, the first time I used this grill!
B00004RALL The grill appears to be of good quality but the assembly instructions don't match the parts that were shipped. The instructions show how to attach the air vent which comes attached with a rivet from the factory. There are more parts than are needed. You can assemble it! but you will be confused. End product is satisfactory. Why do they call it the Smokey Joe Silver when it is black? Poor choice of names.
B00004RALL Ive had this same grill for about 8 years now and its as nice now as the day I got it. Its big enough to cook pretty much whatever you need to cook on it, of course if you have a lot to cook it may take a little longer. Ive always had everything cook very evenly with more than sufficient burn time with coals. This grill is also small enough that you can take it with you for camping or going on your boat for a bbq on the beach (I just use a bungy cord to secure the lid) . If I need to rid of the coals I just put water on them turn the grill upside down and cover the coals in dirt, if the grill is still hot ill throw some more water on it then wipe it down and off we go..This grill isnt heavy so you can easily dump out the ashes in your trash can or where ever with minimal effort. Very great grill for the price and perfect for pretty much anyone!
B00004RALL I bought my first Smokey Joe in 1992.  I am finally replacing him... not because he wore out, but because I tore him apart to use the pieces for something very important.  (It's a long story... Smokey Joe was all I had or I would have been outside all night in my car).  Anyway, I am now replacing my first SJ with another.  I'm quite certain he will be chillin' and grillin' with me for the rest of my life.
B00004RALL The Weber Smokey Joe is a great portable grill as far as cooking quality is concerned but there are a few issues.First the good. You get a decent size grill area for an ultra-portable grill. It measures at 14 1/2 inches in diameter. Sure you probably can't do much with this grill if you are cooking indirect, but that's not what this grill is meant for. The grill cooks much like it's larger cousin - the Weber One-Touch. The porcelain enamel coating helps prevent rust. There's a vent damper on the bottom of the grill (as well as the top) so it's quite easy to control your temperature, much better then any other portable grill I've owned anyways. The ash-catcher works well enough to keep hot pieces of ember from falling to the ground.As I mentioned before, there are a few caveats. My main complaint is that this grill has no lid-lock. This makes transportation a bit cumbersome, especially for a grill that is meant to be portable. You have to buy the Gold or Platinum version to get this functionality. I believe all portable grills should be easy to transport. I use a couple bungee cords to lock my lid down during transportation. Another small issue I had with mine is that one of the legs is a bit shorter then the other two, so my grill doesn't sit as evenly as it should. This isn't a big deal because Weber has great customer service, it's not that big of a deal anyways, it's just a little off. Finally the top grate doesn't fit very tightly so it wobbles around a bit - again a small issue. One other thing I should mention is that even though it has an ash catcher, it doesn't have any sort of One-Touch type of system, so you have to dump it to clean it (the vent damper doesn't quite do it).  This isn't an issue at all for me because it's very light and easy to clean anyways but I thought I would mention that for those that might be curious.All in all this is a great portable grill. For my wife and I this is a great grill to use even when we aren't going anywhere because it needs so little charcoal. Cooking on this grill definitely feels like I'm grilling on a baby version of my One-Touch. There are a few issues that keep this grill from getting a perfect score, but don't let these small issues keep you from buying this great grill. Personally I believe it's worth the $5.00 to go ahead and upgrade to the Gold so you can have the lid-lock, but it's not essential, like I said before a couple bungee cords do the trick if you need that functionality. Happy grilling!
B00004RALL I see some reviews state that this is just a smaller version of the larger kettle grills&#8230; and that&#8217;s not quite true. This one is not portable unless you grab the whole grill&#8230; there&#8217;s no way to pick up the whole unit by the handle. The kettles have a handle and wheels so you can roll it around&#8230;once lit this unit isn&#8217;t going anywhere. Also, there&#8217;s no place to put the lid once it&#8217;s removed&#8230; the kettles have a hook so you can hang the lid right on the kettle but all you can do with this one is lay it on a table or the ground. Other than that&#8230; it&#8217;s a perfect grill for the two of us, it&#8217;s easy to assemble, it&#8217;s built rugged and it&#8217;s easily worth 5-stars. I would have given it 4-stars had I not known beforehand that it cannot be moved with the handle&#8230; when it&#8217;s cold you can just throw a bungee cord on and you&#8217;re good to go.
B00004RALL Hurricane Irene was on its way and our gas grill was DOA. Thank goodness we have Amazon Prime, because I didn't think to order a grill until a few days before the storm; it arrived on Friday.  We lost power early Sunday morning and did not get it back until this Saturday.  There are only three of us, so this was just the right size for us -- you can fit three to four burgers on the grill at a time.  It was simple to put together and very easy to use -- just roll 4 or 5 sheets of newspaper loosely, place them in the bottom of the kettle, put in about 30 briquets in a pyramid shape, light the papers and the charcoal is ready to use in about 20 minutes.  Spread the charcoal out evenly  and place the grill in place and you are ready to go.  There's an instruction booklet included.  It was really a lifesaver this week and will be used regularly from now on.  It's easily portable for camping trips, too.
B00004RALL Am writing this while cooking some chicken on a WSJ i found last week in new condition for a Hamilton. Let me preface my comments by stating that I have a 22-inch Weber with hinged grate that I love.The WSJ is small, somewhat solidly constructed (mine, while unused, has rust rings around the handle welds that go through the cover - not good).However, most folks use this Weber as a portable grill. Weber, for gawd's sakes, incorporate some form of simple mechanism ON ALL MODELS to keep the lid on in order to use the carry handle! (i use a pair of bungees looped every 45 degrees).The stove's best feature, the ability to cook using fewer coals, is also its drawback. This stove is best suited for slow cooking, delicate kebabs, fish, hot dogs, and burgers - not for hot, quick searing and grilling of thick steaks.Other drawbacks are the vents, which do not (at least on my unit) rotate smoothly. And trying to adjust the bottom vent to control air flow will result in your burning the beegeebees out of your fingers - i suggest fireproof mitts handling this stove.Also, being lightweight, this stove can dramatically shift during your cooking session, resulting in the potential for spillage of hot coals - especially if used on a light platform to increase cooking height (cooking on the ground with this thing can be down, but for many folks, may be uncomfortable). I'd suggest at least some holes for securing the stove legs to a platform or a way to weigh down the legs?All in all, this stove is OK - it gets the job done. I like Weber products, even if some of the QC and build quality has gone downhill in the last 10 years.I hope to enjoy my WSJ for as many years as my 18-inch (given away), my 22-inch (8 years going strong), and newest acquistion, the Smokey Joe Silver.
B00004RALL You can tell these are quality grills; otherwise Weber wouldn't give these a 10 year warranty. My 20 year old Smokey Joe recently came to its demise and there was no doubt I'd purchase another. The only difference is they now have a nylon handle instead of a wooden handle. I keep mine outside on a patio 24/7/365 and it weathers the elements without covering it. I also use mine on an old metal wrought-iron table to make for safe grilling. This is the perfect size for 1-3 people.
B00004RALQ Okay, I'm an addict and this is actually my fourth Weber grill...I buy one every four to five years, use it often, treat it poorly, and when it starts to show signs of age, I simply spring for a new one. Until I discovered the Weber, I seldom even got a year out of my grills - so this is quite an improvement for me. The quality of the product, and the results I get, are topnotch, and today, I wouldn't consider any other brand (except maybe a built-in Hastings - but that's another animal altogether).I go back and forth between the 22.5 inch and the 26 inch version. The 26 is more expensive, but it offers quite a bit more cooking area. It also uses quite a bit more charcoal, and to my eyes, it doesn't heat quite as evenly. Instead, I've settled on the 22.5, and on those relatively rare occasions when I need more grilling area, I just run a second grill.One thing I especially like is that Weber is so popular, you can get replacement parts just about anywhere. It's nice to know that if I open the grill in the Springtime and the grates are all rusty, I can zip over to the local hardware store and probably find an exact replacement.This time I went for the blue version, but otherwise it's the same Weber I've come to love. Easy to clean, rugged - and it cooks as well as anything out there. I'm not a fan of gas grills...they simply don't seem to get hot enough for certain uses. But with the Weber and some quality charcoal and you're all set, no matter what's on the menu.Only very small complaint is that I've had some problems with the paint peeling off under the top cover. In the past, once I noticed this happening, I simply scrubbed all the loose paint off with a wire brush...curious to see if this one has the same problem.Really recommended!
B00004RALQ I'm not even sure where to start!  I've wanted to add a charcoal grill to my outdoor cooking fleet for many years just for those few times that I'd like to cook more naturally.  I've used this one 2 times so far and can't believe I've waited this long.  I think it's saved me over $1000 I was going to spend to replace my 10 yr old gas grill.This grill and a couple Weber accessories make charcoal grilling a breeze!  I haven't grilled with charcoal in years and obviously I had cheap junk for grills in the past.The quality of the grill is great, but I expected that.  I can see it lasting years and years as many others have attested to.  I'll easily use it even during the week when I don't have the time I thought it would take and thought gas was easier for.  The first use and trying to get used to charcoal again was almost a failure because I almost choked the heat down keeping the vents closed.  When I realized that the steaks slowed down cooking and the kettle top got wet from condensation it hit me that I had the vents closed thus the fire couldn't breath.  All I had to do was open the vents and 'viola, in no time the heat was back up and going strong with no other help from me, just air.Yesterday I outdid myself with ribs. Although I did cook them a little to high, they were the best I've ever done both falling off the bone and the best flavor I've ever gotten.  I was using Mesquite chips as well but I've done that on a gas grill and cooked twice as long and didn't get near the same results.  It's amazing how the kettle makes all the difference in the world keeping the charcoal hot and lasting a long time.  I'm amazed!Clean up is much easier than I expected.  The ash catcher is awesome, even in high gusty winds.  Access though the grill for adding fuel makes adding briquettes and wood a breeze.Assembly was easy and took less than 20 minutes taking my time.The only con I can come up with was that on the top handle, it came out of the undamaged box with a chip of the porcelain coming off as if it had been hit.  It's small and by the handle and not exposing the metal so it's not a functional problem but with the box arriving in perfect condition, it's obvious it happened before being packed.  However, I'd be surprised if anyone could find it.All I can say is that I'm sold!!  Everything Weber that I've bought, from the grill to the accessories, have been top notch. Charcoal grilling is now a breeze and so much better than gas.  The old saying is absolutely true; having the right tools make all the difference in the world.  The Weber Kettle is absolutely the right tool!!  Being made in the USA is the cherry on top!To address some of the complaints in the lesser ratings:The handles don't get hot.  As hot as mine has been, the handles are easy to hold with bare hands, although I tend to use a mitt around a grill.  The new handles should last in any weather condition and much longer than wood as well.It would be nice to have a temp gauge but that's not hard to add if you really need one.  I can see the benefit but it's limited.The Kettle is not unstable if it's put together right.  If it falls apart after assembling, the legs aren't being secured fully as they should be, which is to tap them all the way in.  Rolling it isn't a problem but like with most anything, you have to be careful.  Depending on which way you roll it, one might be able to knock it over if not careful, but I've not found that to be easy to do.  Standing, it's as stable as can be.  Again, if it's wobbly or falls apart as one has claimed, the legs were not assembled properly.The lid DOES have a hook to hang on the side of the kettle; it's on the underside of the top near the vent.  It hangs nicely on the side of the kettle.
B00004RALQ We have a similar model One Touch Premium home (Germany) and the quality of Weber pays off. I brought the old chinese bbq to trash today ;-).The Weber is very solid build and comes ready to go with drop pans and charcoal holders (wires). Bought a chimney from Weber since the reviews were so good. Tried direct and indirect, keep on training.Will not to back to chinese quality again.Since we live in Northern Germany usage of this bbq is limited to summer time, completed with a Q200 grill.
B00004RALQ Our gas grill finally rusted out after 15 years. I was ready to spend $700 on the 320 but started asking myself why? Grilling outside is for leisure, take your time, relax and enjoy the flavor. So I opted for this Weber One Touch Gold - what I have been missing all these years!This grill is so easy to use. I didn't get the chimney starter, I just place some newspapers under the charcoal and it works just fine. I am usually grilling in about 15 - 20 minutes. The ash collector is fantastic, the ashes don't blow around and it makes it easy to remove the leftover ashes. I got blue, it really looks great. The little hook inside the lid makes it easy to set it aside so you have both hands.This is going to be a great summer - now if we could just get some sun here in the NW!
B00004RALQ Order this blue grill a week ago and got a defect with 2 big black dent on the side on the cover exposing the inside metal. I was a little disappointed. Try to contact Amazon customer service on the web and was amazed that they have a \"please call me\" service. I just typed in my phone number and they call me right away. The return for a replacement is painless and they order a new one for me right away. All I need to do is put the damaged grill in the original box, re-tape it, leave it outside my front door. UPS was here the next day, pick up the box and return to Amazon. That was really easy.I finally receive my new blue grill today. It is perfect and only took me 10 minutes to assemble it. The ash tray needs a little adjustment with a plier and now it is working perfectly. I have ordered a work table and putting it in is a snap.  I also got the smokenator and it fit perfectly inside the grill. Try the cover and it fit perfectly and no gap in between with everything in place. I am a happy camper and ready to do some bbq this weekend.  The blue color looks really nice in my backyard for an extra $10.So do not get despair if you get a defect, just keep returning and you will eventually get a perfect one. It worth the wait.I am glad that I only need to return it one time. On my reasons of return, I mention this grill is defective and should not put back on the shelve and send to other customers. I also contact Weber and let them know about this so they can improve their product quality control in the future before boxing their products and send to the distributor.Hope this help and good luck.
B00004RALQ We ordered this for the FIRST time on February 5, 2010.  My husband was so excited and rushed out to buy charcoal, cleaning brushes, etc.  When we got it and he opened the box we discovered one of the handles was bent, and there was a large section that had no protective paint over it, making us fear it would rust prematurely.  Needless to say we were disappointed.  He boxed it up and I called Amazon, and they were great!  They immediately sent us a return packaging slip, and placed a new order (at upgraded two day shipping no less) for us.  So, once we got all that straightened out and got the second one (which looked great by the way) we unpacked it and looked forward to making the chicken we had prepared.My husband put it together and brought it over to me and I must say, the blue looks a heck of a lot cooler than the basic black!  This is the upgraded model with the reservoir for ashes, and while I don't do a lot of grilling, my husband really appreciated this aspect of the grill.It was easy to put together, and Weber has a wonderful reputation when it comes to grill products.  The chicken we cooked on it came out wonderfully, though we have had a gas grill for the past few years, so the extra time a charcoal grill takes will take some time to get used to.All in all well worth the money.//Update March 2013: Wow. Has it already been over 3 years? I guess it has. This grill is still going strong. We clean it regularly, and keep it covered with one of the standard Weber grill covers. It has no rust and still cooks some great food. The ash catch is an absolute must have with the charcoal grills. Still very pleased with this purchase. Especially seeing as we've had other grills fall apart in little over a year.
B00004RALR I love BBQ. For convenience I have often used a gas grill, but really do love the taste of meat cooked over charcoal (PAH and NCA risks notwithstanding). I have often cooked turkey breasts for Thanksgiving, and particularly love the smokey flavor that comes with it! Alongside baked potatoes and fresh veggies (extra nice on the grill), I have a special meal that is actually healthy.So when my last gas grill bit the dust, we went back to the old fashioned way of cooking! Real charcoal, real delicious smell, real delicious flavor! I suggest that you consider using theWeber 7416 Rapidfire Chimney Starter, so that you can have the purest taste without any chemical oders.A funny thing happened when a dear friend came by to visit ... Her son was entranced by the fact that we didn't have any fuel for our BBQ.  Times change, but old fashioned flavor doesn't. This grill made  the move with us recently and now sits on our new deck waiting for spring, or at least a nice sunny day!
B00004RALR Great Product! Makes it fun and easy to Bar-B-Que.I have a Weber Gas Grill and use it all the time. However when I want that real charcoal flavor nothing beats this Weber Grill. The ashes just fall into the bottom for easy removal.A great product and reasonably priced.
B00004RALR the grill is fine, but what i was really hoping was the clean up of the ashes was actually \"one touch\".  perhaps you can get used to it, but removing and re-attaching the ash-catcher is a bit of a pain.  there are much better ways to design an ash catcher that would be easy to remove and re-attach. oh well...hopefully weber will spend some money on a re-design for the ash catcher in future models.
B00004RALR This is my second Weber...the first lasting me about 7 years. We like charcoal (instead of gas) and the Weber is a wonderful all-around grill.
B00004RALR When it came time for us to get a new charcoal grill I searched every site and checked out dozens of different grills, some costing many hundreds of dollars, all promising some advantage.Some units were really interesting, and not too expensive, but upon close inspection many of these proved to be tinny and cheaply made. The very expensive systems were very nice, but did not offer rotisseries and other useful accessories and were just too expensive for us anyway.So, we ended up with another Weber, the Gold Model. In the many years since our last Weber, there have been a lot of improvements that kept it attractive. The ash catcher really does make cleanup much easier and the vent system is more functional. The grill itself has the new flip-up hatches that allow you to add more coals and move them around without having to lift up the grill. I did that all the time with the old grill.The optional little bent-wire style of charcoal retainers do help to keep the coals out to the side when you want to use a drip pan in the center.Others have recommended the chimney style charcoal start for ecological reasons. It is also just plain faster to use as well, and it is made of heavy gauge metal that is both attractive and long-lasting.I love the optional rotisserie (see those reviews) and it comes with an extension ring that is also useful for other cooking options.We got the green colored kettle and it looks very nice on the patio. The general design and those odd white-wall tires give it a kind of vintage look.This is a well-made and very functional grill with all sorts of interesting available accessories that really work well. There is a reason for the popularity of the Weber. I looked, I bought. Hard to beat................Update 7/2012. Still good, used daily all summer and even in the rain under my porch cover. Something I came up with that could be interesting to the more dedicated user. I essentially bought a downed oak tree and have been splitting it for firewood for next winter. Had a lot of small, crooked, knotty, twisted pieces that couldn't easily be split. I cut them up into 1\" cubes on a band saw, hoping to use them as briquettes in the Weber. A newspaper sprinkled with cooking oil got them started in the Weber chimney starter quite quickly. The secret is to be a bit patient so that they stop flaming and turn to glowing coals. And then you have a genuine oak BBQ, just like on a ranch. Very good, but a lot of work and dangerous enough even on a band saw. And it messes up the blade and rollers. The other more accessible method would be to simply start an oak campfire in the Weber, using regular old pieces of oak like you would in a fireplace. It would take some time to burn down to coals, but even more of an excuse to drink too much and then burn the food because....well, everyone has done this. Right? Anyway, flaming oak imparts a kind of bitter taste while glowing oak coals make it delicious. I do this research for you.__________________________Update 2, on cooking an expensive steak. This works and requires no skill. I went out and bought the most expensive steak ever, an organic, grass fed, free range whatever ribeye at a boutique market and the attractive butcher girl probably had her thumb on the digital scale besides. I about died when I saw the price. Hmmm, can't afford to cook this any way but perfectly.I once saw a YouTube video on how to properly cook a steak using high heat and this is my BBQ grill interpretation of that.Use the coal retainers to block off a section of the lower grill and fill up that smaller portion with lots of hot coals. It cannot be too hot in this case.Put on the cooking grill and let the previous session's grease flame off, which of course also heats it up hotly and is somewhat entertaining and makes you feel guilty about what you are eating...Put on the steak. Having those long tongs helps a lot. You can rub it with olive oil if you want, but it is unclear to me if that is necessary and it causes more flame-ups. No BBQ sauce though. Lid off! Deal with the flame-ups by maneuvering the steak around. Some people use a water spray. This is hands-on, attentive work.Stand by. It will cook fast. Have your other food well under way. Within minutes the down side will have that crust of goodness, short of burnt of course. Turn it over and do the other side. When that side is seared, remove the steak and insert a digital cooking thermometer, taking care to place it in the very center, from the side (not stabbed in from the top).  I use a Polder and the line from the sensor to the display seems to hold up in high heat, but don't string it out over the coals. Run it out the back. Set the alarm for 130.Put the steak back over the un-coaled area. The effect now is that this is a very hot oven, not a grill. Put on the lid, make sure all vents are open. Watch the temp rise, amazingly fast so don't wander off.Remove the steak, with tongs, to a plate and cover it with aluminum foil, resting it as they say on cooking shows. By the time everything else is served up, maybe 10 minutes or so, it should be ready to serve.This gives you a steak that looks exactly like the ones in advertisements, medium rare with a great crust.  You can throw it back on and in a couple of minutes the temp and doneness will go up. There is no shame in putting food back on the fire, but there is shame in over-cooking it! If you paid the big bucks for your meat, burning it will make you cry.BTW, this works for other meat like thick cut pork chops (thick ones are easier to cook properly). Use the same method, but run the temp up to 140-145 (145 being the new govt standard, and in fact it is the standard for all meat other than poultry. If you were brought up on thin, over-cooked pork chops (we all were) you have a revelation coming. Chicken parts don't require the high heat, but a quick sear and off the the oven part works very well for them.It is suggested that the steak be served with salt and pepper, applied after it is cooked as it may be a bad idea to subject the salt and pepper to high heat. The more expensive the meat, the less you should put on it. Cooks always suggest kosher salt and it is indeed very good for this, and ground pepper is better as well. I really think BBQ sauce is too much for expensive beef, but if you want to fancy it up, slowly heat up some butter and garlic and let it meld together. Strain it and serve it on the side, or simply pour it on. What the heck, you have already gone well over the fat grams or whatever for the month anyway...If you have to cook more than maybe 3 or 4 large steaks, you could fill the entire bowl with coals and then finalize them in the kitchen oven set very high, like 450, and with the temp probe stuck in the most representative steak. This gives you 90% of the grilling experience and taste.
B00004RALR I have used a number of different charcoal grills, and the Weber Gold is the best.  Unless you want to spend twice the price and buy the Weber Performer, which is a Weber Gold with gas ignition, table, and a place to store charcoal. Not sure why you would want to store charcoal outside where it can absorb moisture, but that is another story.First off the Weber is made with a thicker steel, so it retains the heat better than the cheaper, lighter, offshore made products.  The grill is heavier, so you can get more than one season out of it.  The ash catcher is great.  Its a must have feature.  Other units get ashes all over my deck, which is unacceptable, and a fire hazard on windy days.My Weber Gold is about 10 years old.  I replaced the cooking grate once.  It still functions perfectly.  It lives outside and only has one tiny spot of rust, where the cover got hit with a rock and it chipped the paint.  One day I will get around to sanding and painting that spot so it lasts another 10 years.  The aluminum portions of the grill are a little weathered, but still function perfectly.  I guess if I really wanted to I could polish them up, but a little oxidation does not bother me.The only downside I can even think about is the top handle.  It is plastic, not wood.  Sometimes it gets too hot to handle so I have to use a potholder if I am cooking at a very high temperature.  Other than that, it is the best charcoal grill on the planet.Sure you can buy one cheaper, but they will not last.  Buy a Weber and you will leave it to your children when you die.  And they will get many years of use out of it too!
B00004RALR This grill works great. I love the one touch ash disposal feature. Have purchased the Rotisserie attachment also, and I LOVE what these two peices of equipment do to my Roasting Chicken!!  It will Rotisserie a small Turkey also, leaving it so jucy and tender. Will be using this for many years to come.
B00004RALR I had alwayws wanted to get a barbeque grill ever since we bought our home last year. I had been debating between 751001 and 741001 for quite some time, finally decided to go with this one for its ash catcher and it turned out to be a wise decision. Installation of the grill was fairly easy even for me. We had three families of visitors when we tried it the 1st time, we cooked a lot of meat, pepper, corn and etc, it was awesome. We have used it three times already within the 1st 10 days after we received it, it's gonna get a lot more use this summer.
B00004RALR You can grill/ bbq/ smoke just about anything shy of a half a large animal on this. Im glad I went with the 22.5. Will move up to the 26 later when needed. There are so many things you can do with this when adding other attachments (smokenator, rotisserie, pizza oven, iron grates, wok, skillet, the list goes on).
B00004RALR This BBQ grill lives up to everything written about it and the quality is quite good. The new feature of detachable ash catcher is definitely worth having. This grill cooks burgers and steaks to perfection, once you get accustomed to how to arrange the live coals (using more or less heat, etc). I would recommend this grill for anyone wanting an excellent charcoal grill.
B00004RALR Setup was easy on this grill after I realized that I will have to scrape the tabs of the ash catcher ring down the small leg posts. At first I did not like the idea of scraping my nice new grill, which is why I temporarily stumbled on the instructions. They pop in nicely once you get past this. The 3rd leg kind of twirls on which is quite obvious once you start fiddling with it but the instructions have no words so the pictures are not as self-explaintory as I would have hoped in these 2 areas.My only complaints on this grill are the legs and the handle. The legs were wobbly and not as secure as I would have liked them and they were installed all the way to the base of the grill (as the picture showed)  some nuts and bolts would have went far in this area.The handle gets to hot to handle with bare hands. especially when doing large meats like roasts or whole chickens. Wood would have fixed this problem. I wrapped mine with some small rope (not string) and it helped a little.All said and done it's a great grill. Get it.FYI-The Weber 87886 Chimney Starter is incredible and it's only 12 bucks. Get that too.Weber 87886 Chimney Starter
B00004RALR This grill is wonderful!  It cooks really evenly and the lid can hang on the side of the grill while tending to the food.  The hinged grate is great for adding wood chips for flavor.  The ash catcher makes for easy cleaning of the ashes and is worth the few extra bucks.  Our grill arrived in perfect shape and was very easy to assemble.  We use it almost every night.  This grill is sturdy and heats evenly and has the Weber name behind it.  We expect to be using it for many years.
B00004RALR Easy to assemble, though I will admit that one of the wheels keeps popping off the side when i roll it around my patio.  But then again, i rarely have to move the grill so it's not like it's a big deal.  The grill is large and easy to clean and the thing that stands out most with this grill is the ash-catching compartment on the bottom.  Plus my steaks taste way better using this thing compared to my previous grill which used propane
B00004RALR I purchased this grill, but I was surprised at how much I enjoyed cooking on it.  With the chimney starter, it is almost as fast to get this grill ready to cook as it is to get a gas grill ready - and you should let your meat set out for about 20 minutes before you grill, so you really haven't lost that much time.The ash catcher is a great feature and don't forget to get the rotisserie attachment.  You haven't had turkey for thanksgiving until you've had a rotisserie turkey!Real Men cook with charcoal and wood and this is the best grill I've ever owned.
B00004RALR I bought this for the simplicity of clean up.  I wish the kettle had an adjustable coal grate to lower or make higher the direct heat.  It takes a while to get it just right with the right amount coal.  
B00004RALR This is the best charcoal grill I have ever owned. I have cooked ribs at 225-250 and been able to control the fire easily. I used the 2-2-1 method on a rack of baby backs and never had to think about adding charcoal over 5 hours. By using the vents you can get wood chips to smolder for an hour and not flare up and burn away in minutes.  The ash pan holds at least three cooks worth of ashes and does not leak.  I feel comfortable cooking on my wooden deck because of the ash pan. The only addition i would make is the Craycort cast iron grate.
B00004RALR This grill performed as advertized in the reviews here.  Assembly is easy and takes less than a half hour.  The cooking time is longer than other charcoal grills, but is more uniform because of the ceramic cauldron reflective characteristics.  I also bought the stainless steel tools and the tool holder.  The latter ships separately from another company and the shipping/handling is about twice as much as the tool holder.
B00004RALR ridiculous pricing on these new Webers... where once you could get a 22\" model for less than $70, the company now charges (and never discounts) upwards of $100 or morehave to agree with other reviewers about:bad quality control -  issues with the the charcoal grate not fitting the four-point resting tongues - sloppily sizedpoor material choices - older models had really nice hardwood handles, but the newer models have the molded plastic crapola handles...loose 
B00004RALU That title was sarcasm, in case you missed it.When we bought a house almost fourteen years ago, I brought along a Weber Smokey Joe grill I had used when I was single.  We used it for the first several months of our marriage as our only grill.  Then we bought a Weber 22 1/2 inch kettle grill for our new backyard.  We have used it regularly ever since.  It works for indirect cooking of roasts and chickens, it works for direct grilling burgers, chops and sausages, it works for roasting chiles and it works as a fire pit to burn hardwood logs to fuel my large offset firebox smoker.  This grill has been out in the weather without a cover for 13 years or so and it has held up beyond reasonable expectations.  Only within the past few months has the use, age and abuse begun to take a toll.  There are several spots where the porcelain has worn away that are rusting through or already have rusted through.  The wooden handles dry rotted away.  The nuts holding the aluminum airflow disc adjusters at the bottom of the kettle rusted off.  And I'm still using it.  I did a steak and some pork chops last night, using lump charcoal and pecan hardwood chunks I chopped up myself.  They were delicious.I also have a gas grill that is convenient but does not even come close to giving the good taste you can get from charcoal and wood fuel.  Trying to use a smoker box on a gas grill is futile for me.  You can't adjust the airflow through a gas grill.  The only adjustment is the level of the flame.  I constantly find the wood chips either just burn up quickly without producing much smoke or they never heat up enough to start smoking at all.  The gas grill doesn't get much use at my house.I also use an offset firebox smoker.  It's great for doing large size pieces of meat or poultry or multiple pieces of smaller items.  It does require frequent attention to keep the fire going and the temperature within the proper range.  Honestly, the Weber grills can do the same or better job for smaller cuts of meat by cooking indirect.  About the only time I use the smoker is when I have something too large for the Weber.It's time retire the old Weber.  I've already put a One-Touch Gold on my Amazon wishlist.  I think I'll use the old grill as a planter.  I can't imagine throwing it away after all these years.
B00004RALU We had a gas grill for years but opted to go back to a charcoal grill.  This Weber grill made our decision easy.  Outstanding medium size grill for the two of us grilling several items and works well for 4 or more depending on what you need to prepare on the grill.  Suggest using the Weber Rapidfire Chiminey for starting your briquets...it's great and makes your job not only easier but the food taste better without the use of starter fluid.  Great grill....great name behind it!!
B00004RALU After our gas grill had to be retired, we decided to get a charcoal grill.  Weber has a reputation for having a solid product that will last for many years, and I have no doubt that we'll be using this for a long time.  But the legs seem to be made out of somewhat cheaper material than what we had when I was younger. Think I'll be getting the cover to protect it over the winter.This particular model doesn't have the one-touch ash catcher and after using this a few times, I'm kind of sorry we didn't go with that particular model.One person can put it together without help, athough it can be a struggle for a bit.Grilling?  Well that's exactly like you'd expect although I miss having a grated shelf to keep some items a little further from the charcoal.  That just requires a difference in how you mound the briskets.
B00004RALU Great grill that cooks just like a Weber!  Whoever changed the handles from wood to nylon should be fired though... they have obviously never grilled before.  This handle gets HOT!!!  Who wants to put a glove on just to open a grill... this isn't the smartest move unless Weber is attempting to save trees (but they should remember where charcoal comes from).  I won't buy another Weber if it has these cheap handles.
B00004RALU I wish I'd bought one of these the day I first moved out on my own! For years I got by with a ridiculously tiny hibachi -- one day I found myself living in the suburbs and somehow rationalized BUYING A REAL BARBECUE! Due to my dyed-in-the-wool cheapness and extensive researching before buying, it was inevitable that I'd end up with a Weber 22.5\" Silver Kettle Grill!YES the little tray on the bottom end is a pain in the neck. But I can't say it's really ever bothered me ALL that much! You'll want to use a charcoal chimney to light your coals -- I used to build a little fire with newspaper and sticks but the charcoal chimney is the way to go, and one chimney will nicely fill the coal area on the Silver Kettle Grill. Do not ever use lighter fluid or fuel-soaked coals. But you already know that.While you'll get the hang of burgers, hot dogs, steaks, chicken and bratwurst right away, make sure to investigate \"indirect grilling\" where you pile your coals on one side or the other (or both) and put an aluminum tray under whatever you're grilling. Like a pork roast or a whole chicken. The 22.5\" Silver Kettle Grill has AMPLE room for everything you'd like to do. Including grilling a turkey! Easy to do plus incredible flavor!I recently acquired a \"slide-aside\" cradle for the lid which I like a lot,  and a clip-on tool holder, which is really handy. We use the grill several times a week. I've never found it lacking. There are a few techniques you'll pick up to turn out just what you like, such as brining chicken or pork prior to cooking. You really do not have to spend more than this to get an excellent tool which you'll use for years and years to come. Get this larger size, but don't spend more on non-essentials. It's a zen thing. In place of a statue of Buddha, we suburbanites have Weber Kettle Grills in our backyard. Grilling harkens back to caveman days, satisfying something very deep in every red-blooded American -- meat good. fire good. Weber good.Order the hinged lid grate for this size grill -- it's a neat thing to have when you need it. And make sure to try grilled pizza dough -- it doesn't ooze through the grate like you'd think it would and the flavor is incredible.The perfect shape of the Weber Kettle Grill makes operation just about foolproof. Improvise an improved ash catcher underneath (like a big metal bucket!) and you're in business. GREAT product! This is not a frivolous purchase, you NEED one of these!
B00004RALU So, I thought after fiddling with offset grills and barrel grills, it's time to try a kettle grill after all the hoopla from the UPS driver delivering all my other toys.  Well folks, it's worth it.  I had to get a covered grill that wasn't as big as my car for the front porch, after all the hollering by neighbors who saw the smoke billowing from my hibachi.  After all the charcoal experimenting with my barrel grill and its cousins and a Bodum  Fyrkat, I figured, what's new?  Well, a whole lot.  While related to the Bodum, the Weber is a whole lot more versatile, and can, if you wish create a range of flavors and textures.  While the one-touch system was touted as a handy cleaning device, where it really excells is as a controllable oxygen source.  Couple that nicety with movement of the 4-hole vent in the lid and  you control both the intensity of the heated charcoals with directionality.  When you're using indirect heat, the control of the temps lay with the oxygen adjustment, whilst the direction of the heat can determine the moistness as well as the degree of charring of the food.  The heavy steel as well as the brilliantly designed cooking grate that facilitates access to the coals make for a fun time at the cookery.  The Weber is iconic; it deserves that status.
B00004RALU My original Weber is 15 years old and still going strong. Replaced some of the inner parts due to age/exposure. No need for a protective cover, this grill is built to last.  Got this one for a lake house. No need to change from the strong horse.
B00004RALU There are a lot of reviews on this already.  It is definatley a 5 star review.  I have had quite a few different weber products over the years, and this is just one more.  I love the one touch clean out on the bottom of the grill, that is also the vent cover.  The old kettles had a bottom vent that was just like the vent on top.  That little tab would get warmer than you want to touch with your bare fingers.  The new one has a handle that doesn't get too hot to handle.  The vents open easily, and move around the ashes in the bottom, and push them out the vent holes.Just one little piece of advice.  When you are installing the legs, pay attention to which leg goes where.  The one that is different goes in the hole right under the handle.  I hasve both seen and owned grills that have the wrong leg in the wrong hole, and that makes the handle on the side, intstead of the front. It is an easy fix, but easier to pay attention the first time.
B00004RALU I love this Weber One Touch Silver kettle. Seeing the kettles my relatives have, but made years earlier, i am pleased that years later, it still seems to be made with high quality steel, a good enamel and tight engineering. The handles have gone from wood to a resin, but they work well. Grilling or smoking, this unit has proven itself worth the money.I wrestled between buying the Silver or the Gold model, but what swayed me was that on Weber's site, the Silver shows \"Made in USA\" while the Gold does not. The reviewers for the Gold, here on Amazon, state that the box says \"Assembled in USA\", or something like that. The Weber site has no mention of any of it. I decided to avoid the issues that some with the Gold were reporting and I went with the Silver. It is very solid and I am glad I did.
B00004RALU This grill has one major flaw.....surprised it is still being sold due to product liability. The utterly inadequate ash/ember pan allows a mild breeze to blow the ash and embers out onto flamable surfaces...like your deck, your pine straw, or house. For an extra 50 bucks you can get an upgraded model that has an enclosed ash/ember containment system. If you live in areas prone to dryness or wildfires, you could be taking a big chance with this unsafe grill. I love the way a Weber cooks, but this model is needlessly risky.  And if you have one of these grills,  take precautions like putting a metal bucket under this grill. A paint can works nicely and you can buy clean empty paint cans at Lowes. This will help reduce the fire risk and will keep ash from blowing around wildly.....it also makes getting rid of ash an easy task. If you value the property you live in, or think you owe your neighbors some due diligence, avoid this flame thrower.
B00004RALU I had a Weber Kettle grill 20 years ago.  I had no clue what I was doing, but I still got great results.  Open the vents, put on the dome, and a little while later I had great food.  But I got tired of waiting for charcoal to heat up, and went on to propane.  I never got good results with gas.  After wasting way too many years destroying food on gas grills, I came home to charcoal and Weber.  This time around I know what I'm doing, and the Weber is giving me Fantastic results.  The 22 1/2 kettle is a great all around cooker.  It grills, sears, bakes and does a very good job of \"low and slow\" smoking.  If you only have the room or desire for one cooker, get this one without hesitation.  It won't smoke quite as good as a real smoker, but unless you're a perfectionist, you'll never know the differance.  The 18 inch grill is a great cooker too, but because it's smaller it's harder to smoke on it.  So if you have the room, get this model.  The lid and bowls are built like a tank.  I found the unit wiggles around where the legs attach, even though I assembled it correctly.  The older ones don't wiggle.  But that's progress.  I don't think it's a problem though, just an observation.  I was torn between 4-5 stars because of that.  They have been building these forever, so assesories and replacement parts can be had easily.Built solid, mutliple uses, food tastes great, easy to use.  Not much else to say.
B00004RALU Alright,I am one that loves to grill, but doesn't know anything about grills themselves, really. Due to monetary situations I had to grill on the cheapest possible grill... The green Sunbeam camper grill. I'm sure you know what grill I'm talkin' about. For over 6 years it has been my grill of choice (hey it was only $10!) and has treated me well. Over these years I always dreamed about owning a \"real\" charcoal grill. I wanted the American icon, I wanted the Weber One-Touch. I heard all about how durable and well built it was, how it will last for 10 years+ and how it's just a step above the rest. After actually purchasing this grill I have a bit of buyers remorse. You see, before actually buying this I was looking at a grill from Char-Broil. It had the ash catching pan like the One-Touch gold, it had space to put plates and such (sorta like the One-Touch Platinum) and it had grates with adjustable height, not to mention all of this came at a price just $5 higher then the One-Touch Silver! Anyways, for the last 2 years I wanted nothing more then the Weber so I got it. Once I started puting it together I realized that this grill just doesn't seem to have $80 worth of craftsmanship. The legs are super-flimsy hollow aluminum pipes, very cheap. The itsy bitsy tabs that hold the bottom grate are slightly uneven so my bottom grate is a bit wobbly (also it's possible for the bottom grate to fall because the tabs are pretty small). A wobbly bottom grate probably doesn't make a lick of difference when it comes to grilling, it's just that it wasn't right, it's just one of those little annoying quirks. I guess I expected everything to be heavy duty. I expected solid metal legs and such. You can find an identical grill from Char-Broil for less then half the cost! I hear that Weber is a step above because they are built to last... well my cheap $10 Sunbeam is 6+ years old and I've never had any problems with it, it's all about how you take care of it. Personally, I think for the $80 price tag of the One-Touch silver, you should at least get the hinged cooking grate, but you don't.There are good things however. First, it's just nice to have the American icon. There is a certain feeling that comes with grillin' on the good ol' Weber kettle. There are a TON of accessories made for it and replacement parts are extremely easy to find. The one-touch system is pretty handy (although hardly one-touch).Overall I am still happy with the purchase, I love looking at that grill. It's probably gonna grown on me more and more as years pass by. Based on price I decided to get the Silver version, but the Gold might be worth looking at. Afterall you get a much better ash-pan (I modified my silver to be just as good though... just a little creativity should do the trick) and you get the hinged grate with the gold (although you can just buy this grate for $15-$20 and stick it on your Silver if you wanna)Choose... but choose wisely.YEAR UPDATE-----------------------------------------------------Okay, now it's been over a year since I posted my original review. This really is a great grill, I wish I could bump the stars up to 4, but I can't... Amazon wont let me. Some of the minor quams I said previously still apply, but this baby cooks a mean dish! I have abused mine for a year and it runs like brand new.What really made me do this update was when I grilled on a buddy's kettle. It wasn't a weber kettle and it shows. After a year of using this I got to know this grill really well, I got used to such high quality materials. This grill really is above and beyond most other kettle style grills.I do wish I would have purchased the gold though. The ash pan that comes with the silver is not much use if you're grilling in any sort of wind.
B00004RALU I love this grill. This is one of my four weber kettle grills I own.Assembly is a snap. The only tool you'll need is a hammer to tap the wheel lugs on. In 15 minutes you can be lighting your coal.The beauty of this grill is the kettle design which maximizes heat retention and allows the grill to act like an oven with the top on. I've cooked whole chickens, cabbage, bread, and pizza using this method. The top also has a hook on it so you can hang it from the side of the grill while you add sauce or tend to what you're cooking.For best results at indirect cooking, use the hinged 22 1/2 inch grate.  That way you can add coals throughout the cooking process without the danger of having to totally remove the cooking grate.
B00004RALU First the good. I love the looks of this grill. It is sleek, styling and iconic and I enjoy seeing it on my porch.- It is much more attractive than one of those monstrous gas grills.- It seals very tightly.- Its simple style allows you to cook many different meats in many different ways.- There are so many accessories available for it and they are easy to find.Now the bad. Besides the black metal kettle part, everything else seems to be of terribly cheap quality and not what I would expect in this price range.- The legs and bottom frame are made of shockingly thin and weak metal. I wouldn't buy my kids toys with such cheap trashy metal.- The wheels are made of cheap hard hollow one-sided plastic. Again, I would not buy a children's toy with such cheap wheels.- The side handle melted during the first use when we hung the lid from it while cooking.Let's face it. This is a lot of money for a basic charcoal grill. You are paying for quality and looks. I gave it four stars only on the merit that there simply isn't a viable competitor right now. If there were other options it would not have fared so well. I feel like Weber has taken advantage of their good name and market share and is allowing their quality to suffer.Shockingly, I would buy it again.
B00004RALW Bought this small Weber for use by my wife and me since our kids are all grown up nowadays.Easy to assemble, Weber quality as expected. We also bought the cover and are pleased with both.Cooking surface is not large; but, can easily accommodate three steaks and a couple of veggie skewers.
B00004RALW I've had the 18.5 Weber kettle for about 5 years and have been very happy with it. However, anyone shopping for a grill should consider the full-size, 22.5 grill.We bought the 18.5 because our family is small and I figured this would be plenty big enough. What I didn't consider was that a larger grill will give you lots of additional options for indirect cooking and smoking. The 18.5 just doesn't have the space, even for a small family. If you only want to cook burgers and hot dogs for 3 to 4 people, the 18.5 will serve fine but you won't have much versatility.Now that I've \"grown\" as a griller, I wish I had the One-touch Platinum. This model gives extra space, an ash catcher, temp gauge, sliding lid and 2 side tables. However, my 18.5 is still going strong after 5 years of steady use and sitting in the elements. Kinda difficult to justify the new grill when the old one is still in great shape.
B00004RALW Can't beat Weber Grill's for sturdy build and ease of use. Perfect for small get togethers or smaller households. Would recommend easy start charcoal or get a charcoal starter that weber sells and pour the coals in when ready. Charcoal grate is of a very heavy guage and should last for years as well as the cooking grill its self. Some nice accessories to go with this unit:, IE: Heavy Duty Grill cover, Tool Rack, Cutting Board, Bracket for holding lid to name a few. I really enjoy steaks and burgers on this weber! One of the best grills I've ever owned for a evenly grilled and tender sirloin steak! Learning how to use upper and lower vents makes all the difference! Using the direct and indirect methods I grilled/smoked a sirloin tip roast that came out superb with a nice even bark and the mouth watering taste of hickory smoke and a light coating of bbq sauce! Going for ribs next...After reading many reviews on Weber grills, some complain of the ashes clogging the lower vents....duh...clean the thing out after each use! Thats what the ash pan is for...no brainer!!!!
B00004RALW I got this in addition to my Weber Genesis Platinum Grill. I love my Charcoal grill especially for those times when I want Steak, Burgers, Chicken, BBQ Chicken, for a great authentic taste. It heats quickly (Weber Chimney) about 20 minutes. It is easy to assemble, very sturdy and quite stable. Some reviewers noted they could not move with hot coals and food as it only has one handle. You should never move a hot grill of any kind. It should be used in a safe place away from combustable materials. The Weber Silver Kettle Grill is terrific and I use it almost regularly and in combination with my gas grill for a complete cooking experience outdoors. (I also have a smoker for the real low and slow cooking). The 18 1/2 inch cooking surface is excellent, and 2 zone and 3 zone is possible by adjusting the number of coals used and position. I did 2 zone cooking and all worked extremely well.
B00004RALW I love this grill.  This is one of my four weber kettle grills I own.Assembly is a snap.  The only tool you'll need is a hammer to tap the wheel lugs on.

I've cooked whole chickens, cabbage, bread, and pizza using this method.  The top also has a hook on it so you can hang it from the side of the grill while you add sauce or tend to what you're cooking.My only complaint about this is its size.  Its great for direct cooking steaks, chops, etc.  But to do some more long term smoking of ribs, whole chickens, its a little small because the coals get too close to the sides of the food and some parts might get scorched.  If you do a lot of slow, indirect cooked foods, go for the 22 1/2 inch weber kettle grill.
B00004RALW After owning a couple of those flimsy &#34;bargain&#34; grills, I finally got serious and bought a Weber!  This 18-1/2-inc size is perfect for a few hamburgers or steaks.  The construction is first-rate, and there is no wobbling or flexing when it is moved about.  I suggest making your purchase complete by getting a Weber charcoal starter chimney (go ahead and get the larger size).
B00004RAMT What's in the box?Just the trapWarning:  you need to check with local laws and ordinances with respect to trapping specific animals.  My locale allows year round trapping and disposal.  Bear in mind, some areas do not allow transfer of animals from one location to another to limit spread of disease.SetupDepending upon what you're trying to catch, you place the appropriate bait distal to the lever in the compartment of trap.  I am catching raccoons, and they enjoy, fish, crispy bacon, nuts and marshmallows.  The trap is a little tricky to set up.  Lift the metal gate and secure a small latch that connects to a slot in the door.I have a recommendation with regards to placement.  Because the floor is open, I recommend placing this on a piece of cement or plywood.  It will keep you from having to dig out a lot of dirt, which I have done.The trap is durable and will keep your critter secure.ConclusionI caught my first raccoon on the first night.  Worked like a charm.Highly recommend.
B00004RAMT easy to set up but they got the apple and didn't stick around to say thanks for the snack.  maybe next time
B00004RAMT I caught over 18 rabbits, 1 squirrel and 1 feral cat with this trap within the first month of its use. The trap is well constructed and holds up to heavy abuse by the trapped animals. The only reason I gave it 4/5 is that it takes two hands to open the trap. If I ever catch a skunk I am going to be in for a stinky experience. It would be nice if this trap had a quick release mechanism that could be operated from a little distance and a long pole of some sort.
B00004RAMT I caught five raccoons in six days of having the trap set. Sometimes the raccoon turns the trap over after he is trapped but it doesn't open. The carrying handle and shield came off with the second raccoon. I used a needle-nose pliers to wrap the shield flange around the wires of the trap and now it stays on securely. I also used the pliers to tighten the wires that hold the carrying handle on. Subsonic .22 caliber bullets can humanely eliminate the raccoon without a lot of noise. Marshmallows make good bait. Something fishy will catch raccoons but it can also catch cats and opossums, which I am not trying to reduce.
B00004RAMT I did not have to make any adjustments either to the trigger or trigger arm.  Just be sure the cage is completely level and the trigger arm nor the door is rubbing up against anything to obstruct or slow down the releasing of the trap door.However, ground squirrels are clever little critters.  Most times you come out and see the door sprung and the food gone is because they tried getting the food out the other end of the cage through the wire - and they can do that.  I cut a piece of OSB to completely cover the other end of the outside of the cage and tied it on with wire. The first time I used heavy cardboard - they ripped it to shreds to get to the food. Then all you have to do is upend the cage - drop something covered with peanut butter in (I use graham crackers)- it will stick to the wire and OSB (also slowing down the squirrel just enough to trip the pan).  Use a little stick if you have to, to mash it to the wire and OSB.  Another good bait are apple strips.  These are made with apple peelers that have the little crank.  The whole apple peel comes off in one strip.  This also slows down the squirrel and the apple peel will cover part of the pan.  Bigger items like this are more successful than small ones.It was more work taking the critters away and releasing them that catching them.This is a perfect size to catch ground squirrels - the size down is a bit small - this one has more room they have to cover to trip the pan - in other words they can't just dangle half their body in, grab the food and leave without getting near the pan.
B00004RAMT Using peanut butter and marshmallows in a papercup as bait I have trapped and transported 4 out of a family of 5 raccoon away from my Koi pond.  I take them 8 miles away and release them near a small river.  Only one left is one of the teenagers, I'll probably get them next week.  If I had hired a &#34;critter getter&#34; to trap them, they would have killed them which I didn't want.Easy to set, easy to pick up without exposing yourself to the animal inside.  I like the way it opens, I cover the trap with a towel so they can't see me and just pop the door up.  The minute they see the opening, they are gone.If you are going to transport them remember that it is against the law in some areas.  Also recommend that you put some wood underneath the cage in your car to protect your interior.  Anything they can reach they will try to use to claw their way out.
B00004RAMT I do catch, spay, release for cats.  currently I use a low priced trap that has literally fallen apart as various spot welds have failed.  this Havahart is simply better made.  only time will tell if all the pieces stay together.
B00004RAMT I had to look up the dimensions of this particular trap since the description lacks that information.  It's 32\"x10\"x12\"Works well for our needs:  Feral cat Trap, Spay, Release with the Humane Society
B00004RAMT Over the summer, I was constantly noticing piled mulch in my beds and every time I would go to flatten it back out I would find a cat poop covered up; not only a pain to clean up but also a health hazard too.  After checking the security tapes I found it was a feral cat problem we had.  I found this trap on Amazon and saw a good majority of the reviews were favorable and decided to give it a try.  Setup out of the box was a little confusing at first but the kit is mostly assembled out of the box.  The only parts you have to assemble are the pole from the step that triggers the door to a hook on the door and to secure the back of the cage closed.  It was a bit of a challenge to get the pole from the step to the door to line up but it seemed so simple after getting it together.This trap is very durable.  Solidly constructed, pre-assembly out of the box was a positive.  The first night I set up the trap with a small paper plate of a little bit of wet cat food.  I checked on the trap after a couple hours and had caught my first feral cat.  I transferred it to a different cage to take to the shelter the next day and set the trap up again.  All told over about a week I had caught nearly 8 feral cats, I couldn't believe there were that many in my neighborhood.  What is great about this trap is the assembly of the door, easy to open and release the animal should you be looking to relocate an animal such as opossum's or groundhogs.  The best thing you can do is to cover the trap with an old towel.  Not only will it help protect you from clawing animals but I found that it helped to calm the animal and also kept the trapped animal from giving away what the trap really is to other animals.For the price, this is a really durable animal trap and I have been satisfied to own it.  I've even lent it to a few friends and they have told me they had great results capturing their troublesome creatures of the night.  The best part is the unit can be easily broken down to store flat against the wall, and can pop back together quite quickly when you need it.
B00004RAMT We needed a trap to catch a skunk raiding the chicken house.  It worked as expected, although I did not enjoy having to get close to the skunk once caught. Not the fault of the trap though.
B00004RAMT Had a possum.  Put this out with some dog food and caught it in less than 3 hours.  I had an animal guy come out, couldnt catch the possum and try and charge me $500.  Way easier, cheaper and faster
B00004RAMT This works well, but be sure not to buy this for smaller rodents, such as squirrels or rats.They are too small and light to trip the mechanism that swings the door closed. I've used this trap to catch large opossums and it's the perfect size. The animal was not harmed and we were able to set it free without touching the little fella. Recommended.
B00004RAMT We've borrowed many traps over the years to catch, spay/neuter and release stray cats in our neighborhoodbefore finally buying two of this Havahart trap # 1079 which we found at Home Depot a couple years ago.After borrowing a variety of brands, one can't help but notice a big difference in quality from one brand to another.Many have thinner wire then Havahart, which is trickier to get the trigger rod set.Some may be painted (like at Tractor Supply) rather than galvanized for rust resistance like Havahart.Some have had a smaller hand guard, or worse ~ none.CONCLUSION ~ Havahart is an easy to use, excellent preforming,  quality constructed, durable trap.With heavy gage galvanized wire and all smooth/ rounded edges. It's a five star product.As if it couldn't get any better ~ Havahart is made in America.Footnote:  For convenience ~ three sizes of Havahart traps ~Small ~ Ideal for catching chipmunks, rats, squirrels and similar-size nuisance animals7.1\" long ~ 2.4\" wide ~ 3.5\" high.Medium ~ Ideal for catching rabbits, skunks, squirrels and similar-size nuisance animals. (this one)25\" long ~ 7\" wide ~ 7 1/4\" highLarge ~ Ideal for catching raccoons, stray cats, groundhogs (woodchucks), opossums, and similar-size nuisance animals.32\" long ~ 10\" wide ~ 12\" high.
B00004RAMT We bought this ~1 week ago and we've caught 2 groundhogs thus far. We used strawberries for ours. We grated some strawberry on the cage, then tossed one in the back of the cage. We set it next to their burrow, then literally waited 1-2 days each.Some suggestions: Make sure to place the cage so you can check it from afar. We didn't know we caught one for a good portion of the day. Luckily it was a cooler day, so he/she was ok. Also make sure to weight the cage a bit, bc sometimes a moving cage will spook them back out of it. Had no problems with opening the door afterwards, but make sure to open it away from you because they nearly fly out of it!
B00004RAMT This is the perfect size for catching the large raccoons and woodchucks eating inside our fenced garden.  Having only one door assures that an animal has to enter far enough into the trap for the door to close.  So far the trap has caught an animal each day.
B00004RAMT The coons steal the bait from this trap at will. I've had to re-engineer the trigger to even trip as a bowling ball rolled into it wouldn't engage the trip at first. They advise putting bait past trip plate, but the coons just reach through the mesh and get the bait, another serious design flaw. There are traps that work, this just in NOT one of those. Save your money!
B00004RAMT I had a raccoon problem, used peanut butter sandwich (small bits each night) and each night I got a coon. its easy to set, tho after you have had many wild animals in it, the latch may need to be worked on a bit. after two full years of outside use, and many many coons, I am in need of a new one. a really large raccoon bent the bottom too much to be reworked but I figure I have gotten my money for the first one in the first 2 weeks, as I was getting rid of my coon family one per night.and, no, its not the same one coming back, we simply had that many.my advice, put the bait in the far back corner and place your trap so the front opening is easy to see and get in, but the rest of the trap I had tucked in to bushes just enough to hide some of it but not get any branches in the way of the trap shutting.  check your trap right away in the morning, you dont want an animal trapped longer than he needs to be. it is unlawful to relocate wild animals, so know ahead of time what you will do with the animal once its in the trap. besides, on one wants your infestation on their property.  (a nice farm is a bad idea, farmers I know shoot raccoons and other relocated pests FYI)
B00004RAMU I put my bait (peanut butter) on the top of the entrance box so it gets between these and the lid. Attracts great and the mice can't get to it so the same bait works for months.No setting required, you don't even really need bait if well placed. I keep these under garage shelving, under stairs, in the floor of the pantry, etc. and just let them sit until successful.There is another model with a clear lid, not needed and these don't have plastic to break. An unadvertised benefit is that these have a \"built in alarm\" of the catch. The mouse (or mice) will push around on the one way ramp which make a metallic tapping sound to alert you of their presence in the trap.If you want to release live, thats great, but if you want to dispose of the mice, just take the trap and set it in the sun for a bit and the mice will expire fairly quickly.
B00004RAMU Has caught mice, but only the smaller ones. Has also caught voles, but again, only the juveniles. Perfectly humane, but rodents, even if left in a trap like this overnight, tend to eat each other.  So yes, the trap works, but in  my experience, not the solution for anything but the smallest rodents.
B00004RAMU We get a lot of mice when the weather turns cold.  I've tried every type of mouse trap on the market, including spring traps, repeating traps, electronic traps, etc.  The old-fashioned spring traps are the best and cheapest solution, but they can be a bit gruesome.  This tin cat trap is the most reliable alternative I've found.  When I hear, see, or smell mice, I put this out and invariably end up finding mice in it the next morning.  The first tin cat that I bought almost 20 years ago is still catching mice.A few important notes:- This is only a live catch mouse trap if you check it daily.  You can't expect to catch mice, leave them in the trap for a week, and expect to find live critters the next weekend.  If they die in the trap, you'll face a smelly clean up task.- I noticed a lot of reviews from people who said the trap stopped working.  In my experience, this is almost always because something has gotten wedged under the trap-door ramp.  Often it seems to be because the mice crawl into the semi-enclosed trap door spaces to die if you don't empty the trap in time.  If the trap is outdoors, twigs and bits of sand can blow up the trap-door ramps and keep them from working.  95% of the time, just banging the trap on the ground a few times dislodges whatever is in the way.  About 2-3 times a year, I spray off the inside of the trap with a garden hose, which seems to clean out remaining debris just fine.In a nutshell:  This is a great trap design that consistently catches mice and has worked for me for decades.  In my experience, the trap has proven to be very reliable and durable with an occasional bit of cleaning.
B00004RAMU We had tried 3 other traps with no results. This one finally caught out tiny friend and I was able to let him go free in a nearby field. I was happy knowing that the mouse didn't have to die just because he dared to come into my home. He was happy to be living and not with a broken neck.Its a win/ win!
B00004RAMU We purchased this mouse catcher last year when we were suddenly inundated with winter lodgers in the basement.  At first, this trap did a fine job, but then it just petered out on us and stopped working.With items like this it is hard to say where the fault lies, so we are giving it Three Stars.  We had better luck though with the Woodstream Havahart Mouse Trap.Three Stars.  Leaves mice sweaty but ready to live outside again.  For us the trap stopped trapping after a couple of months.
B00004RAMY I bought two of these at a large, orange home improvement store two days ago after reading reviews on Amazon.  Same price as here, by the way. Set them that evening, in the dark, using the technique advocated by other reviewers here... that is, gently tamped down a small section of a main, straight run until level with ground, cut grooves on either side for the trap jaws to sit in, set tap, and set trap down in grooves with the release lever sitting against the tamped-down ground.  One day passed with no action, but after a whole lot of rain yesterday evening, the mole was in the trap this morning!He was caught in the edge of the jaws, telling me I could have planted the trap a tiny bit deeper.  There is another method advocated online involving digging out a section of the mole run, building a dirt bridge across the hole, placing the trap down in the hole, and covering with dirt.  This might be an even better strategy, but either way, I'm happy with the result.  I left the traps out, just in case another mole decides to make use of his subterranean highway system. Will update if there is any more action, positive or negative.
B00004RAMY Update June 3, 2011More mole activity which has now been stopped by a Victor trap. This time the activity was in the back yard including a flower bed. I decided to skip the test pressing phase and just selected a mole run, pressed the soil down and placed the trap. Sure enough the next day I had a dead mole in the trap. I had set two traps and the second one didn't catch anything so they are both back in the garage waiting for the next mole trapping adventure.Original reviewFive hours after I set two traps I had trapped a mole; I was truly surprised to see one trap sprung and at first thought it must have accidently tripped; I pulled the trap out of the ground and there was a dead mole, the trap had done its job perfectly.I had lived at my house for over 30 years and this mole infestation was a first. When I started seeing the raised soil trails and dead grass I suspected I had somehow gotten a mole in my yard. I started reading everything I could find on the web and started getting free advice from friends.I called the pest service we use and the man suggested I buy the Victor trap as that was the one they used and the cost of them coming out and setting the traps could get very expensive. I read the Amazon reviews on the trap and they were generally helpful so I decided to buy the Victor traps.The general advice was to locate active runs by pressing down the soil that had been displaced by the mole which I did and then followed up with a hose to really flatten them down. Sure enough the following day certain trails had been raised up again and I selected one of those to place the traps.My yard has a sandy soil mixed with clay; it is also rather root infested so I followed several recommendations which said it was important to cut away any roots that might hinder the traps free movement. Before I placed the trap that caught the mole; I used a straight edged steel edger and pressed it down into the soil where the trap would be placed; sure enough I had to cut through several roots that crossed that area. I used my foot to press down the raised area where the trap would be placed.It took a little experimentation to finally get the trap set; I had never set a trap before so this was all new to me. It does take some pressure to set the trap; there is a safety latch which can be engaged first but then additional pressure with the tools provided is needed to actually set the trigger.I left the safety latch in place until the trap was set in the ground and I had pressed it down so the trigger was resting on the soil. Once that was all done I released the safety latch and the trap was ready.I covered the trap with a garden pot to keep the area dark and protect it from being disturbed by local cats and dogs. This was all done late yesterday morning and by mid afternoon it had trapped a mole.I will update this review if anything of interest happens. In the meantime both traps are in place waiting for the next mole.
B00004RAMY This type of trap is highly effective IF you do NOT follow the directions about how to place it. If you bury it (which the directions will tell you to do) it will simply NOT work. If your \"out o sight\" trap is out of sight it is TOO DEEP and all you will get is holes in your yard and perhaps an annoyed mole.When the very expensive exterminator (who we now refer to as \"Mark the Mole Man\") came to our house, I showed him our \"out of sight\" mole trap. He tried to be respectful but finally just said, \"Ma'am, that's too deep. Ain't gonna kill nothin'.\" As it turns out, this is exactly the same type of trap he uses. He just knows how to use it correctly.He pulled it up and knocked the dirt off and walked around the yard for a while telling me stuff about moles. He clearly took great pride in his mole murdering skills (please don't give PETA my address.) Finally he stopped, stood silently for a moment, then he stepped his boot gently on a run until the soil was level with the surrounding soil. Next he took his special tool for making the slits that the previous reviewer described making with a shovel, and he made his two slits in the run for the blades to fit into.Then, artist that he was, Mark the Mole Man pressed the trap blades slowly into the slits he had made until the flat trigger was sitting gently on the soil. Released the safety and - Done. He placed three more in the back yard (BIG yard) and 24 hours later we had a dead mole.It was a wonderful (and for us expensive) experience. Go get your nasty little critter with this trap, but don't follow their directions. Listen to reviewer Geoffrey Klos.
B00004RAMY I admit it - I'm very, very ambivalent about harming any creature, even one that tears up our lawn the way moles do. But after one of our kids fell and nearly broke a leg in one of the numerous mole holes in our yard we (reluctantly) decided to cut down on the mole invasion. We did not want or need another emergency trip to the doctor's office. We also have elderly parents who visit often and the thought of THEIR falling was frightening to us.Bottom line on these traps - THEY WORK. If you want a trap that quickly kills moles, these do. They also seem to keep  suffering to a minimum. I'm not even sure the moles DO suffer because I was walking to the mailbox and felt  one of these traps go off. The mole was dead by the time I pulled it out, less than a minute later.Our lawn is no longer full of dangerous mole holes. I admit...if we'd only had an occasional mole hole, I would have stayed away from traps. We are animal lovers. We have pets.But the situation was becoming dangerous. I didn't want anyone  to get hurt walking across our yard.
B00004RAMY This trap is great.  I've read the reviews and once you get the hang of setting this trap, you realize it is simply awesome.  As mentioned by others:  DO NOT FOLLOW THE BOX INSTRUCTIONS.What you need to do:1- bend the trigger down a little2- use spade shovel in the turf to make slots (2) for the jaws.3- use good sized wood chips to obstruct an active run near the surface--enough so that the trigger rests on the wood when placed.4- check trap daily...you'll be surprised how many moles use the same run.Once I figured this trap out, I've killed 6 in the very first 2 weeks!!!***WARNING:  check the laws in your city/state.  These traps may be prohibited.  One of my neighbors called the animal warden on me and he confiscated 3 of my Victor traps claiming that they are \"leghold, steel-jawed traps\".  I will be going to court soon...
B00004RAN0 They are soooo much easier and not near as scary as the old ones.  I don't have to worry about losing my fingers.  I put peanut butter way in the back on the rod instead of where they say to put it, and I catch them every time.I do catch some mice that are small enough to not be harmed, but at least I get them.  And eventually they are not so lucky.  It's so easy to bait and so easy to catch them. Even my kid can do it without harm to her.
B00004RAN0 This trap can actually catch mice, but if they aren't small, will only injure them.  It also leaves a wiggling tempting snack for other animals to eat, who then take the mouse AND trap to locations unknown. Trap is not selective and will kill or injure anything that trips it. The most selective and humane way to trap is to use a Havahart trap, then euthanize only the problem animals with ether (found as \"starting fluid\" in automotive stores). Ether is a potent anesthetic which was used on humans in early medical procedures. It's also extremely flammable so take great care.
B00004RAN0 Occasionally a mouse will not get killed and will drag the trap away. This has not been a problem as I hav always found the trap and mouse within a short distance.
B00004RAN0 Every fall/winter season a few mice find their way into our basement pantry.  I think I've tried every deterrent out there--sticky boards, poisons, quick-set and traditional traps.  Like outdoor chipmunks, these mice are clever.  Poison blocks don't seem to interest them, and they know how to side-step sticky boards.So far, I have had the best luck with these cheaply made plastic Victor traps.  I bought two types of quick-set traps--these Victor ones andSnap-E Mouse Trap by Kness(based that purchase on popular reviews).  Even though Victor's snap isn't very strong, it does indeed kill mice.  I have yet to catch anything with the Kness traps.  They have a stronger snap, but so far all I've come up with are sprung, empty traps.  The same bait is used for both traps (peanut butter).I don't care how mice are caught, as long as the job gets done.  This season, Victor Quick Set mouse traps are proven winners.  I don't think they'll last a long time, but they certainly outperform sticky boards and are easier to set than the old-fashioned method.
B00004RAN0 Yes, these are way easier to open. I have a near phobia about things that snap..especially mouse traps. I can not, physically it is impossible for me to open an old board/metal mouse trap. I know, weird, but it just freaks me out! So, I got these and was so excited! We keep our dog food in the garage and pet food draws mice. Every spring/fall we get them in the food or the garage itself. So I tried these traps. Lots of them. I go for total overkill (pun intended) when it comes to killing anything lower than my ankles! Well, these do NOT kill anything. They spent weeks with nothing in them. But the old mouse traps (my hubby sets them) had about one every few days. He just reset his and laughed at my 'old lady' traps. Sigh. I know these look great, and they are super easy to use, but they will not kill anything. I have now read the other reviews and have no idea how anyone could give these a positive review. Also, the thought of having a LIVE mouse to deal with? What a gross, awful, torturous hassle. No thanks. Hope this helps!
B00004RAN0 Having been unable to create a method of capturing marauding mice and teleporting them unharmed to another galaxy, I resorted to a humane trap, intending to drive them several miles into the county and release them to find their county mouse cousins.  Alas and alack, the mice were able to enter the humane traps, retrieve the bait (peanut butter on a bit of cracker) and exit the traps with the bait.  Perhaps they work in pairs with one holding the door open while the other goes in for the food. With a heavy heart I next purchased a pair of these traps. For many nights the mice could count on their evening meal, the bait strategically placed in various places in this trap. They walzed in, dined, and left, no doubt laughing their little tails off.  It seems a human with a master's degree in psychology is no match for the average rodent.  Then, wonder of wonders, last night the traps actually lured two hapless diners to their death. My delight was short lived upon reading reviews here that the mice do not die instantly, but might suffer for a time before expiring. What's a person to do?  My advice, if you do purchase this type trap, is to use just the smallest amount of bait (my successful last night bait was cream cheese) which I rubbed the entire length of the pressure activated metal strip. I think previously I was using too large a piece of cheese or cream cheese. I suppose I'll continue to use the traps, as I have to get this problem resolved though it's awful to think of them suffering at all.
B00004RBDU Gets fleas AND anything else that tries to scuttle past it -- with the night light and the (perhaps nice smelling?) sticky pad it is quite attractive to creepy crawlers.Two things -- 1) use disposable gloves while changing the sticky pad. Saying &#34;eeeyew!!&#34; is optional.2) Do not think that this will catch all the fleas that might happen to infest your home and pets-- Use a sensible flea reduction program in addition to this..
B00004RBDU This is a refill package only and requires you have already purchased the Victor Flea Trap. Our experience with the flea trap has been very good and we have noticed the trap catches anything that happens to stray on its surface.The refills install easily and quickly. We have had to install a new bulb in the trap but that was also easily done. We leave the trap behind a sofa in the den and have noticed a steady decrease in trapped fleas as we've used it.This is a good supplement to flea control and can be safely used with pets.
B00004RBDU I purchased these refills at the same time that I purchased the flea trap. There are no fleas in this area who are willing to step on these sticky discs. As a result, the flea trap is of no use to me. These refills are of no use to me as well  and that is why I can give only one star. They cost only $5.76 which is too small an amount to consider returning this item. I plan to offer the flea trap and the refills on the local freecycle website in case there is someone who has a flea problem and wants to try this option.
B00004RBDU This is a review of the refills, followed by the same review as the trap.  The refills are easy to use, they come with a separate protective layer for each refill and it's fairly convenient to use the protective layer to cover the old, flea infested sticky trap when replacing it with a new refill.  Happy with the refills and the way they are packaged and installed.For the trap itself:I have 2 of these for 2 different locations.  Four stars instead of five because they do trap fleas; but they won't arrest an infestation. I use them as an indicator of the severity of the problem and whether I'm getting it under control.  Fleas are hard to see and find on carpet and furniture, not so tough to find on the dogs.The traps work best at night, don't seem to do much of anything during the day.  If I think I might have a problem or know the dogs have fleas I get the traps out.  This year we were successful with Siphotrol spray on the carpet and furniture and Barklogic's Lemongrass shampoo on the dogs (separate reveiws for those).  I count the fleas in the flea traps on a daily basis so I can tell that those measures are being effective, and when the overnight catch count goes to zero that's a good indicator the fleas are gone.If you are hoping the flea trap will cure an infestation by itself, there's a good chance you'll be disappointed. It might work, but I wasn't willing to wait that long.
B00004RBDU I first started using theVictor Ultimate Flea Trapwhen I lived in California because we had a problem with sand fleas coming in our back patio screen door. We also didn't want to use any pesticides, since we had four small house pets.When we moved to Michigan, we continued using the traps because our child was born, and we felt even more strongly about avoiding pesticides. Although we did not have a flea problem, the traps have caught several types of spiders, the occasional house fly, a few random creepy crawlies, and even a hornet! Basically, they seem to trap anything attracted to the light/heat.We keep them tucked away, out of sight (ex: in a back corner of our furnace room, under furniture), and in places where the pets can't get too curious -- getting a refill stuck to your skin (or dog fur) is the absolute worse.All in all, I think we've been using these traps for nearly ten years now. The bulbs can be replaced with regular night light bulbs or the new LED bulbs.
B00004S1RW I bought this to clear out the thick tangle of thatch in my front yard from years of neglect.  I was amazed at how easily the blades slip through the soil, leaving the grass pretty much intact and pulling up all of the detritus.  If you have a pet and have ever used a Furminator, it's basically like that for the yard.  Love it.
B00004S1RW so, I was trying to save some money and avoid buying an electric or gas powered de-thatching rake/power rake.  I thought this would be a good idea, and I will say, it works as designed but it is HARD work.  Now, this being said, my lawn has a pretty thick layer of thatch because I have a mulching, push mower.  I don't bag for multiple reasons, but bottom line, I needed a way to thicken my grass up.  The only way to do this is either aerate or remove the thatch, which I chose the thatching rake.  I worked my butt off for about 2 hours and had gotten only about 20% of my yard complete, if that.  Not sure if it's supposed to do this, but the head would swivel over about 2-4 rakings, and you will have to flip it over, to get the preferred angle.  It might be meant to do it like this, but I typically don't read directions.Its ok, nothing great, nothing horrible.  I will say the quality seems good, it's got a solid wood handle, and I think it will last longer than I'll even care to use it.  I suppose, in a pinch, you could swing this thing around and do some damage to zombies.  however, I would prefer a piercing/slicing weapon for zombie battles, for obvious reasons.
B00004S1RW This has two sides. One is better for thatch removal, the other side is good for cultivating the soil a bit.I've been able to use this rake to prepare hard soil for grass seed planting.It is sturdy, well designed, and manufactured with good materials.
B00004S1RW The head is attached to the shaft securely and doe not feel like it is going anywhere.  However, the individual metal tines bend quite easily and care should be taken to ensure that they are straight, or it is going to make your thatching job harder than it needs to be.Also, thatching a large lawn by hand really sucks!
B00004S1RW This thatch rake is great for SMALL spots.  If you plan on doing an entire yard, go rent a machine.  It takes a LOT of effort to use this rake on Augustine grass in Texas.  Having said that, the rake works as intended and is high quality / durable.
B00004S1RW I tried to dethatch my yard with an ordinary rake and found it exhausting. A thatching rake like this makes the job so much easier! It's still a lot of exercise, to be sure, but you'll certainly be glad you got this. This rake is heavy duty, high quality, and perfectly suited for the job.The head on my rake was silver in color (not black like the picture), but I don't care about this discrepancy. It otherwise is the same rake.
B00004S1RW Dethatch your lawn with this rake ONLY if you really have to!! This tool is head heavy, so your arms will get really tired, unless you are in super shape. I will allot one week to do the front lawn. I am still sore from using it on 1/3 of the lawn. It will remove everything including green, which will leave your lawn looking terrible.
B00004S1RW I used this rake to thatch our front lawn this fall.  It was very labor intensive since we have a large front yard.  I think in the feature I may try an electric thatcher to save time.  I was also disappointed by the fact that I saw the same rake at my local big box store for 10 or 15 dollars cheaper.
B00004S1RW Not for the faint hearted but a great arm exercise. This thing does pull up lots of dead grasses. Had this for more than 18mths now and it is one of the better tools. But with 5000 sq ft lawn, this is not a long term solution. The metal teeth will bend inwards if you use it forcefully enough; especially when lawn is wet. Not a big deal but can be frustrating each time you try to straighten it back. I'll continue to use this tool for small areas. For whole yard maintenance, I've upgraded to an electrical detatcher.

B00004S1VJ - Many different modes of patterns to choose from- Fairly cheap feel, but it works, and for the price I can't complain.- Doesn't quite seem to get the water pressure I like especially on the more concentrated stream settings, but again for the price its a useful nozzle.- Mostly used for washing the car, and the 7 settings come in handy there.- Amazon delivered quickly
B00004S1VJ This nozzle really fits the bill with good spray patterns that work well, good water pressure and good ease of use.  Because it's plastic, I'll have to take it in for the winter lest it leak next season, but so far it doesn't leak at all.  Each of the patterns is distinct in its function and useful and something about the design allows great water pressure where you need it even if you have a well and lower press
B00004S1VJ Over the winter our nozzle somehow got lost. This nozzle is a great price. It has lots of settings to choose from and is comfortable to hold. It screws on easily. I am very happy with its performance, and am satisfied with this purchase.
B00004S1VJ have had it for over a year now with no complaints. This is easily my favorite sprayer. Liked it so much I have one for the front AND the back hoses.
B00004S1VJ I purchased this in May 2011.  One year later and I'm back on Amazon looking for a new nozzle. Only used this mainly on weekends during summer months, so to say it lasted a year is actually being generous... probably only got about 4 or 5 months out of it and even that was light use.I bought it because I liked the idea of several different spray types.  The nozzle worked well in the beginning, though it had a cheap feel to it and I knew it wouldn't last many years.  After a few uses I noticed that the trigger would stick and not turn off so I would have to pull it to get it to stop.  Then the trigger started coming loose and cracking... just kept getting worse until the trigger snapped off.I would not purchase this again and do not recommend it.
B00004S1VJ The construction and material are sturdy, no complaints about that. All the settings work great. There is just a missing option I think. There's &#34;Center&#34; which does the center holes, &#34;Shower&#34; which does the outer - but not one that does both. Need more water for the plants!
B00004S1VJ This has worked well for me with one exception.  It must be removed from the hose in the winter.  If it freezes it cracks and will spray everywhere next time you use it.
B00004S1VJ This lasted me about two years before the plastic handle broke off.  For the price, I am surprised it lasted as long as it did!  I am sure I dropped it more than enough times.  Overall, I do not regret this purchase.
B00004S1VJ Best I ever had or would need for basic yard watering and spraying off the sidewalk, etc. So much happier with it than my other sprayer, I just ordered another for the front yard.Pros:- Feels like total control in your hands- Plenty of great settings for the spray- Mist spray is wonderful- Doesn't leak (or bathe you)- This is real quality, so great priceCons:- None
B00004S1VJ Nice nozzle and cheap enough so I can have several around the house.  The pattern selection works find (stream and flat get the most use by me).
B00004S1VJ This spray nozzle is pretty sturdy... self explanatory, no need of directions, just turn the knob to whatever settings you want. All spray dials works just fine... have been using this for a little while ( no complaints ). I highly recommend, even for decent price.
B00004S1VJ this nozzle has a comfy grip and good selection of water spray patterns and is well made so i expect it to last for several years.  would recommend this nozzle
B00004S1VJ I thought the 7 patterns might be overkill,but each one is truly different.It is durable and responsive.There is not much more to say ,but is is inexpensive not cheap.Glad I bought it!
B00004S1VJ Bought it in May of 2010.  Did not use it from November to April.  That gave it a life span of 7 months before it became uusable. Spend a few dollars more for a one more sturdy.
B00004S24U I like it.  It is heavy and I use it as a base for my new impact sprinkler.  I made sure after the first use that I disconnected it and drained it, the put it over a chair to dry in the sun--don't want the rust problem if I can prevent it.  Good purchase--I had never heard of this thing before.
B00004S24U There isn't much to say about this sprinkler base. Sometimes the simplest design is the best, and in this case it is. Strong, durable and it works great. I expect to have it for years to come.
B00004S24U I leave it out, tow it around with the hose attached and forget to drain it come winter. Still working great after two years!
B00004S24U I purchased this to use with the Rain Bird sprinkler. It does the job well. One thing that I had to learn was the base holds water which has rust in it. When you disconnect this from the hose be sure that you empty the ring base and don't soak yourself with rusty water.
B00004S24U I initially purchased one for use with a rain bird plastic impact rotor sprinkler, I put an 18&#34; extension from the metal ring to the rotor. Works awesome! I have since bought three more and use one of those with another rotor, and the other two for shrub style bubblers/sprayers for my plants in the the mulch beds. One negative which isn't a huge issue for me is that if you leave water sit in it, there will be rusty water. I always disconnect the hose each time and pour out any excess water so it's not an issue, but I can see that if I didn't do that with time it could rust through or clog your sprinkler head possibly.
B00004S24U i had a couple of spike impact sprinkler, and eventually the spikes for some reason got bend. go figure. So i ordered 2 of these to replace the spikes, and they work great. the impact sprinklers fit in well. I've had them for 3 years now with no issues.  Not much more to say. Buy them with confidence.
B00004SD6U I am a working Certified Arborist, ISA.  THIS is the best tool out there for pruning, no debate possible.  I use this pruner daily.  Fiskars has the BEST customer support, as well.  Nobody else comes close.  They have sent me replacement parts for everything on this unit, as I needed them.  They have even sent me two brand new units that sit unopened in my work shed, when I simply requested new cutting heads for two units.  They sent me new heads, as well.  They have NEVER charged me one penny for replacement parts or the two, new units. I strongly recommend this tool.  Again, you cannot do better.
B00004SD6U The pruner will not release easily if you grab hold of a branch a little too thick, and at five feet away it's not always the easiest thing to do to notice if that branch is an 1/8th inch too thick.  As a result, it broke on the second day.  Amazon replaced with another, which broke due to same issue, but this time was too late to return.  I bought another, more expensive one that I am happy with and I would recommend it to anyone else: ARS LA-180ZR203 4-to-7-Feet Long Reach Pruner
B00004SD6U I had a cable driven long pruner, and besides the fact that it ... near broke my hand to clip a large branch with it, the thing was fragile.  I used to live on nearly and acre of property with a row of pines along the back.  They would get all brown near the bottom so I would try and prune them up to about the point where they could get enough sun to stay green. To do that you need a pruner with a little reach to it?I saw this model on TV and hunted it down, finding it first on Amazon.  I could barely believe the price quoted on the TV show, (it wasn't a commercial, it was a how-to show) they said the stick only cost about [$$$].  Its not quite that cheap, but the quality here is excellent.  It uses a chain, not unlike a bike chain, to drive the extended cutter. It uses a slider, leverage system to pull the chain to make the cuts.  The cutting blades themselves are very sharp and can be adjusted to any angle.  This becomes an important concern when you have about a dozen pine trees to trip.The stick will also do fine when you don't need the extended length.  Remember those hedge trimmers that looked like a huge pair of scissors?  I used to hurt my wrists every year, trying to get enough momentum to trim the bushes in front of the house I was renting.  If you tried to cut too, slow it would get stuck, too fast, and the handles would stop abruptly hurting my wrists!  This cutter, although smaller than a hedge trimmer, cut so quick and easily that it made trimming the bushes a pleasure.  I could even get lazy, and sit down in a chair, and do them from a distance. Try that with your electric model! The bushes never shaped up so well before.The blades will cut close to a one-inch branch, and I haven't had to sharpen it yet.  Just keep the chain free of dirt, and keep a little mower oil on it, or cycle spray and it continues to work like new.  Sometimes they just make a tool that becomes the defacto standard for a while, and for my money this is it.  Don't risk cutting your arm off with a chainsaw. If you've got a little pruning to do, get this Pruning Stik and start clipping away.
B00004SD6U This pruning stick works like a charm. Pull down on the handle or the end ball and voila, cuts through 1+\" branches with relative ease.Safety is the name of the game.Thorns and prickles gone.You've got 62\" distance between you and some pain. Lower levels on the ladder.This is a must have for anyone having to prune any brush of height or thorns..I have had mine for about 5yrs and it is still in excellent shape.Seems like the cutting mechanism should last a long long time.The pivoting head is very useful as well.
B00004SD6U For most yard trimming this pruner is great.  Easy to adjust, cuts limbs like butter, and is light.  I have the 12 foot model also, but for most yard trimming this one is perfect.  I have used it to trim low limbs on my Silver Maples, a variety of yard shrubs, my Magnolia trees, and woody stemmed weeds.  Anyone can use this one. Great trimmer.
B00004SD6U This pruning stick is the best thing to come along in a long time.  I had been trying to figure out how to prune our big Rhododendron bush without ruining its shape, but no matter how I tried, I just couldn't get at the  top.  This stick allows selective pruning while on a ladder or from the  ground.  It is lightweight and comfortable to handle.  Definitely well  worth the price.
B00004SD6U I have a large piece of property in Arizona that requires the removal of bushes from time to time and I figured this looked like the perfect tool to cut the main trunk/branches of a dessert bush; NOT!!!!!It was worth a try, but it is clumsy and will not cut through most of the fibrous shoots of a typical desert bush. I am back to the pick and spade.I have many tools for tree limbs that do a much better job than this.I'll give it to my brother.  :>)Note: My rating is strictly for the said application.
B00004SD6U The first one I owned my teenage son tried using it on a limb that was too big and applied too much pressure which caused it to break. As far as I am concerned it was not the companies fault that this unit was abused. I keep it now for spare parts.I am very impressed with the second one I bought. It has paid for it's self many times over and has never given me any problems when it is used properly.I am disabled with arthritis. I do not like heights. This unit is very easy to use and as it stands now I should get many more years of use from mine.
B00004SD6U I never had much of a brand loyalty for routine yard maintenance stuff until I had a problem with an old fiskars pole saw.  The hardware couldnt hold the poles anymore.  When I contacted fiskars about it (limited lifetime warranty) they sent me a part.  When the post office didnt deliver it (a common problem here) they sent me a whole new $80 saw by fed ex.  When I come across actual customer service, I buy as long as the service is good.  Fiskars earned my business and I now look for their products where available.This is a nice pruning stick.  Unlike loppers, you can stick this into a shrub or low tree and cut a branch off without needing the linear clearance to open and close the lopper.  The mechanism works very well and allows me to trim up my hedges without sticking my arms into them (we have wasps and black widows) or going through trying to use a lopper and having it hit adjacent branches.Not the only tool you need, but its a great addition.  Like most fiskars products, its very well made.
B00004SD6Y No more getting down on my hands and knees to cut grass that the mower can't reach. I use this to cut grass around my mailbox post, the street lamp post on my property, the big metal box the electric company uses to feed me from its underground cable, the post the cable company uses as my feed point and anywhere else that grass needs cutting which the mower can't handle.These shears are lightweight, are easy to use, cut the grass cleanly and, best of all, they let me stand up while using them. They do not require a battery, power cord, string or anything else besides a hand. Very handy, very useful and very good.
B00004SD6Y These shears cut just as well as standard ones, without the back strain.  Also very easy to reach under bushes, plants, etc. to do a better job of trimming.  They seem pretty sturdy as well.  Very happy with this purchase.  Only caveat--if you are tall I think the handle would be a bit short and still require some bending.
B00004SD6Y I guess this might be ok if you had one VERY SMALL area to trim but it is very tedious and time consuming to use to trim multiple areas. I tried it out but decided to return it. Instead I broke down and purchased a cordless string trimmer (18 volt) which I love and does the job much quicker and easier than this thing could ever hope to do. I wanted it to work for me but no way!
B00004SD6Y Action works well enough, but the blades only cut if you use the very tips.  I expected better from Fiskars because I have several other Fiskars hand tools.
B00004SD6Y These Fiskars 9210 Long-Handled Swivel Grass Shears will literally save wear and tear on your back and knees both when you have any small yard trimming to do. These are not made for grass trimming around the perimeter of a large yard, as your hand would wear out from squeezing the handle. We use the electric string trimmer to trim the grass against the fence around our entire yard. As for all the other trimming in the yard- around the house, the garage, around bushes, trees, sidewalks, the patio, gardens, corners and utility poles, these Fiskars Grass Shears are just perfect!These shears are meant to trim grass and lighter plants, not anything thick, but since grass is always growing around everything in our yard, they get a constant workout.  The 3 foot height is just perfect- no bending or stooping ever. There is an orange turning device on the blades, allowing you to turn these blades to any angle you need. The blades actually turn a full 360 degrees. The 5 inch blades are fully hardened for long lasting sharpness and also lock for storage or when you are turning them. We noticed they do come with a slight oil on the blades themselves.I contacted Fiskars and asked about any maintenance for the blades, and they told me they should stay sharp for years, but you could add a sharper edge to them in time with a hand sharpener- similar to a lawn mower blade sharpener. Cleaning and lightly oiling them when they become dirty will keep them cutting perfect.  Fiskars actually has a lifetime guarantee against any defects in workmanship.  For under $35.00, these are a must have for saving my back and knees with the constant maintenance of yard trimming. These are not just for older people, as I've always had bad knees- and I wish I had known about these years ago!The thought of trimming all the constant grass around the yard made me not want to do it. I'd have to get out my small shears, my knee pad or a stool to sit on- depending on the height of the grass or weeds. Afterwards, I'd need my heating pad and linament for my aching back and knees, not to mention Aleve or some other pain killer. Spending so much time in pain made me dread trimming. Now, I just grab the Fiskars Long Handled Shears- stand, trim and that's it. These shears are worth much more than 5 STARS, and I know I will never be without them again, as saving my back and knees are worth everything!
B00004SD6Y Fiskars badly missed the target on this one.  Kudos to them for trying to fill the niche though, but in all honesty, this is almost as bad as having nothing at all.  Yes, it does work, but not very well. Yes, it's sharp out of the box, but won't stay that way for long.  I'll take a wild guess and say that no one in their R&D; department actually used the finished product.  If they did, they'd realize that it's an effective trimmer for 10 sq feet of grass (maybe less).  After that, ergonomics, build quality, and most importantly, fundamental design flaws reveal how a great idea can become a poorly executed product.First, the blades need to ride above the grass by way of wheels or some sort of slick bump underneath.  Second, the steering knob needs to be larger, adjustable, and attach to the pole instead of the top handle.  Third, the gauge of wire should be beefed up - there's too much flex in the existing one.  Fourth, the pole should be at least 4\" longer. Fifth, the quality of plastic could be upgraded for use in a harsher environment (or dispose of plastic altogether).  Lastly, the blades should at the very least, be made out of steel -- bonus points for drop forged and hardened!I completely understand the price point vs quality quandary manufacturers face, but here they really took the low-end, budget approach.  It seems Fiskars tried to implement their fine line of inexpensive scissors to the lawn/garden environment.  The quality of materials is perfectly suited for indoor gardening, but who here has a living indoor lawn?I guess we'll have to give it a little more time before human-powered lawn equipment becomes available in a wider selection and price points.  I'd definitely be one of the first in line for a better version.
B00004SD72 I gave these only three stars because of how they do and feel in your hand.  They will slip in your hand because there a bit slick and hard to hold.  There ok for small cuts and not having to use them a lot at one time.I wouldn't buy these if i had it to do over again.
B00004SD72 I finally broke down and bought a more expensive pair of pruners than usual. The blades on these are great! Small branches and more cut easily, quickly and cleanly. They are certainly a lot more comfortable to hold than the cheap $7 sheers I've purchased in the past.My biggest issue with them so far is the orange hold-close tab broke almost immediately. They have a life time warranty, but of course I threw away the receipt and all of the packing materials.
B00004SD72 This is a great pruner.  It is easy on arthritic hands and is quite sharp.  It works well on everything except larger branches.
B00004SD72 I think I have large hands for a woman but it takes two hands for me to make these pruners work correctly.  I do like the ergonomic aspect and the rolling handle that turns as you squeeze the handles together but it takes two hands for me to do that.8-21-13:  I came back and changed my 5-star rating to a 2-star because yesterday I picked up these shears and walked up the driveway and clipped some Sweet Autumn Clematis to bring that wonderful fragrance into the house.  However, I also clipped and really pinched my right index finger and I was trying to use these pruners with one hand.  They are just too large for me.  I think the swiveling handle is the culprit.  I tried to give them to one of my visiting left-handed brothers and he said no thanks.  They are good and sharp and all but brand new but just too big unless I can use both hands.
B00004SD72 Got to love a pruner that is ergonomically correct and puts pressure on the bush and not your thumb and forefinger.  Got to love a pruner that stays sharp after many seasons of work.  Got to love a pruner that stays rust-free even though we leave it out on the back porch.  Shouldn't come as a surprise:  We love anything Fiskars!
B00004SD72 I have used these for 4 years and love them.  First I'm 70 years old and do have some Arthritis so these are a real boon to me.  If I can get a branch between the blades I can cut it without strain. Strong spring that opens them (nice) but will say if you had small hands might be a bit large for you. The rolling handle took some getting use to, worked well but was different than anything I had used before, like it now though.  I would recommend these to anyone. I have several Fiskars tools, geared loppers, pruning poles etc., and that really is the reason I bought these since the others work great for me and all have held up to work.  When I read some of the bad reviews of these I have to remember some people need instructions on which end of a knife to hold while using.  These let me trim faster and with less effort than anything I have ever used,  believe me I've used several and cussed most of them.  Fiskars also makes others that are smaller in size if these are too large for you.  No I don't work for Fiskars, just totally impressed and sold on their loppers and pruners.
B00004SD72 These pruners are very easy on your wrists (and I have wrist problems)! They really do cut through limbs just like the photo in the images section! My pruners are on their 3rd summer with little maintenance required. When these finally bite the dust, I'll replace them with another Fiskars PowerGear Pruner. I am right handed and tried using the pruners with my left - it doesn't really work as one reviewer noted.
B00004SD72 This the next best thing to having a full size lopper in the palm of your hand. It's very strong with a power gear mechanism that makes cutting painless.  Because of the power gear action, the trigger handle rotates, softening the blow when the sheers get through the branch.  With traditional sheers, the snapping action can be painful after an hour or two of heavy duty pruning.These are heavy pruners, the grip is very comfortable.  I've only had these for two years, but it's going strong.  I wouldn't recommend it for professional u because of the exposed coil spring which is likely get clogged or damaged under heavy abuse, but it's great for the home owner.This performs the job of countless other cutting implements (small sheers to a medium duty lopper).  It's not a delicate cutter, but until recently, I was using it to deadhead my flowers with good results.
B00004SD72 I have been doing yard work for 40 years, so I am no \"backyard rookie\".  This pruner fell apart the very first time I used it. The \"PowerGear\" fell off and couldn't be reattached firmly to the pruner. I have used other Fiskar products many times and had normal expectations confirmed.Despite what a few other reviewers might say, everyone has the right to state accurate facts about a faulty product. Poor products deserve bad reviews, both to inform the manufacturer and to warn prospective purchasers about problems encountered. Amazon expects no less.I have processed the return package to send it back to Amazon and will try another unit. That said, I reserve the right to change my opinion should the second unit function properly.
B00004SD72 I've had this pruner for several years, and I've used it for a variety of tasks, including pruning roses and other bushes, to trimming off small tree branches. I've even used it for branches that were probably too thick for the tool, but when you have it handy, sometimes you use a tool for a purpose that it wasn't intended. Even when I try to go through something too large, it hasn't broken or jammed in such a way where I couldn't remove it and take it from another angle to finish the cut. That shows how durable it really is.I've had no issues with using this pruner for all those tasks, as it allows me to trim individual faded rose buds with one hand. The spring-loaded handle keeps the resistance at the right amount so it isn't necessary to fiddle around with it just to keep a decent grip.If I were to lose this pruner, or if it were to finally break, I would not hesitate to purchase another one as a replacement. I'm very satisfied with it and recommend it to anyone looking for this type of tool.
B00004SD72 When I placed my order I had some misgivings about these hand pruners. That is because I could not tell by Amazon's photo if this was the pruner I needed and how sturdy it is. Since I have had good luck with Fiskars I decided to go ahead and order it.I received the pruners today and I am going to break one of my rules on writing a review. I prefer to wait and use the product before doing a review. I am doing this because these are obviously TOP QUALITY pruners. Arthritis sufferers please take note of what I am about to say.The very first thing I noticed about the pruners is that the bottom handle ROTATES as you squeeze them. This allows you to put far more power into using these with a LOT LESS effort. A wonderful feature if you do not have a strong grip.The photo made these pruners look to me like they were mostly plastic. I immediately saw that I was wrong. All the parts that count are of high quality metal. I will not use them on large branches but I think they could be used on large branches in a pinch.As soon as I got them out of the box I just had to try them. They were excellent for clipping off very small branches in areas where there was not much room to operate. They are SO EASY to use. Once done with the smaller branches I went to larger ones. They cut them with ease. The literature that came with them claimed that they can cut branches up to 3/4 inch. I believe they could but I refuse to do it. I like these clippers so well that I want to take very good care of them so that means I will not cut branches that size with them. I want these clippers to last a long time for me.In conclusion I am very impressed with these clippers. I intend to post some of my own pictures of these clippers on Amazon because I believe I can do a bit better job. I have never done that before with an Amazon product. That is how impressed I am with these pruners. If I run into a problem with them I WILL EDIT this review as soon as it occurs. I very much doubt I will have to do that. I think 99% of all people who buy these pruners will be happy with them.
B00004SD73 I needed a pruner to fight bittersweet vine.  Due to several back surgeries I don't have a lot of strength in my hands, so I was looking for a pruner that was light and easy to use.  I got this 15\" Fiskars pruner this weekend in local home improvement store and spent several hours cutting my pesky vines.  The pruner worked great! It cut every vine I found and it was easy!The pruner weights 13 ounces, and has a PowerGear design that really helps amplify the strength needed to do the cutting.  I am attaching a collage of 5 photos (you can find the photos by following 'customers photo' link under the main photo).  The photos show the pruner and some of the vines I cut and took home to measure.Photo #1 and photo #2 show the pruner opened and closed. Photo #3 and Photo #4 show one of the bigger vines I have cut: 3 inches in circumference and a bit over 7/8 inches in diameter. Photo #5 shows the vine that was snaking up one of my big fur trees.Overall, I am very pleased. This pruner was easy to use and did a good job!Ali Julia review
B00004SD73 These are great.  Had the old ones for years and I confess, they were occasionally abused.  I took a sharpener to the blade and got a few more miles out of them before deciding I needed to break down and buy new ones.  Works on branches that were surprisingly large (sorry!) but I hope to treat these better than the old ones.
B00004SD73 It had been years since I had a new pruner and the one I have most would consider \"vintage\".  So when I chose this pruner, I chose on the brand I know has quality and endurable products.  This pruner is lightweight and sharp.  I didn't realize how good a pruner can when when you have one that works!
B00004SD73 I used this product to trim shrub and tree branches around my yard. I can easily carry it around the yard because it is the perfect length and is light weight. I will also note that the blades are sharp and pinch through branches with ease. The Fiskars trimmer is a great addition to any garden cart especially if you want a quality trimmer for all your yard work needs.
B00004SD73 This little tool is deceiving.  It can cut those thick branches in one swipe.  My husband even uses it.  It is a big surprise what it can cut with no effort.
B00004SD74 Finally a decent pair of loppers. Quality construction. I love the gear setup and handles that won't come loose.They are a breeze to use.
B00004SD74 The gear mechanism does assist your chopping power.This is a solid branch cutter and as long as you clean your cutting edges,the tool should operate for a long time.
B00004SD74 cuts through branches like butter, not needing a lot of force at all.  super sharp and the design makes it take less energy to get it done
B00004SD74 These Fiskars are the very thing to have on hand, They cut really good and smooth. I like the long reach too because the short ones you will need a ladder more for taller trees.
B00004SD74 OK, I ordered these because I have some hand pruners by Fiskars and love them. These did not disappoint. I have been using them all over our new yard to cut back overgrown lavender, smoke bush, and branches. Today I thought I'd give them a try in the woods next to the house that \"could\" be a beautiful fire pit or gazebo area... eventually. I took these through dead and alive saplings. And to clarify-these were 1\"-3\" saplings. While it handled the recommended size of 2\" easily, I found with some maneuvering and going around the tree in a circle I could also take down larger ones. Then I worked on cutting the smaller branches off, all still cutting with ease like they were brand new. No dulling or sticking- a perfect cut each time.I worked at this for about an hour- plus all the other times I've been out with these... I would definitely buy another pair in the future - but these don/t seem like they will be wearing our anytime soon!
B00004SD74 I cut down two very dead shrubs today using these and was very impressed with these lightweight loppers.  I didn't think I'd get the heavier two-inch branches cut because these loppers are so light, but with the right grip the gear holds the wood down and cuts the branch cleanly in half with little effort.  I'm not the strongest person out there and I'm certainly no Hercules, but these loppers made the trim job for me fairly easy.Although these may be harder to use in dense shrub because you need a wide opening for these to work effectively, once you have a grip on the wood the cutting is easy.  And, since they are somewhat long, you can also reach up rather high.  Overall, a very well-engineered set.They are attractive on top of it, and look impressive in my tool corner.
B00004SD74 Fiskars 32 Inch PowerGear Bypass Lopper (9154).  Now this is a great Lopper, I use it a lot and it makes trimming easy.
B00004SD74 Love it, one of best products I have ever ordered period. I couldn't believe how effordless this thing cuts thru even thick branches several inches wide. It is very easy to use, light in weight but very solid construction and feel,  even makes cutting branches fun if you can believe that. I cut down twenty branches and three small trees in under a few minutes. I was looking around for more things to cut. Seems very well built. I can't think of a single thing that could have added on this thing to make it better Price is great. One reviewer gave it one star because the blade is curved so you have to open the tool's jaws slightly more. I am not sure but would bet the curved blade has something to do with just how easy this thing cuts. I have another cutter that doesn't have curved blades and it can't cut nowhere near as powerful as this tool. Tool is fantastic. Very Highly recommend Many Times over!!! Would give it twenty stars if could!!!! Good job to the people who designed this product!!
B00004SD74 There is power to spare with this lopper. Yes, it has to open very wide to get around the cutting target but if the space permits you to do so the cutting part is almost effortless. This is hands down the best lopper I have ever used as far as ease of cutting. When I finished clipping I decided to apply a bit of oil from the Fiskars Cutting Tool Care Kit that I had purchased. As I was applying the oil I noticed that the black cutting blade had a bright spot. Closer inspection revealed the bright spot was actually a nick in the blade. This was a major letdown after the feeling that resulted from the cutting prowess. I had to delete a star due to the nick and hope that it was just a  rare flaw in the metal. Other than the nick this is a top notch lopper.
B00004SD74 This 32 inch loppers is a great addition to our yard work tools!! I am a short lady, and have no problem snipping branches around our yard. The long sturdy handles make it easy to get leverage and trip harder to reach branches, and I have seen great improvement in our curb appeal because of this great loppers!
B00004SD74 This is a great addition to my growing gardening tool collection.  This tool will make it easier to prune tall tree limbs in the fall.  The Fiskars quality in sewing instruments in why I purchase the brand for my outdoor activities.
B00004SD74 I bought it in a local store on sale, for $29.99, mine is the same model, only 32\". Funny, because on the fiskars website there's no mention of the product!I compared it to other alternatives, that can cut 2\" branches, and this model came out as number one!It cuts wood like butter!Mine is very light weight, has titanium blade, hollow aluminum arms, with rubber handles.I fear I bought a product that may be more powerful than the product can actually handle! Meaning, it may be good for casual use of cutting branches upto 2\".But perhaps not industrial use!That's why they probably decreased the size of the gripper to 25\" and 31\" instead of 32\".Nevertheless, I just use it for some thorn bushes in my garden, and think it's well worth the $30 I spent!Even mine (32 inch) is very light weight, I can easily lift it up with one arm stretched, to cut off the furthest branches, and I'm a pretty skinny and weak guy!One cutting blade seems titanium, the other some sort of treated metal alloy. Only one of the two is a blade, the other is just a hold for the branch.Unlike other branch cutters I've seen, this one cuts the branch like a scissor, not squeezes the branch like pliers; which means, you won't have branches hanging on threads still on the tree.The cutting mechanism provides clean and easy cuts that separate even the toughest branches (upto 2 inch)!I highly recommend this one!; and that's very high praise coming off of my lips! (those who know me, know I'm usually very skeptic, and thorough in reviewing the bad sides).If anything bad about this device, is that it's not on the manufacturers website (the 32 inch model), and that it's probably not made for mass pruning on an industrial scale, eventhough it would probably outlive a DIY-er pruning gardens in his days off!
B00004SD74 I've usually found Fiskars gardening products to be innovative and effective, but there's usually a kink in the design.  I still swear by the Power Lever shears because the blades move parallel and effortlessly, but the kink is the retaining pin which is a pressure fit which simply loosens with use as the hole in the blades enlarge.  As to this very lovely and innovative Power Gear lopper, well, let's say there are a lot of kinks.  As you may have discovered, the handles break and the blades are fragile.  Just how fragile?  Check Home Depot's website for feedback on this very lopper and you'll even see pictures of the chipped Titanium blade.  It happens a lot, a whole lot.  Quality control may well be to blame, but the material used in the titanium blade is just not solid or steel.  My blade broke or rather chipped the first week of use and the broken surface revealed something that looks like pot metal.  The material in the blade looks like a composite, a grainy composite.  If you look at the blade you'll see that's it's very hefty and designed to withstand a direct applied force, but apparently not a force related to twisting, which would act against the cutting edge with increased leverage due to the unusual depth of the blade and its almost rectangular shape.  So you have high tech materials that when working, operates as advertised, save for that extra span needed to clear the blade around let's say a 2 inch branch.  BUT here's the good news:  Fiskars has replacement blades.  Here's the not so good news:  Fiskars charged me a reasonable $7.99 for the blade, but a very, very hefty shipping and handling ($4.00 for the handling) charge of $11.39, making the modestly priced blade $19.38 to purchase and receive.  The replacement blade (they're determined by the distance between the mounting holes)is steel and shaped like traditional lopper blades:  no more composites, no more thick blades, which tells you something.  As to Power Gear hedge shears, well , count your blessings with the lopper, because there ain't no replacement parts for the hedge shears from Fiskars, and their kink is the composite Power Gear mechanism, which breaks teeth with a passion, rendering the unit useless, unless you have a similarly wounded twin, because the mechanisms are comprised of two sets of power gear parts, that are interchangeable front and rear.  There you go, have fun.
B00004SD74 This tool makes unpleasant pruning tasks much more pleasant and the ease of cutting makes the work a lot more pleasant!  (If you can bear to think of it that way!)  It really takes the effort out of cutting thick branches.  I carry this lopper along with my smaller pruner--and I don't struggle trying to use the pruner on bush that's too thick for it.  Makes the whole pruning job go faster.I use this on our numerous rose bushes, too.  The length comes in real handy when I'm trying to avoid the thorns.In our neck-of-the-woods, we'll be pruning our roses in mid-February.  So now is not too early to start thinking about Spring-time gardening chores.
B00004SD74 Boy this looper is sharp and strong.  My wife uses it and loves it.  The gearing is amazing strong.  We have cut tree branches about 2 inches and no problem
B00004SD74 This is an excellent pruner/lopper and the rachet allows extra pressure on the blades when needed. Well made and rugged.
B00004SD74 Bought these to trim some larger bushes and small branches on a big pine tree.  These loppers work perfectly fine and are fairly light.  Although they seem to be a little more expensive, they are built well and should last a long time.  Remember to oil the blade and hinge after use, to keep it working properly and to prevent rust.
B00004SD74 Alright then, these are amazing at what they will cut with very little effort on my part.  Quality made! Save yourself the aggravation of lesser loppers. Just get these and be done with it.
B00004SD74 These do everything the company says.  I was surprised at how easy larger limbs were to cut compared to my old loppers.  My wife tried these and was really pleased at how easy it was to cut limbs.  (Hint, Hint, guys)  Let me say I would not have tried to cut some of the big limbs with my old loppers (now gone to lopper heaven).  If the jaws of these loppers fit around a limb they will cut it and so can you.  Only once did I have a problem opening them (handles) wide enough to fit a limb inside a shrub, it was a big one.  Most of the time I could find an angle to reach through with and cut inside limbs with no problem.  I would recommend these to anyone who like me enjoys easy work.  At 66 years old and surviveing throat cancer surgery I need that too.
B00004SD74 I have owned this thing for years.  It is hands-down my all-time favorite gardening tool.  I used to use your old-school loppers which became tiring to use and had trouble cutting thick branches.  I was in Home Depot one day and decided to spend the big bucks and get this thing.  It was my first Fiskars purchase ever, and ever since then I have been SOLD on this company.  These loppers are AMAZING.  I can cut branches, even tree roots, thicker than ever before with ease.  The gears on this thing make it possible to use this for a long period of time without tiring your arms as much.  Very efficent and effective tool.  Easily my favorite most-effective gardening tool I've ever bought.  I highly recommend this to you if you are in the market for some loppers.  Or if you know someone who likes to mess around the yard (especially older folks - this is so much easier on the joints), then get this as a gift.  It's just the best!** UPDATE 12/11/2102 **I just bought this as a gift for someone this Christmas. They work outdoors around the house and actually were using these same loppers, but they were 16 years old at that point (the loppers, not the person!).  They hadn't cared for them or sharpened them and they are in really bad shape.  So - a replacement is what they're getting for Christmas!  I do still love these things!
B00004SD74 I just used these to cut up some pine branches that came down in a horrendous windstorm and they WORKED LIKE A CHAMP!!! No effort and it cut through 2\" branches effortlessly. I am so glad I happened upon the Gold Deals when they were featured. They even came in ONE day. Thanks Amazon!!!Fiskars 9154 PowerGear 32-Inch Bypass Lopper
B00004SD74 The leverage you get from this looper is insane!  The gear pivot gives you a lot of leverage to cut through anything that'll fit in the blade when opened.  The only trick is making sure you open the handles WIDE in order to fit branches.
B00004SD74 Trees and shrubs grow year-round here in Hawaii, and trimming is a constant job. I much prefer using this&#8212;no cords, more control and a bit of exercise&#8212;over an electric trimmer.
B00004SD74 it looks like a well made high quality piece of equipment. brand new right out of the box both handles fell off. i guess i can glue them back on but this is a brand new tool under warranty.update: i glued the two handles onto the metal arms. it works great. it is very powerful. i like it. it has enough leverage that it can do the big jobs easily.
B00004SD74 I think I have three or four, maybe more. I'd have to go up into the attic to check. These work better than my Felcos which is saying a lot.
B00004SD74 Great piece of equipment for the price!  They are very light weight and has plenty of power torque behind it.  I would definately buy another one of these in the future!
B00004SD74 This lopper has actually exceeded my expectations. The only reason you buy one of these is to lop off tree branches and limbs, as well as extra bush and vine growth. This thing requires no real strength to use whatsoever, and i have now lopped limbs as much as three inches in diameter with no problems at all. Definitely well worth the $30 or so that they currently costs. Helped me to clear a lot of extra growth in no time.Enjoy!
B00004SD74 I purchased this at Home Depot.  It can cut 2\" or even 2.5\" branches with relative ease.  But there is one issue.  The cutting blade broke at some point.  I didn't notice it until I had problems getting the cut to go all the way through.  However, I went to the Fiskars website [...] and found out the live chat button and explained the issue to the customer rep.  She sent a new one out that day and I received it in 3 business days.  Installing the new blade was very easy and it worked just great.Over all, this lopper is a joy to use.  The movement is smooth and the cuts are clean.I wonder if Amazon will ever sell the replacement blade, though.
B00004SD74 I do a lot of gardening and I've owned a lot of loppers. These are the first that I've been totally pleased with. They are super sharp and will easily cut branches up to 2 inches in diameter. I also like the way the blades are designed and the way they \"grip\" the branch. I've been using them for 6 months now and I've never noticed them getting stuck inside a cut. They really make your work a lot easier and even pleasurable.
B00004SD74 It cuts easily through pretty large branches. It takes very little force to cut even large branches. If you have a lot of large trees (we do), you will still need a pole saw and/or chain saw, but this gets the most total use.All of my garden tools are Fiskars and I am very happy with each of them.
B00004SD74 Because of the length and the power gear, you have to spread your arms wide in order to make this 2\" cut, which can be troublesome in many cases, if you ever come across a power gear2 design, i'd suggested you buy it instead, a 27 inch power gear2 also cuts 2\" while your arms don't have to do spread eagle all afternoon, this one serves the purpose, but tiresome after 15 minutes.
B00004SD74 I had to buy this when the trail blazer was delivered to me defective in its assembly.  By leaving out a washer, the trail blazer bent out of shape when you tried to cut something over an inch.  This one handles up to about 1 1/2 inch stuff just fine.  It is not a ratcheting one so it might require a little more effort but it does do the job.
B00004SD74 Fiskars has given me great service over the years, so while I didnt used to have brand loyalty to any particular lawn tool maker, I now buy their products when available.  They're all well made and work well, this is no exception.  The gear drive is smooth and powerful, and as you might expect from a company with its roots in expensive scissors the blades are exceptional and dont need frequent sharpening.  Make sure to spritz a little wd-40 or other light lube on this and any tool with moving parts before using, it'll make them last longer, work better and prevent rust.
B00004SD74 I love how powerful these are.  I have cut up to 1.5\" diameter with this...any larger than that and I reach for a saw.My only complaint is that to get the large branches, you have to open the handles up all the way due to the power gear (almost180 degrees apart).  The limiting factor is cutting branches is whether I can open the handles far enough apart where I'm working.
B00004SD74 The 3:1 gearing helps these loppers cut quickly, BUT it also means that the handles have to open three times wider than ungeared loppers.  if you're trimming an outside branch, that's not a problem, but I've found them almost impossible to use when trimming branches next to tree trunks and in other dense foliage.If you choose to buy these, make sure that you also have some regular loppers around or you're going to be muttering to yourself a lot.
B00004SD76 I bought these a year ago but hadn't used them much.  I just began using them this spring and loved them - would have given them five stars until today.  Ironically I just ordered another pair yesterday because they are so easy to use - lightweight and sharp.But today the orange clamp that keeps them closed when not in use no longer does its job and they stay open all the time which makes them bulkier to carry as they are much less compact with both blades and handles splaying out.  That's the reason for only 3 stars. After today's malfunction I wouldn't order them again.  Plus the price has gone up in a year from $8.68 to $11.79. They are VERY useful - I just wish they were sturdier.
B00004SD76 I've had several of these from various manufacturers. I can't add a lot to the other reviews except to say that(1) they are very capable and surgically precise for pruning. They can handle quite large cross-sections as long as the material is not woody or hard. For example, they're perfect for pruning back conifers to the next junction, even 1/4 in. dia. so long as the material is \"softish\", and(2) Do not put them away in your pocket or tray or tool shelf without putting the \"sheath\" on the tip, because these are a very sharp and finely pointed weapon when locked closed. You can get a bad wound when you sit down, or crouch, or bend over if these are in a pocket unprotected.If you lose the little protective tip. use a wine bottle cork. It's greatThat said, they're probably my favorite, or one of my two, favorite pruners. Of many.
B00004SD76 These pruners are durable, having a locking mechanism, a protective sheath, and are quite sharp (don't run your finger against them too hard!).They make it easy do get into dense foliage, and get a perfectly angled, clean cut. Enough said.
B00004SD76 These Fiskars Consumer Prod 99216935 Pruning Snips are a good cutting little garden snip.  They are made from a stainless steel with good handles.  Fiskars products are a quality offering and these are perfect for caring for you home or yard plants pruning and upkeep.  I love them.  My wife does also and now they are hers!
B00004SD76 I have to say,I was a little worried that either the spring was going to go,or just something was going to happen to these perfectly priced trimmers.And after using these lil guys off n on for several months now,these things are worth thier weight in gold,I tell ya.LOL!Comfy,sharp and easy to clean as well.Excellent price and an even BETTER deal.
B00004SD76 These were purchased to replace a larger hand trimmer which I used on my hanging plants, herb garden, seasonal flowers, small shrubs and bushy perennials.These do a very good job on anything that would fall under the category of small and/or delicate because it has a thin and long cutting blade that makes it ideal when you want to trim something without chancing taking out half the foliage. It makes taking off snips of dill easy without damaging the plant or taking off too much.  It is also precise if you are selectively trimming small sections.The handles have a spring action device that requires almost zilch pressure and is comfortable and easy to use even when mounting a morning of garden maintenance. I used it for two hours today and my hands felt fine ----- no stiffness or discomfort.The cost is appealing. Small garden tools can get pricey and since I paid about $8 for these I thought they were reasonable.
B00004SD76 Sharp and precise pruning snips are here!  I used these pruning snips for my roses and mums.  I love the spring action handle as this was a great idea.  The tool is light-weight and the quality of Fiskars is one I can rely on.  The size is great and easy to carry with you when you have many plants to prune.  For those family members that like to borrow things and don't bring back, I labeled my snips \"Mom\" so know one can use them without my permission as I want these back!
B00004SD76 I have owned many pairs of this exact trimmer and will continue to do so. I lose them every 3-4 months. I have no idea how or why but i do. So i continue to purchase more. They are tight gripped, the spring is of high quality and will not wear after repeated long use. The shears are sharp and can get into tight spaces (what we need it for). For $11, this is one of the best trimmers you can buy. Enjoy and happy trimming
B00004SD76 I find that the tiny tips allow me to get to right spot to snip off the pepper that I want with slicing up the surrounding leaves and stems.  Nice, precise and small to fit.  Much easier harvest.
B00004SD76 I'm a landscaper, so I use these snips for deadheading fussy annuals like violas and petunias.But I used to work at a Humboldt County, CA nursery, and, um... I was probably the only person ever to buy a pair of these for legal purposes! Seriously, this is the gold standard for pot-growers who need to do trimming. What kind of trimming? Durn if I know, but I've seen them at yard sales coated with the sticky sap, and the local growers used to buy stacks of these nippers with their smelly cash, so...If you need it for either purpose, then these are the best. I've tried other brands and didn't like them as well. Keep in mind this is for cutting thin, tiny deadheads. It's not a pruning shear, it's for very detailed deadheading or nipping of very small stems.If you're doing a lot of delicate pruning like this, I'd also recommend picking up some of those thin Atlas Nitrile Touch gloves. Best gloves for tactile sensation while doing fine work.
B00004SD76 I'm really weary of buying things that are made in China. Fiskars is located in the USA. I'm unclear on the reason (RICH EXECUTIVES AND GREEDY BOARD OF DIRECTORS) why they would manufacture these snippers in China. Brings me down.Anyway. These are QUITE nice, very lightweight -- you will not be cutting anything more than thin plant material with these BUT they do reach in very nicely, nice thin blades. This operates on a naked steel wire spring, not a coiled spring, so I'm curious how long these are going to last. Comes with a thoughtful little orange plastic cone for the business end of the snippers.These are significantly superior to bonsai-type snippers or repurposed manicure scissors. Ideal for deadheading flowers. I love garden tools and these snippers are a real treat.
B00004SD76 I bought these to trim my weeds buds.  Works real nice, and the are small enough to get in and get those smaller leafs.
B00004SD76 We know that we should not pull beans off the vine if we want the plant to continue bearing.  In the past, we have used small scissors to snip, but often the blades were too short to reach back into the plant and we were knocking off tender young buds.When I saw these snippers, I did not hesitate a moment:  I bought two pair.  (Of course, I didn't want to steal all the fun of harvesting our green beans, so I bought my husband his own pair...)We love Fiskars products--they are sturdy and built to last and blades are good and sharp.  Blades stay sharp for a long time, then take very well to a sharpener.Regarding bonsai:  This snipper is too large for bonsai work:  The blades are not fine and small and exact enough.I did find another Fiskars snipper, a bit longer in the handle and the blades, that I find better for using on roses.  Longer handles and longer blades keep my fingers further away from the thorns and that's a good thing.  I looked for that product here on Amazon, but didn't find it.  I just mention it so you can be on the lookout.  The handles are different and there is a hook on the bottom of the handles to hold them together.UPDATE July 2013:  We now have only one pair...I used it to snip a small Japanese eggplant and one of the blades snapped right at the joint.  It is very vulnerable at the joint because of the hole that is drilled in each blade where they are joined together.  So, it's still a great snipper for very delicate things, but nothing more.
B00004SD76 I bought these to trim the leaves from my cannabis flowers and they work well for that. For any jobs that require more strength, get yourself something bigger/stronger.They're not perfect, they're not for heavy-duty cutting, and they're made in China.But they cut. I kept a cotton ball and some rubbing alcohol around to clean the trichomes off the blades periodically and had no problem getting through my entire crop. My hands were sore,  but you'll have that after trimming a pound and a half of high quality cannabis.  To help ease the pain, I smoked some cannabis. Worked for me.*I am a fully RCW 69.51a compliant medical cannabis patient*
B00004SD76 I'm into bonsai and I have (don't tell my wife) hundreds invested in bonsai tools. This is my go-to snipper. No it doesn't get used like it would in a commercial nursery, but, hey, it's a cheap, little, freaking scissor. I don't gunderstand the negative posts. It does what it does and it does it VERY well. I use it a few times a week for light trimming and it's perfect.
B00004SD76 I got this for me, but gave it to my wife.  I wanted something heavy-duty for cutting vines, etc. in our wooded area, but these work better for gardening / cutting fresh flowers.  I was looking for something more \"beefy\", but this seemed a little delicate for my use. My wife does enjoy this very much for her small garden.  It was likely my fault for buying this product for something that it was not intended for; and it does work very well for what it was designed to do.  I liked the rubber tip cover for when you throw it in your pocket.  I do wish that you could hang this up on a peg-board, but there's no opening to do this with, and the blades are heavier than the handle so it would hang tip down.  Instead we have to throw it in the \"gardening tool drawer\" where it is slightly more difficult to find.UPDATE: after one season of use, my wife has broken these sheers cutting in the vegetable garden.  She admits that the item that was being cut was too big for the sheers, but they should be more durable.
B00004SD76 This extremely sharp tool with its long narrow blades (and the neat safety cap that protects the blades) has been one of the handiest tools I have used in my greenhouse and garden.  I've used it for over a year and it remains sharp and the spring action remains reliable.
B00004SD76 These pruning snips are fantastic. They are super light and easy to use. The handles are comfortable and the spring action is extremely nice, even after heavy use. I really like the cases that cover the blades when they are being stored. My lefty husband and I (right-handed) can easily share them. I highly recommend them!
B00004SD76 I love these snips for pruning and cleaning up plants in my greenhouse.  The tips and blade are very sharp, so use with caution.
B00004SD76 I always have this tool on me when I'm in the yard.  It's perfect for dead heading dense flowering plant without accidentally snipping the neighboring blooms.  It has a very sharp and strong blade so you can cut only using the very tip of the sheer.  Because the point is so narrow and sharp, it comes with a orange rubber sheath to protect the blade while it's in your pocket.My only gripe with this tool is the flimsy orange clasp which breaks off very easily if you are not careful.  I've owned several copies of these sheers and I've manage to break off the clasp on all three of them by clipping branches a little larger than recommended.  Fortunately, the orange sheath keeps the blades closed, assuming you don't loose it.
B00004SD76 Perfect pruners for tiny work.  Very very sharp all the way to the tip.  Spring loaded for easy use. Would reccomend.
B00004SD76 This is my most used tool.  I keep it hidden by the kitchen sliding doors so when I go to get that rose, it's there.  It's the perfect flower cutter and comes with an orange cap to cover the blades.
B00004SD76 I have never run across a Fiskars product I did not love. These small pruners are no exception.  I found them ideal for pruning houseplants and shrubs (like azaleas) that produce small flowers and need regular deadheading.  They are a perfect fit to get between stems throughout plant. Not recommended for thorny type plants, like roses. I have every fiskars tool that I have purchased or inherited.
B00004SD76 Great trimmming sissors for a great price.....Gets right in were i needto go to trim with out getting my hands dirty and snips off cleanly..Lovem
B00004SD76 These are great for fine detail snipping.I wouldn't use them to prune a very thick branch,but for leaf work its great.
B00004SD76 Just the right size for indoor plants.  Stays sharp as long as you keep it clean.  It's a good price.
B00004SD76 I had to go with 4 stars because Amazon stated it was 7-inches long in the description but it's only 6-inches. I checked the Fiskars Website and they show it correctly at approximately 6\" in length... but it's exactly that length and the cutting edge is 2\". I have a large hand and the length does make a difference for me and I kept pushing the locking lever closed because my hand covers it and my thumb pushes the latch forward. I did trim some lilac bushes with it and it's pretty easy to use, feels the same in either the left or right hand and is quite sharp. However, since I have about 30 more bushes to go I'm going with the larger pairFiskars 9920 Garden Multi-Snip with Sheathand these will fit much better in my wife's much smaller hand. If you have a small hand they you'll likely be going with 5 stars because I can't find any other issue with it.
B00004SD76 Fiskars just doesn't seem to be what it used to. These are alright but they do have problems. When pruning with the blades at a downward angle, the locking pin slides down and locks them when you are in the middle of using them. I've had to play with them and hold the locking pin back with my thumb while I use them. The blades cut well but I wouldn't say these are worth the price.
B00004SD7B I bout this after my power company felled a couple trees on my property that were encroaching on power lines. They cut them into 2-3 foot sections (and a couple 6-8 foot sections... thanks a lot!) and left them where they lay. I cut them into standard 16\" sections with a chainsaw and got to work on them (still pretty green) with this axe.First piece I hit was a smaller section, only about 8 inches or so thick and maybe 10 in diameter. I struck dead center on the first swing, and the halves flew apart about 6 feet, leaving me with my axe burried about 2 inches deep in my chopping stump. For the smaller length pieces like this, I only really had to let this axe fall with its own weight.On to the larger pieces...I put the first 16 inch log, about 10\" diameter, up on the stump and had a one-hit split on that one, too. Now, I'm not a big guy (5'6\"), and I have only split firewood 2 or 3 times in my life. My buddies showed me proper technique on a camping trip so I wouldn't cut my leg off, but that's all the training I had. I really only planned to test the axe out on a couple pieces and save the rest for another day, but it was so much fun splitting the wood with this axe, I finished the whole lot! Not all of them were one-strike splits, mind you, and some of the more twisted or knotty pieces gave me a little trouble. This is not a magic axe. But it got through everything, including pieces that came from where the tree bifurcated. Many of my splits ended with the axe burried in the stump I was chopping on, even after going through a nice 16\" log. Left me sweaty and smiling.I also like to smoke meat, so I used it to chop some of the scrap-sized logs into chunks for my smoker. It worked well for this, but I think I'm going to buy the x7 hatchet for that purpose in the future. This axe was a little too heavy and long-handled to easily take care of the smaller work. Still, I split a large box of wood chunks with it by \"choking up\" on the handle and am thrilled with the results.I would buy this again or recommend it to others in a heartbeat. I haven't truly put it through the paces yet, and I haven't had any (major) overstrikes, so I'll try to remember to update this review in the future to reflect any problems or continued success with it.
B00004SD7B What can I say? I'm no professional axe wielder, but this tool really does the job well.  Strong. Balanced. Light-ish.  I'm really pleased with it.
B00004SD7B I have never split firewood before. This thing works great for me so it should be tremendous for an experianced person. I did order the Fiskars sharpener and sharpened it before using. First swing I missed, after that POW!! a clean split every time. Used it for over an hour without a problem.
B00004SD7B Now this is a real splitting axe, have never used a good splitter axe.  This will splits Oak real fast and clean.  The long handle is just right for power splitting.  And yes I would buy it again!
B00004SD7B I've only been splitting wood for about 10 years, but in that time I've gone through 5 axes including this one. Two were regular axes, the fiberglass handle on the one split and frayed, the head on the other came off and was not repairable. Regular axes have their place, but if you're splitting all day long they are NOT what you want.I had an old school wooden splitting maul axe I got from a buddy that I used for about two seasons, and I thought it was the best thing ever. However it weighed over 12lbs. A great muscle builder, but not quite as fun when you get older. I came across a similar splitting maul at Lowes, TrueTemper. It was great that it only weighed 7lbs, and I found I could split more in a day with it using faster swings. After 4 seasons with that, constant resharpening, I came across the hardest Oak I've ever seen. I was really struggling with the TrueTemper, finding myself constantly having to take double swings to get through a piece (sometimes more). It was embarrassing almost, until I had a party one night and 4 different guys tried the axe on this tree and all failed equally. It was perfectly sharp and at the proper angle, I just couldn't easily get through the wood..Then I found this.. I instantly found myself just TEARING through the wood, like it was nothing. I honestly couldn't believe it. This axe is 6.25lbs, about 3/4lb lighter then the TrueTemper. So I could more easily, and with slightly more speed swing it. I think the key to it's victors is the angle of the blade and the maul/wedge. The blade edge (long ways) angles back towards the handle so when you strike the wood you don't have to compensate for the axe to hit it at the perfect angle (although depending on the wood height you still need to hit it right). Then the wedge is a much lesser degree of incline then the Lowes, that the maul has a chance of getting into the wood and pushing through before the maul starts splitting it apart. The Lowes one had a much steeper angle towards the edge of the blade, so it on really hard wood it was getting stuck there as soon as the blade touched the wood.There's honestly no other splitting maul options in my mind. I could never recommend anything other then this, because it is simply the best in all splitting situations. Other good points on it is :-corrosion resistant head steel (although please don't leave it outside, it will dual the edge)-hollowed out handle thats even more lightweight, but EXTREMELY strong-lifetime limited warranty-strong head through handle design, looks much more durable then your standard axe or maul-head cover to protect the blade and anyone/thing that might come in contact with it.I also recommend getting theFiskars 7861 Axe and Knife Sharpenerand hitting it frequently. I usually don't go more then a 1/4 of a cord without sharpening, sometimes an 1/8th. It definitely makes it a lot more easier to split - especially for hard or wet wood.
B00004SD7B My old, heavy maul frequently got stuck in the piece of wood.  This one bounces out until it splits, eliminating the effort to pull it back out of the wood and getting it part way into position for the next stroke.  I can also split larger pieces of wood with it.
B00004SD7B Never splitting wood before I went into this venture a bit nervous.  But I did end up splitting a 1/4 cord of wood from big logs rather easily.  I heard the trick was speed. However I found just the normal almost over the head with &#34;no extra push&#34; but having good control worked every time.  The bade did exhibit tiny chips, but I kept it sharpened as several recommended.  The price is great and it feels virtually impossible to break. Although I read some had broken the handle. I did over swing once but it did not seem to mark the handle. It did make me concentrate that much harder. I did find stepping back a half of step kept me from compensating as I bent coming forward. I am sure each person swing is a bit different.
B00004SD7B I've cut down hundreds of trees and have split all the wood by hand.  I've been through two different mauls, and this my friends, is the best I've used.  It's lighter, but it splits like a maul twice its weight.  I just wanted to try it out when I first got it, so I took a few pieces of some hardwood into the driveway just to see how far it would go down into the wood - I never expected it to slice completely threw and still have enough energy to makes a nice chip in the concrete.  All I can say is wow, I immediately went inside and ordered the 14\" and 8\" hatchets & fiskars sharpener.  I'm 6'4\" and yes, the first couple of strikes I noticed the difference in the length of the handle - however if you follow proper form when splitting wood, you are in absolutely no danger of hitting your shins or feet. I quickly became accustomed to the shorter handle and because of its design, it does not require the \"windup\" and force of the longer and heavier mauls.  Buy it.
B00004SD7B This is a great axe. It is the perfect length and weight for my husband and me. We use the axe to split wood for our fire pit in the back yard. The axe blade is very sharp, and I have found that the Fiskars axe sharpener (Fiskars 7861 Axe and Knife Sharpener) works amazingly to resharpen the blade any time it seems to get dull. The handle fits nicely in my hand and is comfortable when splitting wood. I love this axe and recommend it to all.
B00004SD7B Well balanced and comfortable. This axe does an excellent job splitting smaller to mid sized logs.Edge maintains with a lot of use.Handle seems unbreakable.A quality peice of equipment! Another fiskars winner.
B00004SD7B A great feeling splitting axe. Very comfortable in my hands and allows me to split wood easily. 
B00004SD7B Amazons service was a great. Even though I used Supersaver they shipped it right out using UPS and I got it 3 days later. Thanks Amazon.Let me say in general I despise Fiskar tools and never buy them. While some are very well designed the price point demanded by all you people who buy made in China or made India lousy products at Home Depot means Fiskar has to lower the price point to where the quality is not commercial. Fiskar tools in general are not commercial and I have destroyed or worn out every Fiskar tool in short order as I have a large property and commercial orchards and timber land and  my tools are heavily used especially by the 'help' that does not have to pay for the tools.In general I stick with Gransfour Bruks (Sweden), Vaughn (USA), Estwing (USA), Milwaukee (USA-electric saw), Silky Saws /cutting hatchets (Japan) or the professional Grade Husqvarna chainsaws when it comes to felling timber.I took down a big ponderosa pine and was splitting it green. My  near six pound maul was having problems with the big rounds as the wood was very wet. And it is a hassle to use a wedge and 8/10 pound hammer. And my 8 lb maul had a broken handle.Gransfour Bruks does not make an 8 lb maul. I checked the USA sources. No one made an 8 lb maul.I checked with Craftmans who while they do give a lifetime guarantee make their 8 lb Mauls in China now. So no 8 lb splitting mauls made in the USA anymore that I could find, if you know of one let me know. I have my old 8 pound maul head which was made by Craftsman in the USA but have to find a handle for it. Glad I saved the head now.China  is gutting the USA with its currency rigging and we send them fake paper money and they send lousy products with a lot of 'cheating' in the steel quality so fat cat Home Depot Shareholders and Fat Cat Chinese sweat shop owners is all you have and then you get a lousy axe and the \"opportunity' to make yourself poorer and Home Depot Shareholders and the Communist Chinese richer. And a sharp, well designed long lasting tool is the safest tool.Sad to see Craftsman Tools which are nearly commercial grade  go to China. People buying these cheap made in China tools at Home Depot or Sears are hurting us all and especially the people who need commercial grade tools or the 20 pc of America that is unemployed. It is unethical to buy tools made in communist china or india as they use slave labor and you're taking a job away from an American/Canadian and china/india rigs it currency to give its manufacturers the ability to drive USA quality vendors out of business. Buy local. It is 'greener' for this politically correct generation of MTV bra....er kids to buy local.I was very skeptical about the review about this axe, given my prior experience to wear out Fiskar tools in no time or have the help break them in no time,  but I ordered one against my better judgement as Fiskar tools are at least made in Finland which has good protection for labor. And the Finns have a big timber cutting industry they manage well so I suspected maybe the Axe was better or the Finns would just buy the Granfours Bruks' axes from Sweden. So the pressure was on Fiskars to come up with something world class. They surely delivered. This is a superb tool!!This axe is very, very well balanced and designed,  as well balanced and designed as the Gransfour Bruks splitting axe or splitting maul which is saying a lot. It splits like a dream and has the same splitting ability as an 8 lb maul at a much lighter weight which really, really surprised me. So it is particularly good for older people like me that are starting to have trouble with swinging the big mauls all day. The ergonomics are perfect for a 6 foot tall man. The blade keeps its splitting edge well. Splitting a Cord of Pine is near effortless. The only problem is I don't get the good workout anymore the splitting is so effortless. You might not even break a sweat splitting with this axe if you touch up the edge after every cord with a stone. I'm a strong big guy and I was splitting wet 1 foot ponderosa rounds with a 3/4 raise and one arm. It Split just from the gravity fall with the dull factory edge. Truly amazing. Not even my Gransfour splitting axe does that and they shipped it with a dull edge for safety when I tried the dull edge first cut test with just a one arm 3/4 raise. This axe was truly amazing once I put a professional edge on it and got after those 30 in rounds with no problems although you do need some skill to crack a wet 30 inch round on the first go.FYI - Never ever take a splitting axe or maul behind your head. Learn to split and/or you need to get a heavier axe. I never take ad axe behind my head and have never seen professional fallers or buckers to so at least back in the days when they did not have chainsaws and people learned how to use an axe properly.I would have preferred a leather sheath but the plastic one it comes with is very clever. Plastic is not good for the environment. You can always grow more cows or wood.The only question I have is if the handle well hold up and how easy it is to replace. Fiskar steel is better than average, not as good as say Silky Saw steel or Gransfours Bruk steel which is world class,  but it is as good as Estwing steel or Vaughn steel so it is great steel. This axe has a commercial grade head as far as steel quality. It is a great, great head.I gave it five stars as for the price you can't beat this splitting axe. For the homeowner or non professional  you cant beat this splitting axe and the only shame is that Vaughn or Estwing don't make a splitting maul or heavy splitting axe in the USA. This axe is the bomb as this generation says.The only question is how many 'years' of hard use can you get out of the axe handle for professional splitters. But you could buy 4 of these for the price of the Gransfour  maul and this splits better although Gransfours won't like to hear that. The Granfours of course last several generations the steel quality is so good so if you don't want to have your kids buy tools go with Granfours axes and maul if you can afford them. I inherited my grandfathers gransfour axes and I am an old man now and they still cut/split like they were new.Given what is available in the market for high quality 6-8 pound mauls not made in China or India or the third world  this splitting axe is the best choice for the home owner with a lot of wood to split especially big rounds. It really cracks those big rounds I was using a estwing wedge and 8/10 lb Vaughn sledge to break.Looks like they are selling enough of these I can get a new handle if it breaks and the handle is under warranty but I always misplace receipts. I'm going to put some coffee can tin underneath the head to extend the life of the handle as the head is a 'perfect' design. They should give a raise to the engineer who designed this axe. I will  buy a few more of these.In summary a superbly designed axe with capability to split equal to a good usa made 8 lb maul with near commercial quality ex for the handle and lack of a leather sheath. For the price you can't beat this tool and its made in  Finland where the government respects labor and not China or India nations looking to gut and steal USA and Canadian jobs by rigging their currency and employing child labor.Too bad about the cheap looking plastic sheath. A leather sheath and a commercial grade handle of top quality hickory would make this a forever tool and I would gladly pay $75 dollars or more to get the upgrade to the commercial handle and a good sheath. Gransfour is on the run with this axe at last. Heck I would pay 125 dollars for his head on a commercial grade handle it is that good.Thanks Fiskar. Thanks for providing us with an ethical buying choice and such a superb design. Fix your other tool lines and I will be a buyer. This makes up for all the other Fiskar tools I wore out or the help broke. So Fiskar owed me as I don't take back tools I wear out. That is my job to be a buyer and pay a fair price for high quality.This axe has HIGH QUALITY although its is nothing to look at as far as aesthetics. Only Gransfour makes beautiful axes anymore.
B00004SD7B This is the first Axe I have ever owned. (Not the first axe I have ever used.)  I am very pleased with it.  At first the head seemed to make the axe feel off balance and heavy, but as I got to using it, it helped get momentum building to make splitting the wood almost effortless.
B00004SD7B I have never picked up an axe in my life but in a few hours I split over a cord of wood.  This axe is incredible.  If you are on the fence, don't be!  Buy this axe now!!!
B00004SD7B If you&#8217;re looking for a well made axe and you don&#8217;t want to spend over a hundred dollars to get it then this is what you should buy!  I have beat the hell out of mine so far this wood season and so far I&#8217;ve gone through over 6 cords of tamarack pine and oak and this thing never seems to tire me out!  Love the light weight handle which is not cheaply made, but absorbs most of the off strikes and doesn&#8217;t seem the worse for wear, just some nice scars.  Holds an excellent edge and cuts through wood like a hot knife through butter.  EXCELLENT PRODUCT!
B00004SD7B Had a tree cut down in the spring. Picked this guy up to make some firewood for the summer. It is comfortable in the hands and splits wood as if it was a mellon. I've even used it to cut down some Honeysuckle and a small tree. No problems what so ever. The product was shipped on time and packaged well.
B00004SD7B I bought the 36 inch Fiskars Splitting Axe based on the great reviews of it here early in the Spring of 2013.  I like the long handle and it works good for someone of my height (6 feet).  I can say this wood splitter has been as good as people say it is and is by far the best wood splitter I have owned.  I used to go though a wood handle on my old wood splitter every year because of wear and tear with an occasional miss of my target.  This wood splitter is far lighter and far more durable.  I have cut about 4 cords of wood with it so far and am very pleased with how it works.As many others point out, you will need to keep this sharp for it to work correctly, and I recommend getting the Fiskars 7861 Axe and Knife Sharpener along with this.  I sharpen it every hour or two of good use.  If I notice the wood isn't splitting well, I sharpen it again (it is easy to loose track of time when splitting wood).  I keep the cover on it at all times when not in use as this is not something you want to fall on anything accidentally.I want to thank everyone here for their insightful reviews, which got me to buy this and to Fiskers for making such a great product.  I have been splitting wood for about 10 years now and I only wish I knew about this product when I first started.  I cannot recommend this product enough!
B00004SD7B After splitting hundreds of cords of firewood, this is the best splitting maul that I've used.  The hollow handle cuts down on the weight and the efficient design of the wedge make splitting wood much easier.  I was able to split 3-foot cedar rounds relatively easily after failing to be able to with my old splitting maul.  I use the 36 inch handle, but sometimes choke up a bit to get more force.  This is an excellent design that allows you to split wood more quickly with less effort.
B00004SD7B This is an item I purchased based on reviews.  I barely looked at any other splitting axes.The reviewers were right.I am new to splitting, but watched some videos to learn.  This is a solid axe, yet the lightweight handle gives a great balance and reduces fatigue versus heavier, wood versions.  I have a lot of Fiskars tools so I know their plastic-composite is incredibly strong.  They also have a great warranty.In short, if you use this axe how you are supposed to, you will not have a problem splitting logs.
B00004SD7B With a yard full of cut oak and a 20-year-old axe, progress was slow until this dimwit figured out he needed a new axe. After a little bit of research I decided on the Fiskars X27 with the longer handle. After several days of chopping wood I am a believer. The axe arrived in a timely manner with a sharp edge burrowed safely in the protective, snug fitting head cover.Some of the oak sections left for me are 17-20 inches in diameter, an impossibility for my old axe. With the Fiskars I made quick work of a 17&#34; piece and an 11&#34; log today. In fact with three hits I was able to split the larger log right down the middle. For other pieces instead of hitting in the middle I chopped pieces off of the edges until the log was small enough to split in the middle.I like this new axe quite a bit. It's sturdy, nicely designed aesthetically, and cuts like nothing I've ever used before without needing the strength of Hercules. The Fiskars is just a little longer than my old axe and is just the right length for this 5 foot 10 inche amateur lumberjack. Occasionally I forgot about those few extra inches of length and hit my target with the axe handle. Eventually I learned to stand back just a little further.At first I wondered if any product could live up to so many positive affirmations. This axe does and for me is well worth the money.
B00004SD7B This Super Splitting axe does exactly what it's supposed to do.  The handle is unbreakable.  Really.  It has very good balance.  Perfect weight.  The shape of the handle fits the hand well, and the curve at the end of the handle makes gripping it easier.  It's very well designed.  It's the favorite of all the guys on the Arborist site.  Great tool  Great price on Amazon.
B00004SD7B Best combination maul/axe I have found.Sharp,lifetime guarantee,great ergonomics.Another Fiskars product that is well worth the money.Stlii made in Nordic Country,the quality and innovation shows.I like the Teflon coating a lot,no more prying out a stuck maul,it is so well balanced,it is fun again to Chop Wood!
B00004SD7B I wrote reviews on my other Fiskars products and this one is King of them All. I love this axe. With this woodsplitting axe you will not want to own any other splitter. This baby smashes through logs with one medium force swing. The logs explode. I couldn't believe how much wood I split the first day I had this axe. It comes with a great head cover, the axe is light and I think the handle is indestructible. Best money you will ever spend on an axe, especially for wood splitting. No wedges required.
B00004SD7B I got this to cut wood for camping and a backyard fire pit.  It's a great axe and the weight is about perfect.  I cut oak, hackberry, and mesquite.
B00004SD7B One of my many home defense weapons.  Not sure if I would grab this first but it could be fun.
B00004SDY5 + Doesn't leak+ Simple design+ Easy to connect/disconnect- A bit priceyOverall, very happy, these are nice!  I hope they last in the weather/sun.
B00004SDY5 Unfortunately nothing beats gardena. They kepp tight even after years and years of usage. connect as well as disconnect easy.My parents have some that are at least 20 years old and still fine.I am not sure how many attachments are available in the US but in Europe, this is the Rolls Royce of water hoses. You can get sprnklers, waterguns whatever you can imagine....and of course they are REALLY expensive.....well, you get what you pay for.Before I forget, one thing that makes these connectors so great. Once you disconnect the water stops! No dripping and when you connect the &#34;hot&#34; hose...you will not get drenched......If I was unclear pls ask, I will answer if I can
B00004SDY5 These use universal metric/US hose connector sizes that should fit either or (I'm using them on US sized threads). I bought two sets of these to go on various hoses, pressure washer, sprayers, sprinklers, virtually every watering device and hose I have has these connected on it. It makes it incredibly simple to switch devices on the hose without having to shut off the water. For the past 6 months I have heavily used all of them and none have leaked at the quick connector or the screw fittings! You can pick up a set of o-ring from harbor freight or buy the proper ones from Gardena to replace the quick connectors if they fail (haven't had any issues yet). You can also try to oil them to bring them back to life, especially if you've left it out over winter.These seem really durable. I have had these on hoses and sprayers that have dropped on pavement and not broken off. I've had several cheaper hose fittings that either started leaking within the first year or broke apart the first time they touched pavement. I expect these to last many years without needing replacement.Had a slight issue when I ordered one of the packages was missing one of the female quick connect fittings from the box - Amazon quickly replaced though. Otherwise these are quality connectors that I will continue to stick with Gardena from now on.
B00004SDY5 These are easy to use and perform well as expected. Delivery was fast and the contents were unharmed. The price is higher than comparable products but that is the case with all Gardena items. Worth the extra cost.
B00004SDY5 I thought that a plastic quick connect might turn out to be cheesy, but I gave them a try anyway.After only one month at the end of a light duty hose, the male end just snapped in half. The plastic sheared in half at the middle of the fitting with the male end still engaged into the female snap. Yup, it was under normal water pressure but it wasn't like I was using the hose as a tow rope, or pumping benzene through it.I've had both brass and aluminum hose quick connects wear out over the years, but never snap in half like that.Next time I'll listen to that little voice.
B00004SDY5 I was certain this product would leak but I have had it hooked up to water under pressure for  some time now and have not noticed a single drip. I will add more to other quick connect purposes.
B00004SDY5 Hello. My name is Momster and I am a gadget lover. Oh, I am also lazy...I got sick and tired of screwing and unscrewing my garden hoses whenever I wanted to swap from nozzle to sprinkler. Much to my delight, I found these years ago when buying a new sprinkler (a Gardena) and haven't been able to do without these since.I have a two-way connector attached to my spigot with a QC (Quick Connector), one side goes to our auto-timer that runs the sprinkler (told you I was a lazy gadget lover!!), and one to the regular cleaning/tasking hose. On the end of my tasking hose is another QC so I can slap on another sprinkler or nozzle with very little effort. Because I have a QC on the spigot as well, I can easily change hose configuration without breaking my back because I'd have to bend over AND twist around to access that one.NOTE: Because these are made of plastic, they do have a limited life - especially if you leave them out all year long. (Been there, done that.)  The summer sun and winter freeze will cause the pieces to crack sometimes, so be sure to check them before you use them at the start of the season.Part of the fun is figuring out which pieces should go to what. Have fun with that. But honestly, once you get everything figured out, you'll wonder why in the world you struggled so long without them...especially as you get older....it's no fun playing Twister to get at the spigot.
B00004SDY5 I much prefer snap connectors thought they tend to be overpriced.  Gardena is my favorite brand.  I usually remove the autostop valve inside.
B00004SDY5 This is great!  Sure beats screwing and unscrewing hoses & attachments.  One came with the Gardena Sprikler that I odered and I liked it so much that I ordered the Starter Set for all my other attachments.  Now I just plug and unplug.
B00004SQ1N I wanted a patio box to reduce the clutter of watering cans, garden supplies, and other odds and ends that sat on my patio.  This one is perfect!  It's a great size, not too big, is sturdy, and was a breeze to assemble (no tools needed).  Very happy with this purchase.
B00004SQ1N I have 2 of these. One is a year old and I just ordered a 2nd. They work great to keep things dry and make my yard look less cluttered with stuff.
B00004SQ1N I put this together in about 5 minutes and it's sitting on my back porch right now.  It's strong enough for a 200lb person to sit on comfortably and it's roomy enough inside for all my pool equipment, pool toys, and other miscellaneous things that were sitting around making a mess.  The porch looks great now without all of the clutter!  I'm thinking of buying a second one since I liked this one so much.
B00004SQ1N The size of this item as described is the very maximum outside dimensions.  Anything you want to put inside it will need to fit the interior of a box about 2 inches less on width, length and height.  Not saying the info is deceptive, just not as clear as it might be!  I have a small air compressor that I thought would fit inside it because it is a bit less than the 21 inch height from the description but the inside of the box is a little under 18&#34;.  I was able to make it work by leaving out the bottom tray and trimming away some of the reinforcing ribs in the lid...which reduces the strength making it unsuitable for sitting on but I didn't plan to sit on it anyway.
B00004SQ1N I ordered 2 of these, we really like them.  They are well made and I think they will last a long time outside holding our misc. items (water hoses; electric cords; pool vacuum; etc.).  I don't think they are strong enough to use as a seat, but, we don't need them for that.
B00004SQ1N I am very happy with this deck box. It is very roomy. I keep all my garden supplies there. It was very easy to install, just 5 min, snap all the parts and it is ready to use. It is sturdy too. We sit on it and it holds me, my husband and my 3 years old with no problems. I actually store there some vegetables and fruits, like potato and apples, when I do not have room in refrigerator and I know that animals won't get it. It nicely blends with my white walls of the house.
B00004SQ1X Here in Houston I go through one of these reels every 3 years give or take a bit. What happens is the central support for the wheel simply snaps and the reel then hangs at an odd angle. Soon, it will just fall off. At least it gives a bit of warning.Examining the carcasses of my dead reels I've learned that the plastic bleaches in the sun and the heat and then becomes brittle. It just crumbles. If the reel is full of hose, that extra weight doesn't help much either.I'm going to try knocking back to just 50 feet of hose instead of the full reel of hose. My experienced guess is that will work  better. Also I'll spray some UV protectant on the hub before I mount the reel. That may help.So why do I keep buying these if they don't last too long? Well, for one I've got my holes drilled in the brick and I really like just being able to slap the new unit in place of the old one without drilling even more holes for some new reel which may or may not last any longer than this one. Also, I don't see where anybody makes a side winding reel that is that much better than this one for the price at this time.
B00004SQ1X This is the second of theses reels I have purchased.  The first one broke after much use due to the stress and a heavy hose I had installed.  This time I purchased a much lighter weight hose and it works great.
B00004SQ1X I bought a STA100 at True Value Hardware this morning. It ran $23.99 + tax = $25.50. (With a store buyers card). It's slightly different than the one I replaced, requiring me to drill 3 new holes. Not an issue with me. Like other reviews I've read, the round parts that are on either side of the wrapped hose were also warped. That means it came from the factory/shipper that way. There was no damage to the shipping box. Perhaps the heat from the sun will help straighten that out. I also read their 5 year warranty, which I doubt I would ever use. The defective one needs to be shipped back to the company at owners expense, they will fix or replace it, then you must pay for return shipping. That is NOT a good or reasonable warranty. Still, I'm satified with my purchase. UPDATE: IT DIDN'T EVEN LAST ONE YEAR. WHILE I LIVE IN ARIZONA WHERE IT'S HOT, THE PLASTIC DRIED OUT AND FRONT PART WITH THE HOSE FELL OFF AFTER BREAKING. IT'S NOW USELESS AND IN THE TRASH. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY. OR AT LEAST DO NOT BUY ONE THAT MOUNTS ON A WALL. CHANGE MY RATING TO A 1 OR 2.
B00004SQ1X The fatal flaw with the design of this hose reel is that it can not support the weight of a 100' hose full of water. The first problem was that the wheel part wanted to separate from the spindle due to the weight of hose.  Finally the part you screw to the wall gave way and broke in half after about a year.  This is a waste of money - anything plastic is essentially junk.  I have now replaced it with a full metal version from another maker that was about three times the price.  It looks like it will work forever.  Also, this reel BARELY is able to hold 100ft of 5/8\" hose.  It is probably more suited for 50 or 75ft.  If I had it to do all over again, I would have purchased a quality reel the first time.
B00004SQ1X I've had this for four years.  It leaked from day one.  Finally took it down to see if I could fix it.  The replacement part from Suncast costs 64 cents but the shipping is $9.50. On a 4 year old item, replacing the part doesn't make sense. Since this hose is right next to my front door, I have to have some sort of reel.  I'll look elsewhere.
B00004SZ9D This stovetop smoker is amazing.  We currently own theChar Broil Silver Smokerand it take 5+ hours to smoke fish and meats.  The stovetop smoker can achieve the same results in about 30-40 minutes.  I love using different varietities of the smoking chips and foods come out tender, juicy and full of flavor.  Clean up is simple since I use foil to line the bottom of the drip pan.  All I have to do is toss out the smoking chips ashes, peel back the aluminum foil, give it a quick wash and rinse to get any moisture or any food splatter on the lid  and store it until the next use.  This unit does not fill your house with smoke but you can smell the wonderful aroma of cedar, apple, mesquite or whatever flavor of chips you use.Since I have a smooth top stove and do not want to scratch the surface, I use the stovetop smoker on top ofSanyo HPS-SG3 200-Square-Inch Electric Indoor Barbeque Grill, Blackand also use it on with myWeber 586002 Q 320 Portable Outdoor Gas Grill.  Using it on the Weber Grill gets slower cooking results but it is great to take to picnics and camping to smoke up those fish you catch!
B00004SZ9D This stove top smoker is one of the best products I have ever used (and I use it often).  I have had this thing for about 5 or 6 years now.  It is as good as the day I bought it.  I smoke chicken and ribs mainly but you can smoke just about anything that you could in a regular smoker (just not as much in terms of amount).  It is easy to clean and the wood chips are reasonable in price.  You only use about a teaspoon to a tablespoon depending on what you are smoking.  I would highly recommend this product.  The best wood to use is hickory (it is the all around best for all types of meats).  The next best as far as i have found is the Cherry.  It imparts a nice fruity taste to meat.  If anything happens to this smoker, I will certainly buy another one.  This product is one that lasts and lasts!
B00004SZ9D I have not used this product yet, but it is very heavy and lots of wood chips came with it. I am looking forward to having the time to fool with it.
B00004SZ9D I have NEVER used this product after purchasing two or three years ago.  Other reviewers seemed to like it so I gave it five stars.  I have packed it away somewhere and will give it away to anyone who wants it.
B00004SZ9D pick a flavor of smoke, get some of Cameron's wood dust in that flavor and get ready to smoke stovetop style, any season.  just great flavor.
B00004SZ9D I lived in a condo for years and really missed cooking outdoors and the tremendous flavor of food slow smoked in a smoker.  I bought this awhile ago and have been pretty happy with it.  It's stainless steel, durable and comes with samples of 4 different types of wood chips. You can buy more from Cameron international or Amazon.com. I use it all the time and never have any problems with smoke filling up the kitchen and the smoke detector never goes off. It's a closed unit so virtually all of the smoke stays inside.  If there is a problem with smoke escaping, the instructions include tips on how to correct the problem.  Usually, the lid just needs a little tweaking.I think the first thing I smoked in it was salmon and let me tell you it was delicious! I have also smoked chicken, turkey wings, sweet potatoes, potatoes, shrimp, burgers, and cheese all with excellent results.  I put the potatoes in the microwave for a few minutes to shorten the cooking time. The chicken doesn't brown as in a traditional outdoor smoker or grill but you can finish cooking it in the oven to brown it.  If it's smoke flavor you are after, this is a very good alternative to outdoor smoking!Cleaning the smoker is a breeze if you first spray the rack with cooking spray.  Also if you line the base of the smoker and the drip pan with aluminum foil all you have to do is let it cool completely and dump the foil in the trash.  This will help to keep your pans from getting black and shortens clean up time.
B00004SZ9D I just tried my stovetop smoker and was amazed at the results.  I've used a large outdoor smoker for years, and was skeptical about the stovetop smoker.  I used it to prepare chicken breasts, and they cooked fast and were juicy and tender, and had just the right amount of smoke flavor.  I'm looking forward to using my stovetop smoker for seafood and vegetables.  It's a great way to add flavor to food, and a very healthy way to cook.The smoker is constructed from heavy steel and is well made.  I could smell the smoke as the food cooked, but it wasn't intense and there was no smoke in the house.  I'll still use my outdoor smoker for batch cooking or for smoking large birds, but expect to get a lot of use out of the stovetop smoker.
B00004SZ9D Used once and really like it. I smoked whole chicken, but I cut chicken in half and smoked about 1.5 hours on lower heat. The chips birned, so next time I would add more chips. I did have to finish chicket (to add some crispiness) in the oven for 10 min. The chicken came out excellent, best chicken I ever cooked. With chicken smoked potato and came out very nice as well with delicate flavor of smoke. Also, I considered as a bonus the aroma of smoked wood that fill out my house, loved it. It was not strong, but flavorful. Highly recommend this product.
B00004TBJ7 I've had this grill for about two months now and I love it. It's nice to see that Char-broil has taken the initiative to break free from the standard black, rectilinear grill. This grill tucks neatly into the corner of my back deck and looks great. Friends are always commenting on it.As for cooking, the smaller grill surface has proven to be ample for parties of four when cooking fish, steaks or skewered items. For sandwich-style grilling (e.g., hamburgers, hotdogs, etc.) you can cook for twice that many. The cooking surface itself is a refreshing change as well; the metal slats are thick and give restaurant-style grill marks to your food, while providing more surface area for smaller items to sit on. The Patio Caddie comes with hickory-scented briquettes that enhance the flavor and mask the gas scent.Be sure to consider the Patio Caddie if you're in the market for a high quality gas grill in this price range. You can't go wrong!
B00004TBJ7 I've owned the Char-Broil Patio Caddie for quite a few years and I am currently on my 2nd grill.  For those looking for a compact grill to use on a small patio or balcony, I believe that this is the best grill that you'll find.I'm not sure if the other reviews mention this or not, but this grill does accept a full-size propane cannister, so you can just swap it out at your local drug or hardware store when it's empty.  My grill did come with the smaller cannister, but I bought it quite awhile ago, so perhaps they no longer do.  If yours doesn't, it's no great loss, in my view, because once again, I've never used the smaller cannister.  Just get yourself a full-sized one and it will last a lot longer.The temperature gauge seems very accurate and the grill is quite durable. I figure that this grill should last you about 5-6 years, with regular use.  I'd definitely recommend it and I'd also suggest buying the cover to keep it looking nice on the outside as well.
B00004TBJ7 This is a perfect grill for small groups.  I typically only grill for my wife and I so the size is perfect.  It wasn't too difficult to assemble and the parts machining is excellent, everything fit together very well.  I have only 2 problems with this grill.  First, the hangers you attach to the lid to allow you to hang the lid from the side of the grill are quite a pain when placing the lid.  Makes it difficult for the lid to fit snugly.  Not a problem, I'll just take the hangers off as they don't work that well anyway.  Second, I grilled on it 2 days ago, on a fairly calm day weather wise.  For some reason the flame kept going out.  Took me an hour to grill 4 steaks, should have only taken 20 minutes.  Not sure what causes this problem as I haven't ready anyone else experiencing it.  It's annoying enough that it keeps the grill from getting 5 stars.
B00004TBJ7 I bought this a replacement for one exactly like it.  The old one finally was put to rest after many years of use by my parents.  This compact grill is easy to use and uses up very little space.  Perfect for a small deck.  Great construction and easy set up.  The one drawback was that the new grill did not come with the two side tables that the original grill had. I took them off the old grill and installed them on the new one.
B00004TBJ7 I love this grill, it is deceptively small from the outside. You can probably fit 8-10 burgers on it. It takes up a third of the space as my old \"Grill 2 Go\" portable grill. It has an attractive dark green finish. As others have said, it heats evenly unlike most grills which focus the heat along the burner.The only reason I'm giving it three starts is because Amazon (and the Char Broil) site lists it as having a propane tank included. From reading the Amazon description and some other reviewers comments, it should've come with a smaller propane tank. According to the Char Broil site there should be a 20 pound tank. I sent Amazon an email followed by a phone call, and they stated that there should've been a tank, so they immediately sent me a new grill, had it the next day, great customer service! But this one, like the first box said on the outside \"LP tank not included.\" I called Amazon now, and the rep agreed that there should be a tank, and sending a third unit would be pointless as it would probably not have a tank. Amazon offered me a $30 refund to cover the cost of a 20 pound tank purchased locally, which was an acceptable resolution.
B00004TBKI This would have been a zero star review if I could have done that.  Yellowjackets would fly around it but would not enter.  After three weeks I tried to return and Amazon didn't even want the POS returned, just gave me a credit.  I guess not having to return it is worth one star.
B00004TBKI Don't waste your time or money on this peace of pretty plastic.  Using the bait that came with it and the bait refills I bought extra, it never trapped one yellow jacket in an area well populated with the little pests.  Save your money and get a good fly swatter and some spray for the nests.
B00004TBKI With the included attractant I caught one yellowjacket.  They preferred to go to the hummingbird feeder and when I took the feeder down they flew away.  Using apple juice I caught some even with the feeder up and more when I took the feeder down.  They live for several days and most of them eventually escaped at night.  Next year I will put this in the refrigerator each night to chill the yellowjackets, kill them while they are torpid, and then put it back up.  Apple juice worked in the fall but something else might be required in the spring.
B00004TBKI By far, the most effective pest control for Yellowjackets I've ever come across.  How effective you ask?  We had a major Yellowjacket problem and I went to 4 stores...all of which were out of this trap.  At each store, there was at least 1 person (one place had 3) looking around for the traps because of the yellowjacket problems in this area.  Finally the 5th place I stopped had just restocked and their shelves were full...and yes, there were 2 people already picking them up when I arrived.Come home, put the solution on the cotton ball and by the end of the first 12 hours, we had caught 13 yellowjackets.  I come home tonight from work and we are now up to 25 yellowjackets this device has captured in under 24 hours!Now those are measurable results!EDIT:I just added a photo...over 40 yellow jackets trapped in just 3 days!
B00004TBKI Great and effective product for YJ's only. No food attracts hornets and really foul smelly stuff attracts flies, but this is great for YJ's. Other wasps and hornets are attracted to the activity but they like fresh meat/bugs. Fly catchers (stinky bags) attract hornets and wasps to the live bugs. I have used these for many years. Use these units with the larger 10 week cartridge, and place the small pack bait (available at Amazon) on it when it gets weak, reuse with this type of cheaper bait in the larger cartridge each year, but check that there are no webs covering the bottom holes and/or internal cone hole, or YJ's will leave. It works very well to catch queens looking to build nests in April, and keep them out until Sept. to get workers of queens that were missed. Very effective. Move to another location if no luck in 2 weeks, or if very few are caught. Load indoors or after sunset, or you might get stung. Hint, this old fish smell works well in the spring, sweet attractant works better before hybernation in the fall in a different type of catcher; one you can put juice, beer, or other sweet attractant, with a drop of soap, recharge with water but add a drop of non-fragrant dish soap as it evaporates.
B00004TBKI Does not seem to actually capture YJ's, but their annoying buzzing stopped when I put one of these about 20' outside of my veggie garden. Somehow it seems to work. YJ's, hornets, were making nests in the GROUND, in dying roots from pine trees which I had cut down YEARS ago...the roots seem to never completely rot, but leave a hollow which apparently invites these guys. And they are protective of their nest area.I use the stuff which comes with the trap, nothing fancy like apple juice and peanut butter.I bought a 2nd one this year for near an apple tree where these guys get their sips from fallen apples or apples which the birds have started to pick on. Hope it works there too.Recommend.
B00004TBKI Never enough around, re-ordered product; easy to use though this current model is missing the hanging string.  Works well for 30-45 days until the scent diminishes.  It is an effective product.
B00004TBKI We had hundreds of wasps in our tree so I ordered one of these, followed the instructions and waited for the massacre.  NOT ONE DEAD WASP after 3 weeks of use.  I changed bait for 3 more weeks, nothing. I changed bait again and still nothing after another month.  I half expected the wasps to build a nest around it. Bah, annoying.
B00004TBKK Washed out my 'old' trap that I have been using for several years, placed a 'new' cartridge in the trap and had begun capturing wasps or yellow jackets by the next morning. Keeps my backyard free of the pests...
B00004TBKK Very effective, I am able to keep my garden and yard relatively yellow jacket free and I can enjoy sting free outdoors.
B00004TBKK I have a time to time yellow jacket problem where I live so I bought a yellow jacket trap and this bate to help with the problem.  I followed the instructions and hung it in an area well populated with yellow jackets.  I left it there for weeks and it never trapped one yellow jacket.  Yesterday I took it down and threw it in the trash.  Waste of money.
B00004TBKK This attractant works excellent for YJ's and I have been using Recue successfully for several years. Easy to place and reusable units and these cartridges can be easily resused by adding liguid from the less expensive plastic refills. However, I believe these cartridges last longer and are a better value. Great price at Amazon. Must be used in the effective Rescue canisters. They really work great!! Highly recommend!Great and effective product for YJ's only. No food attracts hornets and really foul smelly stuff attracts flies, but this is great for YJ's. Other wasps and hornets are attracted to the activity but they like fresh meat/bugs. Fly catchers (stinky bags) attract hornets and wasps to the live bugs. I have used these for many years. Use these units with the larger 10 week cartridge, and place the small pack bait (available at Amazon) on it when it gets weak, reuse with this type of cheaper bait in the larger cartridge each year, but check that there are no webs covering the bottom holes and/or internal cone hole, or YJ's will leave. It works very well to catch queens looking to build nests in April, and keep them out until Sept. to get workers of queens that were missed. Very effective. Move to another location if no luck in 2 weeks, or if very few are caught. Load indoors or after sunset, or you might get stung. Hint, this old fish smell works well in the spring, sweet attractant works better before hybernation in the fall in a different type of catcher; one you can put juice, beer, or other sweet attractant, with a drop of soap, recharge with water but add a drop of non-fragrant dish soap as it evaporates.
B00004TBKK I put up 2 of these. One was about 20' from an apple tree which the yj's just love. Had no problem until the end of the season, I'm guessing that that's when the 10 weeks supply ran out. I put a 2nd near my veg garden and about 15' form old tree roots which the yj's also find irresistible. No problem there either this year.Would buy again.
B00004TBKL I've had this up for a week and it's got one yellow jacket. I notice that some people recommend apple juice, but the instructions say to just add water.I'm very disappointed.I added some sugar today and possibly other ingredients in the future to make this more attractive.Their fly catcher is great, but this one works poorly for St. Louis yellow jackets.
B00004TBKL I know the difference between yellow jackets, honey bees, bumble bees, paper wasps, and bald faced hornets.  It was yellow jackets that were harassing my hummingbirds at the feeder. With the originally supplied attractant I caught no yellow jackets in this trap.  With Dr. Pepper I caught one in a week.  Another bait might have worked better but the Rescue reusable trap with apple juice worked somewhat so I stopped using the one-time use trap.
B00004TBKL Changed from 1 to 3 stars. 'Worthless' was initially noted, as the YJ's often walked in and just walked back out. It will trap some initially, but later catches flys AND hornets. The bags often have defects. This 'type' of bag device is great for flies (get the 'Big Bag' fly type as it stinks more like a ripe out-house and holds lots) but this (YJ type) smells like rotten fish (better to smell bad and catch things that sting you). Get the 'Big Bag Fly Trap' type like this for flies but use Rescue yellow plastic traps for YJ's. (W.H.Y traps are worthless so read the reviews). These will trap some flys and YJ's and a few Hornets going in for live food. Hornets will not fit in the hard yellow Rescue YJ traps, but hornets do fit in these, and do go in after flys and YJ's.Hornets are very unique and there seems to be no attractant for hornets, except people, and other live insects. Stick with Rescue (hard yellow-domed plastic type) for YJ's. This type, made for flies, work 'great' for flies. Hornets seem to hang out at the bag-type fly and yellowjacket traps to capture live insects. Sometimes these traps and the fly traps capture hornets (that is why I switched from 1 to 3 stars) that go in looking for live flys or maggots but it is not real common. I find one hornet hangs out at he top of the trap at a time, and when there is a hornet there the other bugs disappear. When it is gone the other critters reappear. These traps smell like rotten fish, which is fine, and the fly traps smell like outhouses, which is really strong if the wind is wrong. Hard to eat near the fly traps. I have trapped several hornets that go in due to the activity in the bags.Hint: If you add a very little non foaming, non smelling, dish soap to any water-type trap the insects drown quickly instead of crawl out, dehydrate, wear-out, or over-heat. These critters (YJ's and hornets) only know to sting and are constantly hunting for food for their hive, to feed the larvae (more future scavangers). They sting live bugs and bury them in with the growing insect to feed on while they are in suspended animation = creepy).Update 8-7-13:I still think these are not as good as the reusable Rescue hard trap (for yellow jackets) which you can re-bait:Pros:-They do catch flys and some YJ's.-They do trap some hungry Hornets looking for live critters.-It is an attractant for flys, YJ's and Hornets (rotten fish smell and activity)-It comes with attractant; just add water and a lead to hang it with.Cons:-They are firm plastic bags, flexes but not soft like a baggie-type, and some have arrived with holes (punctures) in them, which I used duct (Gorilla) tape on to cover then fill. This can lead to a stinky mess if you fill any in the kitchen. I do not know a way around this type of bag and think 'it is the best they can do' for a bag.-Holes develop on the seams after a while. Maybe from the weight of the water.-You have to keep replenishing the liquid that evaporates (I use a little wine/apple juice/sugar-water with a dab of non-fragrant, non foaming dish soap; do not use hot water).-They are one-use and throw away (before tossing I recommend draining the fluid outdoors, away from the house, letting the bag dry out, then throw away in the trash - stinky mess with maggots from flys). I do not recommend just putting a smelly liquid-maggot-filled bag in your trash.-Many yellow jackets tend to walk-in and walk-out, as do hornets and flys.-Stationed at most bags there is a sentry Hornet that posts itself at the entrance and it keeps all YJ's and flys away. Hornets prefer live catch. Other flying insects seem to be afraid of them, and I have seen some Hornets try to sting a bug (from the outside of the bag) that is inside the bag, and they try to catch any that fly around. This problem tends to keep many flys and YJ's away from this type of trap.-I have seen Hornets stationed at the 'fly traps', too, but I have trapped many flys in them so they get 5 stars. I have seen Hornets go in and sting maggots but have not witnessed them flying out with them, not that they don't.-these do not come with a hanging device (so be sure you have one on before you fill it).-you must carefully cut the bag with scissors around the opening to pull out the entrance device before filling and hanging.
B00004TBKL Last year was a horrible YJ year here in Northwest Montana.  Although I caught hundreds daily in July with homemade traps (mason jar with soapy water and meat dangling over it) - this year I set the non disposable Rescue traps out in mid-April after 2 YJ in the house.  I was prepared to try to catch queens early and hopefully have a better summer - typically bugs of any kind are not an issue here.When I bought the non disposable, I  also bought these and these are not only lots more convenient but I've been getting 50-75 in each in several days vs 15-20 in the non disposable.  Our weather typically is a string of warm, sunny days followed by cool & cloudy so at the onset of warm and sunny, I set out fresh traps.I have 8 acres of wooded property but am setting traps only in my yard area - maybe slightly less than 1 acre.  I didn't expect to catch so many this early.  I hope it helps.Now - in my area, they seem to do best in the sun.  It is nearly 80 today but most warm days have been 65-70.  I have 2 or 3  of a mix of disposable and non-disposable hung in 5 places from 20-40 feet away from my house.I'm using water in the traps, not apple juice.FWIW, I did try adding some of my mason jar meat traps and there was no interest in those at this point.  Also, previous years, I've caught wasps and hornets in beer.  Beer did not work last year or this for the YJs.  I also tried Hawaiian Punch last year - no, they liked my chicken leg bones with a bit of bbq sauce.  Crazy.  But, these are working for me this year, I am just astonished at the volume considering we had 3 periods of sustained below zero temps over the winter.
B00004TBKL I'm allergic to the buzzy creatures and have to carry an epi-pen.  Lots of them favor the nooks and crannies of our 120 year old log cabin up in the Rockies. I've tried everything they sell and we try to avoid chemical poisons.  This really works and works fast.  Use as directed and start early spring to head off those &#34;queens&#34;  We have cut back the problems by 75% since we began to use it a couple of years ago
B00004TBKL I hung this trap about 20 feet from an underground yellow jacket nest.  For the first few days, not many yellow jackets were trapped, I was not impressed.  I went out and shook it up a bit, making sure that the attractant was properly dissolved in the water.  Next time I checked, this thing was FULL of stinging insects, yellow jackets and a few hornets.  There are still some yellow jackets around my deck, but a lot fewer.  We can now sit out there without fear of being stung.  This first trap was a test drive, I am now ready to purchase more of these things.  Would like to purchase another three, but Amazon only has ONE in stock!  Bummer.  At least I know that they are  not a waste of money.  I do worry about the bee population, but I cannot have them so close to my house.  My kid is being stung, we cannot enjoy our deck.  The bees have to move outta town!
B00004TBKM I am guessing the 'attractant' used in these traps is derived from poop.WORD TO THE SQUEAMISH- this bag will be FULL OF FLIES, and the whole thing will be pulsing from the dying wing-beats of the hundreds (thousands?) of flies inside the bag. It is NOT for the faint of heart.YUCK. It's giving me the shivers just to look at the picture.Flies are gross, a clear bag full of horse poop smell and dying/dead flies is worse!Find a different solution.
B00004TBKM I'm updating my last review where I said it didn't work. I've since moved it to a new location and this trap collect hundreds of flies. I can really see a difference when I got outside now.I would also like to add that I didn't take this down during hurricane sandy and it held up to the really bad rain, and very high wind pretty well! I thought it was gonna be all ripped apart when I went out there to look at it. The winds reached at least 90MPH. So don't worry if you get a bad storm. As long as you have it tied up good it should stay.
B00004TBKM beware -- do NOT have in enclosed spaces....even just walking by it makes me want to gag!!  but the flies love it.  they have such bad taste
B00004TBKM . . .whether they're being attracted for a mile radius.  I didn't think I had a big fly problem.  We had a few flies.  We're in a residential neighborhood in tropical Hawaii, not a horse farm or overly near a public park.  Still, the trap only lasted a week before becoming filled up with what I estimate might be one thousand flies.FWIW, this trap works.  It attracts flies to a smelly liquid trap where they subsequently drown.  During the week I had it up hanging 20 feet from the house in a tree, no flies came into the house.  I'll take a break for a week, then try it again to see if the trap lasts longer and whether the fly population seems to have decreased.FWIW, take two, I developed a macabre fascination with checking on the trap every few hours to see how many more flies had been caught.  Ick.
B00004TBKM We had a fly problem a few years ago, so I tried these traps. I was very impressed with the sheer number of flies it caught (my wife was just disgusted). This year we had a bigger infestation, so I tried theRescue Reuseable Fly Trap with Attractant #FTA-SF4and they were nearly ineffective. I purchased a few more of these disposable traps and they're amazing at attracting and catching flies. The smell, however, is quite bad and is almost more offensive than a few rogue flies.The major advantage of this type of trap is that it works in the daytime, when flies are active, unlike an electronic trap like theFlowtron Model BK-40D Electronic Insect Killer (One Acre Coverage)(which I also purchased).The irony, I found, in having such effective attractants is that you get more flies. I moved my traps to the far side of the yard, away from the house, and suddenly we have fewer flies trying to sneak in the side door. (Obvious?)
B00004TBKM They stink like an old outhouse but work great trapping fly's and hornets; the hornets go in to catch a fly or maggot and can't get out. There is usually a sentry hornet that hangs out at the opening, and tries to get fly's from outside the bag, or, goes in after them. Once that hornet is gone, another arrives. Hornets want live bait.Warning: Do not use indoors!! If you fill it in the kitchen or inside your house, do not spill any in the sink, floor, trash, or your hands, as it really reeks, as it is supposed to to attract fly's, like to an outhouse. Some bags do leak from manufacturing defects. Yuck!! It does not wash off easily. Do not use warm or hot water in the bags as you will dissolve the smelly contents too quickly and not attract fly's to the heat. Once hung, refill it, regularly only to the line (it gives them space to crawl in and get stuck inside), and towards the end of the season add some apple-juice to attract more flys and hornets, and yellow jackets. Adding a drop of dish detergent helps them drown quickly, and to sink to the bottom. If you fill it too full, or the dead fly's stack up, the others will crawl out easily. Keep a space between the yellow plastic and the fly's and water. Once full of fly's just unhook it and set it on the ground to dry out then toss the whole bag; it will stink. Be sure once you have opened it that the yellow top seals in the open position from the weight so fly's do not crawl back out. Be careful not to get stung while refilling if a stinger creature is close; you encroach on their hunting territory.These have worked well for me and I prefer The Big Bag model. Highly recommended!! These can stink up an eating, playing, or relaxing area but gets flies like crazy, and some hornets and YJ's. My wife cannot stand the smell so I get the job.
B00004TBKM I can't fathom a fly catching product working any better. We experienced a few flies in the house this Spring so we purchased this product. In less than one week, this product caught over two hundred flies. What is kind of funny is that this product attracts flies to it...who knew there were that many flies around my house. While the product captures many flies, it also attracts them.  Flies that were not necessarily a problem were captured. Day one a few flies are trapped, and each subsequent day--- by the fifth day, the amount of flies caught was unimaginable. I am going to rid the entire neighborhood of flies at this rate. I am going to stockpile this product.
B00004TBKM This fly trap catches a lot of flies and so far we can't smell anything from it.  It is hanging outside suspended on a string tied to our garage.  Perhaps its because of our trade wind weather...but so far no smell and it has been hanging out for a week.  It's actually fun to see all those trap flies inside.
B00004TBKM I've been using this brand of fly trap for about 5  years now and it's never disappointed me. It will catch all the nasty types of flies you normally find during the summer time. This is perfect for pet owners like myself, in case the dog dumps its love bundles and I don't see it, which can atrack flies.A couple of things you should know about this product:First, it will probably not catch any flies the first day, and let me explain why, the material in the trap and water that you add need to mix for about a day, at which type, a very strong smell will start to come out of the trap, which means it is now working. After the first day, and during the hot ones, trust me, it will be gross, yet amazing thing what this trap can do.Second, you have to constantly add water to the level indicated on the bag, specially during the hot days and if the trap is under direct sun light. This is easy to do with a paper cup or any other small cup.Third, when hanging it, place it away from your doors and windows, or be ready for some nasty smells. The trap has a mixture of eggs(dried) and other products to create a strong odor that flies can't resist.In conclusion, this product DOES NOT USE chemicals at all, it is all natural and catches a great number of fly species; it won't let you down. It works.
B00004TBKM I have a four year German Shepherd and during the summer months the flies tend to munch on the tips of his ears. I have tries all types of all natural insect repellents, none of which ever worked. I also tried flys off which was fair but not 100%, not even 50% effective. So I decided to eliminate the flies to eliminate the problem. I then searched Amazon, my go to company for everything and I discovered the fly trap. I was skeptical at first but I opened the top and filled with water ad directed and hung it near my dogs house. Within hours I saw many flies trapped and within a few days the number of flies in the area has decreased tremendously. I will buy more fly traps and if you have a problem with flys, you should too.
B00004TBKM These things work great!  Make sure you follow the directions to open/set it up, then fill it with water and hang someplace out of the way where the flies collect.  I've hung ours about 50 feet from our patio, under a pine tree where we have a quail block feeding the birds.  Lots of flies gather round there, and these traps fill up quickly.  Nary a fly makes it to our patio, even when we have our meals out there.  Before the fly trap, we were constantly swatting and shooing flies while sitting on the patio.  So glad I found these!  Only downfall, they are a little stinky, I can smell it when I walk by about 8 feet away, but since it's not close to our 'living space', it's no problem.
B00004TBKM The only thing wrong with my order is that I did not order more! The trap was working within 30 minutes of setting it up.I want to thank the reviewer who said he had an issue with cutting the plastic at the top of the trap. Had I not read his review I would have had the same issue. I avoided it by using an exacto type cutting tool to cut the circle out.When setting it up I did spill some of the attractant on the side of the trap. The flies were all over it within 15 minutes and 30 minutes later they were in the trap. Be sure to hang this trap up of the reach of pets. This trap not only attracts flies it also attracts dogs too. Never underestimate the intelligence and leaping ability of a miniature dachshund. She immediately found where I had spilled it on the ground and soon figured out the source. I distracted her, hung it higher, and washed away what spilled on the ground. I mention this only because we mini dachshund owners tend to be very protective of our little heart stealing dogs.A possible mistake I made when setting this out was to hang it in direct sunlight. We have a heat wave at this time and during the hottest part of the day I did not see any flies around the unit. Today I am going to hang it in a shade tree. I'm sure that will work and if it does not I will update this review within a short period of time.I feel that this trap is well worth what I paid for it and as soon as I am done with this review I am going to order at least one more maybe two. One for the front yard and one for the back. I have a fly problem because I have fruit trees, compost piles, a garden, and I live in a tiny town surrounded by farms. The flies in the front yard are a bad problem because when I mow the yard they come out and pester me when I am trying to concentrate on safely mowing the part of my yard where it has steep slopes. You can easily turn your mower over while trying to swat a biting fly. If the yard does not get mowed I wind up with thousands of mosquitoes and dozens of snakes.All in all I am happy with this purchase and I wish I had found this item many years sooner.UPDATE. JULY 28,2011.I'm glad I ordered more. My trap is already full. One more thing I need to mention. Don't hang the bag too close to where you sit or eat outside. The bag has an odor and without that odor the trap will not work. I would experiment by hanging it in different locations. The perfect spot would be close enough to attract flies away from you but far enough that you don't smell it. It also helps to remove things that attract flies away from the trap. Mine hangs in a fruit tree. I had some rotten fruit on the ground that was attracting the flies more than the trap. I raked them up and got rid of them. The next day the flies were swarming the trap even more than they had been.
B00004TBKM I put these by the chicken coop, the edge of the property that is past our pool, and another past the fenceline that is closest to our deck.  Draws flies like crazy.  Can't have close to the house because it's pretty stinky!  All you do is add some water and hang the bag out..let it get full and toss it.
B00004TBKM This is a great product but I think the price is a mistake (94.00) I got mine at some local store for less than 10 bucks.  I just put one up a few days ago and it is filled (I have chickens) with flies.  Really works well I keep one by the coop and another by the house. I am going to get more it is really too full. The best part you just chuck it when you're done with it.
B00004TBMV I am an ISA Certified Arborist, so I can tell you, as a professional, that this product beats all other similar products out there, hands down.  I use mine on the job just about everyday, and it stands up to pretty tough use.  It does go through webbing straps every now and then, but restringing new straps is easy, once you get used to it.  Customer Support at Fiskars is second to none.  They have replaced, at no charge, numerous webbing straps, the extension tube and a cutting head.  Rest assured, unless you are a professional out there, you will probably never have to change out anything on your unit.  If you ever have to though, I can assure you that Fiskars will be there to help you out, via their toll-free number and quick e-mail response team.  I recommend this unit and its smaller brother.  Both go into the trees with me, sixty feet and higher, and both give reliable service.
B00004TBMV I'm pleased with this. I'm 66 years old and a cancer survivor so don't have the saying power of some people.  Have found this very easy to use.  It is a little heavy for me when fully extended but not so bad I can't use it.  One thing I learned is to adjust the head so I make square cuts to avoid any hang up from the branch starting to fall and binding the blades.  Used this to trim limbs over my electric pasture fence while driving my tractor so my Tractor ROPS bar now clears the limbs. If the jaws fit around a limb you can cut it without a terrible amount of strength.  I bought this to trim some tall hedge bushes along the edge of my yard and it worked well for trimming the tall tops.  Have used the saw (3 inch limbs) and it cuts fine if you let it do the cutting and take your time.  Used it to cut some woody stemed large weeds on hard to navigate banks too. Over all a very handy tool.
B00004TBMV In the $80 range with no shipping or tax, this is worth the money if you need to prune tree branches on a regular basis as I do.  My husband loves it and thinks the construction is superior.  Unfortunately, I have difficulty working it.  He's 65, and I'm 59 and don't have the arm strength/length nor the the height (5' 3\" and under are going to have trouble) to work it properly when it needs to be fully extended. Any man should have no difficulty, and it will pay for itself the first time you use it versus hiring someone to prune for you.August 30, 2007 update:  Since December 2006 when I bought this, I have been forced to use this more because my husband has been unavailable due to his golfing addiction.  In spite of my shortness, this tool works fine for me as long as the trunk of what you are cutting isn't more than one and one-half inch in diameter.  However, there is a saw attachment which will allow you to get through the thicker branches.  Over time, this tool has become indispensable to me, especially since I have six redwood trees, numerous other treees, and tons of high bushes.August 16, 2011:  Fiskars has terrific customer service.  After almost five years of heavy use, a plastic clamp that holds the extension, broke.  Know that Fiskars honors a limited lifetime warranty on this item.  I had to send them a copy of my Amazon receipt and a picture of the damage (picture cannot exceed 2 megabytes). Full instructions on how to make a warranty claim are included on Fiskars' website, plus their telephone customer service is excellent.  They sent me a new part plus a link to complete instructions, including pictures, for disassembling the pruner and replacing the part.  My husband was able to effect the repair.  There was no dollar cost to me at all, and this is way better than having to buy another one for $80.May 28, 2014:  I still use this pruner regularly, and it continues to work well after the repair.  The only problem is that you do have to watch the thickness of the branches you are cutting because this pruner will only tolerate so much.
B00004TBMV Purchased this item at 11 AM.  Used free supersaver shipping. Received the next day. Unreal.  Apparently these are stocked in local warehouses. I live in a small Ohio city. The tracking number immediately showed a UPS exception. This was a first. The product itself is nice. Well made.  Easy to use.  Some commented on the shipping carton.  It was a long box, with 2 separate box pieces taped together.  The UPS man told me it looked like it may be damaged.  It was fine.  I do agree that there should be a box long enough for the item to fit in.  The pole is solid enough that there was very little chance of damage. The box is so odd shaped that nothing else will be piled on top. This will be a useful product. Added:  Minor dissapointment.  Just saw this in my big box grocery store for $ 69.00-full price. This is a full price store-not a discounter.
B00004TBMV excellent product, already done with winterizing trimming around the house, when I first pulled the cutting bowel and branch fell down, my wife instantly said \" magic\", that's how I felt, too. But then moving on to larger branch and switching to cutting saw and that's when problems occured, first the wing nut which were used to tighten and positioned the saw were being knocked off by the tree because of the push and pull motion; which un-screw the wing nut, went down and look for it, after finding it and tightening it up super tight, back to work and the extension poll fell out also caused by the push and pull motion, pick it up, slided it back in, tightening it up and figured out how the rope and jaw reacts to each other and did some adjustments, and it works fine ever since, I'd give it a 5 star if not because it took me 30 minutes to find things and fixed  and adjusted it the first time I've used it, other than that, it's a great helper to make things possible.
B00004TBMV This is a nice, light weight tool for trimming small branches high in trees and shrubs.  It easily cuts branches up to 1/2 inch.  The only reason I did not give it a five star rating is my experience with other Fiskars' tools with the same type of adjustable head. The head is a weak point, after a few months of use my experience is that the plastic head will fail.  Even though it has a lifetime warranty; returning for repairs is just too difficult to be worth the trouble.
B00004TBMV After it arrived, I went right out and trimmed a few trees.  Amazing how easy it was to use and how effective it was.
B00004U9V8 Each time I cook with my grille, I use this around my waist and have all my utensils handy and ready to go, what I did was just hang it upon my belt and it works great, unless you use suspenders or don't wear pants.
B00004U9V8 Each time I cook with my grille, I use this around my waist and have all my utensils handy and ready to go, what I did was just hang it upon my belt and it works great, unless you use suspenders or don't wear pants.
B00004U9V8 I bought this to retrofit it on my Genesis platinum series 2 gas grill.  The reason why is that the factory installed tool hooks prevent you from opening the lower grill doors with tools hanging from the hooks.  These are stainless steel and I have figured out how to do this so I am going to relocate them to the side of the work table on the grill.  They will work and last with a little customization.
B00004U9V8 Clips right onto the rim of the lower kettle half, well-made, really handy, you NEED one of these! Possibly TWO of these!!!
B00004U9V8 This was a nice idea, but it doesn't work to well if you have the lid holder.  Whenever I take the lid out of the holder, the tool holder falls off.  I don't really need it, because I have the perfomer which has a built in tool holder on the table, which I forgot about when I ordered this.  The tool holder should have some kind of locking clamps on it so they will stay in place.  I can see how they would interfere with the lid closing all the way if they are hung off the grill itself and imagine that they don't stay in place when the lid is taken off.  I like having the extra set of tool holders so I think I am going to trying clamping them down on the lid holder with pliers.
B00004U9V8 Now that I finally bought my new Weber grill (One-Touch Silver) and some new Weber tools, I needed something to hold them. I didn't want to hang them on one of my other crappy grills, so I went ahead and bought this handy tool holder.Now, I have read previous reviews on this and people have said that they couldn't get their lid to close, or that the tool holder would fall off. Well, it doesn't take much creativity to realize that you can pinch the tool holder onto your grill with a simple set of pliers. This will take care of both problems.I highly recommend this simple-yet-handy gadget to anyone with a Weber One-Touch grill (except for maybe the One-Touch Platinum, since it has everything you need). It is very easy to use, your lid will still close and you grill-cover will still fit =)
B00004U9V8 The tool holder works well.  There is a little leakage of smoke, but I don't think this reduces the quality of food preparation or changes the temperature of the grill.  The tool holder ships from a company other than Amazon, and the shipping/handling costs are more than the holder.
B00004U9VA This charcoal slow-cooker & smoker does everything as advertised.  It is well made and easy to assemble.  I have done 2 cooks so far (baby back ribs, chicken, sirloin tip & salmon).  As long as you don't keep adding smoke-wood, but only do it at the beginning (and do it sparingly) you will have well cooked and flavorful food.  I recommend trying the \"best ribs in the universe\" procedure for your first cook - found at [...]  I highly recommend this cooker and think you will do the same.  P.S. - Amazon.com has about the best prices and delivery you will find around.
B00004U9VA I used this in Vietnam, where the local butcher, Hang Kau Pung, asked me to use my gas grille for his yak. After butchering it, we used the grille to smoke it and had a problem when the ribs did not fit on the Weber 3601 Rib Rack. I had 5 Weber Rib Racks so they were useless and we had to put the cooked meat on the fly dirty ground near treated sewer water. I suppose if you are using pig Ribs they fit but be weary of larger meat animals.

B00004U9VA This Weber is simply the best. Get it going, put in your meat - go to bed and get up the next morning to the best briskets and pork butts you ever had. It is amazing how this charcoal smoker can maintain such constant cooking temps whether it is -20 or + 99 outside.
B00004U9VA I have only owned a couple smokers in my life, and after purchasing this one - I don't plan on owning anything else. The Weber Smokey Mountain Cooker (WSM) is a simple, yet incredibly effective water smoker.The WSM has two cooking sections which allows you to smoke a good amount of food (such as a whole turkey and a whole ham simultaneously). The 18 1/2 inch grates allow plenty of food, but you might have to get a little tricky if you want to smoke something like 8 racks of ribs. This can be done if you roll the ribs up and use a skewer to hold them in place. If you aren't trying to entertain large parties, then this is the perfect family smoker.The WSM is coated with porcelain enamel, much like the One-Touch kettle grills. The grates are triple-nickel-plated. The WSM is very sturdy. The material is nice and hefty, you don't get the sense that this smoker was cheaply made. One of the only issues I have with this smoker is the access door. Instead of being hinged it comes completely off the smoker. It can take a little bit of figiting to get it to attach to the smoker, but this is an extremely small issue.The reason people love this smoker is because with a single batch of charcoal you can smoke for an incredibly long time. If you use the minion method then you can smoke for up to 18-20 hours without adding anymore charcoal! For those who aren't aware, the minion method is where you fill the charcoal ring with unlit charcoal, light about 10-15 briquettes and place them on top of the unlit charcoal. Please don't use the minion method with pre-soaked coals. My first smoke was a brisket and for the first 5 hours it stayed exactly at 245 degrees without any adjustments! I thought my thermometer was broken... it wasn't - this smoker is incredibly efficient. Another example is the second time I smoked with this. I smoked a 10 lb brisket, started at midnight. It finished 5:00 PM the following day. That's 17 hours right there. I roused the coals a bit and was able to smoke some stuffed jalapenos for another 2 hours. That's 19 hours on a single batch of charcoal! I am very impressed. I have a Brinkman smoker and when I used that smoker I would get about 2 hours of burn time. The WSM is just so much more efficient and has MUCH better air control.Here are a couple of tips if you plan on buying a WSM (and you should!).Get a decent enough thermometer, such as a candy thermometer so you can check your temperature at the lid. This will become instrumental in your cooking.Unfortunately the WSM has a small water pan. What you should do is buy a replacement Brinkmann Smoke N Grill charcoal pan (don't get the water pan, make sure you get the charcoal pan). You can buy one directly from Brinkmann for about $13.00. If you look hard enough you can find them online for around $5.00 - $10.00. The Brinkmann charcoal pan fits perfectly inside the WSM as a water pan (some say it fits even better!). It also holds more then double the amount of water then the standard WSM water pan. This allows you about 7-8 hours of cooking before needing to refill the pan, which is much better then the 2-3 you get with the standard water pan. Once your temps stabilize you can easily do overnight cooks and also get some shut-eye!To conclude I would like to say that if you are even thinking about getting a  vertical water smoker then stop looking right now. This smoker is near perfect in every single way. With a few tiny modifications you can own one of the best smokers in the world at this price!
B00004U9VA This thing is ridiculous!  It holds a temperature better than my electric oven.  I can load it up with charcoal, set the vents, and it will be rock steady at 250 degrees for hours.  If you have a favorite BBQ restaraunt that you think is pretty good, try their best menu item and compare it to the \"Q\" you'll produce on this cooker and you'll never eat out again.  I've made baby back ribs, meatloaf, pork butt, spare ribs, and fatties (smoked sausage rolls) and they've all turned out delicious.  Buy it, you won't regret it.
B00004U9VA This is a great product.  It lives up to the Weber name.  The WSM is well built with tight tolerances so heat does not escape.  It is easily possible to get a consistent even burn at 215 degrees for 6 or more hours with a single chimney of charcoal.The two cooking grates allow you to cook a lot of food at a time, and either grate can easily fit several racks of ribs, a 15 pound brisket, or 2 or 3 pork sholders.The water/drip pan holds about a gallon of water and allows for warm moist heat, causing a natural convection and ensuring even heating.It is a breeze to put together and out of the box you will be cooking delicious slow cooked authentic barbeque!
B00004U9VC I used this in Vietnam, where the local butcher, Hang Kau Pung, asked me to use my gas grille for his yak.  After butchering it, we used the grille to smoke it and had a problem when the ribs did not fit on the Weber 3601 Rib Rack.  I had 5 Weber Rib Racks so they were useless and we had to put the cooked meat on the fly dirty ground near treated sewer water.  I suppose if you are using pig Ribs they fit but be weary of larger meat animals.
B00004U9VC The description doesn't do this rib rack justice.  This thing is pretty big and will hold a LOT of chicken.  You will certainly not complain about running out of room!  Even though it might be an exaggeration to think it can hold enough chicken to feed the entire neighborhood, there's enough room here to hold enough chicken for a family of 7 or 8.  Washing it may be a problem.  Just wash it immediately after using it.
B00004U9VC This is a nice item when you want to keep your food off the cast iron grates.  Useful for numerous food items.  Good quality.
B00004U9VC I have been using this rack all summer and still have yet to see it rust as someone mentioned in an earlier review.  The rack is certainly a space saver and comes in handy when you have a lot of grilling do.  I have used it when smoking chicken and ribs in my Weber Kettle, and noticed that the meat may tend to touch when placed in the rack so not all areas may be exposed to the smoke.  If this happens, I may rotate the pieces or just leave it like it is since I'm not entering anything in a competition!  Everything still has the same great taste but the parts that were not exposed to the smoke will have a different color.
B00004U9VC Increase your grill capacity.  Works great.  The only drawback is having to take the ribs out of the rack to baste them.
B00004U9VC I have used this twice now.  Once for baby back ribs (pork loin back) and once for St. Louis style trimmed spare ribs.  It worked great both times, but was easier with the spare ribs than the baby backs.  This was because the spare ribs were straighter (less curve to the rib bones) than the baby backs and stood upright better.  The curve in the baby back ribs made it slightly more difficult to remove a single rack of ribs to rotate it.  But this was a minor issue.  Overall the unit worked great.
B00004U9VV You won't find a better way to start your coals for the Webber Smokey Mountain cooker.  Following directions I had half of the coals I needed nice and white hot for my cooker in about 10 minutes.  It is built better than the ones I have seen at Ace Hardware and other places.  There is an inverted cone grill at the bottom that enables the starter to have more surface area for the newspaper sheets that you use to get the thing started.  You will not be sorry you ordered this along with your WSM cooker!
B00004U9VV Just like everyone else has said, this is a winner.I've owned a few different chimney starters over the years and just never could get them to work reliably.  I always ended up going back to lighter fluid.  Yes, it stinks and it's expensive and it can ruin the taste of your meal if you don't let the charcoal burn down for a long time but it worked every time.  Those Brand X chimney starters didn't always get the charcoal going.The Weber is larger and the design is well thought-out.  Instead of a few holes in the bottom of the charcoal section, it has a grate.  And the grate is kind of reverse-cone shaped so more charcoal comes in contact with the burning newspaper.  The result--it lights pretty much perfectly every time.  All it takes is two broadsheet pages of newpaper stuffed in the bottom.  That's two broadsheets--the equivalent of eight pages of your morning newspaer.  You can also use paper towels--they create less ash.  If you want, you can lightly spray the newpaper or towels with a little Pam or the like.  That's gets the paper to burning quickly.Don't bother with those small, poorly designed, no-name (or even big-name) chimney starters you see around.  The Weber is the one to get.
B00004U9VV 1. It is taller than the cheapos and has more chimney effect so it works better.2. Is made of heavier gauge steel than the cheapos and lasts longer. I just  leave mine outside. It takes years to rust through. My old one lasted about 5-6 years.3. It will rust like any steel exposed to high heat, so the thicker the metal, the longer it will last.4. The length of time to start the coals depends on the brand of coals, their moisture content, humidity and the way you crumple up the newspaper.5. If the coals fail to catch, then repeat the process. Do not pour lighter fluid into it. Doo.6. I just grab the insulated handle and pour the coals out. I do not use the tipping handle thing so I don't need gloves.7. One of the features of a Weber, and some other grills, is that after you finish grilling, you can shut off the vents and save some of the coals for next time. So, pile the newly lit coals over the old ones. This lights them up and gives you a longer fire as well.8. Weber offers little wire fences that allow you to keep the coals off to one side of the grill. Use this feature. Pour your coals into this area, sear your meat quickly and then move it off to the non-coaled area and put the lid on and let it cook slowly to completion. Add specialty wood chips at this time if you wish. This gives the best result.9. Weber stuff seems to be the best, at least in its price range, and they offer a lot of quality accessories that are properly designed.10. Many stores are now just stocking a cheap Chinese brand of chimney. Thin, small, short and just ca ca in general. Don't encourage the b******s, get the real thing._____________________________These are great. The one I reviewed is still good after hundreds of uses.FIRE-STARTING UDATE: sprinkle a little olive oil, or other cooking oil, on the balled-up newspaper. It makes for a hotter and longer-lasting fire that so far has started my charcoal the first time, every time. I also shred the paper and then ball it up. Takes a couple of pages. Don't use the slick paper advertising inserts.
B00004U9VV This takes all the work out of lighting charcoal for the BBQ.  Will help you light and heat up your grill in approximately the same amount of time as a regular gas-grill.  Best part is there is absolutely no need for cancer-causing lighter fluid under any circumstances.  A good gift for the charcoal-phob or charcoal-challenged.
B00004U9VV If you use charcoal you need this! It really works!Just load your bricks throw some paper on the bottom light the paper and in about 5 minutes your bricks are ready for action!
B00004U9VV at least three time a week year around. I've used the Weber chimney starter every time. The 'old' ones were lighter gauge than the current product and they lasted about three years. The latest one is heavier gauge and perhaps it will last longer. I recommend this item.
B00004U9VV I got this because of all the great reviews here on amazon. Some of the reviews said that all you need is 2 sheets of newspaper that was all. and I was like That's not possible. Well it is. this thing is incredible! It starts up quickly and is good to use in about 10-15 min. I have noticed that lower quality bricks do not work as well and that if you over stuff the bottom with paper it will not work right. It smokes a lot! I suggest closing your windows. You really need to have 2 of them when doing large meats such as turkey's and half pigs. That way you can start enough charcoal right off the bat. It also says that you should wait until the coals have a slight white ash on them. I would have to disagree with that because the coals are 30 min from being burned up by then. I wait until the center is red hot and flames are leaping from the top. It seems the coals last longer that way. for 15 bucks it's a no-brainer. Get it!
B00004U9VV This past summer I tried a charcoal grill for the first time and as a result my gas grill was never taken out of the garage.  It's become an obsession of mine and now I have three different grills, one smoker and a collection of different wood chunks.  My newest obsession never would have taken root if there was not an easy, foolproof way of starting the lump or the briquettes.  I don't have any other chimney to compare this to but it works perfectly every time.  Two sheets of newspaper, dump in your fuel of choice and light it.  10-15 minutes later the coals are ready to go.  If you think the newspaper gives too much ash try paper towels sprayed with some cooking oil instead.  If you grill on a deck be careful when you light it or where you put it after dumping out the coals as it gets very hot.
B00004U9VV Dump some charcoal in the chimney, crumple a few sheets of newspaper into the bottom, light the papers, wait a while, and you have ashed, ready to use coals.  This is so much easier and healthier than dousing the charcoal with starter fluid and more convenient than using the electric starters.  If I'd known this sooner, I would've bought my charcoal grill a long time ago!
B00004U9VV Like many other charcoal barbeque enthusiasts, I hate using charcoal lighter fluid.  (Who wants toxic junk smoldering all over their food?)  For years I have used an electric lighter, but ours was on its last legs.  I was tempted to buy a gas grill, as they are fast-lighting, but just really didn't want to spend the money on a product that doesn't perform the way I like.  So, based on the favorable reviews, I decided to try the Weber Chimney Starter.Wow.  Really.I was accustomed to putting the electric lighter under the coals, and preparing other parts of the dinner while the coals were getting started.  And after they had gotten started, it took a while for the fire to really get rolling.I use a Weber barbeque, and every time after I have finished grilling, I close down the vents and save the briquets for another use.  I only have to add a couple of handfuls of new briquets each time I cook.I stuffed the bottom of the Weber chimney starter with newspaper as directed, put in the cold leftover briquets from the last grilling session, and added the usual amount of new briquets.  I lit the newspaper as directed.  At first all it seemed to be doing was producing a copious amount of smoke.  I walked away, and came back just a few minutes later to find the charcoal flaming away most impressively.  The coals were ready in about a quarter of the time that it took using the electric starter.Who needs a gas barbeque for a fast-starting fire?  I had my whole dinner cooked in a half hour from the time that I lit the newspaper.  This charcoal starter is a gem!Update (June 29, 2008):  After using this starter for almost a year (yes, I barbeque in the winter) I have a couple of notes to add.  First, use only the amount of newspaper recommended.  More newspaper cuts down the amount of air able to circulate through the fire, and you just end up with a smoldering mess.  Secondly, don't fill the container full of charcoal.  Doing so extends the time it takes for all the charcoal to ignite, with the end result of making the handle too hot to comfortably hold.  Even if you need a lot of charcoal, only fill the container half-full. Once the briquets are burning, dump them into the barbeque and put more briquets right on top of them if you need more.
B00004U9VV I haven't used lighter fluid in years, ever since getting one of these.I didn't believe that just a couple sheets of newspaper would be enough to get the charcoal going, but that's really all you need.  I use natural charcoal exclusively (you know, real wood, not gravel and clay briquettes), and this works perfectly with that kind of charcoal.You'll reduce the amount of time necessary to get a usable fire, and you won't have that annoying starter fluid smell or taste on your food.Two caveats to consider: this thing gets very hot by its nature, so use oven mitts when grabbing the handle, and be careful where you put it after dumping the coals, so as to keep small children and yourself from touching it until it cools.
B00004U9VV The Weber is the best chimney starter I have used.  It's bigger than most others, can be lifted and dumped with one or two hands, and the handle stays relatively cool.  I just ordered a second so I can fill my relatively large barbeque all at once.  If you are not into gas you need this tool.
B00004U9VV I finally gave up on the lighter fluid and bought this last summer.  What a brilliant idea!  I have always used lighter fluid and was notorious for using to much because the charcoal wouldn't light fast enough.  That problem is solved with this chimney starter.  The coals ignite quickly and a full blaze is going within minutes!  Once the flames have died down, just dump them out and start grilling!I have the Performer grill but when I bought the grill, the store didn't have any cartridges so I have been using the chimney starter all summer.  So it's a nice backup if you have the Performer but no gas cartridge.This is a good product for the price.
B00004U9VV This thing works great! lights my charcoal with ease and without fluid. If you are picky about the taste of your food (you will notice the difference if you grill without lighter fluid or pre-soaked coals) then get this handy starter. It couldn't be easier! shove a couple pieces of newspaper on the bottom, fill it up with coals and light.
B00004U9VV I have another no-name chimney starter that I bought a few years ago for around $15.  I've used it for cooking dutch oven for a couple of years and it has worked fine, or so I thought.  I recently purchased aWeber 2820 Smokey Mountain Cooker/Smokerand bought this Weber Chimney Starter at the same time.  It is MUCH bigger than the generic starter I've been using, and the additional lift assist handle is great.  The conical grate inside the starter allows the charcoal to get up to temperature much quicker than my old unit.  I don't know what I'll use my old starter for now.  From now on, it's only Weber for me.
B00004U9VV As an avid griller and lover of cooking on charcoal, I can't say enough good things about the Weber Chimney starter.This simple to use chimney style starter quickly lights enough lump or briquette charcoal to fill your 22 1/2 inch weber grill WITHOUT LIGHTER FLUID!!Lighting is easy. Simply add charcoal to rim of chimney, place parafin lighters or newspaper in the bottom. Light newspaper or parrafin lighters and place on charcoal grate in grill.  In 20-30 minutes you will have orange hot smokin' charcoal.This is also a must for cooking things with very long cooking times such as turkeys or roasts.  About 30 minutes before adding additional charcoal, use this puppy to light your coals, and then add to the fire as needed.As I mentioned earlier, I reccomend using this in conjunction with the Weber parrafin charcoal lighters.  On windy days they are easier to use than newspaper.Once you use this you will never go back to using lighter fluid again.  A must have for anyone who owns a charcoal grill.
B00004U9VV I've used chimneys for 50 years and this one is the best I've ever had.  It's construction is solid and its handles are positioned to keep ones hands and arms away from the heat.
B00004U9VV A couple years ago my wife complained about how she could taste the lighter fluid in some of the things I grilled. The charcoal just wasn't getting hot enough to burn it all off, especially on cold, rainy days. By the time the ligher fluid was burned-off, the coals were nearly gone, too.We had just seen Alton Brown's Good Eats episode, The Grill Seakers. He had used a chiminy starter to get his charcoal going, so when we saw one in the store, my wife told me to buy it and try it.Well, after two years of use, that cheap starter has gotten to the point where it's ready to fall apart. I needed a new one, and I needed to add something inexpensive to my Amazon.com order to qualify for free shipping, so I ordered this one.I've got to say, even though I read the reviews, I just wasn't expecting something so big! This thing has half-again as much capacity as my old one. It's also a heavier guage metal, and a better handle.One hint: I lightly spray my newspaper with corn oil before putting it in the chiminey. It never burns away too fast, as just two sheets can do if there's enough wind, and I don't find myself packing too much newspaper in. I always get a good fire going, with no lighter fluid taste.
B00004VWM1 boyfriend got this for xmas and he loved it. We haven't used it yet but he looks forward to it!
B00004VWM1 The other reviews are correct. This unit works very well in every way, a basket mesh kind of food holder would be a good option, use a drip pan and keep the coals off to the sides, the ring riser/extension is useful for smoking and cooking big things, etc. It is all good, but there is more:Who do you know who actually has a charcoal grill and a rotisserie? Nobody. If you get one, your guests will be entertained on several levels and you will be the Master. A rotisseries is professional looking, produces unmatched taste and an exciting demonstration-style cooking experience for everyone. Those that utilize them are seen as proficient and competent. Not a bad label for you, eh? Might get you somewhere.The best meal I ever had was a rotisserie turkey that saved me from starvation after a Hike of Death. Perhaps it can save you or a loved one.Rotisserie cooking lends itself to the acclaimed high heat, short cooking time technique. Hot coals and the self-basting action work well here. One of the major gourmet magazines cooked turkeys every way known and strongly recommended the high heat way. This is also the suggested method for cooking heritage meats and wild game.Starting out at 500+ degrees and ending at something short of US government temperature recommendations is the secret. A turkey, for example, is best taken out of the heat at around 170, or less, and allowed to rest. It will go up around 10 degrees after that.I tie bacon strips onto the breast and add wet smoking wood chips to the coals. Stuff the cavity with an orange and some garlic. Other things could be used, too. I have rotisseried heritage, free range, organic, kosher and regular good quality supermart turkeys with this high-heat method and they have all been good.Governments and institutions have to recommend a heat guaranteed to kill off any and everything, and prevent lawsuits of course. However, fresh good quality meat does not have to be nuked to the point where you could make furniture out of it. Use a separate thermometer, not the supplied pop-out sensor. I am no professional, but I can say it produces the best tasting food.___________________________________UPDATE: Years later, it still works. Here are some things that will help you if you get one of these. First, for a turkey, get two oranges and stick them in the cavities. Then, stick the skewer through them. This keeps the turkey from wobbling around so much as the oranges act like bearings. Also, get some meat wrapping string and spend the time it takes to tie the legs, tail and wings up to the skewer so that the turkey is more like a ball without all sorts of dangling things flopping around. Use lots of string. It is cheap. Know that all the energy of the universe will try to circumvent your efforts, so over-do it with the string. Cut it off with scissors before serving.Coat the turkey with olive oil. Don't baste it again.Obviously, don't stuff it!I don't use the bacon anymore. If you use the temperature recommendations, you won't miss the bacon.  It was a pain to tie on and was kind of a waste.The Polder remote thermometer is nice because the probe is thin and doesn't create a big hole.I stop at 160 degrees now. That's just me. Remember, you can cook it more, but you can't remove the overcooking.Learn how to cut the breast meat off. Don't slice it off while it is on the turkey. Instead, cut down right alongside that breastbone. Then cut in from the side, about half-way down the side, straight in. This gives you a big chunk from that one side.  On a plate, cut it in slices, across it, across the grain. So much more professional and better in every way. And it is easier. If you are having trouble visualizing this, you can google up a demo video or illustration.I saw a TV show where it was demonstrated that soaking the chips makes no difference, so I don't anymore. A couple of handfuls gives a nice, not overwhelming little smoke flavor. You may want more, or none.The Weber a fine device and one that surely will make you the rockstar of turkey cooking. Imagine how pathetic your relatives will seem when they take their sad turkeys out of the oven after hours of worthless basting. There will be murmuring and eye-rolling from those who remember yours. Make sure you tell the others, loudly, how you just sit around drinking while your turkey rotates effortlessly around, cooking perfectly. By the time the hosts are finished with excuses as to why their turkey sucks, again, you will be elevated to near rock-god status. Humiliation is an essential part of any family holiday and you want to be the one doing the humiliation.See the review of the Weber chimney charcoal starter for a good tip on that.
B00004VWM1 I waited way too long to buy one of these rotisseries.  What was I thinking?  This thing is fantastic!I cook on my Weber charcoal kettles all the time.  It always comes out great, except for the one time my Beagle chased a deer into the woods and I had to go after her.  I got back about thirty minutes later and my chicken was ruined.  I actually ended up feeding it to my Beagle, so now I am thinking maybe she did it on purpose?  They are pretty smart.  And chasing a deer had to be a ruse to distract me, I mean seriously, what was she going to do if she actually caught the deer?The rotisserie chickens I have cooked so far have turned out much, much better than all the other ways I have cooked chicken over charcoal. And I have cooked chicken a lot of different ways.I have read that rotisseries are self-basting because most of the juices don't drip, they just kind of roll around over the chicken.  Maybe.  But all I know is as long as I take the bird off at around 165 degrees, cover it for about ten minutes, then serve it, it always comes out fantastic.If you have one of these you know what I am talking about.  If you don't, you should get one, you will like it.This is not just for chicken or turkey.  I cooked a chuck roast to slightly over rare and then sliced it up for some excellent roast beef.
B00004VWM1 This Weber Rotisserie is the best grilling item that I have bought so far. I did two Cornish Hens and they were so moist and juicy, I couldn't wait to try a roasting Chicken. Well, I finally tried one, and oh, my God!!!! It was AWESOME!!! The taste was like no other rotisserie Chicken that I have ever eaten!! I cooked it slow, about 3 hours, starting with about 12 coals on each side, using the indirect cooking method. I added more coals every hour to keep the temperature about the same (about 325-350). I experimented with basting it with Beer when I added more coals. I also added soaked hickory wood chips with the coals each time. To die for!!!  I also tried a Pork roast. The same awesome results were obtained. Next I will try a Turkey. I am totally sold on this item, and highly recommend it to anyone who owns a Weber 22-1/2\" kettle grill. You won't be disappointed!!
B00004VWM1 this kettle rotisserie works GREAT. it's a much better design than what's shown in the ad. what I mean by that is the one in the ad shows metal tabs that rest on the grill, with the new design they got rid of the tabs and flared out the bottom of the ring so the whole ring sits on the grill giving it a nice tight seal. it makes controlling the heat much easier than the previous one. WELL DONE WEBER now as far as the motor it's super quiet and works very well. the spit is one piece steel much better than the two piece rods the ring itself is the same quality as the weber kettle grill. I really didn't want to spend that kind of money on it but after receiving and using it I'm glad I did. this unit is well made and expect to get many years of great grilling out of it.
B00004VWM1 This rotisserie is made for weber 22 inch charcoal grills.  I got this from amazon and it shipped in record time.  This is a simple accessory with few parts.  There is the skewer with the two prongs that slide over and screw onto it to hold your meat in place.  There is a big ring that sits on top of your kettle and the lid goes on that.  There's a screw-on counterweight to help with even rotation.  And then the motor that slides onto a bracket on the aforementioned ring.  That's it.  Basically no assembly required.  Do you like beer can chicken?  You won't bother after using this.  I'm not a chef so I can't explain how spinning the meat around makes it so good but it does.  Juiciest bird ever, seriously.  Also does roasts well with excellent results too.  I haven't used this for a turkey but I can't see how that wouldn't be outstanding as well.  The motor is quiet, if you care about that kind of thing.  The plug attached to it is ridiculously short so you will probably need an extension cord.  I recommend keeping the box it comes in for storage because otherwise it's kind of bulky and random in the garage.  The only criticism is it's expensive.  But it's one of the coolest BBQ things i own and would buy another in a heartbeat if it was stolen or broken.  But Weber doesn't make them anymore!  So if you are thinking about this, buy now before they are gone forever.  I wish I could get extra prongs for the skewer so I could do two of whatever I am doing without have to jerry-rig it.
B00004VWM1 This is the best accessory you could own for your grill.  It produces fantastic chickens (I do two at a time), roasts, leg of lamb, and (my favorite) turkey.  My brother-in-law brought his smoked turkey to compare with my rotisserie turkey for Thanksgiving.  My turkey was gone and his was mostly there.If you own a Weber Kettle Grill (22 1/2 inch) you NEED to have one of these.
B00004VWM1 Super fast shipping. Great addition to my Weber 221/2\" Performer barbecue! What's confusing is that I called Weber's customer service and they told me that the rotisserie would not fit the Performer barbecue. OK then I e-mailed there tech staff, e-mail sent back also saying that the rotisserie would not fit the performer!(Neither correspondence could tell me why it wouldn't fit). I read the reviews on Amazon and there were two which said that the rotisserie fit and worked fine on their performers. So I purchased one and they are correct it fits and work's great.Thanks guys!! I will be calling Weber again today to dispute their claims!
B00004VWM1 This Rotisserie is too expensive, but on the other hand it's well built, and does a great job. I bit the bullet and bought it on sale. I'm very pleased with it. I've had other rotisseries for other grills. And while they all do the job, the Weber seems to just float along effortlessly. The motor seems to be well built, and strong. Another reviewer said Weber isn't making this any longer. I have heard that elsewhere as well. It's the perfect match for your grill, so don't wait if you want one. I've done Chicken, Roasts and Pork loin on it, all came out beautifully tender and moist. Once you use this, you'll never make beer-can chicken again. I use it with the Weber charcoal pans for indirect cooking. A match made in heaven, or where ever the Weber factory is!FYI.... I have an old \"Universal fit\" rotisserie from an old grill. I found that the basket it came with, and the meat forks fit well on the Weber spit. Also, the motor fits on the Weber bracket, and the Weber spit fits into the old motor fine.
B00004VWM1 After brining my 13 lb turkey overnight, I started up the coals and set the turkey spinning. A little over 2 hours later, I took it off the grill and let the bird rest on the countertop. The smell drew every teenager in the house to the kitchen. The bird was completely picked over before I was able to make the rest of meal. So much for the other food groups. It was completely devoured. There was literally nothing left. My wife, daughters, and their friends kept repeating, &quot;That was the best turkey I ever had. You deserve a trophy!&quot; We now have their friends calling wanting to know when I'm going to roast another bird.Folks, this is a must-get addition to this grill. Forget about the chicken with the beer can up the old caboose. I am not the most experienced grill master in the world but this thing made me into a neighborhood hero.I'm off to Safeway for another Butterball. I wonder where I'm going to put my next trophy?
B00004VWM1 This rotisserie cooks great.  It adds another dimension to cooking on the Weber grill.  Like some mentioned in the other reviews, the rotisserie does not have a real tight fit with the lower half of the Weber grill.  I don't understand why Weber just did not make the bottom lip of the rotisserie the same as that of the grill cover.  Then it would have been a perfect fit.But regardless, the rotisserie works and cooks great.  I expect many years of rotisserie cooking with this piece of equipment on my grill.
B00004W430 I have one of these to use in the front yard where there are concrete paths. I roll it along as I pull weeds or do other chores in the garden. The fact that there is a rather clumsy storage area doesn't bother me too much, because the advantage is, you can pick up this stool and toss it around easily. You wouldn't be able to do that if the top opened. There's room for snacks, drinks, sunglasses, gardening gloves, a trowel, etc.I also have one that does open and acts as a pull-cart. That one does get more use as I pile bags of mulch on it and drag it around the yard.Both have their purpose. The Hopper Mobile Garden Stool is solid. I'm glad I have it.EDITED to say that I've thought of two more uses for it.1. You could toss it in the trunk of your car and easily take it with you to use as a chair.2. Convince the children that it's a self-propelled 'car' and let them get some exercise.  :)
B00004W430 This little thing works very well for what I bought it for:  something to sit on while I work with my plants and garden that will roll as I work my way across the flower bed/garden.  I'd like it better if the storage compartment was closed in so that I could leave it full of supplies, sitting outside, but I just put it under a table or in my potting shed and it does fine.  Well worth the price.
B00004W430 I use this to work in my raised garden.  It is just the right height and you can carry your tools along with you and not lose them.  When you have arthritis, you have a problem bending to do your lawn and garden duties.  This is the answer.
B00004W430 After I started having trouble with a sore knee, I go this to help me in the garden.  It's lightweight so easy to move around the garden, holds my tools, and is perfectly sized for me to sit on while weeding, planting flowers and everything else.  It has really saved my knees a lot of wear and tear and I am finding it super-convenient for storing my tools.  It even had a holder for my water bottle.  It's great!
B00004W430 If you're a lightweight and looking for something to scoot you along, then this is for you; however, if you're a little on the heavy side even the slightest, the wheels on this hesitate to move smoothly.  The reason is these do not have wheels that are totally rounded on the inside as well as the outside.  Picture a wheel cut in half and each half goes on opposite sides of the garden stool, so the wheel itself is not very supported on the inside.  Now, I have another garden stool I got from Home Depot.  The wheels are round on the inside and out, much stronger, roll smoother and have a seat which you can pick up to use as a handle to haul supplies, kind of like a kid's wagon.  On this you cannot.  So, as I said, if all you want is something to scoot on and you're a skinny-mini type of person, then this will do well for you.  Otherwise, try your local garden center.
B00004W430 This is a very sturdy little item for yard work, but it is very low to the ground to be handy to sit on if you have any back problems or you carry any extra weight.  Would be nice if it was a few inches taller.  The storage compartment under the seat is kinda inaccessible, and it would be nice if the seat popped up so you could get to what you store in there.  Would also be nice to have a \"tongue\" so that you could pull it along.
B00004W430 so cute and just the right size for me. Does not take up a lot of room and rolls great. Strong and durable and very handy and saved my aching back. Absolutely recommend.
B00004W430 This is my second cart.  The old one is still serviceable in the garden after years of HOT and freezing weather.  I use this new one in the house to scoot around cleaning floor boards or anything hard to reach.  Saves my back. I haven't found it has a weight limit.  I have used it to scoot some pretty heavy stuff from place to place.  Unlike the description the top does not open although some of the photos on the box are a different model which does seem to have a hinged side.  No matter I just reach under.  It would be even better with a couple drainage holes. It can sometimes be difficult to roll on rough ground but given its light weight I just move it and sit back down. Highly recommend if bending is hard on your back.
B00004W430 We actually have two garden carts this one and another that is all metal. The metal one even has a seat like those you see on an antique tractor. The metal one looks to be the better one HOWEVER my wife prefers the Garden Hopper over it. It feels sturdier than the metal one and does not tip as easily. I have noticed that the metal one now needs repainted and some bolts replaced. Not so with the Garden Hopper. It has sat out in the sun for days and it's paint has not faded. We do store it inside during the winter but we do that for the metal one too.My complaint is about the hinged lid. It takes too much force to open it. I realize that this is necessary because you don't want the lid coming open when you pick it up to carry it. Honestly it's just a minor complaint to me and does not detract in any way from the quality of this cart.All in all we are both happy with this cart.
B00004W430 All you have to do is pick this thing up to know that it's hollow plastic parts. And all you need to do is sit on it once to know that this is one solid little stool.The manufacturer's catalog that came in the box shows that their other products are children's toys that are built for punishment, yet no so dangerous that they'd crush a child. They've carried that same quality construction through to this little stool.The wheels are a little on the small side to carry my 230-lb body across a patch of healthy lawn with ease, but it wasn't so difficult that I would have to stand up and move it, either.I find it a tad inconvienent to reach under the seat to get to tools. There is a cup holder on the outside, but it's design is such that it isn't good for anything but cups or cans. The one thing I'd like to see here is some other sort of outside storage for tools instead of the cup holder.The all-weather plastic means you can leave it outside, but it's lightweight design means you can store it on an upper shelf, too.All in all, the solid, but lightweight construction makes this one a keeper.
B00004Z2FP I ordered one of these becasue I was tired of pulling weeds from between the cracks on a patio I build that is a slate floor with sand filler surrounded by castle wall bricks with rose bushes behind. We have a lot of weeds that like to pop up and since our dogs play out there and eat grass poison was not an option. I bought this, got it a day later (thanks amazon!) and hooked it up to my grills propane tank. Instantly I lit it (why wait?!?!?) and man was this thing impressive! It's weeding with a flame thrower/torch. You literally only have to pass it over the weeds for a few seconds and they start to wilt. A day or two later they are dead. Now at this point you can pull them eaisly or relight your torch and burn em again! :) It by no means is \"magic\" but it does do the job as long as you aren't expecting the thing to vaporize weeds. It kills the cells of the plant and basically it starves it to death. I do recommend keeping the garden hose handy just because it's a safety issue.
B00004Z2FP I bought this last week direct from the company so that I could take advantage of a bundle deal. Wishing now that I had purchased from Amazon so that I could return this easily.I would imagine that this item would be great if you are using it for grass maybe or in an area that is bricked or concreted. In my case, in the woods with dry leaves on a gravel driveway and wind all the time it is a recipe for disaster. The flame is not very focused and unless you absolutely fry the weeds, they don't die. Even the young ones. I ended up pulling the weeds the next day around the house, but I guess I need to find another solution for my 800 ft. gravel driveway.In negotiation right now trying to return the torch. I'll post later about customer service.
B00004Z2FP I bought this primarily for natural herbicide free weeding. Having an infant crawling around, I was really hesitant about spraying Roundup and having that leeching into the soil, not to mention, our property borders a creek. I ordered this and had it the next day! Hooked it up and immediately began flame throwing. Thankfully, I began in the middle of our brick patio. This baby kicks out quite a flame. It was a breezy day, I suggest using this when there is little to no wind. It doesn't produce a tight concentrated flame like a propane soldering torch for plumbing would.Honestly I almost canceled the order in lieu of the $28 model from Harbor Freight. Thankfully you can't yet do that on an iPod touch or mobile phone. The more I thought about it, do I really want to trust an inferior tool when I am dealing with 100,000 BTU?Do keep a fire extinguisher or hose on hand! I did this the day after a rainstorm, which I'd suggest. Do NOT do it when it is dry outside. Even so, the grass caught on fire a couple of times.Next task.... I have a carpenter ant hill right where the sand box is supposed to go. No need to pesticides, I'll turn the ground and flame away. Not even summer yet, and I can't wait to try this on the ice in the driveway!
B00004Z2FP I've used the \"vaporizer\" twice and love it!  I have a gravel driveway - what a pain to use Roundup to kill the little grasses and weeds sprouting in the spring; it doesn't take much to fry them plus, on a cold day, the gravel gets warmed by the torch so my feet stay toasty.  I was initially concerned about lugging around the big propane tank on my dolly - not a hassle at all, the torch extends about 10 feet out so a big area can be covered.  Just be careful with dry grass - it catches on fire easily so keep an eye out for persistent flames.  Otherwise, a big time-saver - I wish I had some snow or ice to melt.
B00004Z2FP Ease of use is very straight forward with not much to go wrong. Even comes with a sparker. I use this as a log starter for my BBQ Pit and it does a great job. I'm also looking forward to having it this winter to de-ice the walks.
B00004Z2FP Buying this product was some of the best money I ever spent. So much fun I am surprised the government has not made them illegal. I love this product. It doesn't stop weeds from growing back, but you'll actually want the weeds to return so you can burn them again. I am 6'2\" and I wish the handle was 8 inches longer, but still love this product. The hose could be another 2 feet longer, but again, you want to own one of these weeddragons. The first day I had this item I used it for four hours non-stop. I did not want to go inside when it got dark. Get one of these and buy yourself two or three propane bottles. One bottle of propane will last a long time with this baby, but you'll want fresh gas once you discover all the things you can burn with this baby.
B00004Z4MS This is well made and sturdy but I just don't find myself using it because it's so heavy to carry to the garden - especially if you're carrying tools as well.  Instead I usually end up taking along a light plastic low one-step stool from the dollar store.  It's true I do struggle getting up at times without those nice handles to push against but I don't have to lug the heavy thing around and for me that's more of a chore. It just doesn't feel comfortable either - the seat is too high and the kneeler too low and neither is very soft.
B00004Z4MS I love this neat little household \"tool.\" It's compact, light, sturdy, folds up, easy to carry, hose-off-able and makes getting up and down from my knees SO much easier. I even realized that I could bring it inside and it made a perfect stool for cleaning low cabinets or a kneeler for scrubbing baseboards. Absolutely recommend. I'm thinking of getting them as gifts for my home-owning family members and friends.
B00004Z4MS I have owned this bench/kneeler for some years and would not part with it.  It is lightweight but amazingly strong.  It is a ready made seat for me in the garage, and it doesn't take up much space.  I am (unfortunately) 175 pounds, and this bench supports me easily.  Because of arthritis, the kneeler option is a must for me out in the garden not just because of my knees but because the bench's legs will help me stand up.  This is money well spent for anyone you know who is a serious gardener.
B00004Z4MS Just about everybody over the age of thirty has some kind of issue with knee and/or back pain, esp. when you want to do seasonal clean-ups inside or out.I was kind of flabbergasted when I was on my hands and knees, cleaning the bathroom floor, and my knees...hurt!...just from kneeling on the tile. I bought this device to help with that chore, and it's a lifesaver. It's made for outdoor use (and it's one of the sturdiest things I've ever bought), but for me it's been wonderful for indoor cleaning.The reviews here are excellent, so I don't want to reinvent that wheel. There are just two things I'd add from my own observations; that is, things you might not know until you actually order and get this kneeler.First of all, the yellow pad is on both sides, it's not just padded one one side. Now as it's show in this picture, it's something to sit on. If you burn it upside down so the yellow pads are a few inches off the floor, behold! It's a kneeler! The metal \"arms\" that become long when you flip it over are extremely sturdy. If you have problems working on the floor and getting up, they'll hold your weight easily and make getting off the floor a breeze (you don't even have to be kneeling ON it to use it as a sturdy prop to stand up.)The other thing is that the device is folded up when you get it. To use it, you just open one \"leg,\" then the other. Some folks seem to have problems folding it back up (very easy to store.) To do this, look for the springs on each side. There is a metal bar that runs perpendicular to the springs. Grasp the bar AND the spring section and squeeze. It's very resilient. You don't have to force the two bars together, but just enough to loosen the knobs that click into place when you open the device. When you squeeze (and yes, it's a bit hard if you're a woman), push the arm down, and one half is folded. Do the same with the other side, and you're done. (To open it, just open each arm. It locks into place with no effort.)You don't have to be an AARP member to find this device to be incredibly useful. I bought two: one for indoors and one for outside stuff. I absolutely recommend it if you find that your glucosamine and chondroitin tablets are taking awhile to kick in with that knee pain!
B00004Z4MS For all the reasons the other reviewers listed, this item has become one of my \"must-have-it-with-me\" tools when I work in the garden. I love it!
B00004Z4MS This product enables those who have difficulty bending down to be able to work in the garden effectively and with ease.  It is easy to set up and collapse for storage.  It was priced fairly.
B00004ZAVI 
B00004ZAVI I really like this bird feeder but not for the fact that squirrels can't get into it. I have two dogs that make sure that doesn't happen. Heck half the time they don't even let the birds on it. But I love it because I went out the other day and four of my six bird feeders looked fine and had seed in them but when I inspected them the seed mix had gotten wet and clumped up so it no longer would come out of the feeder. Not this feeder! The water can't get in to the seed area because the squirrel begone hood. This was the only feeder that was completely empty even though it was the newest edition and held the most seed. It's a hit with me, the birds, and maybe even the dogs!
B00004ZAVI This is a study feeder, with a tube 4.5\" in diameter.  The seed comes out the bottom of the tube into a small tray that goes around the tube.  The birds can feed through 4 holes in a metal sleeve that is suspended by a spring from the bottom of the tube.The main selling points on bird feeders seems to be 1) How squirrel-proof is it, 2) how long will it last, and 3) how much does it cost?  I will add a 4th of my own requirements, and that is how deer-proof is it.  I have had deer come in Winter and tilt myPerky-Pet 7103-2 Copper Triple Tube Bird Feederfeeder and drain the whole thing in a night.  The hoof-prints in the snow gave them away.  ;-)So this feeder appears to be both squirrel- and deer-proof.  Tilting the feeder does lose some seed, but it does not flow out very easily, especially when the bottom part is pulled down like when a squirrel or deer is trying to get into it.  The top dome also tilts when weight is on it, which will certainly cause squirrels and chipmunks to slide off.  I think it's a good design.How long will it last?  They claim a heavy-duty, powder coated finish, which I assume is over standard steel.  The spring inside the bottom part to make it tilt I assume is steel as well.  So this feeder will likely rust in maybe 5+ years, and once the spring rusts away, the bottom will fall off the tube - the spring is the only thing holding it on.  You will have to get a new spring from Perky Pet.  Aluminum or stainless steel would be better materials.How much does it cost?  This feed is on the expensive side, especially not knowing what materials it's made of and how long it will last.  I would wait for a price-reduction from the list price.
B00004ZAVI As a serious bird enthusiast, I have a fairly elaborate setup to attract them and have many.  This feeder seemed a good addition, but there are problems.  To begin with, when it arrived the black cap that covers the spring mechanism in the interior bottom of the feeder was loose in the box.  I don't think it was supposed to be as the directions didn't mention it and it was quite hard to reattach.  The feeder is really big, but not big enough for me to get my arm all the way down inside it to replace this part.  I finally got it placed by using a reacher/grabber gadget, but couldn't get it pushed down firmly.  As a result I expect problems sooner or later.  Right now it's working, though.The directions did show how to attach the pieces of the top, but I found it annoying that you can't set the feeder down with both the lid and the dome pieces attached as they come apart.  I figured out that the dome shaped cover piece is supposed to stay hung at the location you've chosen and only the tube with its lid is to be removed from the underside hook for refilling.Regarding the refilling:  On the good side, the big open tube is easy to fill with most scoops and can accommodate a wide mouth funnel that further speeds filling and minimizes spilled seed.  On the down side, detaching and reattaching the lid is awkward since the tiny side wires of the lid have to fit into equally tiny holes pierced in the tube, and which aren't easily visible since they are slightly recessed under the lid.  You have to squeeze the tube a bit to make it wide enough for the pins to get inside, then releasing it lets them seat if you have them in the correct position.  These holes are very near the top of the tube and should they break when the plastic is hard, during the winter, for example, the whole feeder becomes useless.  The whole weight of this feeder hangs on the two little holes in the plastic which are only about \" from the top of the tube. Only time will tell how long the feeder lasts and given the fact that one assumes squirrels will be jumping on it, trying to get at the seed, I have concerns.Another issue I have with the feeder is that the perches are very short.  So far only the tiniest birds have been able to feed from it, the chickadees and wrens.  Others may get the hang of it and I put the best no mess seed in it to encourage them.  I'll just have to wait and see.I have several feeders, all of which are very sturdy and need to be. For one thing, they can easily tip over on the uneven gravel where I fill them, which I have to do as often every other day during heavy feeding times.  They are almost never without many birds vying for the best perch and suffer regular attacks from crows and squirrels.  Both these marauders mostly enjoyed the tray feeder as all the others are tube feeders and squirrel proof (not that they don't get worked over).  I hated to have to remove the tray as some of the birds I most prize seeing prefer it, but the crows and squirrels drive me nuts.  So far this feeder has deterred both, which is a definite plus.Considering how expensive this feeder is, I expect it to do a good job at both satisfying my birds and deterring squirrels--and it has to last a long time.  I'll update after an extended trial period.  I've only had it up a week at this point.  Maybe it will grow on me.Update 9/18/13:  I left my other feeders empty for a while so the birds would work harder to use this one and the finches and titmice have decided it's okay.  The bigger birds still can't get purchase, but at least it's useful for the smaller ones.  It was easy to refill.  I feel a bit more positive toward it at this point.Update 10/12/13: Not feeling so positive anymore as the top broke off while refilling today making the feeder essentially useless because you can't rehang it.  Some super glue might work to reattach the hanging wire to the lid.
B00004ZAVI I probably would of given this a better score if the design of where the two little prongs are, was different. They support all the weight of this big bird feeder, and its heavy when filled...its good its a big one, filling less often interests me. BUT...the large plastic tube has two little holes drilled in it to have a little piece of metal stick into each hole to hold this, and I am thinking in time, just from the elements and the sun/heat that with taking this apart to fill, refill, etc the plastic will fatigue...then you have a very expensive bird feeder that the squirrels can't even TRY to get into anymore.To me the design of it and how it will probably not last too long is important as this is a pricy feeder. On the upside, it was easy to assemble. I was interested as to where it was made, it says its made in the USA of US and CHINA parts. Draw your own conclusions.
B00004ZAVI This is a decently made product, fairly sturdy and easy to put together. The nut holding the hook together seems to be too small and threaded incorrectly, but it appears to be holding together fairly well none-the-less.Squirrels still mange to use this product as their very own buffet, but they are not able to chow down as fast on the sun flower seeds I fill it with as they can with some other feeders. That is saving me from having to re-fill this as fast as I have had to fill some other supposedly \"squirrel proof feeders\".The mechanism on the bottom where the food come out is very clever in that it tilts and provides no way for the squirrel to hang on for more than a few moments before dropping to the ground. I am sure that given enough time, the squirrels will find a way to bypass this.What bothers me is the price. This is a fairly high end product for what it is. The only other feeders I've used that are in the same price range is byDroll Yankees YCPT-360 Tipper 4-Port Hanging Bird Feeder(although I am sure there are more expensive brands out there) and my Droll Yankee feeders have withstood the test of time. I've had some of them now for 6 or 7 years and they are still doing an outstanding job.If this product last even for three years it might be worth it, but the look and feel of the plastic makes me wonder if it can hold u to frigid winters, sharp beaks and claws and high winds without damage
B00004ZAVI I also had the wrong-sized nut/bolt to tighten the baffle, so getting the top hook and baffle off and on to add seed has been a pain. I've been meaning to get another nut for it, but just haven't had time.Assembly is easy, though I have to admit, I didn't quite see how to get the top off an on initially. You have to kind-of squeeze the sides of the plastic tube to get the top off and I wonder how long that'll hold up before it cracks. It does seem to be very study plastic, but we'll see. I do have my doubts about two little metal prongs in two little plastic holes holding up to 3lbs. of seed for extended periods of time.This feeder holds a LOT of seed. The birds took to it immediately. To date, we have not seen any squirrels on it, nor try to access it.I currently have two other feeders from Droll Yankee with lifetime warranties and they are still holding up after six years. Based on this cost and the quality issue with the top nut/bolt, I think there are better options out there.
B00004ZAVI Between the weight controlled port closure and the tilting and wobbling dome, this bird feeder certainly lives up to its claim of being squirrel proof, BUT it lets so much birdseed fall out of the bottom as the base tilts under the weight of even the tiniest bird that squirrels and large birds can gather up as much birdseed they wish.Probably not quite the solution to the problem you were looking for.Note: The bird feeder comes mostly assembled, and I made no attempt to check the already assembled parts.  After a month one of the perches somehow unscrewed itself and fell off.  I recovered the perch and the nut but could not find the locking washer.  If the locking washer was never there, that would readily explain how the perch came off, and when I checked the other three they were still tight.  So it might be worth a couple of minutes of your time checking that all four perches are screwed in tight when you first unpack it.
B00004ZAVI It's sturdy, a plus. It's engineered to keep squirrels from damaging it and eating the feed. That works too. It's attractive, another plus. Add that up and you get about 2 and a half stars.BUT...BUT...BUT...The design is not only unfriendly to the squirrels, but it is alsoBIRD UNFRIENDLY.I waited a long time, several weeks to review watching the feeder just off my patio where hangs several other feeders. During that time only one house finch ate from the feeder, only once. The design is not one that readily attracts birds. They have to discover where it is the feed is offered. It's almost hidden unless they actually perch. They don't want to do that.Other feeders with a mesh feed reservoir nearby were super actively being used at the same time this new feeder was ignored. So if it's called a bird feeder and the birds don't like the design, then that's a giant multi-star negative. I can't recommend this feeder over the other styles, even though it is strong enough to discourage the bushy tails. Less expensive feeders are not squirrel detracting, but for the price, perhaps could be replaced once or twice at a lesser price. And they will allow you to watch birds actually eating seeds.Bottom line: keep looking. I really wanted this feeder to work, but it will not be used much longer. I'm listening to the golden finches and chickadees who said \"No.\"
B00004ZAVI Update and downgrade. I'm downgrading this to two stars because the birds simply don't like it. I've had it up or a long time now and it is surrounded by four other feeders that all do a brisk business. This feeder has the same seed and yet the birds try it once and then ignore it. I'm convinced the seed is simply too difficult to extract and so the bird give up. There are much better feeders on the market and I would start with any feeder from Droll Yankee such asDroll Yankees YF Flipper 4-Port Hanging Bird Feeder. Updated on 1/24/2014.I have a large \"feeder station\" outside of a picture window in my den and over the years I've tried a lot of feeder designs--some just because I was looking for the best made and best designed feeders and some because I wanted to defeat squirrels. I'm in Connecticut and there are lots of gray squirrels here and they are amazingly clever (and funny) when it comes to getting food from a bird feeder. And they are determined little creatures. I finally found a method to keep squirrels out of my feeders 100% of the time, and I'll get to that at the end of this review. But I'm still willing to try new ideas and it would be fun to find a feeder that solves the squirrel issue all on its own. I'm not sure that this feeder does that, but time will tell.This is a larger feeder than I thought it was going to be-and that's a pleasant surprise.  It also seems pretty well made, but I have some doubts about some of its construction features. Here are some pros & cons:Pros:*The dome on top and the lid look as though they'll keep the food dry from rain or snow entering through the top of the feeder. Wet food can grow mold and that is very dangerous to birds.*As I said it's a large-capacity feeder and  holds three pounds of seed. That's pretty substantial, so I like that feature.*It was simple to assemble, all that  you really have to do is attach the lid at the top of the tube and then put the hanging loop (using a small nut) on the dome. Took less than two minutes to assemble everything. Unlike the Droll Yankee feeders that I use, the perches were already installed and that saves time. On many of the Droll Yankee feeders you have to tap them through holes in the plastic tube and that requires freezing the posts (to shrink them) and that's a pain.*Overall it seems very well made, but with a bird feeder it often takes months and some severe weather to find its flaws--so I'll update this review in a month or so.Cons:*First and foremost, I am not crazy about the way the base tilts down. The idea is that the squirrel will fall off (from its own weight tilting the base) but it appears to me that a squirrel could catch its paw in the feeding station opening if the base starts to tilt after he's on the feeder. I'm not completely sure that that's a possibility, but I was able to get my finger caught (gently) between the moving base and the stationery feeding tray. I certainly don't want to look out and see a squirrel hanging by its paw. Again, the risk may be pretty low, but the way this is designed, the feeding perches are attached to a collar (that has holes through which the birds feed off of an interior tray) and that's what moves. It's easier to understand once you have the feeder in front of you.*Also, I prefer a feeder that has a catch tray underneath to catch the spilled seed. Instead, this tray has openings in the base so that food that falls off of the internal feeding tray falls out through slots in the bottom of the feeder (again, much easier to see when you have the feed in front of you).  The problem with food falling on the ground is that it brings rats and mice. When there is a catch try, the food gets eaten by the birds.*The tube seems a bit too flexible to me. The way that you mount the lid, for example, is to squeeze it a bit and slide in two prongs on the lid (the lid, not the dome, they are two separate things). It seems to me like the prongs could have been a tiny bit longer to keep it attached more securely--and also, every time you grab the tube, you squeeze it and the lid can pop off. Not a major flaw, it's minor, but it's an issue. The Droll Yankee feeders have a lid that slides up and down, you don't have to remove it and it fits very securely. I'm not sure if the plastic tube on a Yankee feeder is thicker or not, they may be exactly the same.You might think that from the cons that I don't like this feeder, but that's not quite true. I am willing to keep it up for a while and see how it works, both in keeping squirrels away and in just feeding the birds. If I don't see squirrels hanging by their paws or find a lot of food on the ground, I'll be satisfied. As I said, I like the capacity and I th
B00004ZAVI We have some pretty fat squirrels in our yard that have managed to get into every bird feeder we have.  It has been about a summer month and I am actually surprised to say that we have not seen them eating out of this one.  We have seen them look and survey but we have not seen them even try to get on this one.  So far it has worked well to keep the squirrels at bay.  The two downsides to this feeder are that there are only four posts/holes for the birds to get to the seed so only one or maybe two birds will eat at one time.  The other downside is the ridiculous price.  At over 70 dollars one might as well invite the birds out to dinner and a movie.  I can't imagine how the manufacturer can justify the price for this thing.  The top and bottom are metal but the tube is just thin plastic.  How pissed would you be if you bought this filled and hanged it and it fell and cracked the tube?!
B00004ZAVI When I received this product, the bolt to tighten the baffler was not the correct size so I called the manufacturer. They were quick to respond and sent me a second whole bird feeder. The issue with the second one is that it was missing all of the hardware. Since I received this as part of the Vine program, I was not going to waste any more of my time trying to get this manufacturer to ship out the correct parts.We gerryrigged the baffler, but it makes removing it to put more seed in very laborious. So far after 2 weeks no birds. It does take awhile to get birds to a new feeder.Why the one star? Too expensive and the manufacturer has obvious problems with packaging. Not worth the time and money. Buy something for less money. A hint on keeping squirrels away from feeders is to remove any from areas where squirrels can jump to. We have six feeders and no squirrels. Now deer are another thing altogether!
B00004ZAVI We have quite a few mature trees in our yard which provide an ideal place for bird feeders. Anyway that's what I thought when we moved here. I hung several of the birdhouse style feeders and in no time the squirrels and chipmunks figured out how to scare the birds away and skillfully scatter their meal on the ground. I watched some even work in tandem to steal the bird food.Perky-Pet has recently released their latest in a line of anti-squirrel bird feeders. They call this one the Perky-Pet Squirrel-Be-Gone: The Baffler (Model 397). If you have ever observed a rodent at work, they are clever and persistent in their desire to secure food and housing for themselves. As you can probable see by the photo this bird feeder has a long clear plastic seed tube that makes up the body of the feeder and providing a visible place to store the bird seed. The bird feeder dimensions are 25 in. H x 11.7 in. W x 11.7 in. D; the seed tube is about 4 inches in diameter and will hold a substantial amount of seed, up to 3 pounds! Here is a promotional blurb I found on this product from Perky-Pet:\"Best Used For: Attracting and feeding birds without allowing squirrels to get the seed. This unique squirrel-proof feeder will increase your bird traffic while minimizing seed lost to squirrels.\"This feeder has an attractive shiny metal saucer-shaped lid (or as Perky-Pet calls it \"a dome\") that connects to the top of the plastic seed tube. There is a hole at the center of the saucer to connect the two parts and at the same time provides a place for a ring to be fastened on the top of the dome for hanging. The dome is part of this new squirrel-baffling bird feeder, along with a very cleverly designed metal base that comes already attached to the bottom of the seed tube. There are four holes (or ports) about the size of dime around the metal base right through the seed tube. These holes are the feeding ports. Small perches are also attached to the base in front of each feeding port and are made out of metal just like the base for durability. Considering the dimensions of the perches and the feeding ports this bird feeder is obviously made for small lightweight birds; No crows or pigeons allowed!Now let's get to the patented weight-activated base and other features of this squirrel-baffling bird feeder. The smooth metal dome is not secured tightly to the top of the seed tube which allows it to wobble around when any weight is applied from above or below; like from a squirrel or large bird. According to Perky-Pet: \"The dome tilts and wobbles as well to throw squirrels off balance who try and land on the feeder.\" This also applies to those pesky crows that dominate our backyard in the mornings, scaring away the smaller birds we are trying to feed. Likewise, if weight is applied to the base, such as by a leaping squirrel, chipmunk or a large bird, the base swivels like a bucket under their weight, automatically closing off access to the feeder ports and preventing the loss of seed.There is very little assembly required. Perky-Pet has included an excellent sheet of instructions that are easy to follow and is written in English only. In fact, there are only two steps to complete assembly. All assembly applies to attaching the dome to the seed tube; everything else comes already assembled. During assembly one thing concerned me. The seed tube is plastic and there are two small holes on opposite sides to attach the dome to the seed tube by poking the ends of a metal bracket through the holes. This feeder is not light and once 3 pounds of birdseed is added it is quite heavy. In my opinion, this is the weakest link of the Perky-Pet bird feeder. In order to prevent a future disaster I decided to drill-out the small holes so I could insert a 2-piece hard rubber grommet into each new hole. This allowed me to still insert the metal bracket as designed while also providing reinforcement for the plastic seed tube. Only time will tell whether my modification will prolong the life of the feeder, or not.Perky-Pet has three short and informative videos on their website explaining (1) How the Squirrel-Be-Gone Baffler works, (2) Where to place your bird feeder and (3) Instructions for cleaning the feeder. You can Google the website by typing the following in your browser window: perky-pet squirrel-be-gone baffler model 397.I had originally intended to hang the bird feeder on one of my wrought iron shepherd staff hanging poles but decided not to when I realized the bottom of this 25-inch bird feeder would only be hanging about 3 feet off the ground; much too low and inviting for the numerous non-flying animals that roam around my backyard. After I watched the videos mentioned above I decided to relocate my bird feeder to a higher point and nearer to our birdbath; I also added a hook to the end of the metal strap I am now using to hang the feeder from a protruding galvanized metal pole mounted horizontally on the bottom roof line of a large shed in the backyard. I have to use a stepladder to hang and remove the bird feeder, but that is no problem. This product was built in the USA with both U.S. and Chinese parts. The label information on the front of the box is written in English, French and Spanish.Overall I am pleased with this new bird feeder. The squirrels and crows have tried to access the feeder without success so far; the wobble and tilt action has definitely kept them off guard. However, they are crafty and persistent animals and since there has been a minor amount of seed loss, mostly during the recent wind storm, the seed that did fall to the ground has kept them motivated to devise new ways to thwart the security measures built into this new Perky-Pet bird feeder.On the front of the box Perky-Pet added the following statement:\"Feeder base and dome tilt to baffle the squirrels and protect your bird seed! Birds feed undisturbed from 4 feeding ports.\"I think Perky-Pet is overreaching reasonable expectations for this product by expecting small birds to feed undisturbed. There is always some animal around my neighborhood looking for a free meal; either in the form of birdseed or in the shape of a bird. Though it would be nice, so far undisturbed feeding is not the norm around here.Otherwise, The Baffler has worked as promised. Since there are moving parts it stands to reason that some attention will be necessary in the future to ensure the mechanisms continue to wiggle, tilt and wobble. There is no mention about maintenance on the Perky-Pet website that I could find. Only time will tell how well this new feeder will work over the long haul. Since much of the Perky-Pet Squirrel-Be-Gone: The Baffler is manufactured with metal parts I expect my Perky-Pet bird feeder will outlast most if not all of the plastic and wooden bird feeders on the market. This bird feeder retails new for $73.99, which is a hefty price for what you are purchasing. I know you can shop around and buy this bird feeder for much less than that.
B00004ZAVI It's really almost too big a bird feeder and the perch legs are too short.  Only little birds can land on the legs and they're not likely to do so with such a massive feeder.  It's expensive, it's difficult to clean because of the way the lid attaches to the base. The feed holes are too small as well. I would pass on this; just too many negatives.
B00004ZAVI I have this hanging outside for a month now, and I'm still waiting to see a squirrel fall off it. They don't seem interested in investigating it yet - perhaps the dome is doing its job of keeping the squirrel away from the perch. The perch is supposed to tilt when a squirrel clings on to it, both denying the squirrel access to the birdseed, as well as throwing it off balance and possibly off the feeder.The feeder comes with the top unassembled. My first problem with it came when I tried to assemble it. The nut provided did not hold the dome securely - when I put a light pressure (say, 2 pounds) on the dome, it will push the nut off the hook. I called customer support, who offered to replace the entire feeder. I decided to get a replacement nut from the hardware store instead. Strangely, I could not find a nut that fit exactly, with either metric or Imperial threading - so the problem might be with the threaded hook. However, two metric threaded nuts worked where 1 didn't.The reason why I'm worried about how long this will last is that the seed tube is made of plastic. Near the top, a metal rod goes through holes on either side of the tube. There's no reinforcement, and this being a rather large feeder, a lot of weight is being supported by a bit of plastic.There also doesn't look like a good way of disassembling the bottom of the feeder in order to wash it properly.I haven't yet seen a squirrel being thwarted by this yet, so I'll rate it based on my observation of it so far. I'll update the review when I have more information.
B00004ZAVI This is an attractive looking, functional feeder and was easy to assemble. The only problem I had was that the unit shipped with the wrong size nut needed to secure the baffle to the hook. Nothing I had at home would fit properly either. I took the hook to my local hardware store and the correct nut is a metric size. Twenty cents later I had the correct part and was able to complete the assembly.I have had the feeder hanging in a tree for a few weeks now and the little birds love it. They took to it within a day or two. [It sometimes takes a week or so for the birds to find a new feeder. I have four other feeders in my yard so the regulars are used to finding food here.] The larger birds have trouble with the little perches. This keeps the Grackles and Starlings from emptying the feeder but it also discourages the Cardinals.The squirrels and chipmunks have not been able to get to the seed by climbing the feeder - however - there is a fair amount of spillage from the tray which ends up on the ground. The chipmunks are having a feast sitting underneath it. The additional of a seed catcher would be nice.The true test of a feeder is whether it will withstand a Midwest winter and ever hungrier squirrels as natural food supplies dwindle. Right now the squirrels aren't that interested. They are curious and jump on it, but don't try too hard. I'm also concerned about the sturdiness of the plastic and how well it will hold up when temperatures go below freezing. I will update as the seasons progress.
B00004ZAVI ok i was so hoping to love this bird feedersadly i do notfirst off right out of the box i had to call in to get a new hook for hangingwhenever we tried to screw it in then hang it up all came crashing right back down againthe nut was too big so there was simply no way to tighten it like it was supposed to begot the new one it and same thing happened so had to finally just go to a hardware store to jimmy rig iti see in reading reviews we are not the only ones with this issuethen other issue we have is not the easiest thing to fill with the feedand once all the way full wowzers is it heavy we had to change the hook it was onbecause of the weight then i just finally hung it right from the treethen on the issue about being squirrel proofi get the concept but with ours they still try to mess with itand shake the sillies out of it and once in a great while they do manage to knock it hard enoughthat some spills out of it crazy i know but i saw it happen for myselfnow granted maybe out beasts are just more crazy than othersreally they did not get tons of the food not like in the other feeder that we havefor the price i am not so convinced this is the right feeder for our birdsthey really do not seem to like it all that welli see them on the other feeders more than this onenot sure if the poles maybe are too short or whatwe have blue jay cardinals blue buntings and many other small birds too numerous to name them allthe little ones really do not like it at allthe bigger ones i see on it more than the little guysi had to give it a 3 because i feel the design could have been betterand i had to be the one to figure out how to get the top to even work rightand i really feel it is simply too big but maybe that is just for our situation
B00004ZAVI My back yard is a haven for all sorts of wildlife- not just birds, but rabbits, squirrels, chipmunks and the occasional skunk. I choose plants that encourage wildlife, and I never use pesticides or herbicides. I've never had a bird feeder, though. I was always worried about the effects of artificially feeding birds, but I was recently reassured by a naturalist that birds get their food from a great many sources, and one more source really won't make a difference. And so I ordered this feeder.Looking at the list price, you'd expect it to be a pretty hefty, solidly-built device. If you did, though, you'd be wrong. There are a couple of stampings, a molded base, a thin plastic tube, a couple of springs, some pieces of steel rod for perches... and that's it. It comes mostly preassembled, requiring only that you attach the mounting ring at the top of the feeder. That piece did give me some concern, as the main thing supporting several pounds of seed and feeder is a skinny #6 screw. New, it has more than enough strength, but a few years outdoors might weaken it through corrosion.Filling the feeder is easy, although my first attempt resulted in a pound of birdseed scattered on my back porch. It was running out through the bottom of the feeder, and I couldn't figure out why until I discovered a black plastic cap about an inch in diameter lying in the bottom of the box. It's not shown in the wordless assembly instructions, but I managed to figure out that kit is supposed to close off the bottom of the seed chamber. It slips on to part of the molding that composes the inside of the base, with less than 1/2\" of overlap. The only thing really holding it in place is the weight of the birdseed in the tube. Once the level of the seed falls below this cap, it could easily become dislodged, and the seed inside could run out. I considered gluing it on but that would make it impossible to access the springs inside if they became unhooked or broke. Once I had this figured out, filling the feeder was easy enough, although I was also concerned that the tube is suspended by two very thin steel wires that are inserted in two small holes in the plastic tube. This also seems like a potential point of failure.  I hung the feeder under my maple tree, using a lightweight steel chain- something squirrels were unlikely to be able to chew though.That was several days ago, and since then we've had two heavy rainstorms, neither of which managed to get any water into the feeder. That's good. I haven't seen any squirrels try to get in, and I don't see any seed spilled below the feeder- which suggests that perhaps the birds have yet to discover the feeder. It may well be that food is plentiful enough this time of year that the birds really are stressed enough to look for new food sources. I suspect that when cold weather comes, they might be a bit more motivated. I'll be watching the feeder regularly between now and then (my home office has a clear view of the feeder) and I'll update as the birds and squirrels discover the feeder. I'll also update if any parts fail along the way.Update: A close inspection of the ground below shows evidence that the birds have indeed discovered the feeder, and it looks like the level of seed may have dropped a bit- I'm going to put a mark on the tube to monitor the level. No signs of squirrel activity.Update II: The birds have definitely discovered it. There isn't too much wasted seed on he ground, but the level of seed has fallen least rabble, and I've observed several birds feeding on- and right now it looks like two robins are having a bit of a fight over who has priority on it. Still can't give it any more than three stars, given the cost and construction, but it's good to see that the birds are making use of it.Update III: The birds- or a combination of birds and other scavengers- are now consuming seed at a rate of two or three pounds a day from the feeder. I just refilled it, and  I noticed a good deal of seed on the ground as well. As I type this on my back porch, there are four small birds on the feeder, and about eight or nine scavenging seed on  the ground below.A this point I'm undecided as to whether I'll keep filling the feeder, get another, smaller, feeder, or just discontinue feeding until winter. I'll probably buy another 20 lb bag before I make up my mind.Followup: It's now June, and the feeder has been hanging in my yard since last August. It doesn't look any worse for the wear. There are no paint chips, no rust, no cracks in the plastic reservoir. In short, it looks pretty much the way it did when I hung it 10 months ago.  I've discovered a number of things since first hanging it, too. Most commercial seed mixes at the big box stores are full of milo, a seed that no bird appears to care for, although they'll eat it in an emergency. The best deals are to be found at country feed stores, buying mixes or making your own. I use a mixture that's mainly of black sunflower seed, some cracked corn, safflower seed, and occasionally some cracked peanuts. This has something for just about every bird found around here, and has drawn a much wider range of birds to my yard than I've seen in the past 27 years. I plan on adding a noter feeder or two, using different mixes in them feeders to get different birds, and maybe add a few birdhouses as well.July Update: I was working at one end of the yard when I heard a crash and turned just in time to see a squirrel sailing through the air after bouncing off the roof of the feeder. They still haven't figured out a way in, but one or two of the smarter ones may have realized than sitting on the feeder and shaking it can dislodge seed do they can eat what falls to the ground below- see the photo.
B00004ZAVI There really is a lot to like about this bird feeder. I live in the Pacific Northwest in extreme Western Washington, and this is now one of 6 feeders that I have so YMMV (your mileage may vary).I have waited some time before adding this review to observe how my birds have adjusted to the feeder. It has taken some time, but they are, very slowly ,and very gradually, becoming more used to it and using it a bit more. The chickadees and the nut-hatches are finally responding and are feeding from the feeder with greater frequency. The slow start to use this feeder seems to be that in order to get to the seed the birds have to stick their heads into the openings, something many birds seem to be hesitant to do it seems.The Good:1.  Very well constructed with quality materials. This feeder will last a long time and, I think, will hold up to weather and use.2.  It performs as advertised, and it really does thwart squirrels, and for my location, raccoons as well.3.  The top also also has the added advantage of keeping the food more dry in wet conditions thanks to the overhang from the anti-squirrel proof curved top.The Not So Good:1.  Many of the birds seem very hesitant to use this feeder, as mentioned above it may be because they really hae to stick their head into the opening to get to the seed. I use a \"premium\" blend. Perhaps another sort of feed mix would be more attractive to them> I'm not sure since this blend has had them doing through 20#of seed in a week generally.2.  The level of seed has not gone down much in this feeder after nearly three weeks of use. The birds have been coming to the feeder a little more each day though, so I am cautiously hopeful. I hope that they will gradually become more accustomed to the feeder, but it is a slow process for them it seems.3.  I have not had such a slow response to any other feeder, and Perky Pets feeders have always been a favorite choice for me.So - you see that I don't have a very solid positive answer for this feeder, nor can I say definitively that it does not work. Perhaps the species that you generally attract may make a difference?We attract chickadees, nuthatches, flickers, woodpeckers, various finches, cedar wax wings, juncos, doves, and a host of smaller birds. I have a year round population.I want to love this feeder because it really is made well, but at this point, about 3 weeks after purchase I have some reservations. I have seen an increase in use since I first put it up.
B00004ZAVI This is exactly the bird feeder I've been looking for. We have a serious problem with very \"intelligent\" squirrels. They've managed to get into every bird feeder I've used and ruined most of them. This feeder is sturdy. It also works to keep the squirrels off, at least so far. I hung it on a moderately high branch where it's easy for me to fill and so far the birds have figured it out, but the squirrels are kept at bay. I hope this continues.The feeder can hold three pounds of seed. That, of course, depends on the type of see you use. This is another plus for me. We have a lot of birds here and the other feeders would run out after one or two days. So far this one has lasted a week.The price is rather high, although not all that much worse than the feeders in the stores in town, but if it keeps the squirrels away and lasts several seasons, it's worth it. It's certainly better than investing in a new bird feeder every year and having it ruined.
B00004ZAVI Our last two birdfeeders have been smaller Perky-Pet models and they've been fine. Priced at about $20, and perfectly serviceable and bird-popular even if squirrels have easily solved them.So I wanted to see how Perky-Pet's high-end \"squirrel-be-gone\" model would work. I did not pay for it, but got it free through the Amazon Vine review program.As a product it's well-made and while I think a smart squirrel will still get some food out of it, I do think this will make it difficult for them. The way the food dispenser tilts and wobbles will make it very difficult for an animal to maintain a long grip. They'll fall, and while they'll come back, they'll fall again.My other feeder, the squirrel could just hang out until I squirted him with water. This one will make them work much harder, and hopefully he gets tired of it and moves on.But is that worth $75? I just don't see how. Bird seed's not that expensive, so even if a squirrel does eat a bunch of seed, how long would it take for him to eat $50 worth of seed? However, I only deal with one smart squirrel - so if you've got several, then it's a different issue. Still, the price seems high for what is basically a fun luxury item.This is a big feeder. I have the tallest shepherd's crook, and this hangs down far enough to be difficult to see under the railings of my porch. Luckily, we can see two of the four portals even if it's a little obstructed. The point is that this is a large 3-pound feeder, and will be a big change if you're used to those smaller, cheaper versions.The size is matched with quality. This has some weight to it, and is not one of those cheap plastic models that seems to age very quickly. I think this model will have a longer useful life. I usually get rid of a feeder once a year, usually after winter, but I bet this one would last.Ultimately, while I like the product and I think it's well-made and should live up to most of its claims, the price makes it so I can't go above three stars. But - a $75 feeder that last 4-5 years is better than paying $20 for a new feeder after every winter. So IF this lasts 3-4 years I would have a different opinion.The birds use this fine - like any new feeder, took a few days, but once they got used to it they all sit there and eat all day.
B00004ZAVI A rather large, mostly plastic feeder intended to deter squirrels.It's larger than I expected, and flimsier.  The tube isn't quite as rigid as I'd like, the top is attached by a single small bolt/nut, and the bottom is attached via a single spring.  I'm not sure how many seasons this construction will hold up through the variable, wet winters we have here in Maryland (frequent changes from cold to warmer).The unit arrives mostly assembled.  For storage, the top has to come off (since the top is a \"baffle\", it flops over in storage).  Since the feeding ports are only at the bottom of the feeder, I had to hang it a little higher than I had planned (so it was still visible from my ground floor windows).  Even so, I have to stand near the window to see the feeding ports.The large capacity means less refills are needed, but between lots of seed sitting out, and the design that seems will encourage seed to stick to the bottom of the feeder, I'm concerned I'll get moldy seed and have to scrub this thing out more often than I like-- I prefer the kind where I can easily dump out the dregs without scrubbing or washing.The baffle is pretty garden-variety, and I've seen my squirrels handily climb over baffles like this one (it's not particularly wide nor does it swing/swivel vary hard). The bottom design is innovative and seems like a squirrel clinging would cause the port nearest the squirrel to close, but the crafty little rodents may be able to twist their bodies to still get to the port on the other side.So far, the only birds who've discovered the feeder are chickadees who are trying to get seed from the ports but seem off-put by how far in they have to reach to do so.  That means at this point, I'm not sure how well the feeder works, since neither most of the birds nor my squirrels have discovered the new source of food.  I'm not sure if it's the unusual feeder configuration (my usual feeder is a hanging platform with an anti-squirrel grid), or that the temperature fall has meant lots of other food options for the local fauna.  I'll update once I get more activity, particularly of the furry kind.UPDATE: The chickadees figured it out first, and still are the ones who most like this feeder.  The tufted titmouses use it some also, but I haven't seen any larger birds on this feeder.  The only squirrel observed was eating spilled seed under the feeder, rather than trying to get into the feeder.  One morning I found the feeder in pieces on the ground (nothing broken, the nut/bolt apparently came out of the hook), which might have been the result of a curious raccoon-- but reinforces my concerns about the feeder's construction, so I'm maintaining the 3-star rating.For the time being, I like the idea of this feeder but am ambivalent about the design and durability, especially at this high price point.
B00004ZAVI I have tried numerous supposedly squirrel-proof feeders over the years.  This is a pretty basic design.  The top keeps squirrels from crawling down fro the top (but they can still jump from nearby branches if not carefully placed).  The bottom is on a spring that closes when the weight of a bigger squirrel (grey) lands.  However, some smaller squirrels, like red, or chipmunks are too light to lower the bottom and can access the seed.These kind of feeders usually work well for a year or two, then get knocked down by deer or bear and the top gets chewed by something (probably the grey squirrels).  They do work pretty well until that time.I have had it hanging for nearly 6 months and have had very little bird interest.  I think it is because I primarily use black oil sunflower seed and they just don't come out well from this feeder.  The benefit of this is that squirrels and deer are not able to tip the seed out. The downside is that the birds also have trouble.  My other feeders are filled with birds and empty quickly.  This pretty much just sits there unless the other feeders are emptied.  I could switch to a seed mix, but the majority of that goes uneaten.  Safflower would probably work, but that isn't very popular in my area.I do think it is very hard to fill.  I had to add an s-hook between the feeder and top baffle to be able to hang it easily.  I won't buy another if a bear steals this.
B00004ZAVI We have several bird feeders outside our breakfast window and have had a terrible time with squirrels. Our feeders hang from a pergola-type structure build over the window and the squirrels climb up the sides of it and actually leap onto the feeders. I jumped at the chance to review this Perky-Pet Squirrel proof feeder. I have used Perky Pet products in the past (their hummingbird feeders are the best) and always been pleased with them. This bird feeder, however, has been a disappointment.First, the good news: It appears well constructed and it holds a lot of birdseed. It is fairly simple to put together and hang. I've had the feeder up almost one month now and I can report that yes, it is squirrel-proof. They have not been able to get to it.But now, for the bad news: the birds don't seem to like it either. I filled all 3 of our feeders, this one included, and while the other 2 older feeders were empty within days, this feeder still remains almost full of seeds after almost 4 weeks. I have seen birds perched at it but the feeder just isn't popular with them. I suspect that the openings near the base (where the birds have access to the food) isn't obvious to them and they have to stick their heads inside to actually get to the seed. Perhaps it is just sunflower seeds that don't do well in the feeder. I will plan to try another type of seed and ammend this review if there is a difference.
B00004ZAVI The assembly is easy and the design is good but not perfect as it does not stop small chipmunks getting at it. But this feeder prevents squirrels from feeding on the seeds. I have used this over the past one month and we have few chipmunks in the yard to cause enough trouble at the feeder. When a squirrel jumps at the feeder, the metal dome tilts and wobbles to throw the critter off balance. The weight-activated base also tilts to close off the four feeding ports. The feeder is designed satisfactorily and the metal dome and feeding base is well constructed. The glossy heavy-duty powder coated finish protects the feeder from sun and rain. I have rated three stars for its quality 
B00004ZAVI Right out of the box - it does seem like good quality and looks to be nicely made.  It was easy to assemble, fill and hang.  I have had bird feeders before and even the ones that claim to be squirrel proof were broken into and essentially destroyed by my squirrels. I have it hanging on a shepherds hook and I haven't even seen a squirrel get near it. So far - so good.
B00004ZAVI I immediately found that the quality of this feeder is really good. The metal parts are thick and heavy and have a good coat of gloss paint. It comes almost fully assembled as all you need to do is put the top dome and the inner top cap on. So now for why I feel it needs a 2.0 version. First the clear plastic cylinder that holds the feed has two small drilled holes at the top that the inner cap clicks into with pins. I know that its just a matter of time before the holes start to crack and then split and no longer hold the pins. I think they need to reinforce those hole areas with something (i'll use some duct tape of something myself). The other problem and this may just be an oversight is that there is a nut that you use on the inside to fasten the dome/hook hanging knob. Well, that nut is bigger than the hook/screw and just falls off and doesn't secure the dome at all. I called the company and the telephone number on the instructions insert are wrong so I went to the website to verify. Once I got a person on the phone they were very polite, apologized for the bad part. They had initially told me to return the feeder to Amazon and get a new one since it was brand new. I had to mention that I was doing a review thru the Vine program and she immediately said it would be no problem to send out the one part to fix the issue. I also asked if anyone else had called about this issue and she said she hadn't heard anything but would mention it to the appropriate department.Squirrels are clever critters so i'm constantly changing/rotating out my feeders to try and keep them guessing. Some will still figure out a way, as most jump on it and hit it hard enough to make the seed fall out. Which is what I think will happen on this one but I don't think they can hang from it like a bat and eat from it. It is heavier than most feeders so be aware that it really needs a strong line or what ever you are hooking it on to. I did notice (and this may change in the future) The price is $72.00 on Amazon but on the Perky-Pet website its only $59.00 Its way too expensive for a bird feeder but it is made of good materials and sturdy. For me if it wasn't for the Amazon Vine program to get this, i'd pass on it because of the high price.
B00004ZAVI I own several Perky-Pet brand items and have always loved their products.  I really love EVERYTHING about this squirrel-proof, EXTRA LARGE bird feeder; except for the price.I have 5 other feeders in my fenced-in yard and the birds in my yard flocked to the feeder on the very first day I hung it up.  No clogging, no squirrels, great design and super easy filling are the main things I really like about this feeder. If you don't mind the price, I would urge you to purchase this feeder.  It is undoubtedly my favorite feeder in my yard!Happy Feeding!
B00004ZAVI We have had all sorts of birdfeeders, but I have to say, for some reason the squirrels don't have anything to do with this one. We've tried many squirrel-proof feeders, and well, most of them just aren't squirrel-proof. The squirrels can just take them apart if given enough time.I really can't tell you what it is about this one, but it does seem to work!
B00004ZAVI I hung this feeder in the same spot as another squirrel proof feeder that the squirrels never defeated but never stopped trying to vanquish it either.The squirrel-be-gone feeder is large with it's eventual weight determined by the type and amount of seed used to fill it. Listed capacity is three pounds, but we keep it half full to keep the weight down. Filled to capacity this feeder requires sturdy support.It is easy to assemble the feeder with the only challenging part the piece that hooks into the plastic tube. Filling the tube is no harder than filling any other feeder of this type though I found that using a funnel makes filling much easier and neater. The base and baffle are made of powder coated metal - I'm guessing aluminum because a magnet doesn't stick to it.Most importantly, does it keep the squirrels at bay? So far I'd have to say yes because mostly they don't even try to get into this feeder. Even if they could get past the baffle, the perches are too small for a squirrel to grasp securely. Even the Rodan-sized blackbirds in our yard have a difficult time getting food out of this feeder because the perches are too tiny for them also.A deer had mastered the other squirrel proof feeder and regularly emptied it. I don't think Bambi will be ever to get seed out of this feeder.Yes, I was also taken aback by the listed price for this feeder. Yet, the price has gone down at least five dollars since I first saw it posted, and on the day I'm writing this review it's on sale at the Perky-Pet site for 59 dollars. Those who have spent years battling the squirrels might not mind paying this much for a squirrel-proof feeder that actually works.UPDATE -  I filled the feeder to the top; it holds lots of seed. The next morning the feeder was completely empty. We suspect deer who have previously emptied our other feeders. Will have to monitor the situation.
B00004ZAVI The Perk Pet 397 is almost like the Cadillac of anti Squirrel Technology. The top baffle helps serve to \"baffle\" the enemy, while allowing some birds to maybe stop and perch on the edges... but, if they are too weighty, the baffle will tilt, kicking them off the top. Very few birds I've seen on the feeder have tried landing on the baffle, so it may not work as a perch anyway.Baffles are old hat in the battle against the Squirrel Invading Army, however, so Perky Pet has enlisted even further help. The perch section on the lower portion of the feeder is spring loaded, so that when something too heavy for the feeder touches down, the battle line is closed and the invasion repelled.Unlike the Droll Yankee, THE M1 Abrams in the Squirrel Invasion Prevention Army, is much more expensive than this model. I do not own one, but I can see how someone would want one if they have a bigger squirrel problem than just 2-3 of the little pains. This, of course, in no way justifies the cost of the Perky Pet 397, as $75 is a really expensive feeder. Sure, it works, but you better have a really bad squirrel issue to buy into this one in my opinion.Missing is the ability to adjust the sensitivity of the perch latch, though I've seen a few cardinals on ours, so I assume such birds wont be an issue and will still be able to feed.The feeder is easy to assemble and easy to fill. One thing to note, if you plan to fill this to capacity, ensure wherever you are hanging it has the ability to withstand the heavy load. This thing holds a lot of seed.Overall, I'm happy with the feeder and its squirrel thwarting capabilities. Where I struggle is the price. For $50 you can buy 2 baffles, one for above and one for below a regular feeder. Unless you give the little suckers a place to hang out between the 2 baffles, you pretty much succeed with squirrel immunity. If you want an all in one solution, have the ability to hang this with a full load of seed and just want to hang it and forget it, this is definitely not a bad solution to the Squirrel Invasion.
B00004ZAVI This is a nicely made feeder, easy to assemble, fill with seed and hang.  I have had it up for about a week and so far no squirrells have  been able to get to the  food!  I have it hanging from a shepards hook  that  is cemented into the ground! The birds have had no issues that prevented or made it difficult for them to eat at the feeder.While it is nicely made, easy to assemble etc. it is in no way worth $72!!!  I can't imagine anyone paying that kind of money for a bird feeder that is suppose to keep squirrels out of it.
B00004ZAVI We haven't had a bit of problems with squirrels, chipmunks or other pesky thieves stealing birdseed since I put the Perky-Pet Squirrel-Be Gone IV feeder out. At first I tried regular birdseed, but the birds didn't seem to care for it. They couldn't (or maybe just wouldn't) dig through the mix of seeds to find their favorites. After seeing the seed level not going down, I decided to swap out the seed for black oil sunflower seeds. The only birds to use it (and still very sparingly) are the goldfinches. Everything here still prefers the other feeders and will pretty much ignore this even when the other feeders stood empty for a few days.The feeder design itself is really interesting. It is large and holds a nice amount of seed (up to 3 pounds!), so you are not filling all the time. The cover is not attached to the feeder, but instead the feeder hooks to it, allowing the cover to wiggle and not let any creatures to sit comfortably on the top. The perches are attached to a free moving base that will tip and close off the food so any unwanted visitors cannot get to the food.This feeder really seems to work well, but my birds don't seem to like it. Maybe this winter will be different as food becomes more scarce.
B00004ZAVI Issues with the feeder:-the nut that is to secure the top hook to the cover is tiny in size and ill fitted to the size of the hook.  It was impossible to secure it, and thus the top wobbles a bit.-tube plastic, part holding the seeds, is a bit thin.  It has to be squeezed slightly in order for the 2 prongs that hold the top on to be inserted, which gives me concern it will not hold up well in windy conditions.-seeds (1/4 to 1/2 cup) fall out of the bottom when filling the container and/or anytime the feeder is set on a solid surface.-bottom portion wiggles around the tube, seems way to loose, maybe that is why so many seeds fall out.-It does hold a lot of seeds, but the rather flimsy construction and materials gives me pause for concern. Especially considering the entire thing is held together by 2 tiny prongs, one in each side of the tube top.observation:-only very small birds have room to land on the tiny perches-the holes to feed from are very small, and there is a gap between the opening and where the seeds actually are, so again, only a small bird head will fit inside the hole to reach the seeds.Opinion:For the price, currently $73 on Amazon, there are better, more sturdy options. I have and currently use several cheaper and better feeders than this one.**Edit Oct 3, 2013 -- So after only a few weeks, I had to take down the feeder as the bottom was falling out.  And changing the rating from 2 stars to 1.
B00004ZAVI Simple assembly (two minutes worth) is required for this feeder.  The tube has two holes in the top into which you insert the  metal prongs on the roof (you cannot see this in the stock photos, as it is covered by the squirrel dome).  I have uploaded a photo of the top. The roof has a 2 inch  opening for seed and a bar across it, so that the baffle part can hook onto it.  To fill you have two choices, remove the top by slightly squeezing the plastic,  the plastic is flexible enough for this, but I am not sure if that is what it was designed for and am afraid that squeezing it may stress it.  Or you can try to pour the seed through the opening, which is not easy because the bar across the top tends to deflect the seed.  I really do not like this, especially because the tube itself tends to move around when you set it down due the spring loaded bottom designed to keep squirrels out.We have Abert squirrels (darling but clever things that look like koalas).  They are acrobatic and determined.  They do not seem to be able to access the feeder after a few days (and they usually do get into them quickly) but it remains to be seen if they will learn.  Birds do not seem to have a problem.This feeder is not worth the current price over seventy dollars.  The metal parts are a lot nicer than most birdfeeders, and the bottom works well but I feel that the design of the top is really lacking.  I am concerned about all the weight on the small prongs that stick out and filling it is a pain. The plastic part is also not much better than my 20 dollar feeder.  Filling it so annoying, that I cannot recommend it at all.  I have a couple of the Perky Pet 102 Squirrel Resistant feeders, (you can get three of those, with some money left over for the price of this one) that have multiple ports (which birds like) and which are MUCH easier to fill.  Squirrels can get a bit of food from them, but they do have to work a bit for it.  Try one of those first if squirrels are a pest.  I am going to use the baffle (which is very nice powder coated metal) for my one of my other Perky Pet feeders.  If the baffle were sold separately, I would buy some more of those.
B00004ZAVI I let the feeder hang for about a week under 4 different trees.I would purposely put some bird feed on the ground in hopes that they would eat it and then move up to use the feeder.For some reason I never could entice them to try it.Even squirrels climbing neighboring trees and the tree it was hanging from ignored it.The design seems to make sense but I think the main problem is the way the little metal perches are sticking out instead of being in front of the seed dispensor like a more traditional feeder.Maybe when the ground is covered in snow it would draw birds to it.Or maybe in the spring when birds are busy making a nest they would try the easy supply of food.But here in the late summer/early fall they just avoided trying it.
B00004ZAW4 All of the reviews criticizing the design are correct. The link between the bottle and the suction cup assembly is fatally flawed. On the feeder I received, the glass blob and the runners on the suction cup frame fit together so tightly that there's no way to get the feeder off the frame when it's stuck to a window. Once it's on the window you have to wrestle the entire assembly off to refill, and then go through the tortuous process of remounting the suction cups. Good news/bad news - the feeder is so cheap that it's not worth paying the postage to send it back. Despite the much higher cost, I think the only maker of hummingbird feeders worth buying is Aspects.
B00004ZAW4 It took a while for my hummingbirds to get used to the new feeder before they started sitting instead of feeding while hoovering. Once they figured this out, it is their favorite feeder.
B00004ZAW4 I wanted a glass hummingbird feeder and decided to try this one on my window before springing for some of the more glamorous-looking blown glass ones. I mounted it on my kitchen window, under an awning on the northeast side of the house, not at all expecting anything to happen. A ruby-throated hummingbird found it the very first day!It took some force at first to separate the mounting bracket thing from the feeder itself. In fact, I had to drop it first for it to break loose and detach! Fortunately, nothing broke. I probably could have just soaked it in some hot soapy water and it would have come apart easily.You can't beat glass. I'm just totally getting away from plastic these days....
B00004ZAW4 This is one of my favorite feeders, because it's right there in front of your nose! Hummingbirds are very fast. I've gone entire years only seeing one sighting that year because I wasn't sitting by the feeder when they happened to come by. By sticking the feeder where it is always visible, that little movement will catch your eye, and you'll probably see them daily! I know I do!Because it's made of glass, and not plastic like the normal seed-feeders, it is on the heavy side and needs to be attached securely. I read some reviews where people had trouble connecting it. I found it quite easy, just clean the glass, oil the cups a bit and press. It's stayed up for years without any problem.I also read some reviews where people said they had trouble filling it. Just about EVERY hummingbird feeder I have has a small exit area - otherwise the nectar wouldn't come out slowly! A funnel is 39 cents and makes filling *very* easy.I have 10+ hummingbird feeders and this is by far the best for consistant hummingbird viewing.
B00004ZAW4 I too had trouble at first and gave this feeder a bad review but after fully reading the directions the brackett with suction cups separates from the bottle . I suggest you clean the window fully , which I did and it has never come down , been up for at least a month. When you refill hold the brackett in place with one hand and slide the bottle up and off with the other. It also does not leak. Since the brackett separates from the bottle it is very easy to apply suction cups to window. Forget all that about rubbing the suction cups with friction to make it stick.
B00004ZAW4 The window feeder is an awesome feeder and it is actually the most visited feeder that I have.I'm sure it's the location more than not but also the feeding ports are easily accessible to the rubythroated hummingbird..Please be aware though that ants will eventually find it.  With this in mind, be hesitant to remove that spider web on your window sill.  Spiders are nature pest control.
B00004ZB4K I ordered these little brushes to clean my hummingbird feeder, but you would be amazed at how useful they are around the kitchen and around the house. They fit into orifices and crevices when nothing else will.
B00004ZB4K It would be even nicer if they were packaged in different lengths and sizes (or at least one had a longer handle).
B00004ZB4K Actually, the name of this product describes them perfectly &#8211; &#8220;Perfect Little Brush.&#8221;  I actually have three sets of these. I had originally purchased them specifically for cleaning our hummingbird feeders but found that they are extremely useful for so many different things.I use them to clean small kitchen appliances, detailing our cars, cleaning power tools and cleaning fishing reels and my target pistols.  They work quite well in any small and hard to get at area.  They are stout enough to get the job done, yet they are gentle enough to not damage the thing you are cleaning.If you have hummingbird feeders then these, or something like them, is almost a must.  Feeders need to be kept extremely clean and need to be cleaned often.  These perfect little brushes make our lives so much easier.  We have, at times, up to 12 feeders going and cleaning them is a major chore.The price here is very competitive to what we paid here locally...IF you have Amazon Prime and get the free shipping.  If you have to pay shipping you might want to see if you can purchase the locally.  We buy ours at a local wild bird store. Although I will say that if you keep any eye on these brushes here on Amazon you will find that the price changes quite often.All in all this is a great product and I do highly recommend it.Don BlankenshipThe Ozarks
B00004ZB4K This set of three, multi-colored bottle brushes is perfect for cleaning hummingbird feeder ports and other small holes and places.  For example, I have reserved one to clean out the small spouts in my fountain which tend to clog with algae as the summer wears on.  Each brush is about 3.5 inches long, with a tapered head that begins at 1/8 inch and widens at the base to 1/4 inch.  The brushes can crush down to a much more narrow diameter than that, of course -- the width of the wires that hold the brushes, less than 1/16 of an inch.  The plastic handles are rigid, although they can accidentally be snapped in two with pressure.  The wired support of the brushes themselves is only slightly flexible; you won't be able to work these brushes around corners and inside the base of a feeder bottle.These are basically short, rigid, reusable pipe cleaners.  They are perfect for cleaning hummingbird feeder ports or any other job requiring those qualities.-- Debbie Lee Wesselmann
B00004ZB4K These brushes really do get in the ports for cleaning hummingbird feeders. I suspect the hummingbirds appreciate all the works I do for them - they come here year 'round but I wish they would tell their friends.
B00004ZB4K I am a bit reluctant to give these brushes five stars because they are priced as if they are gold plated. However, I am rating them strictly on their use and that does earn a five star rating. They fit perfectly into the openings in my hummingbird feeders and do the job well for which they are intended. Having three different colors is a handy feature for balancing out the use. A fine, if overpriced, product.
B00004ZB4K This is a very well made brush that is good for feeder ports, especially hummingbird feeders.  So far for me it's been tough enough that after several uses its still holding its shape, and without shedding.  I like it and feel it is well worth the price here on Amazon, (especially with the free shipping that is being offered at the time of this writing).  The only thing I feel I should make extra note of is its really small size.  It's only 3 1/2\" long, which makes it kinda useless for anything but ports on feeders.  If you want to get down to the bottom of a tube feeder where it really gets nasty over time, you will need to pick up a long bottle brush.  Also, if you do buy this brush for use on feeder ports, I would toss the suggestion of keeping it around your sink for other uses that's mentioned in the description.  You will be bringing in all kinds of bacteria from dirty feeders into your kitchen.  You can wash it well of course, but it's still a better idea to either keep one of these strictly for other uses than feeders, or buy some other brush for your kitchen sink.  Recommended for its quality and price.. : )
B00004ZB4K Bought these to clean the feeder ports on my hummingbird feeders and they work perfectly!  Great product!  You won't be disappointed with these
B00004ZB4K I took these and cleaned my old hummingbird feeder and boy are they great to use. Will keep the mold off the sip holes and that will be a blessing for all.
B00004ZB4K These are much smaller than I expected, I did not read the description well, I guess.  But I love them anyway they are perfect for getting into the little tiny holes of the hummingbird feeder to clean them well.  I was using a pipe cleaner before, but these are reusable, so they are perfect for the job!
B00004ZB4K I bought these to clean my hummingbird feeder. I didn't realize they were so short! They are really only good for cleaning out the flower part, but not the glass part of the feeder.
B000053F9J I found mine doesn't droop, and it has a good lighting area. I'm using it for seedlings after they germinate. I'm very happy with it.
B000053F9J This is the best one i could find on Amazon for a reasonable price. I love that it came with the bulb and clamp!
B000053F9J I bought this to provide supplemental light to my Bonsai and it works perfect for what I needed. The clamp is very strong and the fixture easily clips on securely and holds the light in place. Other reviewers have mentioned the light gets hot. I disagree a bit, the light does get fairly warm but not too hot. I have the light 13&#34; from my Bonsai plant and the warmth is hardly felt. The housing for the bulb gets the hottest but I really do not think it is much of an issue for me. I would not place the light near a curtain or blinds but I would not say it gets overly hot.+ Warm Color Light, Not Bright White Like Florescent bulbs+ Very Strong Clamp+ On/Off Switch+ Rotates/Twists/Adjusts to Many Positions+ Easily Replace Bulb+ Price+ Great Supplemental Light Source- Would be nice if the On/Off switch were on the cord not the housing_Bottom Line_ Yes, I would recommend this light to a friend. The further away the light is placed, the wider the angle of light allowing for multiple plants under the light. I have several plants under it and they are all doing very well. I just put two screws into a stud on the wall and then hooked the clamp to the screws. I am very confident the light is secure. I like that if/when the bulb goes out I can buy the same bulb or try something else.
B000053F9J This little light is easy to assemble, needing not much more than a screw driver to tighten the nut and screw. Once it is clamped down on another sturdy object, it stays put.  It doesn't wobble or come undone.  The cord is five feet long.  Depending on how far away this lamp is from the plant, the effective radius is plenty enough (about 24\" from a foot away).  I use this over a germination set next to my bird cage, and my little dove gets some of that light as well.One thing about this that may be dangerous to other users:  the black hood that goes around the socket gets VERY HOT!  This lamp would not be recommended around birds or small children.  However, set in a nice location this is a pretty lamp that provides good swivvel and warmth.This clamp comes with a 60-watt bulb, packed in its separate cardboard support.
B000053F9J I hope to remember to follow up in the spring as to how my herbs wintered, but I am very happy with how these lights set up.This is the first year I am trying to keep herbs growing, indoors, through the winter...in northwest MT.  I do have a room with fairly large south facing windows but at 48North, there is not enough sunlight and not good intensity to keep much going without supplemental light.I bought two lights and they easily and securely clamped on to a window valance (bamboo).  Not only do they give the plants good light (I hope!) but they create a nice ambiance in the room which is also my office (self employed computer programmer).I had thought to buy a light bar and stand - actually 2 - and make some shelf tables, but the other item in my personal mix is that I often travel by motorhome - and I travel through the winter.  These lights will easily go along and allow me to take my little herb garden along.  The light bar/stand options would not have worked for travel.It is a not very expensive experiment.  I love to have fresh herbs.  Based on other's reviews, I have very high hopes.
B000053F9J This arrived on the 19th and I started using it the last week of Feb. It is now March 4th and it has stopped working. No, it is not the light bulb, I changing it  a few times and still nada. So about 7 - 10 days use and it is broken already. Total waste of money.
B00005850M This method is must easier than boiling water and waiting for sugar to dissolve. Our hummingbirds didnt seem to notice when we switched.
B00005850M I love the powder nectar. Easy to prepare. Good buy online, prompt delivery! Left over nectar keeps great in fridge and ready to use.
B00005850M The only thing in this that should be there is sugar. The rest is stuff you shouldn't be adding to your feathered friends diet. This stuff is also three times the price of baker's sugar from any old grocery store, four times the price of regular granulated sugar that takes a little longer to dissolve. This is a bad buy, bad for the birds and bad for your pocket.
B00005850M I picked up some of this  mix last summer at a local agricultural center.  It's an old brand that is easy to find, and the price was right.  My first outing with it last summer was a total bust.  I mean I mixed the stuff, put it out in two nice clean feeders and saw nothing get attracted to it but ants and bees.  If any hummingbirds did bother to stop by and sample it, they were obviously disappointed for they never came back.  Personally I never eyed a single one hovering over it.  At first I thought that I may have gotten started with feeding them too late. I live in New England where we only get one species of hummer that comes this far north, (the ruby throated).  It's important to get your feeders up in early spring and then they will find it and remain loyal to you.  But this spring I was johnny on the spot with the feeders and the same no show was going on.  I decided to try another brand of mix after this last outing.  (I know you can make it at home easier and cheaper, but just not worth the mess and trouble to me. Just my opinion, but its stands).  I decided to try the Mills Brothers nectar after reading the positive reviews for it here on Amazon.  Within just a week of flushing the old feeders and putting in the Mills brand, I had two dedicated hummers dining regularly at my troth.  I love it. It's definitely a little pricier than this mix, but well worth it, trust me.  I don't really know if any other brand or home made mix would do the same trick as the Mills, but I don't really care.  I found something that's reasonably priced, easy to use, and the hummers love it so I am sticking with it.  In conclusion, I don't bother to get involved in the debate about this Perky Pet stuff being junk food or bad for the hummers.  Personally I think that a lot of folks get a little too excited and go overboard with the panic over additives and colorings etc.  My main disappointment and concern with this stuff is strictly limited to the hummers not liking it.  It may have something to do with my dismal results being that I am forced to only deal with one species of hummer here, but the end result is that this Perky Pet mix has been a complete failure for me, and the Mills Brothers a hit even this early on in the season. I have left a link to the Mills brand, and my recommendation is that you skip this stuff and go for what seems to really work...Mills Brothers Hummingbird Food 3-Ounce Packet, 3-Pack
B00005850M There is no reason for the manufacturer to put red food coloring into this mix. There are numerous concerns about the effect on hummingbirds.  This is reason enough to not buy this product.  Buy a product without the dye.Better yet, just buy sugar.  Use 4 parts water and 1 part sugar.  Boil the water first and then add the sugar until dissolved.  You will save money and perhaps a hummingbird's life doing this versus buying dye tainted food.  Hummingbird food is only sugar with coloring.CAUTION.  DO NOT use artificial sweeteners or honey, use only sugar.  Honey and sugar substitutes will malnourish and quickly kill hummingbirds.  Sugar Only!
B00005850M Hummingbirds are wonderful.  They're amazing, unique birds, but you don't need to buy anything expensive to draw them to your yard.If you want a feeder, try this one:Perky-Pet Glass 8-Ounce Hummingbird Feederor something similar.  I've used this type for years and you can't beat the fact that it's glass, and that you can buy new bee guards.  (They get moldy.  Don't bleach...replace.You can get a good feeder for about ten bucks and it will last for years.As far as food, you can do two things.  Plant plants that hummers and butterflies and bees like; or buy a gallon of distilled water and some quality sugar.  You don't need red dye, and shouldn't use it.  It's bad for the Hummers.I was going to send a Feeder to my nieces, and when I looked at this product I was appalled to find that Perky Pet is still producing such a formula.  Their bad.It's cheap to have hummingbirds.  And easy to make your own hummer-chow.  Don't buy this.
B00005850M We recently purchased a new-to-us home in a nicely wooded area. Within a few weeks of moving in, we realized that there were more than a few hummingbirds around... about that same time, we came across unused (new-in-box) feeders while helping my mother clean her garage. This all seemed like the making of a fun hobby, and we have not been disappointed.one of them was a Perky Pet 8 ounce feeder (Perky-Pet 203CP Pinch Waist Glass 8-Ounce Hummingbird Feeder) and the boxed set she she came with one packet of this nectar, which we found to be easy to prepare (very nice, since we really only have a couple minutes to get-it-done as we head out to work early morning).We cleaned the dust off the feeders, loaded them with nectar... and then nothing really happened for the first few days.  Just as we began to feel a bit of disappointment, we were encouraged when we noticed that the fluid level dropped a bit.Following directions, we emptied and cleaned the feeder at week's end and then refilled it -- and that is when the nectar carnage really started! As week #2 of our feeder experience really got underway, the feeders emptied in about four days and we began to see hummingbirds coming and going at all times of the day. Guess the word got out!By the middle of the fourth week, the 16 ounce feeder was emptying every 2.5 days or so and the 8 ounce feeder in a day or two. We had wonderfully colored green, yellow, blue and kinda magenta hummingbirds flying around in singles and in pairs, and they are awesome to watch. They love this nectar, flying in to land on the feeder's perch and sipping until content, then buzzing right off. There were even times when hummers seemed to do a little battle for prime sitting position, with the 'winner' forcing the other one(s) to hover just a few inches away (im)patiently waiting for their tuns. Very interesting and beautiful to watch.It's November and night-time temperatures are dipping below freezing, and our hummingbirds seem to have migrated away now. Can't wait to get the feeders and nectar back out in the Spring and watch them frolic again.Highly recommended! Totally fascinating.
B00005850M This nectar is easy to mix and left overs can be refrigerated. Since I went back to the instant versus the pre-mixed; I've gotten my hummingbirds back. :)
B00005850M This product is very easy to mix.  There have been some hummingbirds using it, yes we do have hummingbirds in the winter.
B00005850M I love Perky-Pet feeders, but they should be ashamed of themselves for selling this. They do not need artificial anything, especially food coloring! All you need to do is bring 4 parts water to a boil, and 1 part white sugar, let boil a couple of minutes and let it cool. If you are too lazy to do this, you shouldn't be feeding hummers. It only takes a few minutes, and you can make more and store it in the fridge for up to 2 weeks. Hummingbirds also get their nutrition from real flower nectar, and small insects.
B00005850M Besides Hummingbirds:this nectar &#34;with NATURAL sweeteners&#34; mix will also draw a variety of birds;nectar feeding birds along with a few seed eating birds + it's quick & simple to prepare.One 2 LB box contains 6 pre measured packets / makes 6 quarts of nectar.As with other nectar:the nectar feeders need to be refilled OFTEN;especially before the birds have plenty of insects to feed on..Part of many nectar feeding birds diet also includes insects.
B000059MT3 This is like a Tornado in your hands. Has 3 settings : Off , 1 and 2.1 is pretty powerful and can even move small rocks. 2 clears everything out of the way. Haven't tried it for the vacuum yet but that's not why i got it.
B000059MT3 I honestly believe that this is the best, most powerful leaf blower for the money. I mean, come on...under $60.00. The Toro name. Great power. Lightweight. Easy to handle. What else would you want? OK...so some people will be put off by the fact that it's electric. Big deal. Get yourself an extension cord. I have a lot that's 150 feet deep and it's no problem maneuvering this thing with a cord attached to it. As far as noise goes, this this is a bit noisy...but it's a leaf blower!!! What are you expecting? Silence? The nice thing about the noise is that it's more of a low roar instead of a high-pitched whining sound like my neighbor's blower (which drives my wife and me crazy). Now...about the vac feature. If you're looking for a heavy duty leaf vac/shredder, this ain't it. It does have a plastic impeller and you have to be careful not to suck up any rocks or thick sticks. In fact, this is my second one of these blowers. I had the first one for three years and had no problems with either the blower or vac part. Then my 10-year-old decided to see if it was powerful enough to suck up a small rock from the garden. Indeed, it was. But the rock broke the plastic impeller, and that was the end of it (man...what a horrible sound THAT made!). But is should show you something that I went right to Amazon and ordered the exact same blower to replace it. I may use this one mostly as a blower. I'll use the vac, but only to suck up stray leaves on the driveway and in hard to reach places. I honestly believe if you're looking to vac up big piles of leaves, a much more heavy duty piece of equipment is in order. But if you're looking for an excellent blower at an excellent price, which will do minor vacuuming of leaves, this unit is perfect. You really can't beat the price. At under $60.00, I don't think you'll find a better made, more powerful, well-built unit. This thing really blows!!!!
B000059MT3 Here's some opinions I have after using this blower for a couple of weeks now.1. The vacuum bag is hard to take off. I seen in another comment that, do not to slip in in all the way. Haven't tried that yet2. The On/Off knob. Sometimes I found I bumped into it with my hand causing it to move it's position.3. I found it easier to let the bag lay on the ground instead of using the strap around the shoulder when vacuuming leaves.4. The Magnesium Impeller will fit on this unit. I ordered and installed the Magnesium Impeller from Toro model 51598. (thanks to Allen who commented about that in his review)5. Would be nice if it had one more lower setting on the blower6. It's very light and has plenty of power
B000059MT3 Received this Toro for Father's Day and I love it. Sweeping and raking are two of my least favorite yard chores, and this unit has instantly become one of my indispensible tools. Although I was able to vacuum up green hedge trimmings w/o any real problem, I went ahead and ordered the replacement impeller from the heavy duty Ultra model (they are interchangeable), for an additional $30. I was going to mount it right away, but now have decided to run the plastic one until it breaks or wears, then switch to the magnesium one. It makes sense to do this, as the magnesium impeller is very light, yet this Super unit is 4 lbs less than the Ultra, which helps at the end of the day.
B000059MT3 Let me keep this short and simple- this sucker blows like a hurricane!  It's much more powerful than others I have used.  The speed adjustment is handily located.  And while I'd never call it \"quiet\", it's not as loud as less powerful blowers I have owned.  I can't comment on the vacuum function as I've never used it.
B00005AKZE I use this for a very small lawn.  It starts like a breeze and cuts well.  It has plenty of power.  I got used to dragging the cord pretty easily and that is well worth the trade off for ease of use.  The main draw-back is that the handle is wider than the mower so prevents Getty close enough to fences, etc.
B00005AKZE This Black and Decker has worked well in my father's tiny 25' x 80' yard, but I wouldn't want to use it for a larger area. Here are my observations:Pro -+ Easy to Use; just plug it in and go+ Quiet; can use it anytime day or night without disturbing the neighbors+ Lightweight; my elderly father had no trouble using this when he wanted to, but my son also was able to help outCons -- No Cord Included; you need to provide your own heavy duty extension cord- Watch the Cord While Cutting; like using a vacuum cleaner, you need to be mindful of the cord so you don't accidentally run it over (I recommended the bright orange color ones that are easy to see against the green grass)Overall, we are very happy with this for use on a small yard.Highly Recommended!CFH
B00005AKZE After using a heavy metal mower for years, this was a blast of fresh, light air. You can mow one-handed and wrangle the cord with your other hand....HOWEVER, we have officially just broken 2 of them. The first one was killed when the blade hit the protruding metal sewage pipe in our yard. The second one just broke now when I set the blade too low and hit an old tree root under grass. The blade got bend, and may be replaceable if the main stem is also bent. I also hit a rock a few weeks ago and almost broke it then, too...Best for even yards without anything that can bend the blade. The cord is a total pain to wrangle and keep from going into the blade...May consider a rechargeable battery model next....
B00005AKZE I have had this mower for five seasons so far, during which I typically have to mow twice per week from March through October or even November.  In other words, this mower has seen lots of use, and it hasn't failed me.There are several reasons I love this mower:1)  I am allergic to gasoline, so I avoid using it as much as possible.  Therefore, it is extraordinarily helpful to have an electric mower that allows me to avoid yard-based gasoline-guzzling &#34;appliances&#34; completely.2) It is light-weight, so I can handle it on my own.3) The handle easily folds down so it takes up less room in storage during the winter,4) Because it is electric, I can flip it upside down to clean it out without worrying about spilling any toxic chemicals.5) It does a very good job cutting grass!  This is important in a mower!  It also does a good job mulching grass clippings.6) It can handle hills without any issue.7) It is easy to adjust the cutting height.  In fact, the cutting height can be adjusted with one hand, by moving the handl on the left side of the mower.8) It is QUIET!  This mower emits less than half the noise polution that a typical mower emits.  I could probably mow very early in the morning and not annoy my neighbors too much. :)9) It doesn't pollute the air the way gas-powered mowers do.10) It is easy to start, with no pulling, keys, or other obstacles.  Just plug this baby in, pull up on the little orange handle (on the main handle), and mow.  That's it!Using a cord can be annoying at times, but it is something to which I QUICKLY became accustomed, and I quickly set up my &#34;ballet routine&#34; of mowing while avoiding the cord.  It isn't that bad. :)
B00005AKZE I feel like I am vacuuming my lawn instead of cutting it, and the cord gets quite annoying to constantly move out of the way.  But as far as quality, cost (no gas) and quick startup, it's very good.  I would recommend if you can get past the cord getting in the way all the time....it definitely took me probably twice as long to cut the grass than it normally would with a gas mower just because of having to move the cord over and over again.  But it cut well, was very quiet.
B00005AKZE This is my first electric lawnmower, and so far, I absolutely love it.  It is smaller, quieter, lighter, cleaner, and more efficient than your typical gas mower, and there is no risk of throwing out your back trying to start it.  It is one of my best buys at Amazon.The mower was shipped in the original box, with the housing nicely supported by cardboard inserts to protect, and minimize vibration.  Remarkably, a single strip of clear tape held the cover down.  The mower is relatively easy to assemble, and does not require any hand tools.  The instruction manual is pretty thorough, except for a couple of parts related to assembly, where a little better description, and larger diagrams would help.  Although it is stated in the manual that `no lubrication is necessary', lubricating the bolts on the handle before assembly, and even finished metal parts like the handle, will help deter corrosion.  The springs in the power handle and grass guard, would also benefit from spray lubricant.Once assembled, the mower is ready for immediate use.  Favoring the right-handed majority, the power switch is on the right side.  The motor starts up smoothly, and is relatively quiet, even when running at full power.  The whooshing sound generated, probably isn't much louder than a large electric weedwacker.  Since the motor is near the ground, and enclosed by a green plastic cover, the sound doesn't carry too much.  Motor speed can be controlled using the throttle lever, though the mower is designed to be run at full throttle most of the time.The blade height is set using a lever located at the left rear wheel, and is adjustable in approximately half inch increments, from about one inch, to three and a half inches.  The motor on this mower is probably not strong enough to cut a heavy lawn with grass higher than say three inches down to the one inch level, without stalling.  Running a motor with the rotor locked, is not a good thing, so avoid trying to force your way through tough spots.  Cutting narrower strips of lawn is one option.  Or you may need to start with the blade at a higher level, and then drop it down to one inch on the second pass.  If there are just a few high spots, the old technique of raising the front of the mower, and cutting them down, and then going over the area again, might do the trick.  It sounds like a lot of work, but consider that an electric mower is much lighter and easier to maneuver.Grass will collect at the discharge area.  The spring-loaded plastic deflector has some deep depressions that get clogged with grass.  If you don't clean the area out it could promote corrosion of the spring.  There is a gap between the green plastic outer cover and the metal framing that also gets filled with grass.  Perhaps a hard rubber seal in this gap, would be a good idea.  In general, the design of this area could be improved.There is a plastic strip at the back of the mower to help block debris that might blow backwards.  It is quite soft and flexible, and because it is quite close to the ground, it gets bent around and scraped up.  Possibly if it were made of harder plastic, and raised up a bit, it may last longer.  The wheels look quite sturdy and durable, and according to the manual, the wheels require no lubrication.Besides the normal safety concerns when using any lawn mower, users of a cord and plug electric mower, need to develop an awareness of, and a system for handling, the power cord.  Avoiding any possibility of overrunning the cord should be a primary concern.  What is recommended is if possible, mowing outwards from the source of power.  That way, you can try and minimize the chances of crossing over the cord while mowing.  Running the cord over my right shoulder, keeps it from trailing directly on the ground, and helps me keep track of where the cord is.  The mower has provisions for attaching the cord, and when connected properly, there is almost no chance that the cord will become detached.If you have a very large lawn, or one with heavy thick grass, this mower may not have enough power, and you may need to look at one of Black and Decker's other electrics with more powerful motors.  This machine has no problems handling my 2000 square feet of lawn, and I am very pleased with my purchase.  Easily five stars for this baby.
B00005AKZI I bought this product back in 2004, replacing an older gas mower after my neighors house caught fire from a leaking gas can in his garage. Used the electric mower until 2007, when I treated myself to a mow/blow/go gardner. I just stuck the machine out in the side yard and never touched it. In July 2008, I pulled it out to mow a newly planted lawn not covered by my mow/go guy. Plugged it in, and it started right away, try that with a gas mower. My new house has 2300 sf of front and back lawn, this mower just gobbles up that lawn. It does bog down in taller/thicker patches, hence only 4 stars. But it gives a nice clean cut. Changing the blade was easy. And it does a nice job of mulching, my lawns look great. I will never own a gas mower!
B00005AKZI This is truly a good mower. I bought my first Black & Decker electric mower in 1972 and used it as my only mower until 1994. It received normal use on a normal sized subdivision lot. I absolutely loved it.Then, I moved to places that had much more land and the use of such was impossible. For the last few years, I've lived where there is a combination of riding mower and walk-behind needed. My gasoline walk-behind developed problems that were going to cost more to fix than it was worth. So, I bought this one.It took just a few minutes to get the mower assembled and the handle adjusted. I sprayed the underside with vegetable oil and started using it. It works great. It is heavy enough to not bounce around on uneven ground, but is light enough to let an old man with back and leg problems to push it around.This has the same problem as the Black & Decker corded tiller - the cheap plastic flip-our power switch and the worthless (and unusable) cord minder. Using a 12-3 cord is necessary for the distance I have to go with this and it just won't fit into the mower as designed. It also requires holding onto the mower with your right hand 100% of the time, regardless of the direction being mowed and where the cord is. I'm working on plans to modify the whole switch/cord thing. What a shame that this needs done.Yes, this is still a 5 star mower. The height adjustment is very easily used. There is ample power. The grass catcher works well, as does the mulching feature. It is a snap to keep clean. And, again, the weight is just right. I really, really like this. It seems that they assigned the mower development to people who knew what they were doing and the switch/cord development to someone who had never used an electric lawn tool.
B00005AKZI This mower hit a small rock on its first mission and that enough to break the unit and send it to the dump.
B00005AKZI Moving to a smaller property back in 2003, I found myself no longer needing my riding mower. I looked at several options in the gas mower lineup. After talking to a couple of electric mower owners in my neighborhood, I went shopping at the local hardware store and brought home the earlier version of the Black & Decker MM875 Mower. Like other gas powered tool owners at that time, I seriously had my doubts. That changed after a few weeks use. I'm very surprised that after eight years, this mower is still up and running.Weighing in at 52 lbs, this 12 amp mower cuts a 19\" path in no time. With adjustable wheel heights ranging from 1.4\" to about 3.5\", it does a nice job. I like the one touch feature for wheel height adjustment. There's no fuss and tightness to contend with. I don't miss the noise of a gas powered motor. Unlike the newer version, my mower has a straight handle bar with a comfortable grip. The start handle is conveniently located on the right side and has a good feel to it. Other then that, there's really not that much of a change from the original.This mower is light and easy to maneuver around bushes and trees.  It does an average job of mulching. Mine came with the side discharge chute. The rear bag that now comes with the newer units was an optional purchase back in 2003. Even though I don't use it much, the folding handle is a nice add on for owners with tight spaces. As far as power cords go, I picked up a good 100 foot length 14/3 gauge outdoor extension cord. Its not that hard to manage the extension cord. When using any power tool, its all about staying alert.Like any piece of gear, proper maintenance is paramount. Prior to using this or any mower, its a good idea to coat the undercarriage with a non stick spray. I use the generic grilling spray on mine. I give the blades a good coating too. Since the body isn't metal, I use a rubber spatula to remove any buildup. Afterwards, a good wipe down. Its a good idea to inspect the bolts, nuts and screws for tightness after each use. Just like gas powered mowers, it does take a little bit of effort to remove and replace or sharpen the blade. I always sharpen my blade before the start of the mowing season and every other month. When sharpening the blade I use a fine tooth file. It can be sharpened with a good stone too. I got about 5 years out of one blade.Besides replacing the blade the back flap needed some help too. The original flap lasted me about 7 years and wasn't that difficult to remove and replace. Protection wise, Black & Decker offers a two year limited warranty on the mower and a lifetime package on the mower deck. I've not used their toll free customer support number for the mower, but I have for other Black & Decker products. The customer service that I did receive was outstanding.Overall, I am very satisfied with my Black & Decker mower. It has been a reliable lawn tool that quietly and efficiently gets the job done. With proper maintenance I expect to get another eight more years out of this one. In closing, I can honestly say that I don't miss my old gas mowers one bit.
B00005AKZI This mower works great with small lawns that have minimal obstructions between the electric outlet and the desired mowing area.  The only way they could make this mower better is if it was push assisted.
B00005AKZI I've had this mower now for 3 seasons. And every time I fire it up, I recall the days of having to maintain an internal combustion engine. You don't have to change oil. You don't have to check spark plugs. You don't have to run the mower dry for over wintering. The only real maintenance we've had done is to sharpen the blades, and we did that last year with no fuss. That's it. Maintenance is blade sharpening. This saves me time and effort.Then there is the quality of life change as well. No more stinky clothes or hair from spent gasoline. No more deafening roar when I run the engine. Yes, the engine makes noise, but this electric mower must be an order of magnitude quieter. My fiance doesn't have to yell at me while mowing if she needs my attention, just speak in a louder voice.The mower is LIGHT. Sure, 50 lbs is unwieldy if you are carrying a package or something, but pushing 50 lbs around your yard? LIGHT.And then there is the one touch, single point height adjustment. Holy COW, this is just fantastic! Gone are the days where you have to adjust horrible levers, one per wheel, to get the proper height. Sure, newer mowers offer this capability and aren't corded, but coming from one that had 4 wheel painful adjustment, this is a dream come true.There are downsides to this mower. One is power. 12 amps has been enough, for the most part, to mow our lawn. In deep (5\") and wet grass, it starts strong but if you don't slow down, the engine will work itself to a stall of sorts. This is NO different than what we had with the electric mower though. I can't believe just how much power this thing really does have.Another problem is the power cord. First, make sure your house has an external power plug, otherwise you'll have to fish the extension cords out the window. And that's where the real annoyance to this mower lies, the power cord. Whereas with a regular mower you can just mow, mow, mow, with this one, you have to mow... be careful... mow. The cord will get in your way. The trick is to plan out the mowing in a way that will always keep the cord in the MOWED section of your lawn (not so easy with the first push, obviously). If you do this, cord maintenance is a non-issue mostly. If you have trees in your yard to mow around, this WILL be annoying, no doubt. If that is the case, you may want to invest instead in one with a battery (this mower does NOT have a battery, it MUST be plugged in). Or, if those aren't rated 12 amps or higher for power, I'd recommend the old standard internal combustion style mower.Highly recommended if you don't mind power cord maintenance.Pros:Quiet (compared to regular engine mowers)No gas smell on clothes, hair, bodyLightPowerfulSingle, easy point to adjust heightCons:CordCordCordCan give impression of not being powerful
B00005LEXF I originally chose a more expensive knee pad, ignoring these because of the single strap. However, when the ones  I ordered didn't work right, I came back to these. The other Fiskars products I have purchased have been very nice.When I first put them on I fastened the strap across the crease behind my knee and it cut into me. Immediate pain. However, I found it easy to adjust the strap below my knee (which actually pulls the cup into place better) and even crawling around, the straps stayed away from that painful spot.I will be using these for both gardening and crawling on cement under our home to replace the filter on the heater, so I am extra pleased with the waterproof nature of them.  They fit me nicely, and once I adjusted the strap, very comfortably. The cup shape keeps them from slipping to the side.
B00005LEXF I do a lot of my gardening on my knees as I find it easier on my bad back. Until I purchased Fiskars Kneelers Knee Pads I used a pad that I knelt on.  The problem with the pad, of course, is that you have to get up before moving to a new spot.  It is much easier to garden with the knee pads attached to your legs.  I am very pleased with this purchase.I am attaching a photo under customer photos that I will be referencing in this review.The photo shows both sides of the knee pads.  The top image shows the outer shell of the pad that touches the ground. It is made out of thick (slight under 1/2 inch) rubberized material which provides cushioning and protection from moisture.The bottom image show the inside part of the knee pad, which is made with soft black non-slippery material.  The cavity of the knee pad is 4.75 inches wide, and 7 inches long. It can be made more narrow by tightening the knee straps or wider by pressing on it with the knee because it flexes.Each knee pad has a rubber band which holds the knee pad to the leg. Each band is 20 inches long and 1.5 inches wide.  At each end of the rubber band there is 3.5 inches of Velcro so you can adjust the pad based on the size of your leg.  If your legs are particularly skinny you can sew in additional Velcro strip so you can close it tighter.  If your legs are thicker you can add another piece of rubber band with more Velcro.  I consider myself an average size woman and I got a perfect fit with and without long pants on.The knee pads are easy to clean by washing them with a hose.  They are solidly made and feel like a good quality item.Fiskars offers lifetime warranty for the knee pads.  Even if when I don't plan  on using a warranty replacement, it always makes me feel good about a product when the company shows the confidence in the product by offering such long warranty.  For warranty service, email warranty@fiskars.com or call 1-866-348-5661 or contact Fiskars Brands, Inc. 2537 Daniels Street, Madison, WI 53718.I am really enjoying my knee pads, in particular because I can move so much easier with them than a knee pad I used before.  I recommend this product.Ali Julia review
B00005LEXF I should have bought knee pads a long time ago! I have bony knees, and gardening and housework really bruise them.Now I just strap on the pads and don't worry about it.The only thing is that the backing on the foam pads is peeling away, a little. So they're not the sturdiest pads ever. Maybe now that I know I'll use them often, I'll buy a higher-end pair and relegate these to the camping bins.
B00005LEXF Big and floppy, When you tighten them it feels like you cut off the blood or they fall down off the knees.
B00005LEXF This is not what you want for heavy duty wear, like dragging your knees around on concrete all day.  These are light-weight and comfortable in that binding area behind the knee:  Perfect for kneeling to do work in your garden.  As a gardener, with several veggie gardens and plenty of shrubs and rose bushes spread over an acre and a half, these knee pads are perfect.  Both my husband and I have a pair.  They have a lifetime warranty, too!  I couldn't ask for more.I love Fiskars and when I have a choice, I always choose Fiskars:  This brand very seldom disappoints.
B00005LEXF I bought these for two reasons: 1 - I paint a lot (walls).  2 - I have little nieces and nephews who like to ride on my back as I crawl on the floor!  For the former, they work great-  they don't add any weight to me as I walk around and go up and down ladders, etc.  I can get on the floor and paint near the baseboard while on my knees.  It's great.  My knees aren't the best and these help a lot!  For the latter reason, they're great too!  I can quickly get these on and then let one or two (or three!) of my plentiful and beligerent nieces and nephews ride on my back around the house!  Good excercise and quite tiring!  But for the price - you can't go wrong.
B00005LEXF I wore these twice and they skinned the .... out of my knees. Yes, I had the straps adjusted correctly. Won't use them again. Use a kneeling pad instead!The kneeling pad has worked beautifully! No more skinning my knees.
B00005LEXF Bought as a gift and here's the offial report:'Great pad cushions and velcro closure. Extremely comfortable. Only hitch: the liners inside start detaching very quickly.'For under $10 they're worth it.
B00005LEXF I purchased these to for yard work and now I use them anytime I have to be on the floor or ground working. They have stood up very well and the quality of the product is great. You won't be disappointed and your knees will thank you!
B00005LEXF Received last week.  Purchased for gardening, but am using them first to resurface a concrete patio.  Lots of knee work.  Seconds to fit and very comfortable.  After finishing my preliminary work, I went inside to use the computer for an hour.  Then, on walking to another part of the house, realized they were still on.  That's comfortable.  I'm average build, male.  No problems with the velcro.
B00005LEXF Overall I am pleased with these knee pads because I can garden without moving a kneeling pad around,  I gave this product four stars because depending on the type of pants that I am wearing they either feel too tight on my right leg or too loose.  Also if you are working  on the ground with a lot of dirt, some of the dirt tends to get inside the knee pads, so sometimes to have to stop to shake it out.  I would probably buy this product again.
B00005YX2U I made the huge mistake of buying a cheap $2 trowel from my local HD, of course, it literally snapped at the handle while doing some light digging.The Fiskars trowel on the other hand, is built to last. I couldn't really tell from the pictures, but once I inspected and held it, I could feel the quality and after testing it, I noticed a huge difference, the way it handles dirt/soil and the little work it takes to dig, is simply great.What I like the most is the design, the handle is a  solid metal piece, thick and extremely durable. It didn't bend while digging and it felt very comfortable. The handle is wrapped in a rubberized sleeve which happens to be very ergonomic.Nothing much to say really. This is great gardening tool that I'm sure will last.
B00005YX2U I use this heavily to till the soil in my flower beds because of its broad shoulders and sharp point.  Although its used mostly for troweling, it's  narrow enough to be used for planting and broad enough for transplanting.  I have a tool for every job but I find this is the only digging tool I really need to bring along.  If you're debating which type of  hand digger to get (planter, transplanter, troweler, etc.), I would stick with this trowelerThe handle is very comfortable, important when jabbing it into the ground repeatedly to loosen the soil.  The wooden tools I've used in the past have been very hard on my hands but, I come away with no pain with this design.The polished alumnium is VERY strong, light weight, mostly scratch resistant and does not rust.  The textured material on the handle does collect dirt and has to be scrubbed to get clean.
B00005YX2U I had one of these trowels before, for about 5 years, before my husband got too heavy handed & snapped it while digging in the garden!I love it, the soft, rubber handle offers you a good grip while digging.It's perfect for preparing holes in the earth to plant shrubs.
B00005YX2U I'm a beginner gardener even though I've been a home owner for 11 years. I've always had a yard guy and never liked it much. I decided to get into it this year and have had a good time cleaning up my backyard. This trowel is lightweight and strong and I would recommend it.
B00005YX2U This is a good sized, well balanced, very effective trowel.  The handle is soft and cleans up easily.  It is strong and well put together.  Fiskars quality can always be counted on.
B00005YX30 I wish it had more pockets but I got what I paid for. As I have used it I have found I could use more pockets but it is of good quality and is exactly as advertized.
B00005YX30 This is a very convenient way to keep all your gardening tools handy. It's similar to the bucket tool caddies that contractors used with one key different -- there's no flap that goes inside the bucket, so it's possible to use the bucket to carry dirt, weeds, plants, etc. without getting dirt all over the caddy.Construction is decent. I had no problems fitting it to a five gallon bucket, but it's essential that you find one that does not have a lot of ribs around the lip. The caddy straps on with velcro, and the ribs would make it hard to get a good fit. Thus, buckets you buy at places like Home Depot will not work well - you need an old 5 gallon paint bucket for best results.There are plenty of pockets. The pockets on one side are closed at the bottom; the pockets on the other are open on the bottom. Chances are you'll be able to fit all the tools you want to carry. The only problems I encountered were with long handled weeders. I'll end up carrying them inside the bucket as before.The seed pocket (sort of like a wallet with cutouts to stash seed packets) is a nice touch but, alas, one that I can't use since I purchase most seeds in bulk bags not envelopes. Wish there was an option to remove that and replace it with a pocket suited for tools, but hey - at this price, I can't complain at all.My only concern is construction. While it is decent for the price paid, I expect it will be a bit ragged after significant use. Reenforced seams with rivets would be great - I'd be willing to pay a bit more for that. A better gripping mechanism would also be a nice touch - perhaps some type of spring clamp that grips the bucket so the burden of holding this on is not born by just a single piece of velcro. Lastly, a built-in sheath for a garden knife would be an excellent addition.
B00005YX30 It looks a lot nicer than it really is. It doesn't fit an ordinary size bucket so I had to go buy a bigger one...
B00005YX30 I've used this for around a year now, absolutely love it.  I keep getting more gardening tools and haven't ran out of pockets yet.  The pockets are all different sizes, some very narrow for something like a pair of scissors or a marker, there is a big one that fits my PH tester perfectly.  I also have theCustom LeatherCraft 1140 EasySeat Lightweight Plastic Bucket Seat for 3 1/2- 5 Gallon Bucketswhich turns the bucket into a chair and seals the interior if you want a dry spider-free place for gardening gloves.
B00005YX30 The material is good and easy to clean. Size is perfect, just as described. I have a bunch of Fiskars tools, and now they get perfectly organized and easy to move around. Price was good and deliver was fast.
B00005YX30 received this yesterday, really nice and well organized. I placed it around an old chlorine bucket and it fits well. compartments for tools are well thought out.
B00005YX30 Do you find yourself constantly looking for the last hand tool you used when working in the flowerbeds? Are you forever walking back and forth to get the right tool, or to toss the weeds you just dug up in a lawn bag? If so, you need a garden caddy, and you could do a lot worse than this model. While it's not made of heavy-duty canvas like the $60 models, it's strong enough for every day use, and it can last through several buckets. I bought this one for my girlfriend, a passionate gardner, and she's very pleased with it. Might even get one for myself.
B00005YX30 This is the greatest thing I have ever found for my yard supplies.  I cannot imagine working in my flower bed without this product.  It fits large buckets without any issues.  I keep compost, soil or mulch in the bucket and then have all of my necessary gardening supplies in the caddy.  Excellent!
B00005YX30 This is the finest made caddy I have ever owned. I doubt if I will ever have to buy another. It just doesn't seem to wear!The size differences and set-up are conveniently placed. Construction is heavy duty, well thought out and worthy of all my Fiskars tools. But then it is after all Fiskars.
B00005YX30 If you're like me, you tend to set tools down when garderning, go on to another project, and forget where you left your tools. This Caddy is lightweight, with lots of pockets, so it's easy to pop the tools into a pocket and pick up the caddy and move to a new project. At the end of the day, no running around the yard, trying to find things to put them away.
B00005YX30 Carrie it in every time i go in my grow room.Always a need to manicure and get all dead and unwanted branchs and leaves...Has tons of pockets to store whatever i need and my trash bucket.Makes things a lot easier and cleaner love it
B00005YX30 I am relatively new to gardening and only had 2 old, cheap tools that I used to pot indoor plants. When I started vegetable container gardening, I quickly found that my old tools were not going to cut it, so I got myself a nice set of Fiskars tools. I then needed something to hold them and carry them in when I went back and forth to the garden, so I found this bucket caddy.I already had 5-gallon buckets as that is what I use for container gardening. It is tricky getting the caddy on right the first time. I found it easiest to lift the handle of the bucket up and then put the caddy on, being sure to align the openings on both sides of the caddy with the sides of the bucket where the handle connects. If you don't do this, you won't be able to use the bucket's handle, which kind of defeats the purpose of being able to carry your tools to the garden! Even after going through this process a few times, I still haven't mastered it, but I did at least get a tight fit of the caddy's \"belt\" onto the rim of the bucket. The handle is pretty much locked in the upright position, but that's okay with me because it makes it easier to grab it and go to the garden.There are loads of pockets of all sizes. They fit everything from my big round composite soil scoop (Fiskars 7068 Composite Soil Scoop) to a small pair of scissors I use for opening bags of soil and such. The caddy fits my Fiskars garden tools set plus several extra tools and there is still plenty of room for more.The material the caddy is made from appears quite heavy duty but, since mine is still pretty new, I can't speak yet to how well it will hold up over time.You might want to complete your bucket and caddy with a bucket seat (Custom LeatherCraft 1140 EasySeat Lightweight Plastic Bucket Seat for 3 1/2- 5 Gallon Buckets), as I did. I had hoped for it to be more flexible for comfort, but it is still great to be able to sit on the bucket and have your tools right under you so you can both reach for whatever you need and also easily put away what you're done with.Definitely recommend this Garden Bucket Caddy.
B00005YX30 This is great for me. I can keep all of my garden essentials organized and available. I highly recommend this product.
B00005YX30 ...I thought this was a canvas bucket with a handle and didn't realize it was a canvas wrap around for a 5 gallon 'homer' bucket, which is not included.Tip for putting it on, unlatch the velcro strap and remove it entirely so you can slip the wrap under the bucket handle, not over it.  That might be why some people are having the velcro or seams tear, if you wrap it right around the handle and then raise the handle, that would put more stress on the strap.Once I wound this under the handles as pictured in the amazon image on the product page, rerun the strap and secured the velcro it was snug enough to put a bunch of tools in the pockets.  Which are big enough for tools you'd use to manicure plants, as opposed to hand shovels and the like.  Look at the photo and you'll see some regular standard scissors in one of the pockets, that should give you some scale.So nice that I have a big bucket to put stuff in, not so nice that its really made for rather small tools, not so nice that I had to go buy a bucket but that's my fault.  I own a ton of fiskars stuff and although I know their big business is scissors, I thought I was buying a yard tool caddy and not a scissors holder.I re-purposed it as a sprinkler/irrigation repair bucket, that's working for me.
B000063XHT A not really sure if this attracts mosquitos or if it is the light, but whatever it is it works so I am very happy with my purchase and woul recommend,
B000063XHT I don't know if these helped or not.  The bars seem too far apart to actually kill a mosquito on the zapper.  The sticky things also fall off after a week or before.  Might be a design flaw in the zapper as there is not a solid surface to stick it to
B000063XHT This does not appear to attract more mosquitos than the light does by itself. The chemical is toxic to touch per the package warnings and it's not easy to get the cartidges into the light as instructed. Save your money....not worth the hassel.
B000063XHT Given the price and the length of time these each work....you have a 2-3 year supply.  Store them in the same box used to store the zapper &#34;off-season&#34; - BUT KEEP THEM IN A LOCATION SAFE FROM CHILDREN.
B000063XHT Using these in Japan. I have used them previously in Canada. They were sent to me by family since I wouldn't have purchased them again. In my case at least, Octenol seemed to reduce the kill rate...at least the number of zaps I hear throughout the day and night. It was the same back in Canada, at least the kill rate wasn't any better with the cartridges. The other down side to these (if they do have any effect) is that it's highly dependent on the direction and force of the wind. If the mosquitos' hiding/breeding area is downwind of these then great...if not, then what? Given the massive and ongoing cost of these...I would just hang another zapper. I'd be willing to bet that would be MUCH more effective.
B000071NUS I like the product, the sensor works well the minute it comes in contact with a subject that crosses its path (that would be me for now) but it's hard for me to tell if I am getting results.  I live in a wooded area with lots of deer.  They come every day and more so at night, so I haven't seen any action yet.
B000071NUS Being relatively new to the Austin, Texas, area, we didn't realize that patience plants were salad for the local deer. So, one day we had beautiful, healthy blossoms on our newly planted flowers and the next all we had were stumps and a few small leaves left on each. Talk about being sad!After a relatively detailed review and possibilities, we decided on the Scarecrow. We ordered one and two days later via Amazon Prime it was assembled, in the ground and hooked up to the hose. Aside from inadvertently squirting myself a couple of times, I got used to sneaking up on it to turn in off in the early AM and on in the PM. After a few days I got the sensitivity right and for a week have not had any problems with deer.Convinced that the Scarecrow was the device for me, I then purchased a Gilmour 13 Brass 2-Way Connector for the faucet and an Orbit 62001 Lawn and Garden Digital Watering Timer. I'll have reviewed both of these separately.Suffice to say, I am extremely happy with the Scarecrow. It is better than any other device I can think of and, unless it breaks early in its life, will continue to receive a five-star review from me.
B000071NUS A family of raccoons had taken up residence in a sheltered area of my house.  They demolished a make-shift barricade I previously erected at the entrance.  I could hear them scratching and squirming in the little den of theirs, which used to be part of my house.  I tried a \"coyote urine\" repellent  - without success.  I decided to give this Contech ScareCrow a try.  I erected it in front of the den entrance and turned it on just before midnight, when I was sure all the raccoons had left their den.  An hour later, it fired and I heard the sound of animal running away.  All was quiet afterwards.  The next day, I spent all day erecting another barricade - a much sturdier one this time, with grade A \" lumber, 1/4\" steel screws, and \" steel nuts and bolts.  I left the ScareCrow where it was, just for good measure.  During the week, the Scarecrow fired a couple of times during the night and that was it.  The raccoons never returned to attack the barricade again.The nature of and solution to animal problems vary extensively, but for the narrow purpose of keeping raccoons from getting into their den, this Contech ScareCrow passed with flying colors.  The whole unit is made of plastic; it may not last very long under the hot desert sun of the American Southwest, but it did work as it was supposed to right out of the box and setting it up was a breeze.  Other reviewers complained about short battery life; perhaps a lithium 9V battery may help.
B000071NUS Cats just love nice soft planting bed dirt. Easy digging, no grass or leaves to work around and often plenty of room so they don't have to re-visit the same spot. They are indeed tidy animals. After preparing them for this year's planting, adding all sorts of expensive amendments, every day saw new cat diggings and poop. This year the beds are off limits.Set up the Scarecrow and not one cat visit to report yet. Well, they might of visited, but they didn't stay! I know it fired off at least once and while the water goes up some and doesn't actually hit them, it does make a sudden and fearsome noise and a lot of commotion and they want no part of that.Once I saw a mountain lion paw mark in one of my beds, so if it chases them away that might also be a good thing. Same for raccoons at the fish pond. And it does all this humanely.You do have to be careful to set the sensor low enough for cats and smaller animals. In the past I tilted a Scarecrow down so the sensor picked them up, but for deer or larger dogs you don't have to. With a raised bed it is easy to set up the height to just above ground level, but for a bed at ground level you might want to try setting it in a pit. You can't lean it over because it works by tracking animals walking across its path.It does not work on critters coming straight at or away from it. My outdoor motion lights are like that. You have to spend the time to find out the direction your visitors will travel and make sure they go across its path.The kick of the water will indeed knock it back so that it is pointed upward and this will make it useless. Really, you just have to attach it to a supporting post. I wired mine to the planter walls. I had one once that I put into a pot full of gravel and that did not work. Normal soil will not contain it either.So, spend the time to point it correctly and secure it. I find that going up half-way on the sensitivity works fine. You just have to test your situation (with the water off).You need a 9V battery as it does not ship with one.Years ago I had what seems to be the same device, a gift. It broke and the company would not answer an email about buying the part (solenoid). I hope things have changed and parts will be available. I do not like throwing away a $50 item that can be easily fixed.Hecho en China of course. Should be cheaper considering. Lost a star for that.
B000071NUS I bought three of these to keep a local skunk out of our lawn before he/she manages to dig out all the grass.The PIR sensors inside the scarecrow barely detect a skunk - it's too low and slow to set it off unless its within a few feet of the sensor. However, the sensors do a great job of picking me up to 20' away. When an object is close, the water won't hit it, even on minimum range settings. What few drops are hitting the skunk, he/she simply shrugs off and keeps digging / eating.This 'scarecrow' works better repelling squirrels since they seem to set it off more easily (hopping through the grass) and because they seem to mind the water more.I like how the sprinkler head can be adjusted for range and scope of rotation (360 degree vs. a smaller sector, etc.). That allows you, within limits, to fine tune the area of coverage. The smaller the area of coverage, the more effective the scarecrow is, since the pest will be hit repeatedly as the stream whisks back and forth in a narrow arc. But that only works for alleys or other narrow confined approaches, not a open field.Another nice feature is how you can daisy-chain these scarecrows. The bottom has an inlet and and outlet that is usually covered with a cap. They even include sealing rings, so there is no leakage. However, I am not impressed with everything being made of plastic. The thing is fragile, as emphasized in the manual - no pushing, pulling, etc. on anything plastic other than the stake and then only around the garden hose fittings. For example, I accidentally dragged a hose across the top of one unit and the plastic distance dial popped right off.For $50+ I expect better and its claimed efficacy re: skunks is not borne out in my experience.
B000071NUS I grow a lot of my own food and I keep a straw mulch of 12\" on top of the soil.  I also have five cats who love to play in the mulch; moving the mulch around - revealing the seeds to the sun or they go to the bathroom in it.  Was looking for an inexpensive way to keep them out. Electric fence will work but is time consuming and somewhat costly..When I put it up, using all the parts, it is way too high to detect cats. Not only that I couldn't get the water to spray down where it would actually hit the cats.  If you look at the picture above, the spray is \"above\" the cat.  That won't work with my cats - they'd just thumb their noses at it and continue on their way.  This thing has to soak them or they aren't going to leave the garden. So after fiddling with it for awhile, I finally stuck a piece off of a wooden clothespin in between the dial and the deflector and that got the spray closer to the ground.  But the whole thing is still too high.So I checked to see if a 1/2\" pvc hose thread fitting would work with the Scarecrow fittings and it did so I cut the long extension pipe down to size.  But they've made the pipe itself not a standard size - too big for 1/2\" pvc, too little for 3/4\" (what kind of company does that?).  So I sit there and scratch my head - looks like I will have to buy another extension pipe from the company.  But as I was walking by I looked at it and thought \"Now why can't I just screw the hose into the fitting where the hose attaches, then screw that directly into the motion sensor head.Eureka!  Victory.  So now the Scarecrow sits about 6 inches off the ground.However, there is still another problem with the design of this product.  The hose attachment piece does not have a swivel.  So unless you put a disconnect fitting on it you are going to have to uproot the scarecrow to be able to get the hose off easily.If I were the owner of this company I would include additional length extensions in different lengths and a swivel hose connector.  A good idea this product; but needs more forethought by the designers.  Afterall, this product isn't inexpensive really, especially if you need multiple ones.
B000071NUS I wish there were ****** six star ratings!  This product deserves at least that many stars!We received the Contech CRO101 Scarecrow Motion Activated Sprinkler yesterday and installed it this afternoon. I just heard it activate (10 pm) twice and in the dark I saw two pair of amber colored raccoon eyes in the near forest. YES, IT WORKS!!!! What a blessing!NOTE:  Don't waste your money on the Havahart motion activated sprinkler; it doesn't work! It only activated if there was movement within 4 feet of the sensor. Buy the Contech Electronics CRO101 Scarecrow Motion-Activated Sprinkler through Amazon.UPDATE 9-17-2011: We received the Contech CRO101 Scarecrow Motion Activated Sprinkler yesterday and installed it this afternoon.

B000071NUS We bought two of these scarecrows several years ago and have used them continually ever since. Deer are a major problem in this area. Forget deer resistant plants, they will eat almost anything when they are hungry. What they don't eat, they destroy, pulling it up and spitting it out! We tried several chemicals including wild animal urine, without success. On the recommendation of a local landscaper we purchased the scarecrows and they really worked! They protected even the most tender (delicious) plants.After the warranty expired, a big buck, escaping the spray, stepped on a scarecrow and broke the spray head. I called the factory, (phone number and e-mail on the included brochure) and they promptly sent a reasonably priced replacement.Recently, after six years of use, one unit was still working normally, but the other started spraying with a very small flow. I was prepared to buy a new one as we had several new tender plants that needed protection and I still needed both. However, I first tried again calling the phone number on the brochure, to my surprise it still worked! I talked with a very polite gentleman who suggested I try disassembling the unit and thoroughly cleaning the parts with a vinegar solution, he would e-mail the instructions. He did, and I cleaned it following the very clear (with pictures) instructions. It wasn't that hard and the scarecrow worked like new! The scarecrows were initially expensive, but they are still doing the job and have been well worth the cost.
B000071NUS My neighbor's cat loves coming in my yard each afternoon to claw my screens and harass my indoor cats through the windows.  Nothing worked to keep him away - pepper granules, citrus sprays, commercial pest repellants, or mothballs.  My sister purchased Scarecrow for me and I had low hopes - but it certainly exceeded my expectations! The first day it was up & running, the cat came by, got blasted with it twice from about 15' away, and ran away scared to death - and I haven't seen him in my yard since!  Scarecrow is a little inconvenient when I forget it's on and walk into my back yard, but it's worth the inconvenience to keep the neighborhood cat away for good.  I would highly recommend to anyone with a pest problem!
B000071NUS There is a cat in our neighborhood that used to spend most of his day in my backyard hiding near my birdfeeders. Before I got five of these sprinklers, he was killing several birds a day.  In the seven months I've had the rainbirds scattered around my backyard, he hasn't had a successful hunt.  Nor has he been able to spend enough time in my backyard to leave presents for my dog to find.  The sprinklers do not react to birds, but the cat hasn't figured out a way to avoid them. Each time he moves out from under a bush, he gets blasted by a rainbird.  He jumps the fence and runs away only to return the next day hoping for a different outcome. When I first installed them I had a problem with leaks, but after wrapping the connectors with plumbers tape, there have been no drips whatsoever.  I like that the water jet can be aimed high or low, so my windows remain dry when the sprinkler goes off. The water jet is pretty powerful and very loud, so be sure to direct each rainbird so you can sneak up behind it to turn it off.  Even when the water is turned off at the spigot, enough remains in the hose to give you a good soaking.  Embarrassing to admit, but both my gardener and I have been sprayed more than once. This is a solid 5-star product, but you'll need more than one.
B000071NUS I have many fruiting trees that must be protected by birds and squirrels.  This motion sensor product is a great item to thwart those pesky birds from eating my persimmons, cherries, and other fruiting trees.A relative has a motion sensor device to protect koi from predator birds.  Sometimes those little birdies want a fish or fruit meal; however, motion sensor instruments are a tremendous method of eluding their dietary desires.
B000071NUS I bought this to keep coons away from my fish pond and it works great.  A must have is you have a pond.
B000071NUS I would have given this five stars but the connections loosen with use and I have had to hand tighten the connection right beneath the scarecrow head a couple of times.  I use the two scarecrows to scare critters from our newly created garden pond.  I bought the two scarecrows along with Yard Sentinel's RC Ultrasonic Pest Controller.  They work in unison and are effective!  I have the Yard Sentinel set to only operate after dark for raccoons and any other four-legged critter.  Everything has remained undisturbed.  And, I did not put on the yellow stickers so they are solid black and (to me) less obtrusive.  This was a great investment.
B000071NUS It sprays water but the cats just walk beyond the area that gets sprayed. They don't seem to care.They (I have two) have a tendency to break. The settings dial never worked properly, and even when turned off for four weeks somehow ate the battery.Animals must be large, probably raccoon or bigger. Definitely doesn't go off for birds or squirrels (though butterflies immediately in front of the sensor sometimes did.) For me it is a source of aggravation and would probably serve me better used as a projectile.
B000071NUS This looks like a well built sprinkler.  It seems to work for a lot of people, but it did not work for me.  The motion sensing was unreliable even at its most sensitive level.  The squirrels were undeterred and they continue to plague my garden.
B000071NUS I bought this unit last summer to deter cats from attacking the birds in my back yard.  I have several feeders in my yard, and in the summertime when the bushes and ground cover is heavy, several cats in the neighborhood hide in the brush and very often leap out and nail birds that are ground feeding.  I can't tell you how many times I have gone out there some time during the day to see a pile of feathers on the ground.  Sometimes I am fortunate enough to catch them hiding and I chase them off.  But I can't be back there all the time. Both me and the birds were losing the battle big time for a while. I even resorted once to laying down one of those sprinkler hoses and leaving it on low all the time.  But that was wasteful and expensive...This sprinkler thingy has been a Godsend to me and the birds.  It's so easy to hook up.  You just put a battery in it, attach a hose to it and stick it in the ground.  Its that simple.  I bought two of them for the bushes on each side of my fence and installed a Y connector in the hose so it can deliver water both ways.  It takes a while to get the sensitivity just right, but then its just sit back and watch it patrol the grounds for you.  Since I have had it installed I have not seen the remains of a single victim.  And the burst of water that is left behind is useful to the birds and harmless to the cats. It's true that you have to have a hose running across your yard for it to work, but that is a minor irritation for what you get out of it as far as service for sure.  When I first installed it I saw the area wet all the time as the cats were taking their chances with it.  Now its less and less being used as they have become wise to it and moved on to other game somewhere else.  It's true that the battery doesn't last as long as one would want, but I really don't mind it.  I just change it at the beginning of the month from late spring through September whether it needs it or not and its up and working without interruption.In conclusion, this is one of the cheapest, if not the cheapest form of motion detector sprinkler I have found on Amazon. It installs in a jiffy, works perfectly for me, and seems very well made.  I can't attest to its durability yet, but for the price and performance I highly recommend it.  Great product.. : )
B000071NUS This product not only works well, but it's also fun to watch!!, especially when rabbits, cats, or dogs come to do their business in your loan or rabbits eating your grass, this thing blast them with a burst of water before they can escape!! I love watching this in the early moring hours. Also when a dog or cat wants to take a poop in your yard and the owner of the pet just lets them do it with cleaning up behind them, this thing will blast the animal with water and they will run away from you property. Have fun watching!!
B000071NUS This is the ONE thing that actually kept the deer out of our garden all last Summer.  All of the various repellents, sprays, dangly-things, and even electric fencing, only held Bambi and Bambi's mother off for a week at best, then they would either get used to them or (in the case of fences) just jump over them.They can't seem to get used to this Scarecrow though - I guess it's just too unpredictable for them.  It held them off all season and I actually got veggies from my garden, whereas my neighbors got nothing but deer-droppings.So I'm here to order another this year, to protect my flower garden as well.  (I'm also considering using one to ward off pumpkin-stealing pranksters at Hallowe'en - that ought to be a good \"treat\"!)  Oh, yah- that reminds me:  don't set this device up where the mailman has to cross its path.  Mail carriers can get a little grumpy about being squirted with water out of the blue - go figure... :)--- Just editing this a year later to add: Not only is it still working (imagine that: getting an electronic product out of the potting shed after winter is over, putting in new batteries, and it STILL WORKS!) but the deer are also still completely put off by it.  Can't ask for better than that!
B000071NUS I tried everything for my vegetable garden including fencing, electric fencing, solar vibration but this is the only product that actually worked.  I have deer, chipmunk, turkey, and the most annoying, ground hogs.  This works for all of them.  Just set the sensitivity to the right setting.  Don't jack up the setting too high, otherwise, it'll go off a lot.  Not sure why other reviews say the battery runs out fast which I was worried about but I've had it going for about a month with the product going off several times a day without any issues with the battery.  Perhaps they jacked up the sensitivity to the top.  The only downside is based on the size or layout, you may need to get several of these to keep out the animals.  I have a garden about 50 x 20 with 2 tiers and tall plants so I needed at least 4 to get a good coverage.  Amazon has the best price so get what you need for your garden and keep those pesky animals away!
B000071NUS I was skeptical that this scarecrow would deter the deer in my yard.  I'm very glad that it exceeds expectations!  I placed it facing the parts of the yard where the deer trails end.  Heard it go off during the night a few times during the first week, followed by the sound of snorting and stamping deer.  For the first time in years my yard is not a deer buffet--as a matter of fact NOTHING in my yard has been browsed this year.  So glad to finally see some perennials that I haven't seen in five years.  I have tried all kinds of things in the past to deter them and nothing works.  If you have deer problems I highly recommend giving this a try.  If only there was something for winter (besides deer netting).
B000071NUS I was having a problem with a groundhog that was loving some of my cabbage plants to death (literally). He ate three to complete stumps in two days and was working on his next one when I got this in the mail.I anxiously set it up and learned much about it in the process. I see most of the people here praising it for getting rid of deer, and it may work well for that because they are large targets. It also does disturb smaller varmints but not in the way I expected.Thie product is very difficult to review because while it works somewhat,  a 60 dollar product is not necessary for smaller, less intelligent and less numerous pests.  It is probably great for an area infested with pests though, hundreds of deer or tons of groundhogs, but something much simpler could be used in your average garden setting.The idea of the product is cute and simple enough. It is a motion sensor attached to a sprinkler. If the Scarecrow sees anything that moves, it fires the sprinkler off for about five seconds. It then waits 8 seconds and repeats.The problem is that with smaller varmints, they can hide behind the plants, and when the Scarecrow is aimed low, every plant movement (breeze blowing a cucumber leaf) sets it off unless you turn the sensitivity down so far that it won't go even off with you dancing in front of it.When set to scare away smaller pests, this device falses constantly on plant movement and only sees the varmints if they are totally exposed in front of it, which rarely happens in my garden jungle. The motion sensor concept doesn't work well because everything moves in the garden including the plants. It has a false detector that suppoesdly automatically shuts down the sensitivity if it is falsing too much. It doesn't work well. We have watched the Scarecrow go off every 10 seconds for an hour non-stop with nothing in front of it but plants moving in a very light breeze.The good thing, and the dichotomy for me, is it appeared to get rid of the pest. We have not seen the groundhog since and my few cabbages left are doing OK. So for that, I wanted to give it a much better rating than I otherwise would. The sprinkler does appear to scare away most animals, but it cost me $60 to save $10 worth of cabbage.Cats, dogs, groundhogs, squirrels, rabbits, etc. appear to be driven away by it. And the battery has lasted several weeks. I just can't give it anything but one star because it doesn't work the way it claims and is very expensive for the average Joe. The device works more like a random sprinkler shooting water at random time intervals depending on the breeze.A better product, and one that is actually affordable, would be one you set up that randomly fires a sprinkler every few minutes.  It would be much cheaper and just as effective.  You may be able to recreate it with a timing device that runs on a battery and a $7.00 sprinkler, or just a generic timed sprinkler you use when you notice a pest is bugging your plants. But if you have tons of deer, then this may be your only viable solution short of a major fence or wall.There is another reason the product is very annoying. You have to have it hooked up to the hose all the time. I have to have a hose reeled out across my lawn at all times to reach the garden from the water faucet on my house. It is in the way much of the time, so has to be moved about all the time for family gatherings, lawn mowing, kids want to play in yard etc. But I did discover an alternate use!! Kids love running in front of the Scarecrow. :-) OK, now would you pay $60 to entertain your kids?  OK, so sell it as that.  Much more useful for that purpose.If marketed as a garden tool, the motion sensor should possibly be a heat sensor or something that can discern better between mammalian presence and a leaf in the wind. The sprinkler is little more than a cheap lawn sprinkler attachment. I am very torn in my rating because here is a device that basically did what I wanted it to do, scared away a varmint eating my plants. It has a major cool factor and is a fun conversation piece loved by the kids. But it falses constantly and is difficult to deal with unless you want to run an underground hose to it and it is expensive.I am giving it one star because it works, kind of, but it is not what it advertises itself to be.  A motion sensor cannot work in a dense garden for small animals.BUT YOUR KIDS WILL LOVE IT!  This would get 5 stars as a kids' toy!!  So maybe as a combinational use product it gets more stars?
B000071NUS Everytime I forgot and walked out onto the the lawn, I got sprayed pretty good.  That's the problem with this unit. You either have to leave it on all the time and get soaked or remember to turn it on every night before you go in..........or buy an outdoor  timer and hook it up to the hose, which I ended up doing.  The Deer ate 25 flats of impatients I planted last year....... along with 15 Hostas, Daylilies, Verbina, Phlox and anything else they decided to munch on.  Bought these toward the end of the season so I'm not sure if they did any good to deter the deer...........they pretty much ate everything before I  got it.  We'll see next year  ( 2013 growing season) and report back.
B000071NUS 
B000071NUS my many times getting wet testing this thing proves that it works. I would buy this again if I ever need another one.
B000071NUS It seems to turn on at slightest motion and I think the frequent on-off cycles cause it to eat batteries.  I've gone through a 9v battery every 2-3 weeks so far using this.
B000071NUS The second unit has worked very well. We had a family of foxes take roost near a creek in the neighborhood. Each night very late we could hear a fox making a weird noise near our house, I guess as it strolled by. Well, this took care of it. After about 10 days, we shut it off and we're guessing the fox changed its route due to this device. Seems well made.
B000071NUS I added teflon to the water connections,  and still leaked but the sensor would not work with the water on.  Dry test worked fine i would hear the click.  But once I added the water and did nothing.  My home is a 1990s house with great water pressure and this device was just terrible.  I also tried the havahart water auto sprinkler and both are great in theory but are terrible on real conditions.
B000071NUS I have 3 each scarecrows and it does work. I used to have cats come into my yard and do there business and not any more. I have even sprayed people with the scarecrow when the walk within range of the motion detector.
B000071NUS Well, I am very glad I made this purchase.  This unit works very well, gosh it does scare the animals away.  I now have no dug out holes in my garden and my vegetables are  undisturbed.
B000071NUS We live in the desert so not many people have grass in their yards, however we do. Because of this we attract colonies of rabbits and they are killing our yard and eating everything I try grow. I recently planted some clover seed to fill in the patches of grass their urine has killed, but the whole task would be useless had I not found the Scarecrow sprinkler. I'm happy to report this has almost completely solved our problem. We have been keeping the sprinkler pointed towards the section we are repairing and the clovers are coming in undisturbed. However, there are blind spots as the sprinler cannot see off to the sides very well. Now the rabbits are hanging around the other half of our yard. Solution- we will definately be getting another one of these for the other half. One annoying thing about the Scarecrow is they didnt include a ring to were you attach the hose to make attaching and unscrewing easier; you have to twist the entire sprinkler around making lining up the threads kind of a pain. Regardless this is has been the best rabbit repellent I could find. I highly recommend the Scarecrow!
B000071NUS The first problem I had was with the leaking pass-through cap. I covered the threads with thread tape to fix that, but that really should not have been necessary. (Minus one star, since most people will not have thread tape.)The next problem was that the water shoots too high in the air. I wanted to aim it at the base of some bird feeders which a raccoon raids every night (climbing over the raccoon baffle), but it was going over the entire feeder from about 10' away. (Minus one star.)Next, I tried moving it to a flower bed where an armadillo often digs, but even putting it on the downhill edge of the bed and slanting it down as much as I could while still being able to get the stake into the ground, the spray was still too high and WAY too long. (Minus one star for not being able to scale down the spray distance to below 15'.)On the positive side, the device uses an infrared sensor, meaning that it keys on moving heat, so that branches blowing in the wind should not set it off. (Add back one star, since the cheapy alternative would have been a simple motion detector.)I'm hoping that having the spray go over the armadillo's head, plus the noise, will be enough to scare him off, but I would have preferred to have it actually hit him with a direct blast of water.
B000071NUS I have one already and they work great to chase those pesky critters away from trees that have fruit! they work super and seem to be the only thing that works, powders and sents don't seem the work!
B000071NUS I have met the Saint Simons deer.  Well, we&#8217;ve not been formally introduced or anything, but I have seen their handiwork.  We had just moved and all my plants were waiting for me to transplant them.  My strawberry plants were gone first.  Then it was the best parts of the blueberry bushes.  But it was the sweet potato vine in the pot near the porch that was my call to action.  I purchased one of these Scarecrow motion sensor sprinklers that will scare the deer away and installed it a few weeks ago.  Although I&#8217;ve never seen it in action, I know it works.While I was out of town moving the family down, there was some work being done at the house.  I was texting with one of the folks working around noon one day and I mentioned the sprinkler as a warning.  Shortly thereafter I received the following text from another worker, who was also at the house helping:  &#8220;Hello Tom.  Thank you for the warning about the sprinkler.  I don&#8217;t know about deer, but it seems to work fine on me, the carpet cleaner, and the landscape crew.&#8221;  That&#8217;s how I knew it worked at first.But, as it turns out, it's not just great on contractors!  It also keeps the deer away.  After installing it, I noticed no further damage except when I would forget to turn it on.  I use a timer with it so that it does not spray our dogs during the day.  I've been using it for several months now and it still works perfectly.  I would recommend this as a non-chemical, low cost way to keep the deer from eating your plants.  ...and as I learned it can keep people off your yard too!
B000071NUS Like others, we've had a problem with obnoxious pests visiting our yard late at night.  The Contech Scarecrow worked really well the first time, but the vermin rapidly adapted and learned to avoid the covered region (front yard plus bedroom window).  Even moving the Scarecrow around only worked the first couple of times.  I've decided to use rose bushes and transplanted poison ivy as a more permanent deterrent.
B000071NUS this was my second one, I guess I didn't learn the first time. it also died the first season.  it was great at first. then it just stopped noticing anything walking by. it also started to leak at the hose after a few weeks but if you don't leave the hose on, it doesn't work at all. I think my next plan is electric fence.
B000071NUS My daughter gave me the scarecrow years ago and it sat in my garage until a few weeks ago. I am currently replacing her rear yard fence and her idiot neighbor has a dog that started coming into her yard and relieving himself on her grass. Needless to say this women is a real jerk who takes no responsibility for her kids or pets. I remembered having the scarecrow and immediately put it in her rear yard. It has worked flawlessly keeping the little monsters, both canine and human on their own property. Her other neighbors asked me about the motion activated sprinkler, they are also having problems with the kids and dog and are now getting their own.
B000087R4E I needed a hedge trimmer that was light and easy to work with to trim grass around my deck and rock garden.  I have used this trimmer for summers and it does exactly what I need at a very reasonable price.My requirements:1. Light in weight2. Easy to operate3. Strong enough to cut grass but not strong enough to fling rocks or damage pots with flowers which edge the grass4. InexpensiveThis trimmer met all  my requirement perfectly.  I am able to trim the grass in a matter of minutes, it works well in small places, and it gets all the grass in one pass.  After two summers I am still using the original string, and did not need to replace it so far.Note: this trimmer requires an outdoor-rated electric extension cord which is not included with the trimmer.Ali Julia review
B000087R4E This little trimmer does the trick with a lot less trouble with handling and is easy on my back.  It is a powerful little trimmer.
B000087R4E We always seek a good way to clean and trim those ugly weeds, this Trimmer does the job smartly and efficently.  There is nothing you can't do without a good weed trimmer.
B000087R4E This tool works very well.  And at this price, it is a no brainer. I use this on my St. Augustine grass and it cuts it close. I love the bump feature to release more string. It is also very light and quiet.Just buy an appropriate extension cord and you are good to go. Nothing to charge and it does not use gas, so it does no pollute.
B000087R4E Im 6'2\" and this thing is tiny. I always have to hunch over. I wish i bought a longer weed eater. Also i wish it was more powerful.
B000087R4E This weedeater is light and cheap and meant to do one thing:  edge lawns.  If you're looking for a device to do a finishing touch on your lawn, this is a smart approach.  Sadly, most of us lack the discipline to use such specialized tools for their best purpose, so don't get adventurous and simply finish off your lawnwork with the craftsman's tool for lawns.
B000087R4E This product was lightweight and easy to use. Even a person with back problems will be able to use this product with ease and minimal strain to back. It was easy to assemble and I had no problems with using this trimmer.This product was good for trimming; however, it did not work well for cutting thicker grass and weeds. I found it fairly easy to change the spool wire on this product.  I recommend buying the trimmer bundle that comes with extra wire and spool.Over all, this was a good product and served its purpose and the price was right. My husband loved it.
B000087R4E I just got this tiny machine home to Japan in my luggage and tried it out. Yes, it is underpowered, but that could also have to do with the 100-volt supply here. But that said it does exactly what I need it for, to trim edges where my mower can't reach. It is not really too short for me, and I can swing it like a one-handed scythe because it is so light.I was totally disgusted with my much more expensive Makita that would never feed the line properly, so I feel the Black and Decker is worth $19.95 for every time I don't need to swear and pull the Makita reel apart to rewind it!Four years later ----- it's still working! The motor seems to slow down now and then, and the blade that cuts the extended line got loose and then lost, but it still trims just as I need it to do. I got a second unit for the US place last year and it has a better designed handle and faster spinning motor. The \"bump\" line feed in the old one still works most of the time, and I fixed the blade problem by cementing a box cutter blade on the housing. The spool is easily rewound with standard line. No real complaints!
B00008GS96 This works pretty well for wasps but is useless for houseflies - either that or I'm just inept.  I couldn't catch the flies to buzz them.  I'm pretty sure they were mocking me as I tried.  For us, this doesn't not replace the old fashioned fly swatter - which I had to go out to the hardware store and buy. This product does seem useful for larger, stinging sorts of insects and might replace chemical bug spray products.
B00008GS96 After an outbreak of pantry moths I was ready to scream.  I tried lots of solutions but none as satisfying as this gadget.  The little devils are hard to kill.  One will all of a sudden appear, fluttering across the room, and if you're not quick, it will disappear again just as fast.  Sometimes you can clap your hands over it to kill it and I've even used a butterfly net, but you can't swat them like you would a fly because when they land they're pretty much invisible.  You have to get them in the air.  I was willing to try any harebrained thing--which I thought this was--but voila!  It zaps the little suckers very effectively.Since you have to grab it fast and have it right way up in order to depress both the buttons to activate it, I put a sign on the 'up' side since it is otherwise not easy to tell.  Once in hand of course, it can be used repeatedly and quickly and is great when sitting out on the deck.  It has made summer evenings much more pleasant.  I really don't want a big zapping machine making noise so this really fills the bill for me.  I've used it a lot in the last year but haven't had to change the batteries yet.When my adult daughter was sitting on the deck one night and came in looking for the bug spray, I gave her this gadget.  She was super impressed and bought one herself.If you hit a damp object or a big bug, there is a rather loud spark and sizzle so you have to be prepared to deal with that, but it absolutely works.
B00008GS96 This zapper is more of a toy for any age rather than just a boring and not always very successful bug swatter.When we got this in we absolutely loved the whole box design they've done a great job and have brought the concept \"alive\" before you even start playing with it. Packaging like this in totally lost now-a-days for everyday items like a \"bug swatter\" and we were just taken a back all the detail and thought that went into creating this!Now for this super cool zapper....Where can i start?! This thing can fascinate anyone but especially boys/men: the difference between boys and men is just the price of their toys..lol..;)..NO offense to anyone. Anyhow i got away cheaply with this one i guess for once! The bigger bugs are definitely much \"funner\" to watch because there is more action once they hit the racket but nothing gets away from this thing.This thing could even been used to blow off steam after a bad day just switch the light on at night and go outside and go at it like there is no tomorrow! The bugs are not going to stop coming as long as the light is on and you will definitely get a workout with all the swinging...;)I've ordered plenty more gifts and just to have in the house for when people come over and want one because this is definitely going to be the summer accessory find for this year!BUY ONE AND HAVE FUN!!!
B00008GS96 This item and similar products are usually marketed as novelties, but I have found mine to be an indispensable tool.  That's because your basic flyswatter is incomplete since it requires a nearby flat \"killing surface\" to get the job done; if the flying bug in question refuses to cooperate by landing on or flying slowly near such a killing surface, a flyswatter is useless.On the other hand this tool can take care of insect pests flying in the middle of the room, next to things that cannot safely be swatted, or outdoors.  This particular model has a couple of buttons that must be pressed and held down simultaneously (by thumb and forefinger) in order to charge, which happens almost instantaneously, and a red LED to let you know it is ready, all of which contribute to extending battery life.  Despite my son's bug hunting safaris, I'm still on my first set of two AA batteries.  Use is basically the opposite of a flyswatter: move it slowly until the grid touches the insect pest (there will usually be a visible flash).  Cleanup in most cases involves wiping with a tissue.Obviously, the larger the bug, the less likely you will kill it outright with the first charge, but at the very least this thing will knock it to the ground.  I would not advise seeking out combat with a swarm of hornets, but this tool would be about the only effective response in addition to running for cover.  Which product you choose is up to you; my buying decision was made for me by a combination of sale, coupon, and discount that reduced the cost of this item to zero.
B00008GS96 Have had for 10 months now on same set of batteries and the zap still feels as strong as ever.  If you swat a fly out of the air it will usually just injure it and you will find it bouncing around on the floor.  It's actually pretty easy to trap them under the swatter by just lowering it down over the fly, kills em pretty quickly this way.  You'd think they'd sense it quicker and move but maybe the wire netting allows the air flow through enough that they're not alerted.  Anyway, it's fun to see the little spark when you get them.  We've kept one in the kitchen and going to buy one for the RV now.  Don't let the kids play with this, it's actually a pretty strong zap.  It is fun, however, to play with it yourself and zap the kids!  And zap the friends and the spouse.  Yeah, everyone loves it! ;)Oh yeah, the case is nice too.  We hung it up near the kitchen as a holder for the swatter and it's been there since we've had it with no tears.  Seems a lot cleaner than having a regular fly swatter out.
B00008GS96 I hate to think of myself as having fun at some other creature's expense but - BWAHAHAHA, bite THIS, you bloodsucking fiends!!I first saw this being used on a vacation to St. John.  The employees in the cantina each had one, and were waving them around slowly in front of their faces, almost in a hypnotic way.  Apparently that is the best way to get mosquitoes, according to these folks (who should be VERY familiar with mosquitoes and their ways!)  If you try to swat at them too fast you will just blow them away, but if you move the paddle around slowly they will just fly right into it and go sizzle sizzle sizzle ...!  ;^)Heed what everyone says though: don't hit yourself with it while the buttons are pressed, and don't let kids \"play\" with it.  It can give you a nasty burn.
B00008GS96 I don't own these but saw them at a flea market. No question in my mind why they were up for sale (but should have gone in the trash IMO!) My friend discovered -- the hard way! -- that these deliver a VERY unpleasant shock if touched to human skin! Mind you, this friend is a large manly guy, not easily affected, yet he howled and dropped it! So you can imagine the jolt of voltage that must have been involved here! I would not want my children in the same room with these devices, nor my father with his pacemaker, or even my pets to inadvertantly come in contact with the live zapper screen. What were they thinking!?!?!?
B00008GS96 **Update February 2013**  I've had this racket for 5 years and it's still functioning as it should.  I change the batteries maybe once a year, and I rate this as one of my best purchases ever.  My husband likes it too because with this racket I can tackle the spiders in our house on my own.  Very happy, especially considering the inexpensive price.**Original review**I live on a couple acres in the woods, complete with creek.  My targets include gnats, mosquitoes, flies, moths, spiders, and perhaps the occasional wasp.  Gnats are vaporized, moths give a gratifying spark and perhaps a wisp of smoke when they hit the racket, and dead mosquitoes get stuck to the racket but are easily shaken off.A few nights ago, a big housefly got inside our home and I grabbed the racket to take care of him.  He flew into the racket as I held it over him near the window and zapped him easily.  This morning, I accidently let in a huge moth that promptly headed for the nearest lamp.  I carefully stuck the racket under the lampshade, and the moth flew right into it.  I can't imagine how difficult it would have been otherwise to get rid of that fly and moth without the racket.I love this racket for taking care of spiders too!The only negative I've noticed is that when I'm wildly swinging this zapper around to see how many gnats I can kill, the battery cover slides a little.  Not a big deal to me.  If I'm not swinging it wildly, the battery cover doesn't budge.I picked this bug zapper over the other oh-so-similar racket zappers available because this one only has horizontal zapper wires in the racket area..... no protective mesh that might interfere with eliminating pesky bugs.**Update** August 2009: I've owned this racket for over 18 months now with frequent use, and someone requested a specific update about a couple of common problems with this racket, so here it is!  Regarding having to press on two buttons to use this racket, I'm glad of this feature because it reduces the likelihood of it bumping up against something in storage and accidentally being turned on.  The buttons are staggered on each side of the handle so that my thumb is on the upper button, and my index finger is on the lower button.  I have to take 1/2 a second to make sure my fingers are in the right place and the little LED light is on and working, but it doesn't bother me.  The buttons are a safety feature and I'm willing to work with them.  Regarding the battery cover, it sometimes slides about 1/2\", but it has never slid off completely so I don't worry about it.  I'm STILL on the original set of batteries this zapper came with.  :)  If this racket zapper ever stops working perfectly, I'll update, but so far it really has exceeded expectations.
B00008GS96 I'm glad this gadget came with two double A batteries, I could test it right away!  Shaped like a smallish tennis racket, the Amazing Bug Zapper does kill any bug it makes contact with, but you have to tap the bug first!  It works fine with larger bugs like wasps, and other slow, flying insects, but the item is fairly bulkly and hard to handle for fast, small bugs.  In the south, I need an entire bodysuit made of Amazing Bug Zapper fabric!
B00008GS96 Really, this is a very effective means of pest control. The safety feature of having two buttons pressed in order to activate it, and having them displaces so you dont accidentally turn it on is nice. When you strike, you get a big blue jolt, which from my experience, makes it fun for the kiddos. Also, i touched the racket while it was on....the current is definitely pretty strong. It wont kill a person, but it does hurt, which is a strong indication of its effectiveness against the much, much smaller insects. They dont always die first zap, but it always stuns them at the least, allowing you to toss them outside or dispose of them however you see fit.A good way to spend $10 IMO.
B00008GS96 This is the cheapest made product I've ever owned.  To insert the 2 batteries, there is no flap that you open.  You have to take the whole handle apart with a screwdriver, then the circuit board falls out and the 2 switches fall out to the floor.  Insert the batteries, put circuit board and switches back in, insert each tiny tiny screw and the nut (3 each), hoping the screw doesn't fall out while you're holding the nut.  Are you kidding?  I'm returning this, because I don't want to go through this each time i need to change the batteries.  I just bought another one that uses 2 D size batteries, you just insert the batteries into the flip open compartment in the handle.
B00008GS96 Zap, sizzle, fry, flyGo up in a plume of smokePaddle bids you 'Die!'
B00008GS96 Seems to do the job. One disappointment so far is that the zapper net is actually much smaller than other zapper swatters out there. But this is the only one we could find that doesn't have the protective layering hence it still works better than the others despite its smaller size. When some genius figures out that this design in a larger size is the way to go, it'll be a bestseller. But for now, we have this one.
B00008Z9ZG This compost starter really speeds things up. I use a tumbler as well as a compost pile which is reserved for leaves, branches and the like. Although the package says you will get humus in 60 to 90 days, I am already seeing progress.  Despite a cold snap, the compost is progressing.This product was sent with the box contained in a plastic bag.  There was some leakage although no obvious rips or tears.Nothing works like progress and this product does speed the composting process. Recommended.
B00008Z9ZG Waiting for the yard waste to break down normally takes a while on average, but three days ago I spread a layer of Ringer 3050 compost plus  on my compost pile, watered well and forgot about it, thinking it would take time to start the magic of Ringer 3050 Compost.. this morning as I passed the containing, knowing that in Arizona's heat it might need watering. One day after applying...What a surprise I found... you could see that the pellets had already broken down and a richlooking yard waste was well on its way to rich compost, I turned it over, deeper this time and again placed a layer of pellets, closed the top,This watering and turning and placing the pellets has been around 12 days now and 3/4 of the container has a very black compost, really black.  What is really great there is no odor,Amazing stuff, The packaging comes in a 2 pound box, it took very little of the pellets to start and to keep activation.  Very, very pleased with this product.Now, the only thing to await is to see how well the fruits and flowers react to this rich mixture.Here in the desert a heavy loam clay is about all there is, so a rich compost that has a rich black color is a delight,Happy with this product and will be sure to keep a box available.  Recommend this for 5 stars.
B00008Z9ZG Well, as I only received this about three weeks ago, and the box says very plainly that it takes 60 to 90 days to actually see what the results vis-a-vis this product and my collection of well-dried leaves and garden waste will be ... so I must defer final judgement at this point. Unaided, it seems to take at least six months to produce anything usable, so any promise of improvement on that is well worth waiting fore. I'll update the review then!
B00008Z9ZG I use a tumbler that I rotate every few days.  I sprinkled a cup of this into the compost that was already in there, with some fresh vegetable skins dropped into it, and within a few days there was a noticeable increase in the matter, with a black, rich compost all around.Now mind you, I live in southern Arizona and we already get the hot, dry heat this time of year.  I don't plant my summer garden until the monsoons hit in July. By then this compost will be ready.  I can actually use what is in the tumbler now for my growing tomatoes.  I keep the compost damp and turn the tumbler regularly.  The outside heat helps keep the matter hot.One thing I noticed when I first used this on my compost is that the bugs that were already in the tumbler scrambled.  Apparently even beetles and roaches give way to this stuff.  And that is a good sign.
B00008Z9ZG I bought a rotating composter last summer. It took all summer to turn my yard waste into compost. Actually, by the end of the last summer, while the compost was almost done, it was too late in the season for me to use so I just left it in the composter. This spring I had great compost. That's almost a year for that batch. This year I am hoping to speed things up a little.This product contains the microorganisms to get things started quickly. I added this product to my yard waste a few weeks ago. I have already noticed an improvement on the progress of the compost process compared to last year. Hopefully I will have usable compost ready to spread in the garden by the end of summer.
B00008Z9ZG I'm actually using a 55 gallon compost tumbler, rather than a heap. My compost contents were moving along rather slowly the last couple months, so I added 2 cups of this to the compost, aerated it each day, and within 2 or 3 days the compost was noticeably more composted! Now, 2 weeks later (and after tumbling the compost daily), the compost is nearly ready to use. Awesome product! Glad the box still has lots left to use in the future!
B00008Z9ZG So, I got the compost in the mail.  I opened the box, and the composts were all over the place.  Good thing that they put the box inside a ziplock bag.  If they didn't put the box inside ziplock bag, i'm sure it would be one messy box.  Anyways, other than that, it expedite the compost process.  Good thing to have in the yard.
B00008Z9ZG We added this to our compost tumbler and it seems to be helping break down the material we put inside (yard waste, food, etc.)As another review noted, the box did not hold the contents inside. It seems like the manufacturer/distributor knows this because the box was sent inside a plastic bag which caught all of the grains that had fallen out.
B00008Z9ZG Ringer Compost Plus is an excellent supplement to kick start a compost pile. It works with either an open pile or compost apparatus.Composting is not terribly complicated, get the right nutrients (yard waste), the right amount of water, the right temperature, the right amount of air, and the right bacteria; and that yard waste will decompose to something wonderful for your garden. The scary part with composting, if a few of those elements are off, the compost pile ends up smelling really bad. This ringer product helps get the bacteria side of the equation working right. You still have to water the pile during dry periods, aerate the pile, and add material to the top. It isn't a magic wand that takes the every other day tending out of the equation.The bacteria that decompose yard waste are already present in those leaves, grass clippings, and wood chips. It is just at a very low level. Ringer Compost Plus boosts the bacteria count quickly and gets the compost pile working much faster than if left to its own devices. In theory, applying this once should do the job, just like sourdough bread. In practice, I end up getting lazy with my compost pile and let things run crazy. Ringer's bacteria are also chosen to work at higher temperatures, meaning the compost pile will decompose quicker.Ringer's yard products are amazing. I've used their Lawn Restore fertilizer for a long time. Unlike synthetic fertilizers with really high nitrogen and phosphorus levels, this is a gentle fertilizer. I'd have to work hard to get my lawn to stripe or look uneven from this fertilizer. There is also a blend of bacteria in the fertilizer that makes my lawn a lot healthier. The product is organic, but that's not why I buy it. It just makes my lawn look great in a gentle way. Their Compost Plus hasn't changed a lot over the years either. It is the old reliable product it always was. Ringer products are not easy to find - the fertilizer is very expensive to order on line. Safer Brand is the main company. I've seen their products in Do It Better and Ace Hardware stores. I haven't seen it in the big box home repair centers.Compost Plus is a great way to get that compost pile working.
B00008Z9ZG It can be quite hard to get a compost pile going. We have tried a couple different ways and couldn't really get what you are suppose to get from a compost pile, we would always end up with just garbage and flies. We researched online and watched a lot of videos. It has to have a certain mixture of types of things that you add. We had way too much household food in ours. We also decided to forgo our compost bin and decided to go with a tumbler composter after a couple failed attempts in our bin.This Ringer Compost Plus helps get your compost going. We are now having much better luck. I suggest doing some research yourself if you are just beginning. There is more to composting than just throwing your scraps and coffee grounds into a bin.Spring is the perfect time to start and the Compost Plus gives it a head start.
B00008Z9ZG I have a classic-style composter with the doors on the bottom and a compost starter really is an excellent way to boost the breakdown process.  If you don't have a tumbling composter you might want to add aYard Butler Compost Turnerto your list.  Anyone who has been composting for a while would recommend a starter, especially if you are mixing everything in your bin from food scraps to wood chips.  No, composting doesn't happen overnight and everyone will learn about composting as they gain more experience.There are several \"recipes\" you can scout out on the Internet when you are going to make your compost.  For example, one common one is one part food scraps, one part grass clippings, and two parts dry leaves.  Ringer Compost Plus has has directions on the box that are quite useful to those just starting out.  There is a brief vignette on troubleshooting that is helpful.  For example, if you have a smelly pile they have a very helpful hint on how to minimize the odor.  Only complaint I have is that I would have preferred a resealable bag over a box.  Other than that, I'm all for compost makers to jumpstart the composting process.
B00008Z9ZG I setup bins and a tumbler to compost this year.  Our city recently changed the trash system and I'm growing a vegetable garden so it just made sense to compost much of what would otherwise be thrown out.I've started using this in my compost bins along with kitchen scraps, brown and green matter.  It seems to be speeding up the process, but it's hard to say how much difference it makes.Next I'll try it in one of the two holding bins I have for dry leaves to see how much of a difference it makes.Glad to have a chance to try out this product.  If it speeds up the process, I'll be purchasing more.
B00008Z9ZG I have started this in my compost turner- I live in Florida...I will come back and post how the compost turns out...really great idea, the instructions are clear and it was easy to use...I might also add no fowl smell
B00008Z9ZG This product works and is less expensive that other brands we have tried.  So this has been our brand-of-choice for a while now.  When growing compost, you have to be serious:  About your ingredient mix and about turning and churning up your mix.  You have to be patient, too!We are diligent about our composting:  We have 1 1/2 acres of manicured lawn, many gardens, many trees and bushes and a free-range chicken yard.  So we need a lot of compost and we generate a lot of compost material.  We use a double-barrel Mantis for our composting:  It makes the turning and churning a breeze.  But we really need to make a lot of compost to capitalize on the Mantis investment.Even with all the great compost material we generate, we still need an accelerator every once in a while--especially during colder months. And then sometimes our mix of \"green\" and \"brown\" material is not quite right.  Sometimes we just want compost fast--well, at least faster than its normal slow-but-sure progress.  We always have a box of this stuff on hand.Just an extra thought that may prompt someone to get into composting:  Even with our Mantis compost-maker, we still have compost makin's left over.  So we bought a roll of plastic fencing and made a triangle using the fencing on the inside corner of a chain link fence.  We dump our grass clippings and leaves into this simply-made 8'x8'x8' triangle.  When we first dumped a partial box of this Ringer compost-maker onto our 5' tall pile, it fell 1 1/2' within a week.  So, do not doubt that it works.  Also, you can simplify your composting efforts--it's not the most efficient way to go, but it is better than no composting at all.
B00008Z9ZG I've always had a compost pile in the back corner of my yard and since I grow most of my own produce, it comes in handy to fill raised beds (certainly cheaper and better than buying soil) and to top-dress beds. The thing that convinced me to try this produce was that it is a 100% natural product and, as much as possible, I like to keep an organic garden. As an aside, I read Mike McGroatry's blog/website a lotEasy Plant Propagationand agree with him that compost isn't complicated--it's what nature wants to do with a pile of clippings. The best thing you can do is just get out of the way and let nature take her course. But you have to be patient (not one of my more stellar qualities).The problem I've had is that while I do get great compost/soil from the pile over the course of a summer, it's a slow process. With that in mind I decided to try this product. (I also thought of buying one of those tumbling things, but have you seen how much they cost?)I tried the product today. The instructions call for sprinkling about a cup on a pile that's about 3 x 4' and about 12\" deep. I had a freshly stacked pile of materials (both green and brown materials) that was about that size and 3' tall already, so what I did was spread it out and and then re-piled it but added a cup of the Compost Plus for every 12\" depth or so. I watered each layer (as per instructions) as I re-stacked the composting materials and built the pile back up to its original height. This sounds complicated, but it took all of 10 minutes. I just used a pitchfork and it was very easy work.I won't know for a month or so if this is any faster, but I'm hoping to see some evidence (heat perhaps) that this stuff is speeding up the process. I may even be able to tell sooner than that. One thing I got from the packaging was that it's important to have a good level of moisture in your compost pile--not too wet, but certainly not dry. I have been remiss in that--again, I just let the rain water it normally. I will try to be more careful about keeping this pile wet to give the product a fair chance. If it works and speeds up the process, I'll be thrilled. I'm reading a lot lately about the value of microorganisms in soil (and reading a lot about no till gardening)Plowman's Follyand that is what this product is: a mix of select microorganisms.I will update this review in a few weeks and report back on how its working. My only negative thought now is that it took most of the 2 lb box to do the pile (again, 3 x 4') and so adding this stuff regularly adds another expense to the garden.Update 5/09/2013: It's only been a few weeks since I first applied this stuff to my compost pile and while I don't feel the \"heat\" that I was half expecting, I will say that the pile seems to be composting faster than normal. I'm seeing a significantly faster conversion to compost in the center of the pile. Not a miracle, but noticeable.
B00008Z9ZG I love composting; it makes me feel like I'm doing my part to keep valuable plant nutrients in the ecosystem, and waste out of the landfills. And it's super easy to do when you break it down into the basics: heap up food and yard waste, and let it rot. Then you wait, sometimes for a year, for your compost.This product speeds up the process a little bit. It has a mild manure smell that did not bother me when I was storing it in the garage before use, but the smell did bother my nose-sensitive mother, who wanted to know what 'that stink' was. So for storing inside, be aware others might find the scent offensive. I'd suggest just using it right away. :)The pellets are really just a kickstarter product, with enzymes and flora to make the compost process hotter more quickly. If you've never composted before, this is a great way to get some quicker compost bang for your buck.It's also fun to use, making the process more like cooking. If you really want to learn how to compost well, read Let It Rot, or find a website on composting. Even with a starter batch like this, composting still takes time and patience.NOTE: Some of my pellets arrived sifted out from the box. It was a bit messy.
B00008Z9ZG ...because my compost bin smells to high heaven.  I put in leaves, some small sticks, grass, some banana peels, and egg shells.  I layered this in between.  I'd say it took 2 weeks to get a good smell going...might be ready to use in a few more.
B00008Z9ZG I've been working on a compost bin for about a year now, and noticed lately that it wasn't heating up as much as it had in the beginning. When I received the RINGER COMPOST PLUS I added about half the box to my current compost pile (a turning drum style) and by the next day found that the head had returned which means the composting process is back in full swing. My ONLY complaint, and it's minor, is the smell(!) of the contents of the box! You certainly don't want to store it in your home or even in your garage - it's THAT strong. I wrapped mine in plastic to keep it dry and tucked it under a sheltered area near the garden. But hey... smell or no smell, this stuff works!
B00008Z9ZG I have a black thumb. I can kill just about any plant known to man (including cactus during a drought). Since I've had little success with growing anything edible in the garden, I figured I'd give composting a shot, with the hope of livening up my roses (the one thing I can grow because I pretty much leave them alone except for pruning the bushes a couple times a year).I started my compost pile about a month ago, and I have to say, it's been fairly successful. It definitely has the strong, \"earthy\" scent one expects from rotting fruits, veggies, and garden cuttings. It's definitely doing something to the stuff I've been adding to the pile--coffee grinds, egg shells, fruit peels, veggie trimmings, dead plants, leaves, etc.The thing is, I don't know how much this compost additive is responsible, if at all, for the results. I think I probably would have had a pretty ripe compost pile anyway, but I just don't know. What I will say, though, is that I don't see any mold or mildew or anything else that would prevent me from continuing to compost.One thing I will suggest if you're new to composting, as I was just a few weeks ago, is that when you start your pile, you need to start with some variety in terms of size and waste. However, make sure you don't leave anything that's too big. I started with the branches I trimmed from my rose bushes. I should have probably cut everything down to no larger than 6 or 8 inches long, but I've got a few branches that are over a foot, and I don't know if it's because of the number of branches (they started out as about half my pile) or the size of the branches, but they are very difficult to turn with the other stuff I've got in the compost box. I thought about cutting them down, but given the effectiveness of the heat and sun (and the Ringer), I'm not willing to touch it with my hands (gloved or not).I know I've got a ways to go before the compost pile will be ready to apply to the rose bushes or the fledgling garden, but I'm looking forward to doing an update then.
B00008Z9ZG Starting a compost pile has been on my list of things to do. I was unfamiliar with this product but after reading about it I was impressed.Although it'll take some time to determine if this stuff is a miracle worker, it has gotten me excited about using grass clippings, leaves, and other lawn debris to start a compost pile. The ingredients included in the easy-to-use box will hopefully 'heat up' the pile and get it into compost more quickly.I'll provide an update when I see evidence that it worked. Until then, though, it has gotten me started on composting.
B00008Z9ZG This stuff is easier to work with than earthworms, not too smelly, and a little goes a long way.  It's great for starting your compost pile, and now is the time to get some, to nourish your spring and summer garden.  As with any other similar product (such as fertilizer or plant booster) start with a little so as not to burn plants.
B00008Z9ZG I've had a \"passive\" compost pile for several years - basically just a big pile of kitchen and yard organics.  After two or three years, I'll start a new pile, and use the good compost from the old one.  Since I've been doing a bit more gardening, I thought a more active, rapid compost would be nice, so I tried the Ringer.  I've followed the directions, kept the pile moist, turned it a bit.  I can't tell much difference, though honestly, I never really looked too closely at the pile before.  It may be decomposing faster, but it isn't a warm pile like I sort of expected.  Maybe it's better - I can't be sure.  So I guess this stuff isn't for me.  If you're a very active composter, then maybe it will work differently or better for you.
B00008Z9ZG But it does seem to work. Added it to a mix of green and brown compost, with an approximate ratio of 1:2, and the mix is warm and decomposing. Essentially this is a bunch of microbes and some nutrients to either accelerate, or perhaps jump-start your compost. If the bacteria are already around, as they would be most places, this product isn't strictly necessary, but could help out with the compost. Hard to tell without a real side-by-side comparison. if you're in a rush though, it's likely to help out.
B00008Z9ZG I have been making compost for several years now. I have a compost tumbler with a crank handle that rotates it. I started a batch in late winter and was having a hard time getting it to heat up. This compost starter did a great job of really getting it going. If it is really cold outside you will have to be more careful to have your ingredients shredded and in the proper carbon to nitrogen ratio. Otherwise this starter will work well if you have more brown than green. In the summer when I am composting mostly greens, then this starter is pretty much unnecessary. I save some of the finished compost from each batch to start the new batch with. If you are doing a passive pile then this stuff is even more of a help because you can add it to each new layer as you build the pile.
B00008Z9ZG I have a compost bin (two actually) and can't wait to use it in my garden this year! The Compost Plus seems to be making my compost material even better, richer, darker. I love this product! The only issue is that the directions say not to add paper to your compost. What??!! Doesn't everyone add paper? Well, I called the company and after a few passes around the office, I was told, then confirmed by another employee, that they don't want to have to list all the kinds of paper you can and shouldn't use in composting. So, they just wrote 'no paper' on their box. Easier for them I suppose, but I'm glad I called because I love adding old newspaper to mine.  Hope this helps! Happy composting!Sheri - writer, mom, mage
B00008Z9ZG I will have to review this product at the end of the summer to give a better idea of the help/quality of the product.  My first impressions were that this was a small amount of stuff.  I also think that it stinks.  I am going to use it in a compost bin, rather than the recommended ground idea.  I don't like to leave compost on the ground, as it attracts rodents.  So far my stuff has been in there for three weeks.  Will update again later.
B00008Z9ZG It's hard to imagine any soil worse than the native soil in my garden and my yard.  Here in Texas, we call it caliche, and you truly could use it as clay on a potter's wheel.  That's why I've been composting veggie scraps and yard trimmings.  The compost that results helps the garden (and increases the worms).  My problem has been that composting is slow.  This Ringer Compost Plus  helps speed the process, so I can build soil that will nourish my plants.I have not measured the temperature in my composter, but in spite of the fact that our weather has been much cooler than normal, the material I put in the composter a month ago has been turning into soil quite nicely.  Ringer says to expect composting to complete in 60 to 90 days, but I'm seeing results much sooner than that.  I'm ready to turn out my first batch of the year tomorrow.In addition to working quickly, this product is a bargain, costing about half of the compost starter I had been using.If you have an interest in improving your soil and putting the scraps from kitchen and yard to good use, try this.  It works!
B00008Z9ZG I notice this product works faster if I added a lot of shredded leaves (carbon source).Tips:- Turn over or mix the compost once a week- Too much water will slow down the composting process- Kitchen garbage is a good starter but brown leaves are the fuel of compostHappy composting!
B00008Z9ZG I have been using this product for 30 days so far, and will update this review when I have reached 90 days.  My compost pile is actually in a lidded bin designed for this purpose.  I have a combination of yard waste and kitchen waste in the pile.  I've not had very dramatic results composting in the bin by itself - it just seems to not decompose very quickly, despite following the general directions for this process.  So I thought perhaps this additive would speed things up.When I first received the Ringer product, I sprinkled a good cup or two into the compost pile as is.  It was going to rain the next day, so I didn't water it in.  I have noticed so far that the pile seems to have sunk more than what I'm used to seeing.This Ringer stuff smells like a barn, uh, natural fertilizer if you will.  While the cardboard box helps reduce the odor somewhat, I decided to store this in a tightly lidded plastic container, so that I could keep this under my sink without the sink cabinet beginning to smell.I keep a small bucket on my counter for compostible fruit/veggie pieces.  I have started adding a small scoop of the Ringer product to my bucket before I take it outside to the compost pile.  I use a plastic cup that comes with liquid laundry detergent, and I add what amounts to about a tablespoon.As I said, I'll update in 90 days to let you know how it continues to progress.
B00008Z9ZG We have an open air compost pile that has both yard and kitchen waste. After putting a fresh batch of veggie scraps and egg shells on the pile, I poured the recommended amount of Ringer 3050 Compost Plus 2 over the pile and watered as directed.  A week later I checked the pile and the kitchen waste was already unrecognizable. The Ringer 3050 Composte Plus 2 was doing a nice job of helping the scraps and shells break down.Can't wait till the compost is ready in a couple of months to use in my garden.
B00008Z9ZG I bought this product along with composter (compost wizard jr. 7 cubic foot compost tumbler). First, I examined the box trying to find ingredients, none of them was listed, so who knows what it is. It made me feel uncomfortable, because I do not know if it is there natural ingredient or some kind of chemical. Also, I would like to do some research on this product if it really works or not, but since there is no disclosure of ingredients, you stuck to \"take their word for it\". Plus, what if you have an allergy for it, but since their no information what inside; it can be a simple dust as far as I know.Second, I followed the directions and added this mystery chemical into my compost. I do not think it made a difference at all. My composter does its job with or without it just fine, it is black and generates a lot of heat, I water it or add greens to keep it moist, and turn it weekly. Did not feel any speed up whatsoever. Nature and composter do what they supposed to do without this gimmick. Don't waste your money!!.To speed up the composting and introduce viable bacteria, I added (as book on composting recommended) about a gallon of already made compost which already contains all the necessary bacteria and organisms, so they can start working on new pile of compost.
B00008Z9ZG I have been composting for almost 25 years. We produce a lot of kitchen waste as well as garden waste, and have a yard full of leaves. My father composted long before it was popular. He started about 45 years ago and I learned from him. In order to compost well you must have oxygen, moisture, organic matter and the bacteria to break down the waste.Just as happens in any wooded area, all of these elements are present and occur in good time naturally. If you wish to speed up the process; it requires some work and the addition of micro-organisms. This is where the Ringer Compost Plus comes into the picture. Here is where the micro-organisms come from.Am I sure this product has all of the right organisms for my waste, how can one tell? Only time will be the judge. In from one to three months I can add to this review. I would add.... why would Ringer sell a product that will not work, since it is a product which is generally re-bought if it works well.Also,organic gardeners do compare notes.It is important to also make sure your compost gets the other things it needs. A rolling barrel can be purchased or just turn the compost pile periodically with a shovel and keep it moist. I do not like shovel work and I am cheap, so I made a composting unit out an old water well pressure tank that had failed. I mounted it sideways  on a simple 2x4 frame. It's about the size of an oil drum. I cut a door with a reciprocating saw, hinged it and added a latch. I added a shaft through the center that sticks out of the ends and they sit on the wood frame, (Like a hamster wheel). I can spin it to mix the compost which adds air and moisture through out. Maybe in 90 days I can give Compost Plus 5 stars.
B00008Z9ZG When I first bought a rotary barrel-type composter I was really excited to get some nutrient rich material for my garden.  Unfortunately it wasn't that easy.  I followed directions but it never seemed to do what it was supposed to do.  The grass stayed green and wet and the leaves stayed dry and brown.I started using the Ringer Compost Plus over a month ago and I can honestly say that it has made a difference.  FINALLY I am getting the type results that I had been wanting.  There might be another way of accomplishing this without a compost starter but for me this is working just fine.
B00008Z9ZG New material reduced more than 50% in just 14 days.shipper is faster than the last batch and much more reasonable costsI will order from this vendor again
B00008Z9ZG I started to use composts when I went to Master Gardener school. It is a wonderful way to get rid of all the food scraps and peelings that you usually through in the garbage.There is more to composting than just putting scrapes on the ground you can actually use vacuum bag dust (if there is no food) I also put my hair cuttings, newspapers and leaves and grass clippings are also used. Letters and junk mail can be cut up and tossed in also.  All  you have to do is toss all of this once in a while and you come up with compost.  I am lazy I never turn my compost I leave it out and my chickens have a ball scratching up the compost.  I wind up having the best soil for the summer garden.Ringer 3050 Compost Plus is a great product it has lots of good micro organisms that literally eat up all the waste and turn it into compost.  Sure you can get a good soil without it but this product speeds up the porcess and adds lots of good organisms that add extra nutrishment to the mix.All you do is lay down the foundation and then add the amount  you need for the size pile you have, turn it a few times wet it down and within 3 months you start to see the results of the composting.  You can use the fresh soil for anything to grow, plants vegetables, flowers shrubs and even sprinkle it on the grass..
B00008ZOXX I've used this saw for several hours which is sufficient to give me an opinion as to its effectiveness and value. It's easy to set up, just use the wingnut clamp to secure it to the pole and off you go, no tools required. It stays put as does the extention of the pole. One easy to use clip on the pole allows you to move the extention in or out and lock it. It stays locked. Use it off the pole to trim off limbs from felled trees or easy to reach stuff. I've found many uses for the saw without the pole that makes to yard work go easy. It's safer than a gas chain saw and lighter. It is durable, it hasn't failed me. I maintain my machines and keep them ready to work, but I don't baby this saw or any piece of machinery. This saw does what it's supposed to without complaint. I pinched the chain in a limb (operator error!) and had to free it with another saw, but the Remington went right back to working without throwing a chain, bending, or breaking. Anyway you ...slice... it, using a chain saw to cut trees is tough on machinery. This saw has chewed through pine, oak, and cherry quickly and easily. When it's at full extention it's a little unwieldy because, afterall, you have a weight on one end of a pole and it will tend to be top heavy. But it is light enough to manuver and keep where you want it to cut and I haven't found its balance to be a problem. It does leak chain oil. In the yard, who cares? In the garage, it can be messy. But also tells you in the manual that it will leak the chain oil and recommends that you empty the oil resevoir when you store the saw. It holds about 3 ounces of motor oil and draining the oil is a ten second operation. Not a problem. When in use, one push of the oiler cap before eash cut and it's happy. It has an aggressive chain tooth layout which helps to slice through even big limbs. It's a ten inch saw, if you need to cut 14+ inch limbs/trees, you'll need a heavier chainsaw that's designed for that purpose. If you use this saw for its designed use, you won't have any difficulty pruning or taking off fairly meaty limbs from a safe position. I recommend it.
B00008ZOXX I have had this since 2011 and used 8-10 times so far with no issues. Best chain saw on a pole for the money. Works great for cutting branches. Beats a hand saw type hands down.After my first use of the chain saw I was thoroughly impressed. It worked great for cutting small to medium size branches. I would highly recommend this product for anyone interested in a chain saw on a pole.Keys to keeping this working well is keep the chain oiled. It does not do this automatically like a normal chain saw.Moving the cord around is kind of a pain but no more then I use this it is fine. I saved a bunch vs a gas unit and maintenance is much easier.
B00008ZOXX The saw has good and bad qualities...PROS.1. Price is comparable to other brands..2. The height of the pole is adequate..3. Home Depot sells replacement chains...CONS.1. Balance is an issue. It gets pretty heavy balancing an electric saw on a long pole..2. Poor design causes wood debris to quickly accumulate in the gear area. As a result, wood chips need to be removed between uses. Failure to do this will cause the chain to slip off or damage the nylon sprocket that moves the chain..3. Chain guide bends when the chain is tightened. As a result, an accurate cut is almost impossible..4. The tightening screw comes off very easily due to vibration during usage. After losing it, the only way to tighten the chain is to unscrew the two bolts holding the metal chain guide, move it forward, and retighten the two bolts with one hand while maintaining pressure on the other..5. The unit is underpowered. Eight amps is not enough for cutting large branches..6. It is very cheaply made. For example, the chain guide is thin. As a result, it bends to the side. Second, the gears and sprocket are made of plastic or nylon and will wear away in short time. Third, the oil reserve is a small squeeze bottle that is useless. It does not hold enough oil and needs constant refills.
B00008ZOXX Well had this item for about a month now, and I shall say it is a great saw, the only down side of it is once it is on the pole and fully extended, it is a bit on the heavy side, but other than that this saw is just great, lots of power, blade/bar size is perfect for cutting through damn near everything, easy to use, I mean this thing is so much fun to use it should be illegal :)  Changing unit from pole saw to chain-saw is so simple even a caveman could do it (like me).  So if your looking for a great quality pole-saw/chain-saw I would definitely give this on a try.
B00008ZOXX This saw is awesome. Took it out for it's first use today. Great power on demand at the push of a button, no worries about gas or oil, just the lube the chain and you're good to go. Sliced through moist maple like butter. Handled branches up to 8\" with ease. It did, however, throw its chain after an hour of use, which was entirely my fault; do what you're supposed to, and adjust the tension are the new chain has warmed up (and therefore expanded!) a bit. A great, versatile tool!
B00008ZOXX I have had this pole saw for three years and have used the pole attachment once or twice a year for the first two years. During the second year, the trigger mechanism broke and did in the pole section, and the whole thing has been sitting for over a year waiting for me to jury rig up a toggle switch in place of the broken trigger.I am about to get back into this process and that is the reason I was looking up a replacement when the Amazon \"you purchased this item in 2007\" notice came up(I do like this function from Amazon as it saves me from reordering stuff)Back to the pole saw.I did expect the pole trigger mechanism to last longer than it did and Remington needs to re-visit the design.Added a JPG to product page as you can only add videos to the reviews???????It shows a SPST $4.00 switch installed in the place of the plastic piece of junk that comes with the unit and the trigger hole filled in with silicone to stop stuff from getting in to the area.The saw also leaks most of the oil (chain lube)out when it is sitting, so put something under it.I have to do a lot of this type of thing these days to make products work: See my other reviews.
B00008ZOXX Lots of reviews so I'll keep it short.  I've used this both on, and off the pole to the point where if it died I'd still be happy with it, but it's still going strong.  Lots and lots of use.  I keep it sharp, adjusted and use the prescribed 30 weight chain oil.It also allows me to make cuts either from the ground, or on a ladder, when I'm in a better position to get out of the way if something falls.  We've used this to safely make the final cuts on limbs that were still hanging from a gas chain saw cut.
B00008ZOXX I got this for a friend who is 80.  He had told me he was looking at them at a local hardware store.  I told him I would check online for reviews and prices.  We agreed this was the one for him.  And it was 80 bucks cheaper than the store.He really likes it but has to go slow.  He wanted the electric one because he didn't want to use a pull cord starter.
B00008ZOXX Nothing like a chain saw to bring one's manliness to the fore.  This one is more powerful than I anticipated, and the fact that it can be used both at ground level targets and those in the air is an added advantage. The saw attaches easily to the pole.  Trimming that limb over your fence, no problem (assuming you don't smash the fence).  Cleans up yard trash in a snap.  I did not experience the oil leakage described by others.  The chain doesn't turn fast enough to burn, so oiling isn't as critical as with a gas saw. And the fact that it's green will appeal to your feminine side.
B000094YKM Besides the cost of propane and attractant cartridges you have to buy about every 21 days, you need to figure in the cost of using 1 of the CO2 Quick-clean cartridges at each tank refill, at a cost of about $4 each. Depending on what you pay for the propane, attractant and CO2 cartridges, it sums up to a cost of $20 around or more at each tank refill. Since you have to refill the propane tank, replace the attractant and use the Quick-clean every 21 days, this adds up to an operating cost of over $400 per year! I'm posting this because it is something you may need to budget for and should seriously consider before buying.
B000094YKM It worked great for one season but when I went to start it up for this season it wouldn't start. I did everything the manual and website said to do when I put it away last fall and did everything the manual and website said to start it up this spring, including wasting three of the \"clean out\" cartridges and it still doesn't work. Plan on buying a new one every year if this is the one you choose.  Their tech support does not answer emails and the wait for them to answer the phone is nearly endless.Bottom line: avoid this product.
B000094YKM This product is a waste of money.  It will only last for one season and its' effetiveness was minimal.  Two other folks on the street bought one as well and had the same experience.  After mine stopped working (the first time), customer service was marginal at best.  I live in the south and I got a little desperate to solve the misquito problem.  Save your money and buy more cans of bugs spray.
B000094YKM One of the costliest mistakes I ever made was purchasing this device (actually two of them!) to control mosquitoes in the yard.  Yes, it caught mosquitoes, but it did not eliminate the problem; the yard was still a mosquito zone despite two operating machines.  The problem was that while the machine does catch mosquitoes, it does not catch enough of them to make a serious dent in 
B000094YKM Expensive hunk of junk.  Orig. purchase date Nov. 2006, after the first one we'd bought quit working just a little after the warranty period ended.  The 'head' on this Defender has been repaired three times and replaced twice.  If you get a replacement head from them, there is no additional warranty past your original purchase date (even though they sent you a new one!).  Save your money for something else.  Ours is dead again.  We purchased an inexpensive replacement plan through Amazon, but we're done with the Defender-we're throwing it away.
B0000950PZ NICE
B0000950PZ I bought these last fall thinking they'd be great to trim the grass along the walk way. I don't remember using them at all last year; today I pulled them out of the storage space in the garage and discovered the blades refuse to close together.  They stay open about an inch and a half!  There is no way to adjust the closure space so I guess I just paid for a piece of junk. Too bad, the other Fiskar products we have are great. They missed to boat on this one and need to go back to the drawing board.
B0000950PZ I use this shears for trimming grass around my landscaped flower bed in the front lawn. It is hard to mow around the bricks, so this shears comes in very handy. I love the fact that the handle/head can swivel and it is so light weight. Also, as with all the Fiskars blade products, the blades are very sharp and I am able to trim precisely what I want. A great product to trim the grass around areas the lawn mower can't reach.
B0000950PZ I have had really good luck with Fiskar's products and thought I would give the grass shears a try.  The have lived up to my expectations and then some.  The rotating head is a really nice feature that I've not seen on other brands. When trimming the grass near the concrete steps and brick walkway, the rotating head allows me to get very close so I am able to make an even cut.  The blade is very sharp, even after several uses with no sign of rust.  The blade locks in place and makes storage easy so I don't have to worry about cutting my fingers when reaching for it in the tool shed.  Great product!
B0000950PZ Fiskars Shear Ease Grass Shears are the best grass clippers I've ever used. We bought these locally and had a choice among 3 different clippers. Of the three, these were the most expensive, lightest in weight, and also were the easiest to open/close.  I was going to get the middle-priced shears because we don't use them that much, but decided to purchase the Fiskars instead. I'm glad I did. They are very light, easy to cut with and don't require a lot of force. The blades are sharp and remind me of Fiskars scissors. I didn't have any trouble with my hand getting pinched, but I can see how it might be a problem. I suggest wearing gloves if you think you might be prone to pinching or blisters when you use these.  The rotating head came in handy when I trimmed around railroad ties. The blades are already grass stained after being used for approx. 20 min. It's suggested that you clean the blades after each use & oil them once in a while for longer life. I can see how grass stain build up could eventually make the blade  sticky requiring more hand pressure to open/close them.  The blades are fully hardened stainless steel. I expect them to remain sharp for a long time.These shears have a lifetime warranty.
B0000950PZ This grass shears is awesome.  In the past I had issue's with my standard shears, because I could not get the right angle to cut properly.  This product absolutely erases all of those issue's; the pivoting head allows me to use this product everywhere I need to.
B0000950PZ This is my first grass shears I have purchased.  I wasn't sure if I would like it but I took a chance and love it!  We love them because of the of pivoting head that allows to get really close and different angles.  It works so nice for the those little areas along the sidewalk and along the steps. Very easy to use and very sharp!
B0000950PZ Though I have several string trimmers, there are areas best cut by hand - like around the vines climbing the two metal arbors out front. If I accidentally cut those vines, I'll be in big trouble, and so when trimming around those long babied vines I use the Fiskars grass shears.The shears cut well through grass though thick woody stems can stop them in their tracks.  The up and down handle mechanism is comfortable and doesn't cramp my hands like some of the side to side units. I like using these when trimming around the Virginia creepers and any prized flowers that I don't want to harm.After three years the shears still cut well, and though I only use them a few times a year, they're a great tool to have in the garden shed when the need arises. I've noticed that my pair doesn't close all the way when put in the locked position. That has never been a problem.Would I but these black and orange (Oriole colors) shears again? Most definitely.
B0000950PZ I purchased this exact model from my local \"Wal-Mart\" and actually paid more than I would have here, but I needed some clippers and fast.First off, they are not rigid at all..  What I mean is, as long as you are clipping a few blades of grass, you are ok, but really put it to use, and you soon find that it will lock blades and not function. This is due to the very poor construction.  Too much \"slop\" between the blades often make either both blades lock together or separate so much that nothing is cut.If you really want a good set of clippers that actually work, look further as this is a \"novelty\" item more than an actual functioning tool.
B0000950Q2 I bought this thing when they still had the wooden handles.  Being an avid sewer, I am quite familiar with Fiskars scissors and have many pairs that I rely on and have for many, many years.  So, when I saw these at the local garden store, it was a no brainer in my mind.  SO glad I have these!  Of ALL the tools like this I've owned over the years, this set of Loppers from Fiskars is the only set that hasn't broken, become jammed, or some other weird thing.  I clean them after each use to keep diseases spreading from plant to plant.  They're amazingly easy to use, especially for women, and boy, the clean cuts it makes just makes everything you do a breeze.  One of those items I am SO glad I found!  HIGHLY RECOMMEND!
B0000950Q2 Love these loppers - I've been using them for almost a year now.  Great for those jobs where I used to use small hand pruners that took lots & lots of effort (you know those branches that are really too big for hand pruners, but that you don't want to get the big giant loppers out for, so you squeeze & squeeze the pruners until the branch is finally cut??)  These cut SO easily & cleanly that they're a pleasure to use.(As an aside, I had an old pair of Fiskars hand pruners that had become badly misaligned.  I called the company to inquire about how I could fix them, and they just replaced them for me.  Great customer service!)These loppers are really for relatively close branches; should you need to prune branches that are farther away, you'd want to buy longer ones.Highly recommended.
B0000950Q2 I love this tool. I have removed small weeds to larger branches with no problems at all. Thank you for a great product!
B0000950Q2 Lightweight yet able to easily cut through a 1.5 inch branch of an Oak.  Simply put, this is a great buy.
B0000950Q2 Not long after I bought these I made the mistake of trying to prune old wood that was really too great a diameter for a small pruner and I broke the cutting blade.  Feeling embarrassed, I wrote to Fiskars and asked them if I could buy the part I'd broken.  Instead of replying they sent me a new pruner within days.  I want anyone shopping for garden tools to know that this is a great company that stands behind its products even when their customers fail to use them properly.  How often does that happen these days?  (I now always make the trek to the shed for the larger loppers when I need to cut old, thick branches.)
B0000950Q2 perfect length for average jobs, cuts like cutting butter, which is very true, keep it clean and well lube, and it cuts like nothing else, best lopper i'd used for sure, blade holds up very well, do wear gloves when using this, because of \" cancer causing materials\", if you have an i-phone, you probably familiar with these subjects.
B0000950Q2 best I've found and bought a second pair for my wife so she would quit using mine and leave em out instead of putting them away I'm not really into writing the product reviews so adding this filler to satisfy the required number of works.
B0000950Q2 I bought this tool because of the reviews. The reviews were so correct. This tool is a great investment. You will be inspired to clean up neglected shrubs etc. on your property. If the branch fits into the opening, you can get a good clean cut. You have to get used to the cutting angle, but after a short time, you become a pro. Great tool!
B0000950Q2 The Fiskars 9625 PowerGear Bypass Lopper is a very effective tool, that usually gets the job done, without the user having to expend an excessive amount of energy.  This is mostly because the lopper is designed with some large \"gearlike\" teeth, which act to increase leverage, and direct the applied force to the cutting surfaces.  This results in a tool that is generally more efficient and requires less effort, than most conventionally designed cutters, where brute force is usually required to cut through thicker or harder objects.According to the information on the product page, the maximum capacity is a diameter of 1.5 inches.  So far, I have used the PowerGear only on shrubs and small trees, with branches that are about an inch or less in diameter.  It has no problems cutting through either softer branches, or harder dried out ones.  Because the lower cutting edge is curved, you can't always go straight in, and cut where you want.  You may need to alter your approach, and come in at an alternate angle, in order to make the cut.  This can be slightly inconvenient, but you will learn to work around it.If you are used to applying massive force when using a cutter, you may be pleasantly surprised by the PowerGear, as it usually makes the task easier, and seldom becomes a physical struggle.  The blades are supposedly coated with a non-stick substance.  I'm not sure how long this lasts, but so far the blades have been relatively easy to clean.The blades are described as being \"razor sharp\" and \"precision ground\", but that's mostly promotional hype.  The blade is certainly sharp, but I was slightly disappointed at the uneven cutting edge on my blade.  The feel of the plastic handles is just adequate, as they don't provide an especially secure grip, something that can be important, when you are wearing work gloves, which can be slippery.A particularly strange oddity concerns the color of the blade.  My blade is black, but in some photos the blade is sliver colored.  I have no idea, what difference this may make, but the lack of standardization just seems strange.There are several versions of the PowerGear lopper, so you may want to check for the one that best suits your needs.  This one is for mid-sized branches, that are within easy reach.  Usually priced at about $25, I had to wait for some time before I was able to buy this cutter for just $18.  If you see it at that level, you might want to act fast, as it probably won't be there for long.  Like most Fiskars products, this one is fairly well designed and a solid value.
B0000950Q2 These are designed to cut far more easily than your garden variety loppers, and they do just that. It says right on the handles that they cut \"three times easier,\" and indeed they do. You want a tool that does the same amount of work with 1/3 the force on the handle side. Since work equals force times displacement, you need to triple the displacement of (amount you open) the handles, and you will get the same amount of work done with 1/3 the amount of force. Since the blade is moving effectively 1/3 the distance you'd expect for such a large movement of the handles, it's providing three times the force, allowing you to do what really amounts to the same amount of work, but with what feels like 1/3 the effort.Since the blade, when closed, looks to be at somewhere near a 30 degree angle compared to the handle, and when opened, appears to be at around a 90 degree angle, the gears are accomplishing exactly what is needed to do what they claim. It's not a marketing claim. It's not a matter of what it feels like subjectively. When they say that it cuts three times more easily, it's an objective fact.The only possible down side is that if you need to work close and have limited room for handle movement, the blades won't separate enough. But for pruning trees, that's probably a non issue. They claim that it will cut branches up to 1.5 inches, and I concluded the same thing when I used them. But it will take the amount of force needed with other tools to cut a 1/2 inch branch. When I cut the largest branch I needed to cut using the maximum opening of the jaws (perhaps a bit more than 1.5 inches) it did take effort (but not struggle) to close the handles. But on branches of an inch or less, I've had more problems cutting paper with school scissors.
B00009PR1E Has the usual (very slight) fade after 5 months, BUT it is not very noticeable I only mention it because I notice everything (live in SB,Cali and we get moisture/sun every day). The material is thick and sturdy...I bought this for my 48-50 inch grill so it would fully cover the sides and it is working out great. Cover would get 4.5 stars but I rounded down due to the color of green being slightly different, to me, that what it looks like in the photos. Will update after a full summer if it holds up and doesn't crack, then bump up to 5 stars.
B00009PR1E I have had this cover on my grill for over a year now in Minnesota, where it has endured a wide range of harsh weather.  The cover has held up wonderfully.  The only word of caution is on the color.  It is clearly shown in the listing as having green left and right panels.  They may be green when you first buy the cover, but they will quickly turn to brown when you put it on your grill.  To me, this is a minor drawback, but others might find it more objectionable.
B00009PR1E the canvas type material is very heavy and easy to clean. It covers our grill from top to bottom. I just wish there were mor color choices, I don't like the white down the middle.
B00009PR1E It is not just plain beige....I love the green on both sides... however it does say &#34;Char-Broil&#34; on the front. It is heavy and feels very durable. A bargain at 23.91 in my opinion.
B00009PR1E Well made and does the job. Unfortunately it doesn't reach all the way to the ground and doesn't have tie-downs, but other than that it works great.
B00009PR1E I recently invested in a new grill. Having lived in an apartment complex where I wasn't permitted to have a grill for the last fifteen years, I was and still am quite excited about the grill.I spent a little more than I originally planned to pay, but decided that it was worth putting a little more money into it on the front end to prevent the desire to replace it within just a couple of years.A long-term investment like this needs to be protected, of course. I checked the Char-Broil site to see what cover they recommend for theChar Broil T480 4-Burner 48,000 BTU Gas Grill, with Sideburnerand found that they recommend the Char-Broil 2185564 65-Inch Artisan Mountain Green Grill Cover, so I ordered it from Amazon.The cover is very thick, and I believe it will withstand rain and other weather should I eventually decide to keep the grill outside. For now I store it in the garage, but I still like to have the cover on it.This cover is easy to take on and off and looks as attractive as a grill cover can. The length is just a bit shorter than the grill itself, so you can wheel the grill around with the cover on without tripping over the edges.I'm pleased with this purchase and would recommend it.
B0000AH849 I bought these to take care of a mosquito larvae problem in my bog garden. They work well and the frogs are not bothered by them at all. I have a few rare green frogs in the bog here and the dunks don't harm them at all. This particular package, however, was very dry and it seemed like they just crumbled after hitting the water. It does not reduce their effectiveness at killing larvae, but it's not a very attractive result, especially if you have water lilies or water plants. You end up with a lot of bits of cork floating around and getting all over everything. Guess that's better than a bunch of mosquitoes, but...
B0000AH849 Used these in my rain barrel all summer and we didn't have any mosquitos breeding in the standing water. Done.
B0000AH849 These seem to keep the bugs at bay if used properly.  I use them in any standing water.  Pots.  Low areas of soil or grass. Just keep away from pets and kids.
B0000AH849 I thought I liked the idea at first and am glad I waited to write a review because when we first got it we were so excited and could not wait to put them in everything until two birds ended up dead and we have more Mosquitos then we know what to do with!We do NOT recommend this to anyone unless you don't care about nature and other living beings!  Also if you enjoy getting bit all the time by all means buy this , but I would never again and I had to drop it off at our neighborhood program which we call STOP program which stands for Stop throwing out pollutants because we found out you cannot throw it in your regular garbage cause it is considered a poison!Terrible product!
B0000AH849 We have rain barrels ranging from 55 gallons to 400 and these drop right in and really keep the Mosquitos from breeding. I cut a strip off and gave to a friend.  I also bought bags of loose mosquito stopper but have not used it yet as these little donuts have worked well.
B0000AH849 The summit mosquito dunks 20 pack is a great deal at 17 bucks as compared to what I normally pay for a 6 pack which is around 10 to 12 dollars.  These typically last for about 30 days each time I put one in my small 6 x 5 x 2 pond.  I use a half dunk as that will suffice for an area that small.
B0000AH849 I have used these for years in my rain barrels. They work great to keep those dreaded mosquitos from breeding.
B0000AH849 I used these last year. Never saw any active larvae. This is one weapon in the fight against mosquitoes. Sometimes the dunk floats out if the container overflows like in heavy rain. Minor problem.I used it in the bird bath. I didn't see any dead birds littering our yard.Great product.
B0000AH849 These mosquito dunks work!  I purchased them for a small, outdoor fountain that we have sitting amongst our large blue hostas.  We only need about 1/4 of a dunk so we break it & put it in the fountain. It will usually separate so there are several small pieces of mosquito dunk that float around in the fountain. We don't like the looks of it so we're considering putting the dunk under the removable top piece of the fountain. Rain will cause the fountain to overflow & we'll have to replace the mosquito dunk more often because it'll float right over the edge.  I also use a small amount in the saucer of my outdoor plants. So far so good, I haven't seen any mosquito larva in my fountain this year.  Locally, I saw this product for between $9 & 10 dollars.
B0000AH849 I purchased these as recommended by friend and am sure they will work as recommended. I did just set up my rain barrels and haven't used them yet. All is pretty self explanatory and straight forward. I am happy to have them.
B0000CBIFG All trimmers are like writers, they need good lines. The Weed Eater line is perfect as it is made for this trimmer and buying in bulk saves dollars!
B0000CBIFG I bought this to restring my Black and Decker Trimmer. I used to buy the pre-strung cartridges from them, but they cost a small fortune compared to using this. I have re-strung two carts. and have had great success with them after using this product. The line feeds through just like the original line and does not seem to go any more quickly than the original. Definitely a great way to save money if you don't mind spending a few minutes restringing.EDIT - 5/10/12After over 2 seasons of trimming, weedwacking, and edging - I still have tons of string left! What a great investment! My property is not very large, about an average size lot for Southern New Jersey. (around 3500 sq feet of lawn space).
B0000CBIFG You must buy this if you buy a string trimmer. The string breaks often so you need extra refills of the proper width.
B0000CBIFG Trimmer line that fits, is relatively easy to work with and inexpensive. I am only 1/3 thru the package and if the trimmer itself lasts then I will buy more line like this. It's great stuff
B0000CBIFG Ok....I have not had to re-string my weed-eater yet, but two things with this item. I bought this because it was recommended by Amazon with the purchase and the cost was reasonable.The things you should know..............1) Realize you are purchasing a spool of trimmer line, not a package that you can just plug into your trimmer. When I get to where I have re-strung the trimmer I bought (the GreenWorks 21212 4 Amp 13&#34; Corded String Trimmer) I will update this.2) The string seems to be of a much heavier gauge than what shipped with the trimmer. Again, I will update when I re-string, but I am hoping the replacement string will work fine.Again, I don't know all the specifics, but  I wanted to alert people to the oddities I encountered in the purchased and visual examination.  It may work just fine and when I get to that point where I am actually using it, I will update the review and star rating.
B0000CBIFG This is a great replacement trimmer line for myBlack & Decker NST1024 24-Volt Cordless String Trimmer/Edger.  If I were to purchase theBlack & Decker AF-100-3ZP 30-Feet 0.065-Inch Line String Trimmer Replacement Spool, 3-Pack, it would have been over 19 cents per foot.  At the time of my review, this product is less than 3 cents per foot!  It took a little research to figure out how to properly re-string my empty spool since Black and Decker's replacements are pre-strung spools.  Once I figured it out, re-stringing my spool was easy.  After I finished stringing approximately 10 feet to test, I took the trimmer for a run and it worked great!  I did the entire yard to make sure it worked well.  I've done the yard a second time since then.  It actually seems to trim the weeds cleaner and easier than Black and Decker's line.  I'm so glad that I gave this product a chance.  It's great quality and saved me a bunch of money.
B0000CBIFG I wasn't even going to write a review because I figured all lines are about the same. But this stuff seems tougher, more flexible, and easier feeding than what came with my B&D trimmer. It seems to have a powdery lubricant like talc that helps with winding and feeding.
B0000CBIFG There is really not that much to say about this product.  If you need 0.065 inch diameter monofilament replacement line for your string trimmer, this spool is competitively priced at about five dollars for 200 feet.  Just make sure this is the size you need, and not the larger 0.080 inch diameter line.If you really want to buy in bulk, you can get the 2000 foot roll and save even more.Weed Eater 952711559 0.080-Inch by 2000-Feet Bulk Round String Trimmer Line
B0000CBJCQ I just bought four bags of these chips from Home Depot for $16 plus tax. I'm disappointed that while Amazon usually beats the price on most items, the price in this case is double what I pay at HD. These are nice chips and do a great job in my smoker. On the Weber main site, they list the price as $4.99 - so for Amazon to have a retail list price of $12.99 is simply incorrect. Buyer Beware!
B0000CBJCQ I cooked a Turkey on my Charcoal Rotisserie for Thanksgiving 2010. I used the Pecan Wood Chips according to the instructions on the bag, and WOW!!! They put a taste into that Turkey that is hard to describe!!  It was so delicious and jucy. I always wondered what Pecan Wood smoke would do to meat, and now I know. No turning back now. I must try some Ribs with these chips next, and a Roasting Chicken.....mmmmmmmmm!!  Highly recommended. Will purchase again.
B0000CBJCQ I have a Weber gas grill with a smoke box at the side.  The first thing I used was made of tiny little splinter type things.  Too small too fast.  These pieces are larger;  most are too large to fit in the smoke box.  I hate having to wield a hatchet to break them up.  3/4&#34; to 1&#34; would be a lot better.  However once these catch the flavor is right on.
B0000CBJCQ Great tasting hickory. I would give it a 5 but some of the pieces are too large to slip between the bars on my Weber 320 and so it only gets a 4 since I need to use pliers to move the grate and drop in the wood.
B0000CBJCQ I used these chips for smoking chickens and pork ribs.  I love the sweet smoke flavor that only fruit woods can add to a BBQ.  They worked out great for me and a little went a long way in the propane smoker.
B0000CBJCQ I have tried both dry and soaking in water.  Jury is still out on that one.What I can tell you is flavor is noticible.  Chips are much easier to work with in reference to Weber's E670 smoker box.  Chucks would be more appropriate for charcoal or homemade tin foil smoker bricks.Tried Charbroils version from HD.  Will continue to be buying Weber's version.Purchase again?  YES
B0000CBJCQ Great for adding flavor to slow cooked meat. Make sure you know what you're doing and don't go crazy on the wood. A little bit goes a long way, but apple wood is one of the best woods for smoking pork. the chips are good sized they arrived dry no musty smell no bugs and are much better then I can get at our local store. I will be buying this again.
B0000CBJCQ Being new to smoking we weren't sure which wood to go with.  So we bought Apple, Pecan, and Mesquite.  I think Apple is my favorite flavor but all had great results.  The bags have lasted multiple smokings and don't require to be soaked in water for 24 hours to get a good smoke out of them (seems like some woods require a long soak time).  Again, I'm not a pro, but thats how we felt about them!
B0000CBJCQ makes good smoke taste
B0000CBJCQ These are just super.  Throw them in a cup for thirty minutes to soften them, then the food absorbs all of that sweet apple smoke flavor.  Yum, yum.
B0000CBJCQ These apple wood chips make smoke but I have found that I prefer hickory or mesquite wood chips rather than apple.
B0000CBJCQ Please see my review of the hickory chips.  These are certainly chips, they are certainly apple and they certainly smoke.  How on earth do you rate something like this.  Everyone does understand that we are going to burn these up right?
B0000CBJMQ I couldn't find this at my two local hardware stores, they didn't stock any bar and chain oil surprisingly. I used this in my newHusqvarna 450 18-Inch 50.2cc X-Torq 2-Cycle Gas Powered Chain Saw With Smart Start (CARB Compliant)and it works great. They don't recommend you use any motor oil or different purposed oil so I definitely recommend this product. I had some husqvarna chain oil in my last chainsaw for years, and to be honest I can't find any difference in noticeable viscosity or functionality of that product over this (it was a lot more expensive).
B0000CBJMQ I wanted Poulan brand oil, and this was the only place I could find it. More expensive but it works great. Nothing to compare it to, but I'm happy anyways.
B0000CBJMQ What can i say it's bar chain oil at a normal price.What i can tell you is never us engine oil because it lacks the stickiness that the bar and chains need.Save the life of your chain and bar and use a quality oil.
B0000CBJMQ If you do a lot of tree trimming or cutting you know the value of good chain oil.  You need to use it to prolong the life of your chain and bar for your chain saws.  I just trimmed 18 large trees and this oil helps to cut quickly through the large branches and protect and extend the life of your expensive chainsaw parts.The thing about chainsaw oil is that it is stickier than regular oil because of an additive to enhance the viscosity and it stays on the bar better to lubricate it while it is doing its job.  It also does not sling off the chain as quickly as motor oil. When oil slings off the chain and bar, a lot of it is going onto you, your clothes and shoes. When you are trimming a tree above your head it is nice to have it not dripping back down onto you.This is a good product and I recommend it!
B0000CBJMQ What can I say about chain oil? I works to lubricate the chain on my small chain saw, and that's what it's supposed to do.
B0000DI845 After testing 4 areas of soil and a couple of control tests, none of these test results could be trusted.1. Tested lemon juice fresh from a lemon: pH read \"6\"... when it should have been the lowest value on the chart or more (pH of nearly 2 is lemon, so these tests give unreliably \"alkaline\" results). The purified water test also came out \"alkaline\".  All of the yard samples also came up as the most alkaline result, 7.5.2. Tested freshly decomposed manure compost exactly to the package directions: none of the K, P, or N tests reacted at all after 10 minutes, 20, 30... or even 24 hours later. Manure compost should at least read \"adequate\" for nitrogen! None of the soil samples from the yard reacted either, so the indicating agent in the capsules is useless.So, all in all, it was a tremendous waste of money and time.
B0000DI845 This kit is a great value and super easy to use. I love that they include a little packet of info on suggested Ph values for certain plants and veggies. Awesome!!!
B0000DI845 I can now save money and feel confident on how my soil is doing. I test my garden and lawn at different times of the year. This way I can always try to have my levels exactly where I want them.
B0000DI845 A decent quality product that appears to be more or less accurate however, I'm not thrilled with the fairly ambiguous rating system for the test results:  I conducted all four tests on a veggie garden soil sample.  The pH test was great - clear results.  The N, K and P test parameters are pretty loose, though.  Essentially, you can tell whether your soil is deficient but it's pretty difficult to discern the difference between the &#34;adequate&#34; reading and the reading indicating an overabundance of the given substance.  I posted a customer pic on the vendor's listing to illustrate results.  Who knows if they will post it.  I don't think I would re-purchase this item.
B0000DI845 I wanted to test various parts of my garden soil to check the pH levels as well as the N, P, and K levels. This kit makes it a breeze. The pills are conveniently labeled and the instructions make it simple to understand what to do. The colored indicators make it easy to tell where your soil currently is at and the instructions give suggestions on how to adjust the levels should you need to.
B0000DI845 These things work just fine. I would buy them again. I added to my soil what they said I was low on and I was pleased with the results.
B0000DI845 I am  Master Gardener and I must admit I broke the Cardinal rule of gardening, I never test my ground.  Even when the MG program offered it to me for free when I graduated, I could not be bothered.  I thought I could adjust my garden when I needed it myself without any help from a test kit.  Until I moved, this house has a wonderful piece of property that I use for my vegetable garden and for the first three years everything was perfect, until this year.  Nothing wants to grow, so I broke down and bought this item, low an behold I have a problem, nothing major but my phosphorous is completely depleted and that is the explanation for the way my veggies are growing.  I found out what must be done and I did it and everything is turning around..Good sound product I recommend it to the gardener that thinks he/she knows it all, (but we really don't.)
B0000DI84D I like the 10\" size.  It holds a substantial pot, whether you change the plant three times a year, or keep one perennial as I do.  The holder goes onto your deck rail in a few minutes.  While it is not heavy duty, it will hold even a tall pot easily and securely.  Holds enough soil for a second story deck like mine to trail a vine twenty feet, or a huge Swiss or trailing begonia.  Not much else to say except no problems and sturdy enough to last for years.
B0000DI84D We are in zone 5-6a and I have a small gardenia which needs to be brought indoors during the winter. I have been looking for a place where I can put the pot that would allow me to enjoy the scent and still bring it in when the weather grows cold.This is perfect because the holder is adjustable and fits my deck perfectly. This also holds my 10 inch pot and is very sturdy.Very nice product, easily adjustable, easy to use.
B0000DI84D I have several pot holders like this one on my deck. This flower pot in particular is pretty sturdy. The only thing I would change is for it to come with a little instruction book or an explanation on how you get it to fit on the railing.
B0000DI84D This came packaged quite well, and I did not have any missing parts.  The brackets were on the holder itself, with zip ties and they were easy enough to find.  The instructions were clear as how to hang this properly, and installation time took less than two minutes.It is holding a 10 inch pot of geraniums and it was easy to attach to the fence post.  I would order this again.
B0000DI84D This hanger works great for hanging my potted plants from my side porch. I don't have an overhang to hang plants from hangers, so prior to this, I was only able to set my flowers out on my side porch on my table, not hang them. This holder slides right over the railings of my porch and lets me hang flowers off the side so they are viewable from my driveway and the street out front. It's also a nice solution when you don't want to drill anything permanent into your porch to hang flowers. Just slide this holder over a railing and set your potted flowers inside, that's all there is to it! I like that I can also move this to other areas of my porch, if my flower are in need of more sun.
B0000DI84D This attractive black pot holder installs easily. I appreciated the versatility as it can fit 2 x4\" to 2x 6\" inch railing. I am not mechanically inclined but was able to affix this to my deck with no problems. It is designed with a \"bumper\" which prevents the pot from tipping. The black color should blend with just about any d&eacute;cor.This is a convenient way for me to keep a pot of fresh herbs in close proximity to the grill on my deck.  The hardware seemed a bit flimsy but so far it has held. This is a good way to bring a color to your deck, balcony or fence. Recommended.
B0000DI84D The holder itself is made fine but the harware is really cheap.  It will hold a large pot, which is nice.  I prefer to look for a holder that will fit over the rails of my porch.
B0000DI84D CobraCo's adjustable flower pot holder is a flexible product that can be used to fit on deck railing up to 4 inches across.  The brackets easily attach in 1 of 2 configurations depending on the width of your rail.  There are 3 screws on each side to lock the bracket down.  There is a bottom bumper support to rest against a post or rail to keep the plant level.  The holder easily accommodates a plant pot of up to 10 inch diameter.This is an easy way to beautify your deck.  Just add plant, and water.
B0000DI84D An effective design and well thought out holder giving you numerable options in mounting positions.  The \"U\" shaped wire at the rear of the base strengthens the holder and holds it out from the post to ensure the pot remains level, as well as stable. The mounting brackets are simple yet effective allowing you to mount the holder in different locations, a welcome change from the \"special\" mounts that require you to purchase multiple holders to mount flower pots in different positions. bogie
B0000DI84D The mechanism of this flower pot is very interesting. The part that hooks over the ledge is removable. It has three awkwardly positioned screws on each side that allow the back hook to slide to accommodate multiple sizes of railing. The screws are a bit cumbersome to adjust. I would only recommend this flower pot holder if you are trying to hng on a non-standard size rail.
B0000DI84D I chose this item for an indeterminate tomato plant.  After I initially set this holder at the desired spot, I then assembled this with my hands before my husband brought his power screw driver in to complete the job. The brackets are now securely mounted on our back porch.  I noticed that the brackets can be used from either the long or the short side, depending on how wide the frame or sill is.The holder leans a little down but that is the desired effect I want, so that the plant can benefit from the western sun late in the afternoon.  The deep brackets keep this holder from getting blown off in our strong spring winds.
B0000DI84D This is a good, standard pot holder.  The metal construction is sturdy and it keeps my plant perfectly perched on my wood railing (a plus because some of the non-adjustable holders I've found are meant for a skinnier metal railing and don't work for my situation).  So functionality wise, these have been perfect.  But aesthetically, it still pretty utilitarian looking.  There's really nothing in the way of ornamentation or decoration.  Because of that, I like using this with a pot that is well designed and pretty on it's own.Aesthetics aside, it functions as expected and is perfect for people (like me) whose railings are not a uniform size.
B0000DI84D Decent quality though not quite as sturdy as I would have wanted.Good news though, it fits 6\" or less rails with an adjustable arm.  My package had all the items included.  Some folks complained the brackets weren't included but I noticed mine were just lying in the bottom of the box separate from the rest of the item.  Perhaps the customer missed them or perhaps the shipper missed them.  Not sure.  But without those it is useless.Holds a 10 inch pot.  Looks nice.  Just wish the metal was a bit better quality.  I worry it might wear, bend, or break over time.  I will update if this occurs.
B0000DI84D This is a metal holder for flower pots. It is fairly basic, not decorative but if you just need to put your pots of pretty flowers out on a rail it will do the job.Some reviewers complained of parts missing but mine was complete. It took me a minute to figure out that I need to turn a screw to loosen the parts and then tighten it up but that was easy enough. Seems to be a good product.
B0000DI84D Overall this is a nice flowerpot holder for a deck railing. It is adjustable to fit a range of railing widths, and holds up to a ten inch pot. It blends in well, and holds a heavy pot securely. It is not permanent - I had no problems removing it and repositioning it (after removing the pot, of course).On the downside, the construction quality for something that is going to be outdoors 100% of the time (and often wet from rain or water coming out of the pot) is not as good as I would have liked it to be. It's all steel (painted) held together with welds. My concern is rust - it would have been nice to have it be made of stainless, or have a plastic coating on the steel to help prevent/minimize rust. I'll certainly be bringing this indoors in the winter, and most likely will need to spray paint it regularly to keep it rust-free, especially where it may get scratched from a clay pot.But so far so good. It's a nice addition to the deck, and I very much like that it's secure but not a permanent installation.
B0000DI84D When I originally set this up on our front porch railing, I was very pleased with the ease of it.  I was able to do it rather quickly and without assistance.  I chose to put a flower pot that has trailing vines in it, that way the frame would be hidden a bit and it looked great.  If I were to rate this item on that alone, it would get 5 stars.  But then I was at our local hardware & garden center and saw similar pot holders for half the price.  I ended up buying two of them in the same 10 inch size top add more pots to our front deck and they were just as easy to install and work just as well.  So for this I do drop this item down to 3 stars.  Don't get me wrong it's a good item, but why pay more than you should? I definitely recommend shopping around if saving money is as important to you as it is to me.
B0000DI84D This simple flower pot holder will hold most 10 inch flower pots. It has a strong metal frame with a black vinyl coating so it holds up well against weathering and it's rust resistant. It's very easy to get set up and is fully adjustable. It should be able to hang on most deck railings, balconies and maybe some fences that have a flat top on them. It's very strong and shouldn't have any problem holding even a really heavy pot.
B0000DI84D This adjustable flower pot holder works marvelously in a typically difficult area I enjoy having a flowering plant.  I usually end up having a hanging plant, but with this adjustable pot it's very easy to attach to a board on the side of my barn.  There's a weathered two-by-four hammered into the side and instead of hanging a plant on the edge, I can now arrange it in a complementary fashion.  The bumper keeps it from swaying and keeps the holder and pot level.  If you have one of those oddball spots where you'd like to have a plant, the CobraCo just may have solved your problem.I opted for a rather heavy plant and didn't experience any problem with forward bending.  The design of this adjustable flower pot is perfect and quite well-balanced.  If you are also in the market for an adjustable flower box holder, CobraCo has a36-inch black adjustable/expandable flower box holderand a24-inch adjustable white flower box holder.  These would look especially nice on a balcony.  Weather resistance for this type of item is usually quite good (I have standing pot holders like this), but I'd recommend taking them in for the season.  I love this innovative adjustable pot holder and can't find a thing I don't like about it.
B0000DI84D I can't get over how easily this product changes to fit my needs.  I have a wide railed deck railing outside and  narrow railed wrought iron railing around a balcony in my living room inside.  I can switch this within in minutes to fit either railing.I don't know how long it will have to be out in the weather to affect the paint on this, but I tried a sharp knife  and it took a very sharp one and a lot of pressure to even scratch this - but yes it does scratch under a lot of abuse.It is built so that it has a piece in the back that acts a bit like a stabilizer so that the flower pot will not be at to sharp of an angle -water/heavy rain will drain out but the soil will stay inside the pot.
B0000DI84D I have this attached to my rails on my back porch.  I just planted a bunch of geraniums(red and white)and put the pot into the holder when I was done.  Very sturdy-that was one thing that I was afraid of was that it was going to fall over. But the brackets are very firm-dont think I will have a problem with them this summer.Nice product. It looks better when you get it. When I saw it on Amazon it looked very cheap but not when you get it.Might buy a couple more to match the one I just got!
B0000DI84D The CobraCo R0926-B 10-Inch Adjustable Flower Pot Holder in black is perfect for iron or wooden fencing, balconies or decks. It can be easily adjusted to fit multiple thicknesses of railing. The holder is vinyl coated so will not rust. Holds even heavy plants up to those in 10\" pots level. Also comes in white.
B0000DI84D This hanger works great. It is adjustable. It is very sturdy and holds a good size planter. I am using it instead of hanging baskets on my front porch and it looks really cute.
B0000DI84D It is flexible, can hold 50+ pounds (lbs), and sit on practically any railing up to 6-inch wide incl. thin panels of thick glass thanks to the clever design of the adjustable attachment brackets.  You can ignore the manufacturer's claim that the bracket can adjust 2-6 inches.  When using only 1 or 2 bracket's bolts (of 3) closest to the pot's bowl - after bending down the end of the horizontal flat (bar) of the L-shaped clasp - the vertical clasp's flat (bar) holding the pot can be fastened as close to the bowl as 0 inches.  It is safe to use just 1 bolt, as the distribution of even a high vertical load results in a very small horizontal component force, which can very little pull (shear away) the bolts, one of which can easily handle.  However, 
B0000DI84D So this flow pot is adjustable, can attach to deck railing, and will, in fact, hold a flow pot.  So as far as meeting expectations to the letter, sure, it worked out.  It's OK.But actually using it brings up some downsides.  The metal, while strong, when supporting a wide-based pot, seems like it's taxing its available strength to hold the bot up.  Also, depending on the pot, the side rails may be too high or, in my case, far to low to hold a tall pot in a way that looks and feel secure.  Nothing has broken or fallen out, but...I'm just waiting for it to happen.Overall, it's an OK adjustable pot holder, but it doesn't impress me very much and really isn't any better than average.
B0000DI84D This pot holder is really sturdy, much more than any other pot holder I have tried of its size.  It also has a lot of flexibility in the size of the brackets to adjust to different railings or fences.I tried this flower pot holder out in a couple of places before I found one that had the best sunlight and water possibilities - morning sun and only partial cover by a porch roof.  Then I decided on a great kindness to the plant, a vine that doesn't like trouble, and I put it on the side of the fence that faces my husband's garden instead of mine.  His side has about 90% better chance (okay, 100%) of being watered in a timely manner.  I have the general attitude that if plants are meant to live, they will -- except during the drought, and then even I showed better sense than that.The only thing I could have wished from this would be for a little more depth.  The size of the pot that will fit in here really is 7 inches at the bottom.  I repotted the vine I was putting in here to make it shorter but I may have trouble with the vine later.  :D
B0000DI84D I love these adjustable flower pot holders.  They keep the flowers at a higher level to enjoy as they hang on the deck railings rather than simply sitting on the deck. They are adjustable to fit most deck railings.
B0000DI84D The flower pot holder is adjustable to fit.  It is fairly sturdy and is easy to assemble.  You will need a philips screw driver to put finish assembly.  The only thing that I am not happy with is that put zip ties all over it and it was hard to cut with regular scissors.  I found that to be annoying.  But, I still find it to be a nicely made product.
B0000DI84D I haven't had this flower pot holder long enough to really see how beautiful it will be hanging on my deck rail  because it's too early for my plants to bloom or vine.  Soon I know it will be a real attraction and add a lot to our enjoyment.  The pot fits securely and I've planted petunias along with some vining plants.  Plan to buy some \"partners\" for it as soon as I can find them on the market.
B0000DI84D This is a nice sturdy product but it doesn't work well on my deck railing.  I have a board railing with slats, rather than a thick beam, and the unit just falls off if bumped.  When I move it so it sets against the slat it doesn't lie flat on the top.I can secure it by putting another screw or bolt behind the rail, but it's not supposed to need that. If you plan to order these, get just one first, and make sure it will work for you before buying enough for all your petunias.
B0000DI84D No way does this product perform as promised.  And what a waste of time it was trying to make it work!I don't think this company considered all the possible railing configurations before making its claims.We have a wooden railing on our deck.  At the top of the rail, one 2x4 is on end and it is topped by a 2x4 laying flat.  Any which way we tried it, it did not hold, would not grip the railing and kept falling forward. The screws are on the bottom of the L-shaped arms that are supposed to hug the railing.  How in the world are you supposed to tighten them when they are facing the railing?  Only if you assemble it OFF the railing; then you can't get it ON the railing.(I think I got all the parts:  I received the basket, two L-shaped arms, six flat-head screws and six plastic cap nuts.)
B0000DI84D We set up the porch this weekend (clean, bring up the furniture, put up the screens and shades) and I installed this pot holder on the deck railing with a pot of tourenia. It was quick, simple and the holder seems sturdy enough to give us several seasons of use. I'm considering getting two more as it's a big deck.
B0000DI84D This is very simple to assemble and adjust. I put it on my wooden deck railing with no problem. It's sturdier than I expected and can hold a big pot of flowers without moving. The design is plain, so you'll probably want a pretty pot to put in it. Great for renters like me who need non-permanent solutions for landscaping and decorating.
B0000DI84D The printed instructions on this wire hanging flower pit leave a little to be desired, but I can't complain about the adjustability. The bracket part really does accommodate a large variety of ledges and edges.The holder looks unassuming when hanging over the fence, and is big enough for most medium plant pots. It looks GREAT with a flowering plant draping down over the edges.The black vinyl coating is nice and should help keep this from getting rusty too soon. It seems pretty strong, and the weight of a potted plant seems to stabilize things quite well.For some reason, my set came with four extra metal brackets, and a ton of extra bolts. I wasn't able to figure out what to do with the extra brackets, which are metal, like the entire set-up. I will probably recycle them, unless I can figure out a reason to keep them around.
B0000DI84D This is a wonderfully realized product. Whether mounted over narrow or wide railings, the included brackets configure securely for either wide or narrow installations.The ten-inch option that I acquired has a depth of five and a half inches - eight inch baskets are also available, both in either black or white. The construction is sturdy. The bumper that keeps the holder level against the vertical support of the mounting area is rounded, so that no matter where I install this, I am not at all worried about scuffs, scratches or unsightly indentations.I love CobraCo's Adjustable Flower Pot Holder. This is the perfect item for helping to get another flower pot up and out of the way. It's well-built, it's easy to use and it really livens things up.
B0000DI84D I'm really pleased with this Flower Pot Basket.  It was so easy to put together and can handle a10 inch flower pot.  I placed it on my front porch rail and it is a perfect fit.
B0000DI84D While I am happy that this flower pot holder seems sturdy enough to hold a fairly large pot, weighted down with soil and water, I'm not sure how long it will hold up in outside conditions.The basket comes with two removable 'L' brackets that can be positioned with the 'long' side up an horizontal to the ground for wider railings or short side up and horizontal to the ground for shorter railings. There are three bolts and nuts to hold it together.The problem started for me on the install. My prefab (plastic) railings are just a hair too wide to use the short side of the L bracket so if I use the long side of the bracket it sticks out into the basket area by inches. Which means that any flower pot put inside is then hindered by the brackets taking up some of the valuable area to place your pot. I also had trouble trying to tighten the nuts to keep it together since they are underneath the bracket arm. You have to tighten them and then put it back on the railing.There is a part that rests against your banister to keep the basket in a level position.It's nice but not great. Since everyone's railings are different, I guess designing a better one is a tough task. This one is recommended with some reservation.
B0000DI84D We have coyote fences in my neck of the wood which are Latilla wood rods wrapped around an iron post. It's not always easy to find something which will hang easily on the inside of the fence, which is why I was interested to see this planter design. I find it works perfectly although it may be just a tad too flimsy for anything with a substantial weight. That being said, I think it will hold up lighter plants with no problems whatsoever.It looks well built and the adjustable part screwed together nicely. The other nice part about this is that you can move it wherever the sun is and then move it back to a shady place to rest for a while. It's a nice idea and I will recommend it to my neighbors who are always trying to figure out gadgets so they can hang flowers on their coyote fences.
B0000DI84D We have all different types of fencing in our yard--split rail, decking and wood fence. The CobraCo flower pot holder accommodates them all.  It has a nifty L-shaped clasp that adjusts two ways to hang from virtually any support--for thinner railings (2-4\") and thicker railings (4.5-6\").  I was worried this pot holder would be like so many others that tilt forward on an angle when a heavy plant is actually sitting in it.  To my delight, it sits perfectly vertical, thanks to another nice feature, a bumper that hits up against rails and prevents any slant.  This is a generous sized pot holder.  It can fit up to 10\" pots, and if weight is an issue, it could also hold a large coco fiber liner instead.  One of my favorite summer pastimes is relocating flower baskets, and this is the perfect gardening companion.
B0000DI84D This is an adjustable pot hanger that will work on most railings, decks, etc.It definitely does not have a high-end look, and I do wonder at its durability, but it'll work for most situations.If you need a lot of these it could get pricey.
B0000DI84D Fast, secure shipping. Everything was inside the box & nothing was missing.I dont know why the other person had problems with lost brackets, but mine were secured inside the bottom of the basket by 2 zip ties. Hard to spot right off....... but they were there.Would I buy again from this vendor.........100% yes.
B0000DI84D This is a nice, versatile pot holder for any sort of railing.  We live in a townhouse, and each unit has a fenced-in, concrete patio.  There's really no place to plant flowers, so a container garden is an only option.  I didn't want many containers crowding the ground of my small patio, so I opted for hanging them places.This pot holder is exactly what I needed.  It's 10 inches at the top, and will accommodate a range of flower pots.  The fastener is adjustable, to make them useful in a wide variety of locations.  I was able to fit it to our fencing perfectly.  It's sturdy and well-made, and I expect it will last through many cycles of flowers.
B0000DI84D The CobraCo Adjustable Flower Pot Holder is nicer than expected&mdash;the black vinyl-coated metal is much stronger than the holder it replaced.  Because of the wind, a drill was used to install it permanently on a deck railing with six heavy-duty wood screws.  It will hold any standard 8 or 10 in. flower pot and doesn't compete with the plant for attention.
B0000DI84D This product works well for what I want it to do - fit on an oddly sized apartment complex's railing.  It is adjustable.  Just works.
B0000DI84D Easy to use and adjust for my patio. It holds my flowers securely, no complains. I also don't see any signs of rust yet, but it rained only 2-3 times.
B0000DI84D Having a balcony pot holder makes my garden more interesting.  Since it can be adjusted fairly tightly on the ledge, it won't fall down, and the plant will not accidentally topple over the way it would if I just placed it on the balcony ledge without a pot holder. Staggering the plant pot heights from high to low allows each plant to have an individual focal point, and the pot holder sits up the highest on the ledge so that's great.The holder is easy to adjust with a variety of three holes per side and screws to secure it.  However, my balcony ledge is a little wide so I can only use one screw per side.  That isn't really a problem since my pot is balanced correctly thanks to the pot's non-tip bumper in the back bottom of the holder.  Also I like the fact that the holder is light weight and black is preferable, though it also comes in white. In addition, it is easy to move around or change the position of the pot and readjust the screws.  The only negative about the screws is that they are a bit difficult to tighten by hand unless you use a tool. Once it is all set up, it seems very secure and looks great on my balcony.
B0000DI84D This is a no frills Adjustable Flower Pot Holder, but it doesn't really need any frills. There is no fancy ironworks on this one, but it really doesn't need it as long as it works.  I put this on on my 4\" railing and it felt secure. I lined mine with the brown liners that come from hardware store so that you just have to put in the dirt and it looks great!  It can hold up to a 10\" pot of flowers and that's pretty wide!  All in all, I like it!  This on is Vinyl-coated steel and the longer one the same company makes is Powder-coated steel and feels much more substantial.  Couldn't ask for anything to be different.
B0000DI84D First of all this does what it is supposed to and in that it is a fine product.However,Took me awhile to figure out how to get it to work (directions not so clear and not 100% self explanatory)The screws and slides allow for probably most desk rail widths.  But the tricky part is that there is a support on the pot which requires that it be braced against a post or a baluster/picket.  My deck railing has a very old style (and no longer code) style \"X\" between posts.  This left very little spacing options for where the pot could be placed.  From below it looks lovely but a direct look at it the two anchors to the railing don't looks so neat (tempted to place a pot on top of them to hide them).
B0000DI84D Over the years I have tried a number of flower pot holders and have always been disappointed with the quality of them. This flower pot holder is made of strong and sturdy steel that is vinyl coated and rust proof so I don't have to worry about rust stains on my deck rails or the holder hanging crooked because of the flower pot weight. It can hold up to 10\" flower pots or even several small flower pots so it has great versatility. It was easy to install and looks simple, yet gorgeous. The only thing I didn't like was having to drill my new deck to install the flower pot holder. Overall, it's a great item that's a cut above the rest.
B0000DI84D This 10-inch flower pot holder seems to be well made and sturdy.  It's a tiny bit tedious to put together, because there are 6 screws and nuts, but really after you do it one time, it's unlikely that you will have to do it again.  Plus this designed insures a solid mount with no bending.What I liked was that you can put the slidey bars on two ways for more flexibility.What I didn't like, and which earned the holder the extraction of one-star, was that despite the flexibility previously described, it did not fit my rail.  Really, we have a basic deck.  Rails are 2x2\" risers with 1x4\" flat tops.The solution to this was actually easy and consisted of taking the screws out and moving the sliding bar to the top, rather than on the bottom of the bar attached to the wire frame.  That way it pokes out a little bit past the ring, but works perfectly.Since there's a fix that will make this plant holder fit almost any rail, I don't have any problem recommending it.
B0000DI84D This is really nice!  It's also bigger than I expected it to be.  It attached to my deck rail very easily and seems really good and sturdy.  I put a heavy pot of flowers inside and it looks great! It hold the pot in place nicely with very little movement and it's so well constructed that it doesn't take away from the look of the pot itself. I plan on getting some more of these!
B0000DI84D ON the positive first, this planter is what it says- a hanger for potted plants so that one can mount on rails or other horizontal surfaces. The paint and fittings appear to be weather resistant- so I don't anticipate anything rusting out.  The wire frame is heavy enough to adequately support a pot, soil and plant.  The mounting system is designed well, I hung this on my deck rail and feel comfortable it will be good there.  It looks nice and the black color I choose doesn't conflict with anything.The negative is in the hardware.  I don't want to be too insulting, but it literally looks like someone at the factory said, \"hey, we've got a bunch of these- use them!\"The hardware consist of flat head slotted screws that come up through the bottom of the part of the frame that goes over the rail.  That seems like a good idea, except the bottom of the frame is an non-camferred slot- so the screws stick out.  The nuts on top are plastic acorn nuts that don't have a metal inside.  This makes them easy to cross thread, easy to over tighten and generally, difficult to deal with.  It seems to me that a combination of a carriage bolt (so you didn't have to hold the bottom, it would hold itself) and a better nut could have made this so much easier to deal with.So, maybe what I'm saying is that this is a perfectly acceptable hanger- but that its harder to deal with then it should be.
B0000DI84D As an avid gardener with a deer problem, most of my plants are in hanging baskets and I was really hoping this flower pot holder would expand the possible places that I could use for more new plants.However with the rather limited ability to adjust the support of this flower pot holder, I quickly found that I would actually have to buy some lumber and add a wider board to either my fence or my house to accomidate the CobraCo holder.The package states to use the short end of the enclosed L shaped clasp for 2 to 4 inch railings,but actually it will not go below 2 and 2/4 inches, so the claim of wood top railings up to2 and 3/4 inches is actually incorrect, this flower pot holder will not fit on anything smaller than2 3/4 inches.Of course, now that I know that, I had to reconsider where to put it as my fence railingsare the standard 2 inch wide boards that are actually 1 1/2 in (38 mm) wide. Dimensional lumbersizes are calculated from the size of the green wood, which shrinks as it dries.Recommendation, mixed feelings here, if you have a deck with wide enough railings, this would work well, but for most fences it would not work.
B0000DI84D This is a substantial, yet almost invisible pot holder. Come to think of it, though, I have a light pot and plant in it; if I had this attached to a railing on a second story or higher railing, I would think twice about placing a heavy pot in it for fear that it might break and fall. I like it fine on our first floor railing.The nuts to adjust the holder could be better. I would suggest using stainless steel wing nuts--or even plastic with brass thread insert knobs--to replace the acorn nuts. Even with those changes, this is still a reasonably-priced plant pot holder.
B0000DI84D This is a simple sturdy product that works.  It is holding a potted Geranium easily on my porch railing.This is easy to put together. When you hang this on a railing the flower pot holder is held securely thanks to two brackets and a bottom overhang.There are three screws on each side of the top of the flower pot holder.  There are two brackets that the screws hold.  On the bottom of the flower pot holder there is a four and a half inch by two and a half inch overhang on the back of the holder. The brackets and the bottom overhang secure the flower pot holder in place.The instructions say this will work on iron, aluminum and wood top railings up to 2 3/4 and wooded 2x4 and 2x6 railings.  It fits up to 10 inch pots.This is sturdy and seems like it is made to last.
B0000DI84D This is a very handy and attractive pant holder. Most of all, it is so easy to install, and if I decide to move it to another location, also very easy. Right now it's holding my pot of blooming daffodils of my front porch railing. I also like the fact that it's made in the USA.
B0000DI84D This adjustable flower pot is very easy to use. Just attach the L shaped brackets depending on the width of what you are hanging it on. It is best on something like a deck railing as the top of this will be about level with the top of the railing so most what you will see is the plant. It could be used on a fence too but may be a bit too high.
B0000DI84D This is well made, functional, easy to install, and seemingly durable.  It was a perfect addition to our deck.  We love the way it looks and are very happy with the quality and design.
B0000DI84D I really like this Flower Pot Holder.  It fits great on the railing that leads down my back steps.  It was quick and easy to set-up and it's a really nice quality.  It holds my flower pots really well.  It's nice, simple & basic.Having just one of these seems odd.  I would definitely recommend getting yourself a set.  I think they would look better if you had 2 spaced out just a little bit from each other.I like this Flower Pot Holder and I would recommend it.
B0000DI84D Cobra's 10-inch adjustable flower pot works well for those who would like a pot that can mount to their deck or patio railing and hold a pot up to 10-inches in diameter at the top (and 7 inches in diameter at the base). The adjustable railing brackets have screw/bolt combinations that will accommodate railing widths between 2 and 6 inches. The pot is simple to adjust, install, and use. It will accommodate plastic, wood, metal, or clay pots as long as the dimensions are correct. The neutral black color works well anywhere.
B0000DI84D On the product label it says this pot holder is \"for decks, balconies and fences\".  The planter has U shaped brackets that are designed to slip over a flat 2x4 or 4x4 or 2x6 railing, but this design doesn't work on a privacy fence.  My fence has no top mounted 2x4 so there is no place to hook the bracket.  I even tried screwing the brackets into the fence's 4x4 post, but the pot's brackets are 4 1/2\" apart so that didn't work either.In the end I just hung the pot on the wooden support of glider/swing that I have on the patio.  Not exactly where I wanted the pot holder, but an okay place I guess.
B0000DI84D I am thoroughly enjoying this plant holder.  It fits perfectly over our metal balcony railing in our rental.  Only time will tell is there will any rusting and peeling issues as I have encountered before with products of this nature.
B0000DINGG Bought this to catch a little mouse that's taken up residence in our garage.  Didn't even know he was THERE until I put a plant that needed repotting out in the garage for a day till I could get around to repotting it.  The next day, my plant was GONE (eaten) and there was dirt on the floor from the animal's digging.What to do?  NO WAY am I going to set a conventional mousetrap and kill a mouse and then empty the trap.  Nope. Not happening.I remembered seeing these at Amazon & ordered it.  Set the trap the day after I got it & CAUGHT the little guy within about 4 hours of setting it (I checked the trap hourly; used 2 kibbles of dry cat food for bait).He was pretty nervous, so I covered the trap with a paper towel while I carried him out to a hedgerow, where I set him free (instructions said to minimize human contact so as to not stress the animal--I agree).  Having read another reviewer's experience of a frightened mouse running up their arm, I planned ahead & put the trap in the hedgerow, on the ground, pointed so that no matter which direction he ran, it wouldn't be toward me.  Then I just took off the paper towel & pressed down on the main trigger so both doors opened simultaneously.  My little guy cautiously poked his nose out of the trap, took a couple of sniffs of air, & bolted like a shot.Trap quality is excellent and it's very easy to set, once you get the \"hang\" of it.  Just press down on the main trigger arm, make sure your 2 locking arms for the doors are positioned at the tops of the doors, bait the pivoting bait bar inside, then position the \"baiting bar\" over your \"main trigger\" bars.  Easier than it sounds; you'll get printed instructions & photos in the box.Highly recommended!  And it will make you feel good to use a compassionate solution to your mouse problem.Have a question?  Leave a comment & I'll be happy to help you if I can.---------------------------UPDATE 9/22/13 Evening:  Uh-oh.  On a lark, I re-set the trap this afternoon.  Just checked it 10 minutes ago.  I caught ANOTHER one (smaller).  Let her go & set the trap AGAIN.  How many might we have?  We'll see...UPDATED UPDATE 9/24/13:  OK.  I did not know we had mice in the garage. Thanks to this trap, I've caught and released FOUR (Mama, Papa, & 2 cute babies).  The trap's been set all day today & no takers, so maybe that was the extent of the family. I've learned one other tip:  set the trap during the DAY so you can release during DAYLIGHT.  Unless you don't mind setting mice free IN THE DARK.  Personally, I can't bear to leave them caged once I've caught them, so I like to release as soon as they're caught. GREAT SYSTEM; most highly recommended for its utility and ease of use!UPDATE #3 10/12/13:  GUESS WHAT?  Mice can run LOTS faster than humans can walk.  I'd re-set the trap yesterday afternoon & didn't catch anything.  Till 10:30 at NIGHT.  Remember my advice about not setting the trap after dark?  I didn't (remember).  I should have sprung the trap at dark.  But I didn't.  So when I did one last check of the trap last night---SURPRISE!---I caught another one!  And since it was late and very dark, I decided to just let him go in the front yard.  Oops.  He ran through the yard, down the driveway, and back into the garage before I could walk even 5 paces.  Learn from me : )  DON'T DO THAT. Because, now I have to deal with a EDUCATED MOUSE.  One who, having returned to the garage, now realizes the trap is a TRAP.  I may have to upgrade my bait; time will tell : )I still most highly recommend this mouse trap--it works!
B0000DINGG I bought this simply because of the reputation Havahart has. The other Havahart traps I own, like the 1025, is of top quality and made to last a lifetime. When comparing the two, it's as though they weren't even built by the same company.  This model is simply a joke. The sides are so uneven I had to bend them in so that the doors would close without leaving a gaping escape hole. I also had to bend the hatch bars because they would not fall into the fasteners when the hatch was triggered. I did catch one mouse, but without my straightening of the unit it would not have even been functional. (Note to owners...you really need to read the instructions on how to adjust the sensitivity before you say it doesn't work.) That makes this unit NOT ready to use right out of the box.Other notes...There is no handle so you must be careful how you handle it so you don't get bit by the rodent. The top corners are also razor sharp and you need to be careful not to get stabbed. The corners should have been rounded off for the extra $.10 in cost.It is important to note that all traps must be cleaned with with bleach and then soap after a catch. The urine and feces detracts other animals since they consider the trap \"marked\". Based on that point, it is also important to know that cleaning this unit is painful as the windows are unfinished and act as a cheese grader on your hands. Once again, a few pennies should have been spent to finish off the rough edgesHavahart's build quality with this model is pretty disgraceful. I wish the company would have thought twice before they permitted this cost-cutting AND let their quality control go down the drain.
B0000DINGG I've owned six different types of rodent traps. This one has been the most consistent. It has even caught two birds! (birds were surprised, but uninjured and released healthy) We have have many species of rodents around our house, but only two create a health problem or damage problem.  This trap humanely captures all of them, and allows us to release the non-harmful rodents uninjured.  The harmful rodents can then be euthanized humanely. This is the most humane and effective process for small animals I've found so far. Yes, the trap can trip from strong winds, and yes it can be tripped without a catch. It's also a one-shot deal so you get one animal per setting. We can live with this - nothing is perfect. The trap can be a little frustrating to set if you've had too much coffee as well, but you get the hang of it.Update 7/10/12Be careful not to get the \"Grips\" livetrap which is a knock off of Havahart. The trigger wire does not have a flat spot which makes it very difficult to set and it trips without trapping frequently. Grips also appears to fall apart easily.  The Havaharts have been catching mice, voles, chipmunks and ground squirrels more effectively than any other trap.  Is also completely humane. We're only after the mice and voles (they damage things) so we let the others go without injury. CHECK YOUR TRAPS OFTEN or these become quite IN-humane.
B0000DINGG We left a bag of cat food in the garage a few weeks ago and when we went to use it, found a hole in the bag and clear evidence around the bag that a mouse had done the deed (think about that one for a minute and you'll know what I mean).We bought this trap and caught one mouse the first night and a second mouse the day after. We used peanut butter as our bait and it seemed to do the trick.Getting my hand inside to bait the trap was a tight fit (it's a small trap). Plus, the trap triggers easily so getting it right the first time was impossible - every time I put it down, it triggered itself. It took a few tries but eventually, I was able to set it and put it down on the garage floor without the doors slamming shut.Getting the mouse out was another challenge. First, a mouse poops a lot and since they can't get a hall pass and use the restroom, well, it's pretty unappealing to have to deal with the trap. I put the trap in a box, hauled it to the woods and shook the mouse out - uninjured, of course.Cleaning out the trap was the final step - I hosed it out with a garden hose.It's a simple, cheap and humane way to catch and remove a pest. It is a bit tricky to set and bait but the end result is a live mouse outside the garage. Win/Win!
B0000DINGG Havahart 1020 - Small rodentsI have a larger Havahart from about 20-25 years ago that works to this day and is able to catch squirrels without any difficulty. The wire mesh on that model is too big for small field mice, so I bought this 1020 to hopefully catch some of these smaller mice and rats. They tend to crawl into my engine compartment and store seeds or other rubbish.The 1020 is quite small and light weight. Its construction isn't very good, everything seems thinner and lighter than the older design. The bait tray is easily sprung. A gust of wind will set it off, and it renders it useless in windy conditions outside. Understandably, a field mouse is going to be quite light so a heavier trap may not spring when the mouse touches the tray. Unfortunately, this also makes the 1020 very touchy. I recommend using it indoors or in a covered area close to the suspected location of the critters.Overall: 4/5 stars, the construction could be better, but time will tell
B0000DINGG These work perfecctly - they are a bit sensitive to set but these are trapping at least a mouse a day in my garage.
B0000DINGG After months of battling a pesky mouse situation we actually NAMED our lil wild friend after he dashed across my foot one night during a trip to the bathroom...!! This trap succeeded in humanely capturing one Mr. Bo Jangles so he could be relocated to a nearby field!!After reading numerous reviews of various humane traps here on Amazon, I finally settled on this trap and the metal 12 catch mousetrapJ.T. EATON 421CL \"REPEATER\" MULTIPLE CATCH MOUSE TRAP.  I'll admit, once these traps arrived I was really impressed with the multi-catch trap which APPEARS to a very awesome trap and was VERY easy to bait! Mr. Bo Jangles never ventured anywhere near the multi-catch trap,, perhaps the strong stench of machine oil present... thankfully the Havahart trap did not have the offensive odor.  Additionally I had to modify the Multi-catch trap as it would have easily released any entrapped mouse with a simple nose press on the upper lid...The Havaheart trap looked weak and appeared difficult to set, I seriously had doubts initially.  I admit I played with the trap awhile and made a number of minor adjustments to the trap before baiting it with a piece of Granola Bar which I \"glued\" to the bait table with a nice chunk of peanut butter.  Once baited, I found a quiet closet in which Bo Jangles had previously been spotted and set it in the middle of the closet floor. AFTER setting the trap in place and being sure this was \"the place\" did I attempt to actually set the previously baited trap.I gave this Havahart trap a 5 star rating despite the written instructions being less than ideal since it caught our lil friend in less than a week.  Just play with the trap awhile and understand how it works before relying on it to catch your mice.  Also understand that it may need a few minor adjustments due to being bounced around in shipping.I wish to thank the Reviewer who provided sane advice for a wise method for releasing the trapped mouse.  As a reminder, when releasing the mouse open the door that is AWAY from you!!  In our case, I took the trap to a local field along with a reliable stick.  I set the trap in the field and used the stick to gently remove the door lock of the door AWAY from me thereby allowing the mouse to nose his way through door.  Using the stick I had to gently move the trap over on the side to allow the mouse an easier time of releasing itself from the trap but at least I didn't have a mouse running up my coat sleeve!! ;-)
B0000DINGG I previously rated the Kness Tip Trap, so there is more info.there.  This trap looks good and should work, but it didn't catch any mice.  Setting the trap doors is a little tricky.
B0000DINGG I've had success corralling the little buggers with the two-dollar Tip Trap and the pricier Smart Mouse House, but they catch only one mouse at a time, and I have yet to find a plastic trap that, after the 3rd or 4th use, the critter hasn't gnawed his way out of (my mice chew through plastic like it was cheese).  On the other hand, this Havahart device frankly befuddles me (maybe the mouse as well).  If I had a couple of hours to devote to it, I might be to figure out how to set the matrix of wires \"just so\" for both ends of the trap to spring shut (why 2 ends?).  I've got enough time to take the little creatures on Sunday drives into the country, but getting the hang of this gadget is beyond my skills and/or patience.  If you consider yourself a \"pro\" with a heart, maybe this'll pan out.  I'm returning mine and going with another fragile, plastic green \"crack house.\"  (It works quite well for the first 2-3 weeks, before the mouse has ripped it to shreds.)
B0000DINGG I have a couple of the larger Havahart traps and swear by them.  Those are solid, well-built, and foolproof.  This model is exactly the same as their larger 2-door trap, just shrunk down.  Unfortunately, everything fits together very loosely, which makes it tricky to set the trap, and much too easy to trip.  The \"U\"-shaped bars which lock the doors down have a tendency to fall out.  The long bars attached to the doors, which hook to the trigger, also fit very loosely.  Setting the bars onto the trigger involves taking two cylindrical pieces of metal, about the size and shape of the point of a ball-point pen, and balancing one on top of the other.  This is trickier than it should be, and the slightest jar will trigger the trap.  It helps if you take a large pliers, or set of channel locks, and flatten the ends a bit so they will stay mated better.  A strong wind can set this off, and a storm certainly will, making these unsuitable for outdoor use.  Note also that a man-size hand won't fit inside this trap, so you will have to carefully toss the bait in and hope it lands on the trigger, or keep trying until it does.  There is no handle, so you need to be careful about where you hold a filled trap to avoid getting bit.  You can make these work inside, but be prepared for some aggravation.  Overall a disappointing product.
B0000DINGG This trap worked great and caught the mouse the first night I put it out. I was then able to release it easily in a nearby field. I have tried many other catch and release traps and the Havahart models seem to always work the best for me. I have used them to catch mostly mice and voles, but I would imagine they all work just as good for catch and release pest control.
B0000VUNBA I just bought an emergency back-up generator.  It's just like a snow thrower.  It you buy it, you probably will never need it and it becomes another gas-fired device that needs maintenance.  Unfortunately, we need both.  Ocassional power outages and significant snow storms here in Maryland do happen.  Even though we hopefully will never have another 40&#34; monster storm like the one a few winters ago, we do have frequent violent storms enough to justify the generator and I just about wore out my snow thrower on that one storm alone.  I think we're do for more.  Hence the generator cover.
B0000VUNBA Bought this for my 10KW Generac portable generator, and it does the job. Covers the engine and generator, and if you're patient, you can even leave the handles exposed through the corner slits in the cover. Seems adequately strong with well-sewn seams - should last a long time, and it'll keep my generator warm and dry over the winter.Definitely recommended for any large portable generator.
B0000VUNBA This generator cover is superb in every fashion.  It fits my largest generator; easy on and off.  I will be purchasing another for second generator in a different State.
B0000VUNBA My fault, I should have ordered the next size up. The description was not that accurate.The openings for the generator handles leave much space for snow to pass through.
B0000VUNBA Fits the champion 41135 generator just fine and seems like its good quality and will last through weather and storms.
B0000VUNBA The cover is thin and not as durable as it looks in the photo or as described 'heavy duty'.  There are two holes for the handles if your generator has one.  Not totally comfortable putting the generator outside or even covered shed.  Better to leave it in closed shed.
B0000VUNBA This thing covers my generator just fine. It shows no sign of wear or coming apart after using it for months.
B00013BUW8 The storage seat comes as six heavy duty plastic panels that snap together.  Once assembled it is strong and sturdy.  The lid/seat is hinged and overlaps the box so rain is kept out.  The bottom is raised on short legs which also helps keep out moisture.We use it to hold a large bag of charcoal, lighter fluid, and a small fire extinguisher.  All the things necessary for a successful barbecue.UPDATE 7/8/11 - Over a year later and the storage seat is still going strong.  One thing has changed though.  We've gave up using lighter fluid and are instead using aWeber 87886 Chimney Starter.  It works perfectly and there's no \"lighter fluid\" smell.UPDATE 10/25/26 - A few more summers past and the storage seat continues to do it's job.  In fact, our first few barbecues each spring use the charcoal that's been outside sitting in and protected by the seat all winter with no problems.BTW, I feel that honest, effective reviews take the place of first-hand experiences that are lacking in online shopping. I've always appreciated the help I've gotten from other reviewers and continue to return the favor as best as I can.
B00013BUW8 I use it on my front porch for my deliveries. works perfect. if it gets dirty, a little rince from the hose and all is good.
B00013BUW8 When I was looking for a nice storage box for my front porch -- I ordered this product based on the other reviews.  They were right!  It WAS easy to put together.  Less than 2 minutes, no tools, no kidding.  It's very sturdy and doubles as overflow seating when necessary.  Very handy.  I even went back and ordered the larger one.  One note on the color:  It's more of a light taupe than the whiteish tone you see in the picture.  No matter. I highly recommend it.
B00013BUW8 It took all of 5 minutes to assemble except for the top. That took about 4 more minutes to figure out. This product literally snaps together - no tools needed except for the top which they claim just snaps on like the other pieces. Maybe if your a body builder you have the strength to bend the tab by hand but I couldn't.There is a simple solution - after sliding the right side hinge into place - use a medium sized flat blade screw-driver inserted between the tab and the hinge and carefully bend the hinge back toward the right and slide the hinge over the tab and your done.I doubt that if left out in a heavy rain-it would be water tight - but that is not an issue for me since I am using it to store ceramic & stainless steel accessories for my Ceramic Egg Grill/Smoker.
B00013BUW8 This came screamingly fast, and I don't even use the two day shipping option.  I put it together in about five minutes, after I figured out how to attach the lid.  It seems fairly sturdy, but I'm about 175 pounds, and I'm not sure about sitting on it, but I put a cushion on top, and the cat will probably sleep there.  Some time ago I purchased a larger patio storage container which my husband immediately took over for storing the pool chemicals.  This made me reluctant to store the patio cushions in it, which was the reason that I had purchased it.  Recently Amazon put this one on sale with with super saver shipping.  My husband liked the idea of having this container solely for the pool chemicals, and so did I.  This one will hold a large tub of chlorine tablets, plus two half gallon containers that hold liquid, and his pool testing box, with room to spare. I now have the larger one back for my cushions and pool floats, so everyone is happy.  August 28, 2007 postscript:  I put a cushion on this, and my husband, who weighs 205 pounds, sat on this without causing a problem, so it's more sturdy than I thought.
B00013BUW8 This is a really easy to assemble box that is just right for my gardening supplies. We have it on the front balcony of our floating home. It looks just fine and doesn't detract from the look of the front of our house, which is in a high traffic tourist area so we try to keep it looking nice. So far it's been rain proof and has worked out really well. I recommend it for anyone needing a bit of storage in a smaller outdoor space.
B00013BUW8 Makes a great little seat, keeps the contents dry. I store a 5gal bucket in here with my grilling tools and it fits perfectly with some room to the side for other stuff. This is great for us on our small balcony since it is both a seat and storage. It is sturdy enough to stand on, and it keeps the weather out well. Great value!
B00013BUW8 I use this to keep some gardening tools and a soccer ball in for easy access. Works well, and supports my 250lbs just fine as well. Keeps contents dry so far.
B00013BUW8 I bought this storage product to keep rock salt in this winter. It arrived today and I had it assembled in just a few minutes. Although they say no tools are necessary for assembly, and while it might be true for a strong man who can get that second hinge to seat properly, it wasn't true for me. I had to use a flat-head screwdriver to pry the final hook over far enough so it could snap back and catch the hinge (when you have the instructions in front of you, you'll know what I mean). It was no big deal to do that. I just want to point out that weaker people may need to resort to using a prying tool.The storage bin seems to be well-engineered for easy assembly (other than that one pesky hinge!) and ideal for standing up to whatever weather Mother Nature dishes out. For me, it arrived just in time because later tonight I'll be outside shoveling the walks and then putting down salt.Bottom line: It's nice to find an economical product that does what it's supposed to do, especially when it also manages not to be an eyesore.Update a year or so later: The lid has developed a bit of a warp or twist making it unable to close fully (there's a narrow strip of empty space when the lid is down, showing that it isn't all the way down where it needs to be to rest on the edge of the container). For my use, that's not a big deal, but it would have been better if that change hadn't taken place. For that reason, I'm taking a star off what was originally a 5-star review.
B00013BUW8 I bought this to store bird seeds on the front porch. It's the perfect size to hold a variety of seeds with room for suet cakes and hummingbird nectar. The piece snaps together easily but securely. You may need a rubber mallet to get the top on but it's worth it. The best part ... it's made in the U.S.
B00013BUW8 I bought a Suncast SS1000 Storage Seat to place out back to hold the bags of dog treats I always have out there. I had considered getting a plastic storage bin to keep birds and rain out of the treats but this is a much nicer solution!It's roomy enough to hold at least three 5 to 10 lb bags of dog biscuits, and it keeps them nice and dry and safe from other critters.It require no tools to assemble, and went together in less than a minute. The lid is hinged and lifts easily, and when closed it slightly overlaps the base to keep rain out.I have a Suncast deck box which has stood up to the elements for a couple years now and still looks great (no easy trick here in the Arizona desert) so there's no doubt this storage seat will do the same.Although I use mine for dog treats, you could easily use it to store garden tools, a hose, toys, pool supplies, or anything you'd like.I'm pleased with it and give it two thumbs up.
B0001AUF8G We try to keep unused containers stored upside down to prevent standing water that leads to mosquitoes breeding.However, my garden area consists of raised beds and earthboxes around the perimeter.  The earthboxes have reservoirs that hold water and mosquitoes often breed in them, leading to a garden full of mosquitoes.It really helps to drop some Mosquito Bits into the fill tube of each earthbox during the season.  I have a few other large containers that have attached saucers that fill with water.  They get some bits added too.This product works well.  A container lasts for quite awhile and makes it much easier to be in the garden and yard.
B0001AUF8G To be honest, I actually purchased this product for fungus gnats in my houseplants from the potting soil and not for mosquitoes outside.  I've been using a product called Gnatrol -Gnatrol WDG - 60 grams(which Amazon used to sell) but ran out of it. Needing a quick fix, it's commonly known that mosquito dunks/pellets contain the same active ingredient in Gnatrol (the BTI bacteria).I bought this because my herb garden I started had an infestation from a newly purchased bag of potting soil. From the herb garden, the infestation of gnats slowly started migrating to my other houseplants. I thought I could take care of them all with this product, but the warnings on the package says to keep away from food sources and to not ingest it. So using it on my herb garden was a chance I didn't want to take.I ended up using this just for my house plants and I can attest the fact that it does work on killing fungus gnat larva. However, the reason I give it 4 stars is because you can't use it on indoor edible plants (like my herb garden).Luckily, Amazon started selling Gnatrol again so I ended up buying another container (which is actually safe for vegetables/crops/edibles). So now rather than using all my gnatrol on vegetables/herbs/houseplants alike, I can save money by using Gnatrol on my edibles and these mosquito bits on my decorative houseplants.
B0001AUF8G We have skeeters terrible down here in Texas. When it rains sometimes we get these standing water holes and I sprinkle this in them and it seems to help. Non toxic makes it the only way to go as well.
B0001AUF8G I'm on my 3rd bottle of this in the last four years.  It works very well.  I can treat standing water in a variety of scenarios.  Dosage is dependent on surface area not volume of water.  The active ingredient is toxic only to mosquito larvae so pets and wildlife are unaffected.  I collect a lot of rainwater and couldn't do without this product, now.
B0001AUF8G I've used these for years in water gardens around my yard and they work very well and do not hurt the birds or any other animal as far as I can tell.  If you look into a water feature and see something wriggling that look like small shrimp, you need these as those are mosquito larva.
B0001AUF8G I have a lot of aquatic plants outside and was worried about the pots becoming a mosquito breeding ground.  I sprinkled this in the pots and haven't seen any little squirmies.  The bits are the best way for me too go as I didn't need a whole &#34;dunk&#34; for each pot and that would end up being expensive.  I also sprinkled these bits in an area where I found some water had leaked leaving a temporary swamp.  No skeeters there either.
B0001AUF8G Not what I expected.  This is to be added in sitting water.  My mistake.  I thought it was a dry type of killer feed.
B0001AUF8G This is one of many products in our arsenal to keep the nasty biters in control.  We reapply every couple of weeks or after a typical TX. downpour into drains, wet areas in our yard.  Even when we run the sprinkler system, it's still lasts a couple of weeks-and you don't need to use alot. It works really well.
B0001IOYX0 Although I have read reviews about woman appreciating the size, as a man I also have small hand. Although I usually work with much larger tools, it is great to have pruners that fit exactly in my hands. These pruners are light which means I can now work for a longer period without hand fatigue. And lastly these are professional, well made, \"last for life\" pruners.
B0001IOYX0 First off, these cut WAY better than any other shears I own.  Friskars seem like children's safety scissors by comparison.  They cut through dead thick woody canes with ridiculous ease.  My only complaint is that they are meant for small MENS hands, not women's hands.I have average sized lady's hands.  Typical caucasian size, I guess size small glove and a size 5 ring. These clippers are still almost too big to keep a grip on when you open the blades.  Essentially, if you hold your hands as if to grip imaginary clippers, as wide as you can, if this gap measures less than 4&#34;, there is no way you're going to be able to open/close these clippers fully with gloves on.  They barely fit my hands bare, and with gardening gloves, I have to adjust my grip so my middle, longer, finger is doing the closing action.  My index finger is too short to wrap around the handle without sliding off.  The handles are not especially grippy, they're smooth rubber.  So, unless they are small enough for your fingers to really wrap around them solidly, you will have to adjust your grip awkwardly.
B0001IOYX0 I returned this pruner. The latch is very difficult to turn. Once open, the pruner works smoothly. I'm a small-ish man and I found the grip comfortable enough. But - I bought a Fiskar pruner for half the price and it works fine. It seems made for two grip positions, depending on whether you have large or small hands. Any, this is probably a good, albeit expensive, pruner - if you want to spend the afternoon with WD-40 working the latch loose.
B0001IOYX0 After 50 years of gardening I have yet to find better quality pruners. This model is great for small or arthritic hands. Very sharp. All parts replaceable although not inexpensive.
B0001IOYX0 I have owned and used dozens of pruners, some cheap, some expensive, but none better than my Felco pruners!  Actually, by spending a bit more I have saved quite a lot of money.  My first pairs were my grandmothers.  I have no idea how old they were but it must have been over twenty five years.  They were as good as new.  I live in a house in the country and we keep almost seven acres park-like with flower gardens, fruit trees, grapes and the like.  It is a very large task keeping this place up between the two of us.  I did purchase the F-6 as my hands are rather small; strong, but alas small and I found these to fit them better.  My old set from my grandmother are larger and after several hours do tire my hands.These are well made and perfectly balanced and their cutting power is tremendous.  I have owned several of the cheap pruners and they last maybe one season.  I have no doubt that I will be using this new pair for quite a number of years to come.  As has been pointed out in other review, there are a lot of look-a-likes available and are quite inexpensive.  Don't be taken by this.  Look for the brand and go ahead and spend the extra dollars.  They are worth every penny and will save money in the long run.I am, I promise you, extremely picky about my gardening tools and yard care tools.  I put them to work!  I have been more than satisfied with these pruners and have no doubt that I will purchase another if the need should ever arise.
B0001LEPYA For every soil sample I tested this powder with, it indicated it was 7.5 ph.  I even tried some of my almost pure peat mix in it and it said it was 7.5, which is the highest the meter will go so I'm assuming it's just bad powder.  I tested the same soil in the other compartment with my liquid ph tester (also bought on here, good stuff), and it showed the real PH values (5.0 for my peat mix), 6.5 for my other regular soil.  So it gets to keep a star because I'll use the container for testing with my liquid ph tester.
B0001LEPYA I bought this to test the pH of my blueberry soil that I have in half wine barrels. I used 1/3 pine bark mulch, 1/3 sphagnum peat moss, and 1/3 organic potting soil. I mixed it all up well and checked the pH a few weeks later. This quick little kit gave me indication I was at around a 6. I wanted to drop it a bit further so I added some organic acid fertilizer, waited close to 2 months and rechecked. My soil is now around 4.5 to 5. The blueberry bushes love it and they are green (not red and yellow now), growing fast, and have tons of flowers!+ Water Dropper Included+ Simple Instructions+ No Mess+ Consistent Results+ Takes about 2-3 minutes to take a sample and get a reading+ Small Booklet providing details of many different plants, vegetables, and flowers and the soil pH they grow best in_Bottom Line_ Yes, I would recommend this pH kit over other products, such as a soil probe. In my experience this is the fastest, most consistent, easiest way to get an accurate idea of what the pH is. This kit really helped me get my blueberry bushes up and going and I will continue to use the test kit to monitor my soil pH.
B0001LEPYA Soil from different areas of the yard test a bit differently, and I got repeat results. This would indicate the tests are at least consistent and sensitive enough to be of use. I'm happy to at least have a good idea of the soil and don't have to worry that it is way off. Since a couple of fruit trees were not so hot, I wondered about that. As it turns out, all my areas are a bit acidic, so I amended the soil and hope for good results.What people say about the small capsules is true. Pretty darn tiny and probably very difficult for many people to use without spilling. What would bigger capsules cost?  Nothing probably.Five stars if it would also kill gophers and weeds.
B0001LEPYA Inexpensive, this kit consists of ten single use tablets.  Instructions are clear and the contents -- a vial, ten test tablets and an eye dropper for water -- are well-designed.  For the price, it provided me peace of mind on my growing conditions and prevented me from pH conditioning the soil where it did not need conditioning.On the downside, readings are not precise.  You'll get a good idea of the general soil pH within a .5 reading, but nothing specific.  That's probably okay, however.  Most times soil conditions are not exact from place to place anyhow and a general idea is what most of us need.
B0001LEPYA It's not a difficult task to assess your soil type.  Just moistening it and checking out how it molds and feels in your hands will easily tell you whether it is sandy, silty, or clay-like.  However, you can't check out its pH level of acidity or alkalinity just by looking at it or holding it in your hands.  For example, if you are planning a strawberry bed, an optimal pH level would be 6.0 to 7.0.  On the other hand if you want carrots, an optimal pH level would be 5.0 to 6.0.The rapitest pH soil tester is not unlike many others on the market, but is a good one.  It comes with ten pH capsules, a dropper, full directions as to how to use them (very simple), and  a color chart to compare your results.  The pH level chart ranges from pH level 4.5 (very acid) to pH 7.5 (alkaline).When you test your soil, make sure that you use distilled water as tap water can skew your results.  This little kit is quick and easy and will help you decide not only what to plant in a particular location, what nutrients you need to add to the soil according to the pH, and enable you to gauge the health of your plants throughout the growing season.  The best time to use this inexpensive kit would be in the spring and after harvest time.
B0001LEPYA It is a very simple yet effective test when someone needs to know the ph of soil (outside for the most part).The ONLY CON i have with this test is the pill capsules filled with the reactive powder which in the end is the catalyst for the color. You do need ph'd water or a very distilled water to test your soil with. If you use tap, you are taking the chance of an off reading due to the ph of your tap water. For the price and complexity it is well worth it. Not a perfect 5 stars but 4 is an understatement.
B0001LEPYA No only is this little soil pH tester include easy to follow and use instructions, but it also includes a fantastic guide for what pH level is ideal for growing a vast list of vegetables, flowers, trees, shrubs and grasses. I love this guide so much I'm laminating it! This tester has been priceless for preparing my raised vegetable beds and getting the pH just right for each bed's corresponding planting.
B0001LEPYA I had been using this kit til I looked on amazon for refills and found none. I didn't want to buy another kit so I researched test strips. The test strips work the same and are waaay cheaper. I'm using my container that came in this kit but a cup to mix soil and water in would work just fine.
B0001LEPYA It works and is more reliable than a test probe thingy provided you follow the instructions. These have been the standard for years and you can't go wrong if you do it right. This can mean three tests per area to be tested but you will know for sure. It only tests PH. If you want to know more get a more complex test.Robs Rating:Fiddly but it works.
B0001Q2EMA I love this hedge trimmer!  I have a fair number of bushes and hedges that need trimming, but always hated having to trim them mainly becuase of the tools.  I had a corded model (also a B&D;) that cut very well, but the cord was always a real pain -- it always got snagged on something, and I ended up spending more time dealing with the cord than actually trimming. Looked into a gas model, but the weight was an issue, as well as the noise.The cordless B&D; is a fantastic tool! It lets you concentrate on the trimming. Ready to go in a second (no cord to unwind and plug in) and the battery lasts a decent interval. No, it's not an everlasting battery that will run for hours, but that's an easy problem to solve -- just get a second battery so if the first one gives up before you're done, you just pop in another.Nicely balanced and easy to handle. Highly recommend!!
B0001Q2EMA Great product!!  Works great. I have trimmed many hedges with this little machine, and it holds it's charge throughout the job. Not too heavy, and easy to maneuver. Very pleased I bought it.
B0001Q2EMA This cordless trimmer has plenty of power and makes short work of bushes and shrubs around my house.  Uses the same 18V battery as my B&D; drill, so it's nice to have a spare if I need it.  First time I used it, I went out planning to spend 5 minutes or so trying it out.  Instead, I was outside over 45 minutes and got most of my trimming done.  I've never used a corded trimmer, but I can imagine how much trouble it would be to deal with the cord.  This is quick and easy.I think the main thing about a battery operated hedge trimmer is that you need to take care of the battery.  Keep the battery in a moderate temperature environment (don't leave it in your freezing garage or storage building), and keep it charged.  If the trimmer doesn't run for long right out of the box, you probably have a defective battery.
B0001Q2EMA I don't have a lot of hedges but I'm pretty sure one battery could get thru most tract-home sized yards with no problem.  It cuts well, light & easy to use, isn't terrible on battery use.  I've had this a couple years, still no problems at all.
B0001Q2EMA I bought the B&D Cordless Hedge trimmer a few weeks ago based on the comments made by the people here in the reviews.  I am very pleased with my purchase. I found the power to be adequate for trimming shrubs around the yard. I didn't find the weight a problem as did some who reviewed it. The safety lock is an inconvenience. As some did, I fixed it to where it would stay in the locked position. It makes a big difference. Time will tell how the batteries will hold up. So far I have no complaints. I would recommend this trimmer
B0001Q2EMA Makes the job a lot easier. Used to have to run 100' of extension cord from the garage then wrestle it around like an Anaconda all over the yard. Cord would come unplugged and I had to constantly be on my toes to not cut across the cord.Cuts a nice even line right where I want it and it has reduced the time I spend messing with yard work.
B0001Q2EMK I've been using the cordless broom since April and am very pleased with it. In the past, after mowing I would drag out a broom to sweep and clean up the sidewalk. It also serves to clean off grass and leaves from my mower...again I had used a broom on that too. I keep the batteries at the ready and so far haven't needed both during one session, but like knowing I have a back up. It has really been a big help.
B0001Q2EMK I love this little blower!  I can grab it at a moment's notice and blow the leaves, pine needles, and other debris out of my courtyard.  SOOO much easier than dragging out the corded electric blower for quick light jobs!  Fits my \"girl hands\" nicely, not too heavy, not too noisy, lasts about 15 minutes.  For the big jobs, I'll still get out the \"monster\" electric blower that works like a hurricane coming through, but with this little guy I find myself blowing leaves and stuff frequently now, instead of dreading getting out the big one for a small job.  I'm going to look at the other items they make that uses the same battery pack too.
B0001Q2EMK I know most will not believe this and it is likely Black & Decker may not either but prior to owning this Electric Broom or smooth surface sweeper as it is called I owned the B & D Sweepstick you may never have seen one but it was a surface blower unit not much noise but good clearing action. The batteries were not renewable all was built in and you simply plugged one end of the charger to a wall recepticle and the other end into the tool and kept it there  when not in use. That Sweepstick lasted for over 20 years I don'r have to worry about this one lasting that long cause I won't but the new one I just purchased does as well as the last one I had  and that is all I can ask for. It won't blow the shingles off the roof but is plenty strong enough for driveways,walkways, porches and decks. I use it for blowing out the garage as well and it has no problem doing all of this on one charged battery and has power to spare. I can and do handle the big blowers, string trimmers, chain saws and pole saws but I can say the Black & Decker folks have captured the market in light duty battery operated tools. No messing with gas and oil except to lubricate the blades and just plug and play or work. Thanks to Black & Decker for the tools and to Amazon.com for making them affordable to us older folks.Sincerely,Denny
B0001Q2EMK Purchased as part of the home care package this little blower is great for loose material on hard or semi hard surfaces. While it doesn't have the power of my 230 mph corded one, there is one application where it shines.Even on a low setting the \"high power\" blower will always blow mulch off the beds when trying to clean out leaves and grass from among the scrubs. Getting the cord through all the shrubs is no picnic either.Provided it's dry, this little guy gets in between the bush's, shrubs, plants without blowing all the bedding into the yard, saving a few hours of raking.
B0001Q2EMK I ordered this product to clean bird seed off my back porch. It works if held close to the seed but I don't recommend it. It takes a l o n g time to charge the battery and it does not hold the charge as long as I expected. It is too big for a \"sweeper\". I usually like B&D products but this one, not so much.
B0001Q2EMK I picked up a factory refurbished one of these at a Black & Decker outlet store for less than half the regular Amazon price. I think it's worth having around at that price (three Hamiltons), but I would be really disappointed if I had paid full price for this blower. It's just not that powerful, and the battery life is pretty short. However, it does have its uses, so it has earned a place in my garage.This \"sweeper\" (light-powered blower) is a snap to assemble and is very easy to use. It has two speeds -- on and off. I used it this afternoon to blow off the garage floor and front porch. It handled leaves and dust just fine, but it wasn't useful against cobwebs, which is really what I had hoped to use it for. I guess they are too sticky to be removed effectively by this, so I had to break out the old broom. Oh well.If you can get a good deal on one of these, go for it... especially if you have other Black and Decker products that use the same 18V battery. I have aBlack & Decker GrassHog String Trimmer/Edger(model NST2118), and having an extra battery and charger around for that is handy. But if you weren't already in the B&D; system, and were looking to pay full price, I wouldn't do it.The Black & Decker NS118 is made in China.
B0001Q2EMK This product used to include 2 batteries. But, B&D; has dropped it down to 1. The cost of each battery is around $30 to $35. I found the last one in my local Lowes store that still has 2 batteries. The blowing capability is low, but sufficient for hard surface. The blowing duration with a fresh charged battery is around 15 mins. It's convenient for quick job. I drop 1 point due to its limited power, I drop 1 more point because the included battery is dropped from 2 to 1.*************************************************************New updates....I bought it, tried it and returned it.After one month, I bought it again.....even it comes with 1 battery only.Yes, this cordless blower is weak to effectively blow leaves in the lawn, especially if the leaves are wet. But it indeed is quite capable in blowing leaves on hard surface (like the driveway).While I have no problem using other corded lawn tools, like mower, hedger trimmer, line trimmer, but I found it is very difficult to manuver my corded blower. Specifically, the cord itself is messing up the leaves while I am trying to pile up the leaves with the blower. So, cordless blower is the choice for blowing leaves around driveway, front entrance door. I still use the corded blower for leaves in the lawn due to its much stronger power.This cordless blower is very convenient and effective for light duty tasks like sweeping the driveway, front door area, backyard deck...This package comes with only 1 battery. That's sufficient for about 20 minutes blowing per each charge. So, plan your cleaning job to be done in 20 minutes, or to get a 2nd battery.
B0001Q2EMK I've had this electric broom for about a year. It lacks the power of a corded blower but nonetheless it does the job for me. I use it to clean up the sidewalk and driveway after mowing the lawn or after a windy period leaves a mess. It works great and I can do my front yard and back yard areas on a single battery charge.I wouldn't recommend this for blowing leaves off a lawn as it may not have enough force to make that job easy. I don't own another blower and don't expect to because I don't feel I need to. In the fall when our trees drop their leaves we rake them.We now have four B&D; tools that use the same type of 18V battery. All four batteries are constantly in their charging stations so are always ready for use in any of the four tools. This is a successful design that is flexible for our use.
B0001Q2EMK Still works same as when I first bought it.  It's not a high-powered blower, and it will go thru the battery pretty quick, but if you want to just grab a blower to blow off your patio or driveway without dealing with cords or anything this is great.  I've got a ton of concrete around my front and back yards and two batteries does the trick.  If for some reason I want something really high-powered I will pull out the old corded blower, but it's rare.  My common use is blowing off sidewalks after mowing the grass.
B0001Q2EMK I have another B&D; 18 V product, a tree pruner that only came with one battery.  Amazon has a pretty good price on the battery at 32 bucks, but then I saw this unit which comes with 2 batteries and another charger for 6 bucks more than the cost of two batteries!  So now I have two 18V tools and 3 batteries with 2 chargers so I'll never find myself running out of juice again!  Great Deal!Oh the blower is not advertised as a leaf blower, so don't expect the power of of corded or gas unit. But as others have noted it works great on the deck and patio with low noise and no smell of a gas engine.2010 update - it appears that B&D; now includes only one battery with this unit.  Perhaps they realized it was too good a deal or people were not buying the batteries alone.  That's a shame because I would NOT buy this unit with only one battery.  You need at least two to get any work done, run time is not great and of course worsens as the batteries age.
B0001Q2EMK I love these B&D products.  I have four items that take the same interchangeable battery.  I have the radio charger, and keep the radio plugged in, so the battery is always fully charged.  The broom does a good job keeping my sidewalk/driveway clean, especially after mowing.  It's just so easy to use.
B0001Q2EMK Will do the job of cleaning up after a day of cutting the lawn.Works best on smooth artificial surfaces like walkways, driveways, and garage floors. Will NOT help much with fall cleanup particularly on grass surfaces as it quickly loses power and is underpowered for this kind of work.
B0001Q2EMK You cannot compare this to a corded electric leaf blower, it isn't even marketed for that. It is a great replacement for a broom however and for that it works great.We have a 50 foot porch which is always in need of a sweep after even a light wind. Needles, leaves, pieces of cones always seem to make their way, it is a constant battle. Using a broom takes too much time to do everyday as is taking the time to get out the cord and electric blower which is overkill. This little blower works perfectly. So easy to use I just grab it and flip the switch. I can have the porch clean in about a minute. Works well for the patio and garage too. As a bonus I was recently surprised to find it worked well blowing the needles off our roof, another issue we have to deal with every summer.I have a couple of batteries. I always leave one in the charger, the batteries last a bit longer when I do.If you have a lot of sweeping to do this is a great tool!
B0001Q2EMK Works great although I can tell the battery power doesn't last as long as the trimmers, etc.  For my long driveway I usually bring a second battery along
B0001Q2EMK The purchase from Amazon was flawless; the trimmer was on by front porch within three days of the order placement. Amazing. Be careful opening the box. I got a nasty paper cut in my eagerness to rip off the box top with brute force. Inside the box everything was expertly packaged and protected with egg carton quality cardboard shell.Luckily operating the machine is simple because the direction sheet leaves much to be desired. It displays as many languages as a United Nations guide, but all in small print, all directions overly succinct. What you need to know is on the direction sheet but not necessarily easy to find because of a lack of clarity and organization.The small pictures provided require the use of a magnifying glass. The pictures aren't annotated with text, just numbered sequentially.In the YardWhen one buys a yard toy he doesn't really need, especially one that costs a hundred dollars, expectations and hopes are high. To this reviewer's relief, Black and Decker's cordless trimmer exceeds all expectations and far surpasses any preconceptions of performance and utility. Without clear directions I did have a bit of difficulty attaching the tool's handle, but after that little chore it was all uphill.So far this handy trimmer has performed flawlessly from one end of Spud Acres to its brother. On one charge I trimmed the front beds, the edges of the asphalt driveway, and most of the beds in the backyard. With extra batteries it's a snap to replace a spent battery with a fresh one. With the batteries included with my other Black and Decker cordless yard tools, and the Firestorm 18V battery bought recently, I have 6 batteries for the three tools. Even if a battery is attached to each tool, I still have two fresh batteries on standby on the chargers.RecommendationThis tool easily rates five stars. It's quieter than my other two trimmers, has more than adequate power for my needs, and is easy to maneuver. At first I thought that the pull down edge guide was a useless gimmick, but it actually works very well. Also the automatic line-feed feature is wonderfully convenient.NOTES - Be sure to remove tape from the line cutter and the spool. This bit of advice is not mentioned in the directions.I bought three spools of prewound line when I bought the trimmer, but learned from the directions that one can use bulk line to rearm an empty spool. I like the convenience of using spools ready to use.
B0001Q2EMK Easy to use cordless blower. Loved the fact that I do not have to grapple with cords while in the yard and it definitely beats using the scrapper broom to clear leaves off my front yard.However, it would be better if the battery was longer lasting as I find that I have to recharge after blowing just half my deck (which is probably a full deck for most houses).
B0001Q2EMK I have a few B&D; 18volt tools and I decided to buy a weed whacker and this electric broom.  I was in for a surprise.The weed whacker works great and the battery lasts for ever...as an FYI!I charged the battery the day I received it...a full charge of about 18 hours..to be on the safe side.  Put the battery in and went on to do my cleaning around the deck etc....  Yes there was air...it was OK..but not enough to sweep much.  15 minutes later it went to half power, and 10 minutes later it DIED.My first reaction - the battery is bad, lets try a different one and if that is the case I can call B&D; for a warranty replacement.  NOT the case...all batteries in this thing died in less then 30 minutes and thus this is useless for me.Other B&D; 18volt tools, including the weed whacker work for 45 minutes plus and usually have full power for the first 30 minutes.Sorry B&D; but this is useless, IMHO.  1/5
B0001Q2EMK This blower works well on hard surfaces and holds a decent charge. I use it only for blowing out the garage and walkways; easier to use and not get fumigated with a gas blower for small jobs. I have 2 other hard surface blowers, but this one is so much better; easier to hold and maneuver and blows harder than the others.
B0001Q2EMU Great little machine. For less than 100 bucks you get a trimmer that does a good job. Can be used as an edger also. I don't have large property but I can use this maybe 3 times before charge runs out. They give you two batteries with it and you can always have the backup charged and ready. Why mess with gasoline and mixing oil. Just turn this on and go. Very light weight and easy to manuever. Can adjust the height to suit your needs and no bumbing to advance the string. More convienent than gas or electric and not alot of money.
B0001Q2EMU No more dragging 200 feet of extension cord out when it's time to do some yard trimming. This thing is light weight, strong enough for moderate trimming, and no gas or cords to deal with. It's much like a cordless screwdriver or drill, use it, plug it back in...use it again. It's the ease of it all that makes it a winner. If you plan on taking down HEAVY brush etc...go for the cord, but for maintenance around the yard...this is it!
B0001Q2EMU I live in one of those communities that have common grounds which are kept up by a service; as a result, I only have to tend the grounds in and around my house.  I used to have to lug a power cord out to do it.  With this device, though, I can charge it up overnight and then bounce outside for perhaps 3 minutes of effort at the most.  You have not experienced convenience until you've had the luxury of no gas and pullcord startup or long troublesome power cord, just a battery powered tool.  It is definitely not for large estates, but for simple short jobs, it is perfect.
B0001Q2EMU I can not believe that I am using the same animal others have reviewed. I looked on the box to be sure. This is my third year and it is still working as well as the first time I tried it. I have a small lawn and what used to be reachable by mower is now only reachable by trimmer. With all the compost I use and other earthy products, the lawn has risen above the driveway and sidewalk. By using the \"Groom 'N' Edge\" button to rotate the trimmer head 180 degrees to convert the trimmer to an edger, I not only groom the lawn but also cut away the overflow dirt. Maybe this is why I seem to use more Black & Decker AF-100 String than the average reviewer. I think this thing will never fall apart; if it does I will go cordless.
B0001Q2EMU First of all, I love this trimmer. I have had it less than a year, so I can't comment on durability, but it is very light, and very easy to use.The handle adjusts for perfect balance. You can (and I often do) use this trimmer one-handed, then switch hands.This item is very light, very easy to use, and very quiet. No noise from a gas motor, no hassle of dragging around very long extension cords.The trimmer string advances automatically, so there's no need to mess around with the spool or tap the trimmer to advance the line.The head pivots so you can switch back and forth between edger and trimmer modes in seconds.I use this for edging, weed eating, and to cut grass on a steeply sloped portion of lawn.  It works great.When the battery is at full charge, this item has decent power. Shortly before the charge is gone, there is a sharp drop in power, which lets you know it's time to switch batteries and plug the one you're using into the battery charger. The unit comes with two batteries and one charger.My only complaint is that the batteries only hold a charge for about 15 minutes, after which it takes 9 hours to recharge them. The unit comes with two batteries and one charger. So you can do your front yard one morning, and your back yard the next, if you remember to swap out the battery being charged before you go to bed.If the unit came with four batteries and two chargers (or if the batteries held charges longer or took less time to recharge), this item would be perfect.Update after two years:  After one year, the batteries only last 5 minutes.  After a year and a half, they don't work at all.  Replacement batteries are very expensive.  The Black and Decker replacement battery I bought was better than the originals, but only holds a charge for a short period of time after a few months of use.  The third party NiMH (not NiCad) battery I bought has been the best of all, but it originally lasted 30 minutes and now is down to 15 or 20 after a few months of use.  The replacement battery charger I bought charges batteries in two to three hours instead of nine, but the two original batteries have died since I started using the new charger, and the replacement batteries are fading fast.I still like the trimmer a lot, but the batteries are so expensive, I will buy a different when these batteries die out.  I hope they last the rest of the year.
B0001Q2EMU I have been sold on Black & Decker for years I have a corded string trimmer that still works as good as new that is well over 20 years old the same can be said for half inch chuck corded drill well over 20 years for it and it is used often. I had a B&D sweep stick internal battery type that lasted 22 years and last month I bought the cordless pole saw and like it so much I decided to get the trimmer and once again have used it twice and very satisfied with its ability to get the job done. Since it is a single line trimmer and the smaller diameter line it would not be good in heavy thick weeds but ideal for grass trimming and very easy to handle it is a very well balanced tool and you cannot beat the price at Amazon and even better you get the extra battery. I can tell you a local big box store in our town which is well known around the world for cheap prices is asking $16 more for this same item and $40 for the batteries. If you want to look at it from my view point you are buying the batteries and getting the trimmer free.
B0001Q2EMU Here's my usage: 1 acre surrounded with chain link fence - and I have to do both sides; plus 200 feet of concrete driveway; three out-buildings; 16 trees, posts, etc.; another couple hundred feet of shrub beds.First - chain link fence and trimmers do not play nicely together. Prior to this trimmer, a trip through this yard with electric or gas meant several reels of line. With this trimmer - slightly more than one reel! I've had this for the entire 2008 mowing season. It does a better job of actually trimming along the fence than any gas or electric trimmer I have used in the last 35 years - period.Second - power is not an issue unless you are trying to clear heavy stuff that hasn't been kept trimmed.Third - battery charge leaves a lot to be desired; it takes a long time to re-charge and extra batteries are expensive. It takes about six batteries worth to do all that we have to do. I've solved this by buying their tiller (see review) and a second trimmer. I now have 5 batteries and three chargers. The second trimmer actually cost very little compared to the price of two batteries.Fourth - I'm 63 with a bad back - the trimmer is well balanced and the weight is no problem.
B0001Q2EMU Purchased as part of the cordless homecare package this trimmer is by far the best unit for our subdivision home. As the homecare package has three batteries and a three bank charger we're never out of power. It will do medium to light trimming and edging without skipping a beat. Light and easy to use, just pick-up and go. The cordless broom cleans up the mess in and flash and your done!Gone are the years of frustration and struggle weilding a gas powered unit, or getting sore yanking the cord trying to start it. Or (ok, I admit it) throwing the gas powered units on the ground in frustration and disgust.
B0001Q2EMU I purchased this trimmer in May 2008 and I am very happy with it.  I have used it about 5 times.  The majority of my weed trimming is done by a yard service, but I needed a trimmer for touch up and weed trimmer in areas outside the lawn.  It is very nice to put in a battery and go.  Battery life is good.  I can get about 20 minutes of hard use (briars, thick weeds) and about 40 minutes of light use (grass) out of a fresh battery.  The unit comes with two batteries.  I have changed the \"string\" once and it was easy.  The trimmer is light and quiet. May experience with the cordless trimmer resulted in me purchasing the B&D cordless pole hedge trimmer.  They use the same battery, which is very helpful.  All and all very good product, if you understand your getting a light duty trimmer.
B0001Q2EMU I love this product!  I have a gas powered trimmer and frankly I got tired of it.  I had to have mixed fuel, I had to prime it, I had to start it, it would not start, I had to clean the carburetor, and it was loud!  With this product I plug in a recharged battery and trim around my one acre yard without hassle.The unit came with two 18 volt batteries and I can trim my whole house 3 times on the same battery.  I then swap the depleted one out with the new one and recharge the old one. I also like how the shaft of the trimmer telescopes because I am tall.  The cutting line automatically advances itself and is always the proper length for maximum cutting speed and power.No mixed gas, much lower noise level, instant start, and no extension cords!  In the time it took to start the old gas unit I am  done using this trimmer.  This thing cuts a 12 inch path and I can trim my 17 trees, driveway and 500 feet of sidewalk in very quick time.  When you use this trimmer you give your lawn that finished look.It comes with a two year warranty and I recommend this product based on my good experience in using it.
B0001Q2EMU I got this item as a Goldbox special with free shipping for a nicely discounted price. I do NOT have large swaths of brush or vegetation to trim through, and if you do, look elsewhere. This is a light-duty trimmer best suited to grass and some herbaceous plant stems.It is fairly lightweight, very easy to use, and the two included batteries are a huge plus for me. I was able to trim up around my yard (~ 1/4 acre)along fence lines and flower beds on one battery. I rushed because many other reviewers have commented that the batteries don't last long enough for them. For my purposes, they are fine and still had enough juice left after I was done. Next time, I'll take it slower to give them a better test.I'm still holding out judgment on the Auto-feed spool; I didn't break the line to a point where I felt there needed to be an advance from the machine. Again, I'll have to give her a few more trial runs to see if she is line-hungry or not. I feel, at this early stage of ownership, that if you can find this trimmer on sale, and have a small to average (whatever that is) sized yard with typical suburban plants growing, you will do well with this device. My only real quibble would be the potential longevity of the NiCad batteries, but some reviewers on here have claimed a life of 3-4 years with them. If I can get that out of this trimmer, I'll consider it money well spent.By the way, in person this trimmer has a distinctly...cheap feel to it. It was a point of concern for me at first, but I grew accustomed to it - I feel the light weight just solidifies the fact that this is NOT a brush cutter - just a device best used to hit some stray grass after mowing on a Sunday afternoon in your backyard. Good luck shopping!
B0001Q2EMU This is a much better trimmer than the other 4 I've owned and I highly recommend it for light trimming.Some will be inclined to call me a nut because this is my fourth B&D; Electric String Trimmer with one exception.  This one is battery operated while the others were operated by 100 feet of extension cord.  Years ago, I bought my first electric trimmer and was pleased with its operation until it burned up in less than a year and the selling company refused to honor its warranty because I did not have the original receipt.  My fault.  I threw it away and have not bought one item from that company since.  I replaced it with my first B&D; electric trimmer and away I went.  I had to increase the length of cord and now I have over 200' of cord to work it.  And it worked fine for a few months and it broke.  B&D; took it back with no problem.  Another one went south and they replaced it.  Each broken trimmer took place within the first year of ownership so my cost was zero except for the handling and packing trash that goes with such a return.  The last corded trimmer still works O.K. but the string device will Not move the string when it is time.  I have to undo the string container and feed it manually.  That doubles my trimming time and is quite a hassle especially during summer.  Incidentally, I have a super gas powered trimmer that I use for the distant sections of the yard and for heavier material.  It is much more powerful and used on special occasions such as when the deer and other critters stop eating the brush.Sorry for the history but I come to this trimmer with a modicum of experience and patience.  This trimmer supports such things as not having to lug that heavy orange cord all around yards of yard.  P.S. I have yet to cut the cord with the trimmer.  I can't believe it either.  The box arrived in one working piece.  A few cuts to tape and actually reading some of the instructions, plugging in the charger and attaching a battery it was a wait until the next day and away we trimmed; with ease.  I ran the battery down in about 30 minutes of trimming and not counting the walking to time.  The next day after the other battery had charged I finished the yard with a little of the juice remaining.  I think \"juice\" is slang for battery power.  The length adjustment is perhaps one of the best features.  One of us is 6'3\" and the other is 5'5\".  One size does not fit all so having the ability to increase or decrease the length is quite nice.  When it is trimming, not cutting, time a simple twist of the shaft permits a straight line of cutting and it sure looks nice when it's fresh.  I felt so good about the trimmer that I even chunked the box in case it did not work.  It works and works well.
B0001Q2EMU this works perfectly. i see no reason to have a gas trimmer. at 18v this has tons of power. comes with two batts so never runs out of power. i get approx one month of use for each charge. ive owned it for one season and would recommend to anyone.
B0001Q2EMU I've had this a couple years and have gotten a ton of use out of it.  My yard is pretty small, just typical socal tract home sized front/back lawns.  On a newer battery I can easily finish the job.  It has good speed, does the job no problem.  Changing string is very easy.  It doesn't feel too heavy at all either.
B0001Q2EMU This trimmer works like a charm. It is plenty good for trimming needs around the home. The automatic string feature is nice. I was always use to having to tap the trimmer on the ground to advance the string.  This you don't have to do anything. You turn the handle which turns the head to edge the sidewalk. I bought this based on comments made on this website. I am am very happy with this purchase.
B0001Q2EMU Bought this for the missus to trim around her flower beds and herb garden and it's perfect for her. Light, easy to use and a single battery charge is enough for her to trim around 8-10 planting areas without having to swap batteries. She's thrilled with it and I can now devote my gas-powered (Ryobi) whacking and trimming to the more onerous areas of our property.
B0001Q2EMU Okay, first for Amazon itself:  What a great place to shop!  I've shopped Amazon for years and have always been extremely satisfied with Amazon's service - quality, value and so far, perfect customer service.UPDATE:I've had and used the trimmer for a few months and have found that after using and recharging the batteries a few times, the batteries seem to last a little longer between charges.  Still works great and I feel safe in saying that this is a good, if not excellent buy (still can't say it is a \"Hog\").Now for the Trimmer.This is a replacement for a gas powered trimmer and so far, it really works well.  I said the trimmer rated a \"qualified\" 5 stars, and here are the caveats:1.  To call this trimmer a \"Grass Hog\" is stretching the truth.  It's more like a grass piglet; but for me, with a small yard, it works great.  However, if you have a really large yard, it may not be what you want.  Having had to wait to receive the trimmer, I had a patch of grass (about 2'x8')that grew to about 6\" or 8\" in height, and really seemed to drag the battery down quickly - fortunately it comes with two batteries.2.  The automatic string feature is nice, but it seems to use way more string than necessary, especially when trimming the curb, sidewalk and driveway (sounded like it was continually feeding string).  Again, for a small yard, it works nicely, but if you have a really large yard, just know it isn't a \"HOG\" and will very likely run out of string quickly.Other than those two caveats, it seems to be, for the price, a great little trimmer, and doesn't pollute the atmosphere.  It doesn't require lots of pulling on a starter rope (along with the associated language necessary to start a stubborn gas trimmer), is fairly well balanced,  light, almost noiseless and really, a joy to use.
B0001Q2EMU I'd give the Grasshog 5 stars if the battery charge lasted a bit longer---it's a good thing it comes with 2---
B0001Q2EMU I'm happy with this trimmer. So much better than the gas one that was hard to start. I have around a 1/4 acre and the trimmer did not run out of juice and handled everything I tried.
B0001Q2EMU Works very good for continuous trimming. Wish had gotten a longer trimmer, as the reach of a 12\" trimmer is only 4\". Actually shorter, due to the curve in the string, which actually reduces the reach to about 3\".But, as long as I know its limitations, we get along OK.
B0001Q2EMU A lot better than messy gas trimmers for small jobs. No mixing gas & oil and no noise. I still have a dual string trimmer for the big jobs in spring but this 18V trimmer is just right the rest of the summer.
B0001Q2EMU The purchase from Amazon was flawless; the trimmer was on by front porch within three days of the order placement. Amazing. Be careful opening the box. I got a nasty paper cut in my eagerness to rip off the box top with brute force. Inside the box everything was expertly packaged and protected with egg carton quality cardboard shell.Luckily operating the machine is simple because the direction sheet leaves much to be desired. It displays as many languages as a United Nations guide, but all in small print, all directions overly succinct. What you need to know is on the direction sheet but not necessarily easy to find because of a lack of clarity and organization.The small pictures provided require the use of a magnifying glass. The pictures aren't annotated with text, just numbered sequentially.So far this handy trimmer has performed flawlessly from one end of Spud Acres to the other. On one charge I trimmed the front beds, the edges of the asphalt driveway, and most of the beds in the backyard. With extra batteries it's a snap to replace a spent battery with a fresh one. With the batteries included with my other Black and Decker cordless yard tools, and the Firestorm 18V battery bought recently, I have 6 batteries for the three tools. Even if a battery is attached to each tool, I still have two fresh batteries on standby on the chargers.This tool easily rates five stars. It's quieter than my other two trimmers, has more than adequate power for my needs, and is easy to maneuver. At first I thought that the pull down edge guide was a useless gimmick, but it actually works very well. Also the automatic line-feed feature is wonderfully convenient.NOTES - Be sure to remove tape from the line cutter and the spool. This bit of advice is not mentioned in the directions.I bought three spools of prewound line when I bought the trimmer, but learned from the directions that one can use bulk line to rearm an empty spool. I like the convenience of using spools ready to use.I like this cordless trimmer so much that my Echo gas trimmer has been gathering dust in the garden shed the past two years.
B0001Q2EMU I love this trimmer for every week sprucing up; it is not powerful enough for heavy duty trimming but does a great job on things I maintain regularly; with two batteries, there is plenty of trimming time for a large yard
B0001Q2EMU I love B&D; tools and have a variety of 18v tools.  I never really owned many gardening tools and decided to buy this and give it a whirl...no pun intended. :-)  The package comes with 2 18v batteries, a spindle of twine, and the hog it self.  Charged one of the batteries for 18 hours or so and off I went to get rid of weeds.  PERFECT....this worked for about 30 minutes on full power and 15-20 minutes on half power with one full  battery.I was impressed...as the 18v electric broom died in 20 minutes...I have now used it about a dozen times and my results are exactly the same....  Replacement twine is avail on Amazon and  your your local big store... :-)5/5 - Great Product, Great Value...especially for us beginners.
B0001Q2EMU Free of restrictive power cords, an electric weedwacker is a very convenient tool.  Black and Decker's NST2018 trimmer is very lightweight, and easy to use.  With a 12 inch diameter cutting path, the unit is suitable for light trimming, touch ups, edging, and catching small areas missed by a mower.  While the motor has enough power for moderate tasks, if you want to trim large areas, or tackle thick, high grass, you probably should look at something more powerful.The trimmer comes with two 18 volt batteries, and you will probably need them both to take on anything except a small job.  It is hard to predict how long a battery may last under actual use, but you might get fifteen minutes of run time from a new battery.  It is a just a good idea to make sure both batteries are charged up, before you start a job.The 0.065 inch trimmer line feeds automatically, you don't bang the spool on the ground, or manually feed line.  The auto feed system works pretty well, but does get stuck at times.  Since the electric motor does not generate higher speeds like a gas motor, the noise level is relatively low.  The unit is very light, and vibration is minimal.  The trimmer guard is constructed of durable hard plastic, and should not crack under normal use.This trimmer is a great for touch ups and smaller yards.  The freedom is wonderful, you are not polluting the air, and your hands won't get dirty mixing fuel.
B0001Q2EMU Everything that has been said is true. This is perfect for those of us who just need to trim the edge of your lawn or clear some overgrown weeds, but it is no bush hog. It comes with two batteries, each of which probably lasts 15 minutes peak on heavier jobs and maybe longer or lightweight edge trimming. We find this sufficient for our 1/3 acre property, though it usually requires both batteries as we tend to wait too long to trim.If you buy this expecting the power of a gas trimmer, you will be disappointed. If you want a trimmer that just works and makes your yard look great, you will be very happy.We had a Toro gas trimmer that was highly recommended by Consumer Reports for years and I could never start it without the help of my husband. This was very frustrating to me because I primarily care for the gardens. Now the gas powered one sits collecting dust because we both use the battery powered Black and Decker.My main gripe is probably that it is so unattractive and that it doesn't go out into the yard and trim without me.
B0001Q2EMU This is a good trimmer for my use. I have a small front yard that i use this for and it works well and the battery lasts long enough and the extra battery is great too.
B0001WV010 Got this a couple weeks ago, and no problems so far. I never tested the temp, but it keeps my seed trays warm!
B0001WV010 The extra bit of warmth helped germinate my seeds including tropical fruit seeds in northern California. It's a pretty small mat if you're super ambitious.
B0001WV010 This was the way to go for me.  I had 4 seedling germination stations and this fit all of them plus I didn't have to pay all too much.
B0001WV010 I have an amazingly good return (sprout rate) on the seeds I planted using this seedling heat mat. What a great idea!This makes growing from seeds so easy.I've learned that it helps to soak the seeds in water for 24 hours or so, or follow the instructions on the packet if they have instructions.Then just sprinkle the dirt over them and provide the right amount of heat. The seeds don't need nutrition at this point, but they do need warm temperatures.I love this product!
B0001WV010 It is sooo totally hot, sleek and shiny, I will pour oil over it and... oh, wait, sorry, that's another review I hope to do someday... this review is for a plastic heating mat to get your seeds asproutin earlier and, hey, there seems to be no other brand out there to buy. This sure does make it an easier purchasing decision.The mat is the right size for one of those seed sprouting kits, but beware that some of them are made of amazingly cheap plastic and leak. It is not a good idea to submerge this pad, although it seems to be sealed up and safe for the typical spills.It seems to work in getting the seeds to sprout, in April on the west coast. My only goal is to have tomato plants going earlier this year.Another reviewer mentioned putting an insulating pad underneath and that would make sense, especially on a concrete or metal surface.But, you ask, how can you give a simple device that actually works only three stars? I bought one of these a few years ago at a box store and it failed in only one season. I also think the price could be better. That is one demerit for every displeasure.Now, about that fun review...
B0001WV010 I have a large bay window with a window seat in my kitchen that gets natural light from three sides. In the spring the seat pads get stashed and out comes and insulated mat that covers the surface, this heat mat, and plant tray with fortified planting material for seedlings or plant cuttings. This mat keeps the plant tray warm and encourages rapid growth without doing much more than keeping the plants warm and fed. In a matter of 3-4 days, the plants sprout and show root growth.I like this mat because I get fast and effective results with this every time I use it. It's a good product that pays for itself with its success rate and the fact that it makes me feel like a gardening pro.
B0001WV010 Just what I was looking for.  I bought two so I can start all of my seeds for spring/summer planting.  While I was using this heat mat, I put styrafoam (bought at Home Depot) under it.  It worked much better.  Germination was much quicker.
B0001WV010 This little device worked like a charm starting my seeds last winter. I couldn't believe how much quicker it took for them to germinate when using this mat. I put it on a timer with my lights and found it easy to use and setup. It kept a nice warm temperature, never getting too hot. Hopefully it will last for quite awhile as I only get to use it a few weeks a year.UPDATE - Year 2 -Seed mat is working as designed again this year. I need to get another one as I have doubled the amount of seeds I am growing. Definitely recommend this product.
B0001WV010 I very much needed this this heat mat for my germination /cloning box setup.This will help speed up the time and increase success in root development in seeds and clones.A must no matter your growings skill and for a small price for a high chance for success.
B0001WV010 Very good seedling mat, I used mine with the digital thermometer. It greatly assisted in my seed germination during the winter months. Recommended for those who start their seeds indoors.
B0001WV010 I bought 2 of these heat mats for my seedlings and they just took off. It does not get overly hot and I used them with the plastic black trays at most garden centers. I could tell the difference between seedlings on the mat and seedlings that did not have a mat in terms of their growth. I would recommend and I plan on buying more.
B0001WV010 I bought one of these to try in my greenhouse. Also bought the hydrofarm MTPRTC digital thermostat here on Amazon. Great pair together. I put this under the starter tray and the seeds sprouted in no time.
B0001WV010 I have a professional quality heat mat from a grow store, this was  a back up. Its smaller, does not quite fit a seedling tray, and is cooler than the pro mat. It is working, seedlings are up, but for more starts I bought another one from the grow store. so this is an ok buy, the pro ones are bigger for the same price.
B0001WV010 These mats (I bought two) operate exactly as advertised.  I raised an astounding number of seedlings this past spring using these mats.  I'm sure my germination rate was greatly influenced by the use of the mats.  Then, after spring, I cleaned them up and am storing them for the next season of use.
B0001WV010 I've got two of these and I really like them since it speeds up the amount of time it takes to get cuttings to root. If they were used on a cooler surface like a concrete or wood surface they'd be perfect as is but running on top of carpet they get a little too warm for my liking. I'm looking into getting some dimmers for them. I saw them on Amazon once so I just need to hunt them down so I can keep these just a little bit cooler.
B0001WV010 First year with a mat for the seeds and jeez - what a difference.  The starts were popping up so fast.  I think the mats really made a difference.  I am very excited for that and plan on using them every year.  I hope they last.
B0001WV010 This is the first year I got these when starting my seeds. I should have gotten these years ago! Instead of only having about 25% to 50% of my seeds sprout I have had 97% of my seeds spout and they are growing faster too. I highly recommend these & they are a reasonable price compared to others too!
B0001WV010 I used to germinate seeds in flats on top of my refrigerator, but after moving to a new place where this didn't work anymore, I needed something else. I tried germinating some seeds last year without anything special, and while I still had good luck, some took a while to come up, and I knew I could do better with some gentle bottom heat. That's why I bought this mat (the 9-by-19.5-in. version, in my case) for this year.My germination rates seem to have improved from last year, but I was expecting that. If one of the cheaper options (e.g., warm place or top of fridge) doesn't work for you or you want more control, you may want to try this. Being new to heat mats, I wasn't sure exactly what I needed, so I bought a thermostat, theHydrofarm MTPRTC, just in case. The mat will only raise the temperature about 10-20 degrees above the room, so with my cool apartment, I probably didn't need this (until I discovered the next trick), but I'm glad I bought it anyway. If you're as unfamiliar with it as I was, here's how it works: the thermostat plugs into the wall, then the heat mat plugs into the thermostat. The thermostat has a probe you insert into the soil, and it will turn the outlet on the thermostat (into which the heat mat is plugged) on or off as needed to maintain the temperature you set on the thermostat. So, it's a lot like a timer, but based on temperature instead of time. If you plug the heat mat directly into the wall, it will just stay on all the time, since the mat itself includes no \"regulator\" like this. This isn't inherently bad, but I'd at least monitor the temperature and compare it to what you want if you do this instead.The \"trick\" I learned, which is also mentioned in the instructions: insulating under the mat helps. My thermostat is now able to keep the mat off for longer than before. I used to have the mat set directly on my counter under the assumption that it wouldn't dissipate that much heat, but I think I was wrong. Even after the simple step of setting the mat on top of a folded towel, the soil has had an easier time staying warmer, and I'm saving electricity by not keeping the mat on as much. You may have better luck if you use a sheet of actual insulation, but even a towel underneath showed improvement for me.As a final note, I measured the electricity usage of this with my Kill A Watt meter. As stated, it uses about 17 Watts when on (which is, in fact, any time it's plugged in to a live outlet, since there is no switch on the mat itself). It's also UL listed. In summary, I'm glad I bought this product. It's working well so far. I haven't had it for that long yet so I can't comment on its longevity, but I'll update this review if it dies unexpectedly.
B0001WV010 I have used this to help germinate some cucumbers I started indoors in a small greenhouse tent. At night when the grow lights are unplugged the inside get fairly chilly like the rest of the house, but with this heat mat I can leave it on all night and not have to worry about the seedlings. I would say it keeps the inside temperatures a good 10 degrees warmer than without it. I found the cord to be a little short but it's really no big deal. Before purchasing I compared this with the ones for sale on Gardener's Supply and this seemed to be much better value for the size.
B0001WV010 I've had problems before trying to clone my plants or even with seed.  This used with a tray and dome is all it took for a 100% success rate on all my clones and seeds
B0001WV010 If you live anywhere where keeping the proper temperature for germinating seeds this is a must, even as your plants grow you'll see how much better they do with the heat mat
B0001WV010 I tried this because the idea made sense, and now I'm a believer.  I planted cucumbers, swiss chard, romaine lettuce, squash, watermelon, various tomatoes, etc... The first cucumber sprouted in 3 days!.  And the other seedlings are doing well.  I'm sure that my potting mix helped as well, but looks like this mat lives up to its promise.  I will probably pick up a second mat next year.
B0001WYNP0 You can get some pretty good tomatoes if you use good potting soil, water the plants in time and make sure that they don't get burned by too much sun while young.Yield:Each planter can grow exactly ONE tomato plant so make sure that you choose wisely. At the peak, for a couple of months we could harvest 1, sometimes 2 large, usually perfect tomatoes on any given days.It IS possible to have some herbs growing on top of the planter.Care:Like I said, water frequently because all water follows gravity so not a lot of it is retained.Take special care not to choke the plant. There is some 'sponge plug' at the bottom of the planter through which the tomato grows. Make sure that it does NOT squeeze the stem or you may see a vigorous plant growing only to die later because the bottom opening wasn't wide enought.Durability:Six out of the 8 planters we used last year can be reused this year. The other 2 developed some cracks and we will not use them again.GOOD LUCK WITH YOUR TOMATOES!
B0001WYNP0 My tomato garden is on my patio so space is at a premium.  To expand my gardening space last year I added a Topsy Turvy planter.  I grew cherry tomatos in it, because they tend to stay more compact and produce a lot of small sweet tomatos.The main down fall of tomatos growing in the topsy turvy planter can be the lack of water because the dirt dries out much quicker than the dirt around tomatoes planted in the ground.  To solve this problem I used a drip irrigation system on a timer which released a small amount of water into the plant several times a day.  This kept my tomatos very happy and healthy.  A drip irrigation system may sound expensive but you can buy a kit for around $20 dollarsRain Bird Patio Watering Kit PATIO-KIT.  Since everything in containers gets dry fast, I have my entire patio garden watered by a drip irrigation system.  After buying a small drip irrigation set up 3 years ago, it has been functioning great each summer and all my vegetables, strawberries, and herbs have been much more productive.
B0001WYNP0 Plastic bag with a few metal rings.  Within a few weeks the metal had pushed through the plastic edges so water would just run out the sides.  The metal also started to rust and the whole thing looks as classy as a bag of trash hanging on a hook.  If this was free, you would still not want it.  Get a pot and a tomato cage. ;)
B0001WYNP0 I HAVE BOUGHT SEVEN OF THESE AND HAVE PLANTED TOMATO PLANTES IN MARCH AND NOW THEY HAVE BEGUN TO GROW LARGER AND HAVING BLOOMS---LOOKS LIKE FUN
B0001WYNP0 This is our third year growing tomatoes upside down, so to speak.  At first I was dubious, but now we look forward to growing our own tomatoes.  We have one for large roma tomatoes and another for small cherry tomatoes.  We have to grow these up and away from wild turkeys that roam in our neighborhood looking to eat any and all fresh vegetable shoots.  We placed them on an upper deck with a drip system.  For optimal growth we have them hanging up against the house so more heat bounces off the house onto the plants; heat is ideal for growing tomatoes.  We regularly trim and pinch off new growth so that all the energy goes into the tomatoes.Four star:  These are plastic and are only useable for one year.  I have had a couple of the plastic breakdown before the fruit bearing season was over and had to duct tape it back together.  We will keep using these for our particular situation.  We love our fresh tomatoes.
B0001WYNP0 I ordered three of the Topsy Turvy Upside-down Tomato Planters last spring for the summer of 2006, thinking it would be great for saving space in my small garden area.  I ordered it and had my husband install hooks on our south-facing back patio.  When they arrived, I inserted the plants just as described and filled them with the best possible bagged soil I could find.  Not only did they not grow any better than the traditional ground method, but it was too heavy for me to lift up to the hooks.  My husband (operates heavy equipment for a living and very strong) even had difficulty doing the lifting once they were filled with soil, both when they were installed and then again when they were taken down in October, with our first frost. If you are not strong enough to lift 50-100 lbs, don't purchase. Considering the trouble I had with this product, I would not purchase this item again, and would recommend that if you have any disabilities as I have or are elderly, try the traditional method. I'm thinking about having my husband build me some small raised beds about 2 feet off the ground!
B0001WYNP0 Last year our tomatoes did really well on the south side of our home, but we needed to make room for other things so I decided to give this a try.Out of the box it's pretty self explanatory as to what you need to do. Open, insert tomato start, fill with potting soil, hang and water. So far my tomatoes are looking great! They haven't ripened yet, but there are plenty of them on the verge. One important thing is to water often! It's easy to forget and if you don't water enough you won't have good results.Overall this is a good product that I think is worth the price, especially if you are limited on your space.  The only suggestions I would make are to make sure that you get your tomato start in early.  I got busy and put mine in after it had grown quite a bit, not easy at all and more stress on the plant than it needed. Also make sure your hanger is sturdy, with the soil, water and mature plant it becomes quite heavy.**UPDATE**After seeing a recent thread in the Amazon Gold Box Forum I remembered that I hadn't come back to post any pictures. Several forum posters complained that the Topsy Turvy was a waste of money and didn't work. I have already had one successful year and expect another one. I just uploaded one, it's within a week of putting the start. I will continue to add pictures as the plant progresses.
B0001WYNP0 This may look like a gimmick to you but it's not.  This planter can actually grow tomatoes and other vegetables.  All you need is a sunny place to hang it.  If you live in an apartment or otherwise have no garden space, try this.  They call it a tomato planter but it actually should be called a vegetable planter.  Last summer I grew tomatoes, bell peppers and cucumbers in them.  I believe it needs to contain more soil (larger) to be an ideal tomato planter.  It grew lots of tomatoes but peppers and cucumbers did even better.  One trick to know (not applicable for tomatoes)- take the top plastic cover off and plant 2 vegetable plants per topsy turvy-- one in the top and one in the bottom.
B0001WYNP0 Now im a green thumbaholic when it comes to trying anything new in the gardening world. I love the feeling i get when i literally cant wait to open the box and try it out and see the results... Nothing was different when it comes to this topsy turvy. I bought two for my mom and one for myself to test different varieties of tomatoes. Well to make it short, the harvest was embarrassing. I had a crimson cushion in both mine and my mothers plus one in a 1 gallon and one in a 3 gallon pot for the ultimate test of durability, watering, nutes, 
B0001WYNP0 Especially with cherry and grape sized tomatoes. Amazing production, it's out of the way, well-engineered, they even include a nice big metal hook to hang it with! The plastic-fabric sides WILL disintegrate in a couple-three years, so don't expect this to be a lifetime purchase. But it works great, you'll have more tomatoes than you'll know what to do with! I ordered two of these to replace the single one I had bought a couple years ago. Very clever idea, highly recommended! HINT: don't use cheap potting soil!
B0001WYNP0 my tomato plant have given me a dozen tomatoes. although not large they have been very tasty. i would recommend this item it works very well
B0001WYNP0 I have tried these upside-down tomato planter two years in a row with not great success. I would get some tomatoes but the plants would eventually die. Since these are upside down gravity causes the plant to not keep much water so these need to be watered a lot especially in the hot summer. I setup an automatic watering kit but it did not seam to help. I will not buy these again.
B0001WYNP0 I am a Master Gardener, which in my state means I need to have continuing education each year and teach minimum amount of hours.  We can't teach old wive's tales, just scientifically proven plant info (but some of the old wive's tales have been proven, so they are O.K. :-) ). These upside-down planters have been a big discussion point and unbiased studies have been done on their effectiveness.  They have been proven to produce less than conventionally grown plants.  I am giving two stars for the novelty factor, but I would never recommend them for anyone who actually wants tomatoes.More work + more expensive + less fruit = thumbs down
B0001WYNP0 This does exactly as advertised. The Black Russian Truffle Tomato i put in mine was growing famously. Actually, it's growth was fairly unprecedented, until....the whole thing fell and the plant's main stem was crushed. See, when the planter is watered properly, it is also incredibly heavy for its size. So, the lesson there would be to make sure whatever you hang it from can hold quite a bit of weight. I would say it needs to be able to hold at least twenty pounds, since the total weight of a fully grown plant with the planter and all the requisite soil and watering will at least end up weighing this much. It might be safer to shoot for 30 pounds though. However, that was a user error problem on my part for not planning properly. The planter itself is great. You cant overwater, as any excess will simply run out the bottom. A good solid and inexpensive purchase.
B0001WYNP0 Bought two after watching neighbor's do fairly well except for watering neglect.This year will have her hang closer to our yard so we can keep eye on it.These two, when set, will be accessible to daily watering as needed.  It doesn't look to be any 'foam ring' in these 2.  BUT one can always stir 'foam packing peanuts' into dirt/potting mixture, which will create some lightness to over all hanging weight, as well as help with water retention.As to Fabric rotting/giving out after one season vs the earlier reviews. Sounds like the typical of past 4 yrs of IMPORTED product where the MFG has reduced the quality of the fabric.
B0001WYNP0 This thing really makes no sense at all.  I was given one of these as a gift, so I used it.  But I also grow tomatoes in a garden every year, so I will use that for my pro/con comparison after using the Topsy Turvy this past summer.Cons:1. Costs more than a whole bunch of seedling tomato plants.2. Needs potting soil which adds to the cost.3. Must water EVERY day or the tomato plant drys out very quickly.4. Doesn't produce nearly as many or as large of tomatoes as a plant in the ground (or in a big pot).5. Not reusable as the \"bag\" became brittle and falls apart after a summer in the sun.Pros:1. Takes up very little space as long as you have a place to hang it (note: it must be a sunny place).2. Seems built well enough not to break easily (at least for one summer's use).3. You don't have to \"stake\" the plant so the vines don't break.  Hanging upside-down, the vines are fine.4. Plants growing upside-down are interesting to look at.But really, this thing makes no sense.  Why plant something upside-down?  You could plant your tomato plant right-side-up in this thing and you would probably be better off, and you would not be bothered with the extra effort involved in planting it upside-down. In fact, you could buy any decent-sized hanging basket and plant a tomato plant in it and let the vines tumble over the side of the pot and have nearly the same thing.  Or just buy a big pot if you have a place on the ground to put it (but staking the vines would be better then).  But, it doesn't have to be upside down.  The upside-down concept is just a gimmick to get you to buy this thing instead of a regular hanging basket.Since I have this thing and a place to hang it, I would have probably used it again, excepting for the fact that the plastic \"bag\" becomes brittle and falls apart when you touch it after a season in the sun.  So you won't be able to use this year after year as there is no way it would stay together when handled enough to replant another tomato plant in it.  They should have used a plastic that isn't destroyed by the sun.  So don't buy this thing with the thought that you can use it season after season.Anyway, the kids look at it strange, so at least it is interesting.  But that bit of unusual-ness is its only real value.  If you just want tomatoes and don't care about the upside-down gimmick, there is really no reason to buy this.  Just buy any pot or hanging basket and plant your tomato right-side-up.But it does work, and once you plant your tomato you don't have to stake it up, and it is interesting to some to see a plant growing upside-down, so I give it a rating of two stars even though I find it really is pretty goofy to begin with.  And you are not going to get as many or as large of tomatoes as a plant in the ground.  But thinking about it, if I used my own money to buy it (instead of receiving it as a gift), I would only give it one star.  Really, it is a silly thing useful only as a gimmick to grow a tomato plant upside down.  If this is your only choice, buying tomatoes at a farmer's market would probably make more sense.
B0001WYNP0 This product works as advertised, my tomatoes are doing very well.  However, it is VERY heavy when filled with dirt and watered.  You need a sturdy hook and place to hang it.  I was having problems with it drying out quickly (granted, I live in New Mexico, where it is quite dry) even though I had added water absorbing crystals to the soil.  I ended up removing the top 6 inches of soil and placing a plastic milk jug in the top.  I punched some holes in the bottom of the jug and I fill this with water nearly every day.  The water then slowly seeps in to the soil instead of running out the bottom, dripping is reduced and the plant gets the water it needs.  I would give it five stars if some system were in place to keep it from dripping so I could use it indoors and if it were a little easier to plant.
B0001XLSGQ This is the second 4 foot hydrofarm grow light ive purchased.  I bought one last year and then again one this year. (The first one still works great)  I use the grow light for my seed starter kits and noticed that the seedlings directly under the light grow alot stronger and healthier than the ones on the outside edges.  So thats where the 2nd light purchase came in.Having the lights hang from the adjustable strings is a pretty nice feature.  As the plants grow you can raise the light up by the pull of a string.The only thing i would change about this light that would make it better would be if it had 2 bulbs so it covers more area.
B0001XLSGQ I've been using this to keep plants alive during the frost, I didn't think they could grow anymore because of the cold. This thing makes them grow! I was surprised. The plants went from about 12 inches tall to about 18 inches. I keep the light on for about 16 hours a day, and if it's warm enough outside I put them out there on a roller.My only con is that the frame could be built better, other than that it's great if you have a few plants you need to keep alive during the winter. It's good even if you want to start plants.
B0001XLSGQ I have a small greenhouse and I'm using this Grow Light to keep my vegetables going. It provides light in Winter to 5 Earthboxes full of vegetables. Does it work? I have 5 planters full of vegetables, some blooming getting ready to fruit, and some squash and cucumbers with fruit on them, and there is ice and snow on the ground outside, very little natural light this time of year.It seems flimsy, and you wouldn't want to kick it around or place it somewhere with lots of traffic and people bumping into it. Otherwise, I haven't a problem with the fact that it isn't SOLID. I move it around a little every day or two to make sure everything is getting some light. It handles that just fine.I'm thinking of getting another one or two. If it wasn't so expensive, I would. I haven't found anything I like better.
B0001XLSGQ I live in the mountains of California and we have a very short \"summer\" season. I wanted to grow tomatoes, spinach and herbs indoors. This system is perfect! First of all it was very easy to set up. There were no tools necessary except for a rubber hammer for just one connection that was a little tight. There is only one bulb which was a concern at first, but this 54 Watt/T5 bulb throws out an incredible amount of light. Much more than my old two-bulb/T12 (fatter bulbs) fixture. I did the math: This system costs a mere $5 a month to keep on for 12 hours a day. That's in California which has one of the highest electricity costs at 15 cents a KW.I have this set up on a 6 foot by 2 1/2 foot table and the light shines across the whole table! Printed on the crossbar is a note that this stand can hold up to 30 pounds. That means that I can attach a larger light fixture with two bulbs, or even my 4 bulb (thin T5's) fixture and use it with a much larger table (or two) without any trouble. Nice to have options.Under the light I have a large \"grow box\" 29\" wide and 15\" deep. PLUS smaller 24\" x 8\" boxes for the herbs, spinach and bush beans. I have covered the whole table with planters and they all get plenty of light. The light goes easily on and off with a toggle, or you can use a timer. Being able to adjust the light up and down with ease is a great plus. I have some planters sitting on boxes to get the right height for them, as I will be adjusting the light for the benefit of the tomatoes.I found the perfect indoor tomato. It's called \"extreme dwarf bush tomato\". Seeds are available on line from many specialty seed companies. This tomato bush grows only about 18-24 inches tall and since this system is 32 1/2\" tall, it's perfect. This brings me to the best feature of this unit: it's tall! You can grow so many things under this light that you may not have thought of. Some indoor greenhouses only have only 12 inches between shelves to work with. Additionally, you could place this unit's legs on bricks or boxes and raise it even further if you needed to.The high output T5 bulb is rated 6400K-Full Daylight Spectrum, and will last 20,000 hours. That's 1,667 12-hour days, or over 4 1/2 years, and costs pennies a day to run. The fixture gets slightly warm, but not hot at all. This unit is sturdy, not flimsy at all, and will last a very long time. I'm buying another one and getting ready for bare root strawberry planting time!
B0001XLSGQ As you can see, most of these reviews are very old.  I have one and it is very sturdy and designed quite well. The lifting mechanism works great and is a great improvement over most of the more inexpensive systems that require moving each side separately.  I would definitely recommend this system - its a nice dark forest green and the paint job is excellent - you could put it in the living room and it would look just fine.  I can't comment on shipping and packing as I bought mine at a retail store but I would have to say the package itself seems pretty well packed so if anything breaks I would say the retailer you bought it from did not protect it well enough in the shipping box.  It is, afterall, a lightbulb and should be shipped as such, with plenty of pellets.
B0001XLSGQ When I retired, I wanted to retire my home made pvc light stand.  Mind you, there was nothing wrong with it.  Having said that, these light systems by Hydrofarm are fantastic.  I have four of them and used them all winter.  Packaging and instructions were right on and they are absolutely wonderful. I wondered at the system for raising the light up and down because it seemed so simple.  Well, simple and smooth it is.  It raises and lowers the lights in micro inches if you want. In this way you can raise them as the plants grow and it seems not to wear out at all with one season behind them.  I wish I had done this way before I retired.
B0001XLSGQ I just set this up over the trays with my spring seed crops started.  It was super easy to assemble.  The parts just pop together and it goes up like a breeze.  The instructions refer to chains for hanging the light but the hanging mechanism is not a chain but that is OK.  Overall this solves trying to rig a light up over the trays and will come apart to store.  Great product!
B0001XLSGQ This was very easy to assemble, very sturdy. Everything was intact in the box. I used this all winter and I am going to have a bumper crop of veggies. Very pleased with this product. Easy to pack up and store away for the summer too. Highly recommend
B0001XLSGQ The advantages of grow lights are obvious, so I won't summarize them here.  I will mention that the sign on the produce advising that it is for use only in dry environments was surprising.  Surely a product intended to be used in raising plants is by definition going to be used in a somewhat humid environment.  That aside, it's a good little unit, easy to assemble and fairly easy to disassemble later.  I'm not sorry to own one.
B0001XLSGQ This this is the best. It was easy to install and setup and the guillotine nature of the suspended lights make it easy to adjust the light source as your plants grow. I had this system combined with the greenhouse kits and heat mats with thermostats and my starters came up extraordinarily quicker than any other method I have tried previously. I did notice it took a bit longer for it to ship, but it is an absolute charm. No more trying to grow plants in my kitchen window sill!
B0001XLSGQ Unlike some other reviewers, I find the build quality satisfactory. It is a little small for potted plants, however. When raised to the highest position, the lamp has a 26\" clearance to the ground. The high-efficiency bulb generates a little less heat than standard fluorescent lights but is still hot enough to scorch leaves that come too close. In short, the maximum height for the plants is around 24\", sufficient for a seed starter but way too low to serve as a mini-green house for plants that need to winter indoors.
B0001XLSGQ This is a great system for lighting, and I have absolutely no complaints with that.  I wish this unit had come with optional items one could buy along with it such as 'heating pad the length of the light.'  I tried to find one but they were all too short.  With the right heating pad I would have had far better results - but again, no problem of the light.  Strongly recommend it.
B0001XLSGQ I am very impressed with this unit!  I was able to start most of my seeds indoors this year and the ability to raise and lower the light easily to make sure you don't end up with spindly plants is great.  The light does not put out massive amounts of heat at all and is *incredibly* bright!  What amazing technology.  Highly recommend if you are a gardener who lives in an area with a short growing season.  The unit is extremely portable and lightweight.  It is also so simple to put together almost anyone could do it.  I prefer putting it on a table for easier access to plants and I also bought an inexpensive timer so I wouldn't have to remember to turn the unit on and off while working.  Great value.
B0001XLSGQ Went together easily enough. The hanging string design is a bit wonky and is hard to really get level. I've found these size bulbs are difficult to find locally.It serves its purpose, but I think there are better options for the money.. though they do require a bit more DIY spirit.
B0001XLSGQ I like to grow herbs indoors, and save a ton of money by starting flowers and veggies inside, 3 months before I can move 'em outdoors.I've had the Hydrofarm Jump Start for a couple of weeks, and already have some pretty little green heads pushing up from the Jiffy peat pellets.Some have said that the metal bars were flimsy, but that's not what I found. They're more than adequate for the job, and fit together easily enough.It's a bit confusing when the company talks about \"bulbs\" - plural - since there is only 1 fluorescent tube supplied, or that could fit in the highly reflective holder.This is an energy-efficient T5 fluorescent tube - one of the new, skinny kind. I'm used to seeing the standard store type - the T12's - which are big around as a silver dollar (and are being phased out). This one would have a diameter more like a quarter. You can replace them easily enough at your local hardware/home supply store - I checked.This is just the 4-foot lighting system: I also ordered a company's Germination Station, Heat Mat and Digital Thermostat (sold separately).I'd say this was a well thought out device, relatively simple, sturdy enough, and works well.Recommended!
B00022OK2A This is very heavily built and well designed.  For a compact grill it reaches cooking temperature rapidly, and can hold 6 large burgers easily.  You can adjust the grill height to two positions. So far I've found the high position cooks best for my own style of cooking.  It's is easy to clean (set it on the grass and hose it out).  The bottom grating is showing signs of rust, so I've started using WD-40 on it after I rinse it out.  However, it is so stout that I don't know that the slight rust would cause a problem for some time.
B00022OK2A Pros:1) Beautiful sear marks and flavour2) Preseasoned, so it's easy care, just wipe down with an oily paper towel, and remember to cleanup the ash after use.3) Simple effective no-frills design.4) Can be used as an outdoor firepit.5) Sturdily built.6) The oval shape is much more space-efficient than the round one:a) for finding somewhere to put it,b) the cooking surface - you can fit 6 burger patties on this, flank steak, a full rack of ribs, good sized slab of salmon...(not all at once!) plus two or three medium potatoes wrapped in foil next to the coals.  You can cook for 2-6 pple.c) in arranging the coals for the right type of heat for what you want to cook.Cons:1) No lid -- For a lid, I would suggest the Cajun Classic brand cast-iron oval dutchoven flipped upside down.2) Matching oval-shaped Lodge cast-iron Dutch oven is discontinued (could be used as lid, griddle and dutch oven).3) It is heavy4) It is ugly5) Design too basic? Could be made more user friendly with height-adjust option during cooking.  Currently, you have to flip the grill over to change height.You have to really know your coals. Not very charcoal-phob friendly.6) Limited use:a) Cast Iron retains heat and cools slowly, so not very pratical for anything where you might have to move it before it cools.b) Needs to be baby-ed: water + ash = lye, which will eat away at the cast iron bottom causing rust. So no open grilling in a snowstorm, during unstable weather, or leaving out overnight to cool.  You have to go back out when it cools to put it under some sort of cover.Needful accessories:1) Oval dutch oven to be flipped upside down and used as a lid.2) Chimney starter.3) dutch oven lifter which can we used to lift the grill grate and adjust the height while grate is still hot.4) alternately a pair of heat resistant gloves.5) 2 pairs of heat resistant tongs, one for fiddling with the coals/ash and another for cooking with.6) The nylon cover to help protect it from weather (better than nothing, but a garage or shed is best).Conclusion:Love it for its efficient size and shape, great sear marks and flavour.  Hate it for when the sky threatens to snow/rain.Precaution for those who live on the shore:I live by the shore and have salt water mist roll in overnight.  I MUST move it into the shed, as moisture/mist/condensation will collect even under the protective covering.  Also, a well oiled and cleaned grate will rust in the salt mist if left out overnight.
B00022OK2A I'm no metal expert but there is a big difference between real cast iron and the pot metal a lot of these cheapie grills are made of.  The Sportsman's is the real thing, plus has the solid look and feel of quality.  Not to mention a near perfect design, the large oval grill top gives plenty of surface area for even a backyard BBQ.  It takes only a small amount of coal to fill the bottom, and temperature is controlled by the sliding air intake near the bottom.  You can had more coal though the front door if it gets too low.I grilled 10 brats on it last summer and they came out perfect, of course I cheated a little because I precooked them in beer and punched them once with a fork.  That allows your grill to brown them without constant attention, and so they don't explode if it's too hot, plus they cook up in 8 minutes not 20 on a moderate heated grill.  I then switched to foil wrapped ears of corn, and finished the grill day off with a dozen shish kabobs with chicken, pineapple, sweet pepper, onions, and small heirloom tomatoes.  Everything came out great, and having participated in my friends sacrificial offerings disguised as a BBQ, I know the difference between cooked and hopelessly burned.Not to mention if you have a big gas or charcoal grill this is a quick way to do a smaller scale BBQ for just yourself and immediate family without breaking out then having to clean the big grill.  Best way to clean this, let it burn all the way down, take off the top grill, the door and the other small parts, dump the ashes (cold) into the trash, wipe with a damp cloth and your back in business total cleaning time 3-5 minutes.  Was it ever easier to clean a backyard grill.  FYI it's iron don't leave it outside in the rain or keep it wet it will rust!  Recommended, for all, but small children, or irresponsible pyromaniacs!
B00022OK2A This thing is awesome! Just big enough to cook for a small get together, but small enough to fire up for just two.  I currently have 8 different Weber Grill/Smokers - but I find I use this grill more than any of them.  A handful of lump charcoal and this baby is good for at least 4 hours.  Still learning different ways to cook with it, but this is much better than starting the range up in the hot summer.  TheLodge Logic 5-Quart Pre-Seasoned Dutch Ovenfits perfectly on top, and you could probably get two of them to fit without issue.It's also nice to place in the center of the table and everyone can cook their foods on it, then after cook marshmallows.  Food, Friends & Drink!  Life is good......
B00022OK2A For starters, there are no instructions. Look at the pictures. There only two screws and they hold the body to the base...kind of. There's a door on the front, seems intuitive, but when you pick the grill up by the bail the grill tilts forward and the door flops open. Maybe I'm slow, but it took a good ten minutes to figure out what went where. Also this is a pre-seasoned grill and there are no directions as to use and preserve the coating.Edit: I just used it and could not dump the ashes. Even a cheap hibachi has wooden handles to grab. With this you have to heft it by the bail and tip it which isn't easy to do one-handed given the weight of this thing. I really want to love it, but, so far, we're not doing well.
B00022OK2A After all, it IS cast iron.  It should last a lifetime.  It was very easy to put together, and we expect to use it for making kabobs on these warm summer days.  I think it took all of about 4 minutes to put it together.  There were no instructions and none were needed.We already have a charcoal grill, but sometimes you want just to cook enough for say two people and that's it, with no left overs.  This will do the job very nicely and not use a lot of charcoal.Oh, they recommend you place it on a concrete patio block to protect any surfaces underneath the grill.  The legs will get pretty hot, and the concrete block will absorb most of that, and not allow for any charring to take place under the unit.  You will need to have protective gloves on to handle the draft vents.
B00022OK2A Great cast-iron grill.  We have usually cooked on a typical Weber-type charcoal grill, and we still use that a lot.  But this little grill has become our favorite for a quick, fun family grill time.  We use a charcoal chimney to get the coals going (half of what we use in the Weber) and sometimes add food-grade wood chips to cook chicken, salmon, burgers, hot dogs, and steak. After grilling, I will remove the grate, add some wood, and we'll roast marshmallow over a small fire.  Clean up is typical for cast iron (no soap, just hot water and light scrubbing).  Just be sure to keep the entire grill (not just the grate) well-seaosned. To clean the outside, I use hot water, a soap-free scrub sponge, and then season the body of the grill while it is still warm (so that the water evaporates and the seasoning can sink in). If you like cooking with cast iron, this is a GREAT grill to get.  If you do not like cast iron, then this grill likely won't work for you.
B00022OK2A We've had a dozen of those cheap portable charcoal grills that either don't cook worth a darn or fall apart after a single season.  This one definitely won't be doing that. Very sturdy, good quality grill - quality we expect from Lodge. I have a feeling this is the last portable grill we'll ever have to buy, and it's a good thing because these are getting harder and harder to find.We BBQ throughout the year and this is perfect for the deck and porch. Mind you, if you're looking to feed the family and guests in your backyard, you need a bigger grill, but if you're camping or just grilling up a chicken, steak, or a couple burgers - this is absolutely perfect!  While the price of cast iron has sharply increased recently, if you take care of (see below) this grill, it will actually save you money over the years.NOTE:  This is made out of cast iron. If you don't know how to care for cast iron, you need to search the web for (easy) instructions on how to &#34;season&#34; cast iron. It takes time and anybody CAN do it, but if you're lazy and won't WANT to put the (little) effort into it, please DON'T buy this - you won't be happy.  DO NOT throw it away if it shows signs of rusts  - give it to lover of cast iron and they'll put the effort into it to fix it up - and they'll love you for the gift!
B00022OK2A The Lodge Logic L410 Sportsman grill is wonderful. I received this as a Father's Day gift and put it to work. 28 briquettes and cooked 4 1/3Lb burgers and 4 jumbo hotdogs to perfection. 1\" thick steaks cooked perfectly. Easy to assemble and clean.  Took a lightly oiled cloth to clean out any residual ash once it cooled. Stores nicely. I will mention it is heavy so be careful. It is cast iron and therefor weights a bit. Others have concerns about the tabs breaking off the door, but if you are moving it that much remove the door to move the grill.
B00022OK2A One of my friends received this as a gift to use for tailgating parties.  After a few uses, he decided it took to long to cool off, was to hard to clean and had put it back in the box with the intention of setting it out with the trash!  Fortunately before he did, he saw me looking at it on this website and asked if I planned on buying it.  I said yes and he said don't because he had one that he was going to throw away.  If I didn't mind it being used and a little rusty, I could have his.  I took it.  It was rusted but I scrubbed it, oiled all the parts, and seasoned it in the oven (it was still cold outside so I couldn't fire it up)!This little grill came in so handy when we bought another house in the spring and removed the stove to make way for the new one. I cooked on it everyday.  What my friend found as a disadvantage, I found as an advantage, it stays hot for a long time!I grilled everything, half smokes, kabobs, burgers, chicken, veggies, fish, etc. . . and nothing stuck!  I also grilled ribs on it.  I sliced them into individual ribs, placed them on the grill, and covered them with foil (crimped the foil around the rack with tongs). They turned out really good. I used my little cast iron skillet on top of the rack to scramble eggs, and blacken steaks (lots of coals needed for that).The grill is very durable and as long as it is properly taken care of will provide many years of grilling pleasure!  I really like it because the grill rack can be put in the sink for easy clean up and as long as it's properly seasoned, I don't have to worry about my food sticking to it.I also have a 22\" weber kettle grill that I use when I want to grill a lot of food or large items.  If I don't, I set this one inside of it on the grate and use it instead.  This is an excellent grill for a small household, and I recommend it over the other hibachi type grills.  It's great for camping but keep in mind that since it's cast iron it takes a long time to cool down, so start grillin' early!
B00023RSUA I purchased this set in 2006, but it came with a 3 batt charger and 3 batts.  Since then it has undergone continuous use from the spring to fall.  I have also added 3 more batts to get the jobs done in my yard (total 6 batts).  It is a convenient set to use.Hedger: Good at lasting a long time (just used it for some large bushes a few weeks ago).  No cord to keep track of makes this much easier to hedge with abandon.  Decent power, as I can go through normal size hedge branches and leaves without too much problem.  Also, no cord makes it easier to climb around my walls and just stretch my hand out to get to tall/far places.Blower: Goes through a batt fairly quickly.  Pretty powerful since it only runs on batts.  Easily clears off my sidewalk and driveway or loose leaves/grass/dirt.  I probably use this tool the most.Trimmer: Is decent, but not terribly powerful.  The replacement spools run about $14-16/3pk which adds up over time.  However, I almost never use the trimmer now that I've upgraded to the B/D 24v versionBlack & Decker NST1024 24-Volt Cordless String Trimmer/Edger, which is much more powerful and lasts longer on one batt.  Trimmer is good for just grass and small weed growth.  Don't go tackling big grasses and weed bushes unless you are a patient person.After awhile the 18v batts lose their ability to hold juice, and so after a couple of years, you will to either replace the batts or deal with less and less capacity.  Batts run ~$30-40.  I think this set is ideal for those who live in townhouses, or have small yards, like 1/4 acre.  It is VERY convenient to not have a cord trailing you.  No cord to roll up when you're done.  No gas or oil changes to bother with either.  After almost 5 years, everything still works fine (though the batts are getting lame).
B00023RSUA Got sick and tired of maintenance of my gas and corded lawn equipment, so I got rid of it and went electric (and cordless!)Price ($165) here is incredible based on what other places sell this kit for, so for the price I paid, 5 star easily.Pros:- so easy to start and use- 3 included batts (and a charger than can charge all 3 at once!) ensures you have plenty of juice for small to medium yards-lightweight tools, easy to maneuver-costCons:- cheap plasticky feel (I guess to keep them lightweight, everything's a tradeoff)- this is NOT for anything other than LIGHT yard work.  If you live in an overgrown jungle, do not get this kit.- I wish the string trimmer had dual strings coming out, not one, and the reach was a little longerI have just started using these, so no thoughts on reliability, but I have used all three tools.  Was most impressed by the hedge trimmer I think.  They took on a huge 6 ft. out of control loropetalum I have w/o any problem at all.  Wow...impressed with the power there.String trimmer is kind of weak, but I expected that...I mean it IS running on a BATTERY for pete's sake!  I did wish it had SLIGHTLY more reach as well, as I had to get really close to some of the walls that my grass grows next to.Blower is best thought of as a carport/deck/garage blower and nothing more than that.  It did great in my small carport and deck, but I would never try to use it for actual leaves (I would never blow my leaves anyway, rakes are faster imo).Anyway, a reserved 5 star...if we had half stars, I would give it a 4.5 for a great little kit at a fantastic price.Completely dependent on what kind and size of yard you have though.
B00023RSUA After passing this up last year when it was a deal of the day, I was lucky enough to stumble across it again this year and told myself, don't make the same mistake twice.  I didn't, and I have no real reservations about the purchase at this point.The main reason I purchased these items were convenience.  I was tired of hauling the electrical cord to the back yard so I could finish out the mowing.  I've never owned a blower or power hedge trimmer, so those were a bonus.Perhaps the best part of this package is that the edger has auto feed, meaning I don't have to tap it on the ground to advance the spool.  I absolutely love that.The blower works fine for what I use it on.  We have a patio, driveway and a small section of sidewalk that we blow off maybe every weekend.  While not exceedingly powerful at 120mph, it does do what I want it to do.  However, for some of the really dirty areas on the patio, water is still needed; which is what I was trying to avoid.The hedge trimmers are great and I can get through our 6 or so bushes without a problem.All in all, I think this is a great package of electric tools.  They have enough juice to do the job I need them to, but I can also see where they may not be very good for larger projects, especially with the only 2 included batteries.
B00023RSUA I bought this set in 2011 when moving to a new (to us) home with much more lawn, shrubs, and trees than I've ever had. I also have the 18V lopper so in all 4 batteries that fit any of these tools.First of all the light weight of these tools really helps. Batteries last long enough for me to do what I need to do and I always have spares if I need them. Second there are no cords to deal with, no gas needs, no oil needs, no pull starting, and the batteries are quick and easy to install and remove.The real champ of these three tools is the edger. I've used it now for about 15 months and have not had to replace the line yet! I bought a spare pack of three line spools and it is still unopened. Second the line auto-feeds; no tapping! It has lots of power to edge our two lawns, and trim around trees after I've mowed. It is quick and easy to rotate the head for edging or trimming. Sweet little tool.The hedge trimmer works great. We have lots of bushes and hedges that require a trim about twice a month. The best thing about this trimmer is how light it is.The weak link in the chain is the blower. It is just a little weak in terms of the stream of air it blasts. It starts out with a little more power but within a minute or so it slows down about 10% then stays there for 5-10 minutes until it really starts to lose power as the battery drains. I still use it, haven't felt the need to go out and buy anything with more power, but I still wish it had a little more umph! This is the reason for taking one star off.I wouldn't call the blower a \"leaf blower\" because it just doesn't have enough power to do a good job on blowing leaves off a lawn. The blower works fine for sidewalks and other hard surfaces. I use it after mowing and trimming the lawn.We live in a tract home. Our front yard is about 30' x 60' and our rear lawn is about 30' x 90'. I don't consider these lawns small by California standards. Due to these tools being cordless, and I also have a B&D; battery operated lawn mower, I can mow, trim, and blow off the sidewalks, patio, and driveway all within 20 minutes. I was never able to do that with corded electric tools or gas engine tools.For a typical mow, trim, and blow operation I use three batteries. One in the mower, one in the edge trimmer, and one in the blower.I often think, while using these tools, that I should run in and put a comment on Amazon - so today I finally did!!!
B00023RSUA I had purchased a grass hog like four or five years ago, and it worked well.  But when the batteries started not holding a charge well, I figured it was time to get a gas trimmer.  So I got one, a simple one that didn't need gas/oil mix, and immediately tore a hole in the siding at the bottom of my chimney the first time I used it.  Had more power, but I really hated how it threw the grass everywhere, trashing my shoes and pants.  So I went back to using the grass hog again, despite the batteries that didn't last.So I was about to purchase some batteries when I saw this deal pop up, and thought I'd go this route instead.  Wasn't that much more than just two batteries would've been, and I got a blower and a trimmer to boot.  Granted, I have no need for the hedge trimmer, and already have a powerful black and decker corded blower, but the cordless would be useful in some situations.Arrived quickly, unboxed, and my first disappointment was that the battery charger can't be mounted.  To me, for a unit designed to hang on the wall, that seems pretty stupid.  Also, as others have noted, it now only comes with two batteries, as described in the product details, not three as it used to.Hanging the rack was a piece of cake.  They use the types of drywall mounts I like, the large screw types that hold so securely, rather than the smaller ones that just have a little pop out in the back to keep them from pulling out.  So this thing mounts VERY well even if you don't get it in a stud.  Three screws to hold the metal bar to the wall, then four screws each for the individual hooks for each unit.As I said, I do have a corded B&D; blower, which works very well.  I knew this wouldn't match up to that, but it actually was even less than I had thought it would be.  I used it in my garage to blow out grass clippings and dust, and it worked fine for that, but anything else would've been pushing it.  Garage floor is smooth so things slid fine, but on my driveway, with the roughened surface of the concrete, it wasn't enough wind to dislodge the grass pieces from the rough surface.  This after being fully charged for about 16 hours.  But for small jobs, I will enjoy the convenience it provides of not dealing with power cords.Trimmer I can't attest to since I have no bushes, but it ran fine, not too noisy, and seems like it should do a fine job on them.The grass hog is a little different than the older one I had, but still the same basic functionality, and works just as well as the one I've been using for several years.  Nice to have new batteries again.Other than the underpowered blower and the inability to mount the battery charger, it was a good deal with the gold box offer, but as many have stated in their reviews, it's not for people with larger yards.
B00023RSUA I sure do love having this set in my shed.  I've used the blower extensively and the weed-whacker extensively.  I've never used the hedge trimmer, so I can't comment on that.Some perks..* it comes with two rechargeable batteries, which is super handy for heavy work days.  The battery charger also holds/chargers both batteries at the same time. Bonus.* Lightweight.  I never felt worn out carrying any of these around the lawn.* A wall mount with hooks comes with the set. So, I was able to hang these all neatly in my shed, just like in the photo.* Durable, good B&D; quality.The only bummer I've found with this set is that the leaf blower sucks the life out of the rechargeable batteries rather quickly.  So, don't dawdle when using the leaf blower.
B00023RSUA I just wanted to add my voice to those who felt that the battery life was insufficient.  After moving into a new home and using this set to catch up on a significant amount of neglected landscaping, we just felt that it didn't cut it.  We were swapping out the battery every 40 minutes or so (the saving grace was that there were 3 of them, so there was always another one ready to go--so long as you were using one machine at a time).  Also, I felt that the hedge-clipper and the blower were fairly weak at their intended purposes.  The hedge trimmer kept stalling and getting caught on the hedges.  The blower blows grass around--do not even think about using it on leaves.  I cannot speak for the weedwacker, as I was disappointed enough to return the set without even bothering to test it.
B00023RSUA I like these tools. They're plastic and run on batteries, but they work. Not as powerful as your gardener's gas powered machines, but for the homeowner who doesn't plan on any heavy duty shrubbery cleaning, these will do the trick nicely.
B00023RSUA I bought these shortly after buying Black & Decker's cordless electric lawn mower (which I also love), and I wasn't disappointed.The trimmer/hedge trimmer/blower work as you'd expect, the trimmer even features a telescoping body to adjust comfortably to your height. They are also relatively quiet and require no gasoline can or earplugs!The best part is that you get all three units for the price of just two of them sold separately! Plus, an unexpected but very welcome bonus is that this set comes with its own plastic mount for all three tools AND a separate mount for the batteries. I wouldn't have considered this a big selling point, had I read it, but having the ability to easily hang the tools in my garage out of the way and out of the reach of my kids is more valuable than I expected.Bravo Black & Decker!-1 star, however, because my package came with only two batteries (though to B&D;'s credit, they sent the third with minimal fuss once I contacted customer support).Oh, and once you buy these suckers, beware! Black & Decker have a whole product line of cordless drills, saws, sanders and other power tools that run on the 18-volt battery system, and once they pull you into the product line, all the other 18-volt products become pretty enticing!
B00023RSUA The easiest way to go., March 10, 2008By  P. Stein \"Bengals Fan\" (Beavercreek, OH) - See all my reviewsI previously purchased all three items separately. The broom works great on my outdoor carpet, and is much easier to use than a wet dry vac. Easily blows away lawn clippings. The hedge saw is much easier to use than my electric hedge saw, though not as powerful. Fair tradeoff. The trimmer works fine. Preferable to either gas or electric, though obviously less powerful. Again, a fair tradeoff. If you have to stop and recharge it, no big deal. I received a promotional radio/charger free. I just keep the battery in the radio charger, and it's always ready to use. Great for when you use a portable radio all day. Recommend you try to add the radio to your arsenal. I'm glad I purchased these items. It made my life easier.
B00023RSUA I had purchased a different yard combo about 2 month before and they where a piece af junk.  All the stuff ran for about 1 minute and then started running out of power.  The hedgers broke and I couldnt get them replaced.I wanted a set of these yard tools so I bought the Black and Decker set.  Yes the set was about 80.00 more and had less voltage but I was deturmined to get a cordless yard set.  When I received them the first thing I noticed was the construction was a lot better.  I charges them up over night and used the handy storage rack.  In the morning I got out the hedgers and trimmed up all my hedges on 1 battery then used the same battery and used the trimmer and then the blower all on the same battery.  WOW  The trimmers had more power then I expected, same with the blower.  I am very pleased with this set.  I recommend this set to anyone who is in the market for a cordless yard combo.
B00023RSUA First of all, this is a light duty set of tools.  If you've got a large lawn and garden to take care of, I think you'll be happier with a corded approach to electrical tools.  But I've found this perfect for my needs.  Each battery is perfectly capable of powering the blower for five minutes or so, and since you have three batteries you can clear quite a large area.  The clipper and trimmer are top notch and seem to run forever on one battery.  The blower is about half as powerful as the best corded models, but it's adequate for blowing junk over hard surfaces.
B00023RSUA My 11-year-old son will be helping me do the lawn work this summer.  To prepare him for this task, I bought this electric lawncare set so he wouldn't have the frustration of trying to start a balky gas edger/trimmer.The edger/trimmer works okay, but it has only one spool opening instead of the two opening like on my gas edger/trimmer.  The unit doesn't have much power to cut through very high weeds/grass or to sever the thick St. Augustine grass we have here in Florida.  But, with enough patience, it will eventually cut the thick grass shoots and does a good enough job with cutting just grass blades.  It's lightweight enough my son can use it without a problem.The blower is nice to have.  It doesn't have the power of a gas-powered blower, of course, but it has enough power to clear debris off the sidewalk or driveway.  Again, what you give up on in power you gain in convenience of having an electric-powered device.The hedge trimmer was a joy to use.  I can't believe I used my electric hedge trimmer for so long.  It's wonderful to be untethered to an electric extension cord!  The B&D; hedge trimmer cut effortless through my mature ficus hedge and it weighed no more than the corded hedge trimmer it replaced.Battery life is, generally, not real good.  I'd say that you can expect to get maybe 5 to 10 minutes of continuous use (such as when you're using the blower), or maybe 10 to 15 minutes of actual running time with intermittent breaks (such as when you're trimming).  On our 100x75 lot, one battery is needed to do all the lawn trimming, one battery is needed to do all the blowing, and one battery was sufficient to manicure the 6' hedge that runs about 30 feet on my front yard.In sum, I'm glad I got this set.  Having no cords or gas spills or troubles during start-up make it a pleasure to use.  I wish they had more power and long-lasting batteries, but I don't regret this purchase at all.
B00023RYS6 I inherited a Felco hand pruner from a dear friend who could not do any gardening any more due to health issues.  I knew they had to be good otherwise she would not give me an old pair of pruners. And boy, are they great!She had these pruners for a number of years, and they are still sharp and cut like new! I haven't had to sharpen them. They feel comfortable in my small hand.  They operate very smoothly, they lock very smoothly, much nicer compared to the others pruners I've used.  And they work!  I can cut through some thick branches with ease, despite being a relative weakling.If I ever needed another pair (even though I doubt this one will break) I would definitely buy Felco Hand Pruner.
B00023RYS6 I treated myself to a new pair of these a few years ago...good investment!There is simply no substitution for quality.  I have been using the Felco pruner for years; more years than I can remember and these tools are the best of the best.  Yes, you pay more for them but it is well worth the extra cost.There are a few things to remember about these wonderful tools:First, they are a bit prone to rust.  Most good pruning tools have this in common as it is the steel that they are made from that does it.  I have found that simply wiping them off with a paper towel and then wiping them down with an oily rag after use will pretty well take care of the problem.  It is interesting to note that I bought a pair of these pruners a few years ago at an auction.  They were ancient and completely covered with rust. I paid .25 cents for them.  A bit of rust remover, oil and elbow grease along with a good sharpening had them working like new in no time.  I still use them.Secondly, these pruners are easy to take apart and it is very easy to replace any part.  This is particularly handy when it comes to the blade.  To keep these instruments in top working order they need to be kept sharp.  The scissors action is far superior to the anvil type in both easy of cutting and less damage to the plant.  They must be kept shape though. Fortunately this is not difficult but it is the nature of any blade that eventually you will not be able to sharpen it and it will have to be replaced.  This is a snap.Thirdly, I have noted from working with others and talking to others that the major reason for dissatisfaction with this tool or any such pruner is that it will not \"cut.\"  Upon examination I have found that the reason for this not cutting is almost invariably the fact that people ask the pruner to do more than it was built to do...i.e. trying to cut limbs that are too large.  This is NOT a lopper.  This is not a cross cut or a chain saw!  It has its limitations!  Use the proper tool for the job and there is seldom a problem.Fourth, the model being reviewed here could indeed, as pointed out by several reviewers, be too large for smaller hands.  I suggest a smaller model.  They cut as well and fit the hand better.  They simply cannot cut as large a limb or twig as this one does.Fifth, you can indeed buy pruners for as little as five bucks...you can buy dozens and dozens of them over the years; and trust me, if you use them a lot, you will be buying replacements constantly.  Overall, it is far more economical to go ahead and buy the best, as represented here, and have something that if taken care of, will last far longer than you will.This is a good tool and if it is taken care of and not abused, it will last you a lifetime.Don BlankenshipThe Ozarks
B00023RYS6 I haven't owned these long enough to know how they will stand the test of time, but they seem very well made, have a sharp blade, are comfortable, and have smooth action.  I like that you can swap out the blade after you've sharpened it too many times.  Mine came with a tiny tool that can be used to take apart the pruners, replace the blade, etc.  Seems like something that will be lost instantly.  Would have appreciated it if they had designed this to store on the pruner body somehow.  Also, the aluminum is roughed up a bit towards the tip of the pruner.  I am assuming this is part of manufacturing process but it looks more like someone drug it on the concrete or something.  The rest of the tool is finished nicely.
B00023RYS6 These pruners are, of course, classic. Thousands of excellent reviews, storied history and millions of happy customers.I am not one of them.The F-2 can cut through all sorts of plants without difficulty thanks to the brilliantly sharp blades. These are excellent for ornamental gardening, but I find them unpleasantly dangerous and annoying for vegetable gardening.Cutting vegetable matter (raspberry canes, garlic stems, squash branches, etc.) quickly results in a gummy blade that does not open/close well. Obviously cleaning fixes that, but most people, including me, don't typically garden with a rag in hand. Further, cleaning the sharp blade becomes a dangerous proposition and has resulted in cuts as the blade slices through the rag to the skin.I spend my time working in the kitchen with sharp knives and in a wood shop with heavy machinery including many types of power saws - I've never had similar fear of lacerations in either location.This is also not a tool I feel safe allowing anywhere near my child. He's spent enough time in the garden that he knows how to use and treat properly pruners (with constant supervision.) I won't let him touch these.
B00023RYS6 Clearly of quality construction, but far too expensive given options that are available.  Mine were stolen from my garage, and I replaced them with a two-piece combo purchased at Costco for $19.00.  They come with a life-time replacement guarantee. The $19 item cuts just as well as the Felco and is equally comfortable to hold and use.
B00023RYS6 The most used garden tool is the pruners.  Cutting your plants back, you should make a clean cut as to not stunt their growth.  Again as things like small branches and trees grow you have to prune them back so this tool works great.  I work HVAC and always have a branch up my butt and love these to cut back plants around the condenser.  Buy it you'll love them.  As what people said about rust, these are make of steel and they do get a little rust but nothing big.  Stainless is a soft metal and would not work.
B00023RYS6 This pruner is so easy to use. It comes with a wrench and instructions on how to replace the blade. The cutting action is very smooth and the price I paid for this pruner was well worth it.
B00023RYS6 My mom owns a garden design and maintenance business.  I never really took interest in it until my wife and I purchased our first home.  As expected, we are now avid gardeners and landscapers.I really like Fiskars and had a set of them along with a cheap set from Target on hand.  My mom recommended that we step up to Felco Pruners.  She noted how she's had her set for over a decade and either takes them in for sharpening or orders new blades. They are built for life.I keep mine in my house with my nice knives.The motion is fluid and exact.  The cut is fine and thorough.  The ergonomics are spot-on.  I cannot find a weak point or complaint.  Be sure to buy the leather belt holster as well.Felco is a Swiss company that specializes in one thing for over 60 years - cutting tools.I wish I bought these sooner.
B00023RYS6 Works well and make each job so much easier.  Would recommend. Handle is comfortable which is so important during cutting.
B00025H2PY I purchased this product because I have a well and did not want to contaminate my drinking water, yet, I needed some type of insect intervention. After some flubs trying to apply it properly, I found it to be highly effective, yet non-toxic (so far!).The thing you will need to be aware of is that this stuff has the consistency of flour. It is very \"fluffy\" and coats things (this is how it kills insects). Orginally, my plan was to mix it with water and spray it. Unfortuntely, I purchased a stand alone sprayer which you prime manually to pressurize. Despite mixing this in the suggested 1 cup per gallon ratio (which I read about online), the stuff instantly gunked my sprayer and spoiled my visions of prancing around like Bill Murray in Ghost Busters (only for bugs).I ended up just using my hand and sprinkling it around my foundation outside. It was sort fo a messy and time consuming job, but I am already seeing good results. I have not had a single carpenter ant in my house since I did this, which is great.This product is costly. It is the food grade quality that makes it more expensive I believe. Please be aware that there are other versions of DE that may be cheaper, but be careful. Some, particularly Pool grade, is carcinogenic to humans and will not kill bugs. There is another type sold labeled as a garden product, but that contains added chemicals and bug attractants, which I was unsure about having possibly enter my ground water.
B00025H2PY This is a high quality food grade DE and is labeled as such .  Believe it is the finest powder I have ever purchased and is rated the purest I have found .  My wife and I use it internally, plus I use it on the yard, under my home, garden and my large dog pens .  It works well in my Dustin Miser (sold on Amazon) , producing a very fine cloud of DE dust .  Because it is a very fine powder it coats things well and kills ticks, fleas, Colorado potato bug larva, most ants, and even most hard shell pests . People don't think DE will kill hard shell pests but even they have connecting membranes between the hard shell parts, and legs that can be damaged or cut . This product was shipped FAST and I highly recommend it and this seller to anyone .
B00025H2PY I could not find food-grade diatomaceous earth anywhere locally. Most places had no idea what I was even talking about. I have a relative who lives in a low-income building that has repeatedly been infested with bed bugs. Although they have had professional pest control in several times, they always seem to survive. Tenants are forbidden to use any poisons due to their many tenants with health problems. This diatomaceous earth seems to have solved his problem in his apartment and he's now sharing the secret with his neighbors!This product was a good price; several dollars cheaper than similar products. Shipping was also more reasonable than others. And service was fast-it arrived in little over a week. I will buy from this seller again, should the need arise.
B00025H2PY I have been mixing a heaping tablespoon of diatomaceous earth (food grade) into my morning coffee every morning for one full month.  I cannot say I have noticed any physical changes for the better.  I have not experienced any of the following that so many other people say they have experienced while using this product:No improvement in skin conditionNo loss or lightening of pigmented spotsNo improvement in joint functionsNo regrowth of eyebrow hairNo increase in energyNo regularity in BMNo improvement in tooth enamelNo passing of internal parasitesNo improvement in hair and nail growthNo weight lossThere is nothing that I can honestly say is a positive improvement to my health after taking DE for a month.  I'm not saying it won't help you in these areas since so many others have seen great improvements in their health,  but either I am super healthy already (which is definitely not the case) or it simply isn't doing me any particular good.  Not everything works for everybody.  I am concerned about how radioactive it is and when I can remember to ask my husband to bring home the office geiger counter I will get him to test it for that and report back.  I have no idea exactly where they dug this DE up and it could be near leaking nuclear power plants or next door to radio active waste dumps for all I know.  I sure hope not though.UPDATE: 4.25.14This past week-end my husband tested the diatomaceous earth with a geiger counter and found no significant radiation beyond background radiation.  This is good news for those who consume a lot of it.
B00025H2PY We drink it and use it to control household 'bugs'. Helps with aches & pains as well as hair and nail health. I discovered this after using DE for years to control insects in the house.
B000279304 I like the spikes. It makes keeping my plants in good shape so much easier than mixing a fluid mix. Just pop it in and you're good to go!
B000279304 wow! I just may have green thumb, brought jobes and I'm already seeing improvements!!!! especially with potho's,will continue to use every 60 days!!!! hope they continue to grow all 26 of them!!!
B000279304 My wife and I have been using Jobe's houseplant food spikes for more years than I can remember; of course we have been raising houseplant for more years than I can remember too so I suppose that works out well.I can honestly say that over these many years that we have never once been dissatisfied with this product and much prefer it to the various liquids we have used from time to time.  Now we have lost house plants; make no mistake about that, but it has never been due to this product.  Normally I am the culprit in that I tend to overwater our plants and overwatering is the number one cause of houseplant loss.  You would think I would learn....These are easy to use and easy to monitor.  Depending upon the size to the pot being used, we adjust the number of spikes used.  The spikes are always placed as far from the roots as possible and buried to their full length.  Yes, the finally disappear in about two months.  Now you do not want to over do it as any plant food can burn the roots if over used but I will say that it is more difficult to do that dastardly deed with these spikes than many other form of food we have used.  They are easy to use, store well and we have had no problem finding them (to purchase) in the different area of the country we have lived.As to the amount used, the frequency used and matters such as they, it is best to do a bit of research on each plant you own.  Plants, like people, are different and they all have specific needs.  You can pretty well figure out what your plant needs via research and pure observation.It should also be noted that if you take advantage of the super saver offer here that the price Amazon is asking is more than reasonable...actually it is about half of what we pay her locally.This is a good product and we have been extremely happy with it all these years.Don BlankenshipThe Ozarks
B000279304 My biggest challenge will be not losing these in the back of a drawer somewhere before I use them all up.
B000279304 Plant spikes have been around for just about as long as house plants have.  They are one of the oldest ways of fertilizing potted plants as there is going. (Someone with roots in their blood once told me that solid fertilizer preceded the liquid variety by quite a respectable amount of time.  The liquid variety being easier, but not necessarily better).  A lot of folks don't seem to use them anymore since liquid fertilizers mixed with your regular watering are so much easier.  My own experience with both is that the solid, slow dissolving spikes last longer, feed the plant the nutrients more efficiently over the longer amount of time, and genuinely do a better job of giving your plants the extra boost of good stuff all house plants can use. I am not a horticulturist and certainly do not claim to know this is a fact over a reasonable theory.  What I do know is I have some of the biggest, healthiest house plants I have witnessed among my many peers that dabble in the home spun gardening trade as well.  I stopped using liquid fertilizers years ago and have had excellent results with these spikes.  You thumb them down just under the surface every couple of months and watch your house plants love you for it.  I highly recommend the Jobe fertilizer spikes, and, I also recommend that if you can't or don't care to locate them locally, that you buy them in bulk here on Amazon and make the shipping worth it.  Made them part of a bundle package with something else and they ship for free at the time of this writing.  Try them for just one or two of your plants and see if they don't make you smile...
B000279304 My gardening over the past 20+ years is strictly self-taught.  What I do know is that for years I have used Jobe&#8217;s spikes when initially planting anything, whether in the ground or in pots, as an aid to help them thrive, and they do.  For potted plants, I usually put a couple more in every year.  For me this is an easy as well as effective way to fertilize.  At the current $1.97 for 50 spikes, they are very competitively priced.
B000291GBQ bought this to replace an older burner that died.. this thing packs some heat.  the legs are sturdy the hose is plenty long
B000291GBQ Fired this burner up this weekend and it seemed to run great.  Flame is control is acceptible and you can turn it down low if you need to.  I recommend running it hot before putting a pot on to burn the paint off in the flame path.  The paint burning left some marks on the bottom of my pot which were hard to get off but its not a big deal.
B000291GBQ I've been using these for years and need another one.  I saw this on Amazon and scooped it up right away.  Killer price with free shipping.  Check the prices on this at your local stores and you'll see what I mean.  This high pressure cooker is what I use to cook big pots of food outside.  Like steaming crabs, gumbo, soups, stews, deep frying - - you name it.  It's made strong, for heavy pots.
B000291GBQ I purchased this to brew my batches of beer outside during the summer months (it gets too hot inside having a pot boil for so long..and my wife doesn't like the smell either). I was very pleased at the quality of construction and the ease of using this. After setting it up and testing for leaks using soapy water...I was ready to go.  As others have mentioned, the paint does burn off many places during its first use. I didn't buy this to look pretty...I want it to brew beer...and fast. And fast brewing it certainly does. After using it a few times, I feel more comfortable cranking it up to high. Definitely watch out as boil overs are much easier than on an inside burner. Overall though, I would estimate almost half an hour is saved by using this burner vs. the stove (I do partial mashes only). Good investment for any home brewer...and it can double as burner for frying turkeys!
B000291GBQ [Update June 11, 2012: I'm still using the Bayou cooker several times a week]I bought this for two reasons:1) If it's hot out, I'd rather not heat up the house.2) I can't stand frying indoors.  I don't like the odors and I don't want oil/grease in the house.  We don't have a big outdoor vented hood in the kitchen.  Now I'm able to fry outdoors much of the year.It's a very simple unit.It's light-weight and very portable.  The propane tank weighs far more that the cooker.I use the cooker for wok cooking.  Although I have a very good gas kitchen stove, none of the burners give off nearly as much heat as this Bayou cooker.  At full blast, the Bayou cooker makes a whooshing sound like the gas units used in Chinese restaurants.The reason why I rated it 5 stars is price per performance.  I'm not comparing this unit to more expensive units.
B000291GBQ This is a very useful outdoor gas cooker. Very rugged and well made. I use it a lot and have been great so far. Good price too.
B0002HSFBC I bought a stove top smoker a few years ago and although I do not use it everyday, I do tend to use it quite often. The problem is that I cannot find the fine wood chips at the regular stores like Wal-mart or Target. These store usually have the really large chips or blocks but not the fine dust like chips one needs for this type of smoker. I have looked at other online stores and found the chips but they were more expensive than at Amazon. What I also like is that this particular pack of chips has an assortment for using with various different meats such as for smoking fish, pork chops, etc. Also, since the smoker I have is a Cameron brand, this is perfect. I especially like the alder for Salmon.
B0002HSFBC The small shaved size of these wood chips are perfect for a stove top smoker or any light smoking job. The chips smoked nicely with no off or greasy oily residue. I really loved the Cherry but all four were great. I smoked cheese, garlic, and salmon and the taste was fabulous.
B0002HSFBC These chips are exactly as described, and work perfectly.  No complaints, no confusion, no aggravation.  Isn't it great when a description fits perfectly?
B0002HSFBC stovetop smoking:  even the Li'l Smokey can do half a bird or a steak and give you that surprise smokey experience.
B0002HSFBC These work great in my stove top smoker and are cheap enough where you can try several types of wood out to see what impact they have on flavor.
B0002IKUE6 The hose is good quality, and it appears to not be kink-able.  The all-important connectors are very good quality, and appear to be well connected.
B0002IKUE6 I like this hose. It is a dedicated hose for flushing my black tank. Works very well and seems to be a good build, good quality, good price, and works great. Will update PRN.
B0002IKUE6 I wish I'd ordered the 75-foot version since 25' isn't long enough! The cardboard label also says NOT APPROVED FOR SALE IN CALIFORNIA or something like that. So maybe the Hose Police will come and get me and drag me away. It's surprisingly lightweight and seems very flexible, then again it's brand new, and the 10-year old hoses this is replacing were supple, once, too. I can see ordering a second 25' length, since 25' is actually not enough to reach anywhere in my tiny yard.
B0002IKUE6 This is a sturdy hose, with thick tubing walls and solid brass fittings. It can kink under certain motions but not esaily -- call it kink resistant but not never-kink. My previous hose burst at a kink point, but this one seems much thicker and reinforced, and less likely to give way in that manner. I like using it just fine.
B0002IKUE6 Just as i hoped - this is a fantastic buy - did not leak and is working well so far. Just get it. Small reminder that 25 feet is a small length.
B0002IKUE6 I used this over the summer and it never tangled.  It is a lot heavier than my other cheap hoses.  I will be buying more of these.
B0002IQ96Y My husband really likes this because, he said it covers a good amount of the lawn and he doesn't have to move it so often.  It adjusts easily, its sturdy and our grandkids had fun cooling off on those hot days too!
B0002IQ96Y There were forest fires around us last summer and I had a couple of these around.  I set them up to water out in the fields around us.  They worked so well that I bought 6 more just for this purpose.  As I am driving around my area; I see that I am not the only one who uses them.  They are sturdy, don't leak for the most part and the sprinkler head is of decent quality.  Unlike some other tripods, the sprinkler can be replaced with another if needed.  They will fall over if you have a decent windy day.  So, you should check on them occasionally.
B0002IQ96Y Forget those spikes that bend or break when you shove them into hard ground this is the ticket and even if the sprinkler head should fail its easy to take off and replace . How do I know that you ask ?? I was getting water from a lake and the intake  hose sucked mud so I had to clean and replace the sprinkler.  But all in all love the stand
B0002IQ96Y The travel settings are very difficult to use and it often sticks.  It also sprays as much water out the side as forward.  The tripod is the only good thing about this sprinkler.
B0002IQ96Y Great product.  I have at least ten of these.  I wish I could buy the tripod without the brass sprinkler head.  I replace those with Naan quiet heads.  I hope Orbit maintains the quality.  The two I bought yesterday seem to have cheaper connector.
B0002IU8K2 I had used rockwool, but after reading some reviews thought I'd give these a try.They keep an even dampness better than rockwool. Rockwool can easily get drenched, but these seem to keep just the right amount of moisture.When I first got them I was surprised how much they looked like moist chocolate brownie cake. Even the spongy feel made me think &#34;This must be delicious&#34;. I never caved into that temptation, but to this day they still look and feel more appetizing than most brownies. I give a star for that alone.They also fit perfectly in the &#34;Hydrofarm CK64060 Hot House with Heat Mat,&#34; which is convenient.
B0002IU8K2 i wish the hole was a little smaller for my more delicate clones but for the thicker root plants it works great!
B0002IU8K2 These fit plastic trays available at WalMart and Home Depot. Easy to water and can plant entire plug without damage to seedling roots.
B0002IU8K2 I'VE USED THESE EXCLUSIVELY FOR STARTING SEEDS. SO FAR, I HAVE AN ALMOST 100% SUCCESS RATE (I'VE KILLED SOME SEEDLINGS ON REPLANTING, THOUGH). VERY CONVENIENT AND EASY TO USE.
B0002IU8K2 I bought these after much research about cloning.  It seems that these come the most recommended from experienced growers.  In a humidity dome my clones took root after about 7 days with a 100% success rate.  I have also started some bell pepper seeds with rapid success.  Would highly recommend to anyone.
B0002IU8K2 Man these are great I mean great never had roots to shoot out and so bog in such a short time less then 8 days from cuttings to rooted plants going to transplant them all into larger pots today I'll never not use these again great things they are
B0002IU8UW as described, came quick, no issues
B0002IU8UW I received the Grodan rockwool 1.5 inch cubes with 45 cubes in the package. Following their directions, the cubes have worked well in starting my chard seeds for my hydroponics garden. Though I haven't seen anyone else mention this, I noticed that once the chard plants were full-sized and had well-established roots directly in the hydroponics solution, the chard appeared to prefer my leaving the rockwood cubes dry so they could stand up better.
B0002IU8UW These rockwool cubes are a good way to start cuttings. Light, sterile, easy to handle and affordable. They do the trick.
B0002IU8UW I compared this to to peat pellets for rooting a camilea from cuttings.  These had a higher success rate than the peat pellets.
B0002IU8UW Been using rockwool cubes for cuttings for a long time now. Have always had good luck them them. I normally start seeing roots after about a week for most of my cuttings.
B0002IU8UW These work very well, I think.  My seedlings came up just fine and without any issues.  A recommended buy.  Thank you.
B0002XK0IC I've always wanted a smoker, but wasn't willing to spend the money on a top of the line model. Plus, being a bit of a lazy cook, I wanted to get something that didn't involve a lot of fuss and muss.So, when I saw this Brinkman electric smoker, I thought I'd give it a shot. While Amazon is my usual place to shop, I have to confess I got this from the big box home improvement store (\"depot\"). They had it on the web site for less than half the Amazon price with free shipping. Plus had a coupon that took several more dollars off the price. Couldn't pass it up. Granted, the one I got did not include the cover, but that's not a problem since it will get stored in a sheltered area.The construction quality is not what you would call top-notch, but acceptable for the price. Assembly is straightforward - need a screwdriver and pliers. You will also need to season the smoker before using it for real. Simple process - just coat the inside with vegetable oil and then run it for 3 or so hours.Easy to use and the food is wonderful. I mean wonderful!! And so easy - basically just fill the pan with water, put in some wood chunks, put on the food and leave it alone for a few hours. That's the type of cooking I like!Clean up is a bit more involved since you have to clean the water pan and the grates. But both fit into the dishwasher, so I only have to wait for things to cool then toss them in for cleaning.I'm sure the smoking purists will scoff at the idea of an electric model, and the more expensive ones will probably last longer and work better. I'm also sure that this does not have the power to work well in very cold temperatures. But for summertime smoking, you can't get better than this for the money (assuming you get it at the depot) . Highly recommend!Note: I was also very impressed by the customer service from Brinkman. The water pan had a big dent in it from shipping (the depot shipped it in just the manufacturer box, and it must of taken a hit from UPS). The dent was deep enough that it cracked the metal, and I was concerned about long-term leaks and rust. I called Brinkman and five days later, a new water pan arrived via FedEx. No hassles, no forms, just quick, polite, effective service. Rare to find that these days.
B0002XK0IC I have had mine for 3 years now and love it. The assembly is minimal and the seasoning prcedure makes all the parts stay in great shape. I do a fair amount of smoking of meats (weekly) and it has been performing well. I have not modified it and manage the internal heat by using the right amount of charcoal and monitoring the unit every 20-30 minutes. Having worked with experienced Pit Masters, they all say the same thing. You have to pay attention to your fire, lift the lid as little as possible, monitor the temp, add more as needed. The only downside, true for all the water-smokers (hence 4 instead of 5) is adding can be challenging but not impossible. Patience is required. Would I buy it again, yes. Most of my smoking is done between 200-225F, and it does from ribs and whole turkeys very well. Even smoked a meatloaf! MMMMMMMMMM
B0002XK0IC I have had 2 of these.  Lost the first one in a divorce.  Had it for many years.  Replaced heating element twice, possibly my fault for not cleaning it.  Body and grills never rusted.  Did an excellent job smoking tons of food.  Decided to order the new one.  Love that you can place the grill on the smoker barrel for height when grilling, no more grilling on the ground.  Also stoked about the added door for refilling water and adding chips.  Assembly was quick and easy.Was disappointed to see the dome is scratched in multiple places, and the water bowl had several dents in it.  One of the dents was so deep I am surprised it did not make a hole, but the paint is gone around the dents and continuing to flake.  Not bad enough damage to warrant packing it back up and sending it back, but still disappointed with the result.There was no apparent damage to the packing material, so assuming it looked that way when placed in the box.
B0002XK0IC Though the design of this unit is pretty good for the money, the cheap Chinese manufacturing makes it a waste of money.  Out of the box the powder coating paint was damaged both on the lid and the water basin.  Though this may having been from shipping, there was no evidence of any rough handling.Along similar lines, assembly of this unit is pretty tedious.  Lots of very small nuts and bolts that have to be applied.  The second evidence of cheap Chinese manufacturing was that one 1 of the three handles went on correctly.  The tolerances for the mounting holes in the handles were off, requiring me to have to force the bolts into them, and bend the handles to make them fit.I would recommend that you consider a more expensive gas or charcoal smoker.  If for no other reason, the electric version is not water resistant.  What do you do if you have it out on the deck or patio, smoking some meat and it starts raining?  You don't have many options.I contacted the manufacturer about it arriving with damage.  They suggested that I buy replacement parts from them.I recommend that you buy a traditional wood fired smoker.
B0002XK0IC I chose this smoker mainly because I found it on sale at one of the home improvement warehouses for only $69.00!.  I chose electric because I like the idea that the temp remains constant.  The downside is that the temp is not adjustable.  On a cool day the temp seems to hover at 225 F which is nice for longer smokes.  The documentation says it should be smoking between 250F - 275F.  I don't think it can get that high because of some minor issues in its shape.The smoker has no intentional venting.  However, the drum of my unit is not perfectly round; it is oblong.  This causes two gaps about 12\" in length and about 1/4\" wide at its widest point.  At first I was concerned with this, but after tasting a brisket and 2 chickens I have smoked, I like the results.I have yet to try the unit on a hot day so it will be interesting to see what the temperature rises to.  I also wish the unit was built with a thermometer to read the temp.If you can find one of these for cheap, grab it.  This is a great intro unit to smoking.  I hope I get 3-5 years out of it and then I will upgrade to an insulated unit (if I am still smoking.BTW, this can double as a small grill.UPDATE:  Okay, 6 years later I am on my second Brinkmann.  About 2 years ago the heating coil broke and I had to replace the whole smoker.  I actually go a deal at one of the home improvement store by taking their floor model that was missing the water basin.  Got the replacement unit for $49.  I have been smoking now for 6 years and I love it.  Here is what I have found out about this unit over the last 6 years:1. Temperature remains pretty constant.  The key is the water basin.  On a long smoke, when I do a 10- 14 lb brisket. I usually have to refill the water basin.  This can be tricky because the basin sits under your meats.  Try to position your meats so that there is room to add water, or use a funnel and open the side door.  Always add hot water when you fill the basin.  Adding cold water causes the temp to drop in the unit (the basin is absorbing the heat)2. There is not enough room to do ribs laying flat unless you cut off the tip.3. I have trouble getting briskets up to the optimal temp 185-190 unless I wrap it and put it in the oven at the end.I still think this is a great entry level smoker and while I am now looking to move up to something else (probably a green egg), I love this little guy.  The consistency in temp and the inexpensive price make this a great smoker to learn the basics on.
B0002YTO7E This is a great hatchet that Paul would have liked to have had in his wood choppers tool box. There was a heavy storm in these parts fairly recently with very strong winds that knocked down many trees. Two of my neighbors trees fell into my yard and tore up my cedar fence. I also had my largest hardwood tree get blown over in my backyard where it fell without causing any damage. I sure wish Paul was available to help me out. Instead of Paul, this Fiskars hatchet came to the rescue in helping to clear up this big mess. Yes, I had to use a chainsaw as well when it came to cutting up the tree trunks. But the hatchet made short work of chopping up a lot of the branches. The hatchet has a nice heft and a comfortable grip. The blade stayed sharp far longer than I had anticipated. This is a must have tool to keep at hand. A great tool and a great price...
B0002YTO7E Perfect little hatchet for small needs, excellent construction and the wife just luvs it, and if she luvs it, then I luv it, for nothing better than coming home to a fire in the wood-stove :)
B0002YTO7E I have really come to love the Fiskars tools.  I bought a post hole digger which is head and shoulders better than everything else, and this hatchet is the same way.  It is different than others in many ways.  It looks different and honestly a bit fragile. However it is one tough mother.  The lightweight handle gives you more head speed, which translates into deeper cuts per chop.  The angle of the blade and the non-stick coating really slices through wood.  The way the blade is attached provides no place for the head to bind up in the wood which again allows you to cut deeper.  I am buying one of the axes in this line too.  Awesome tool.
B0002YTO7E The blade is sharp and the construction is solid. It is small light enough to take on trips yet still able to cut through wood quickly. I would recommend this to anyone with a need for a hatchet.
B0002YTO7E I purchased theFiskars 7884 X27  36-Inch Super Splitting Axe, and was very impressed with it, so I thought I would give the hatchet a try. It is great, the blade is heavier than other blades, which helps build up the momentum and splits the wood nicely.  I like the plastic handle because it feels a little more durable than a wood handle.
B0002YTO7E I give this product 4 stars because I really don&#8217;t use it much.  I do recommend this product and especially this manufacturer if you are looking for this kind of tool.  It&#8217;s well made, lightweight and holds a good edge and of course, it chops wood well...
B0002YTO7E I bought this because I was so please with my other Fiskars ax.  It certainly lived up to my expectations.  Solidly build with an unbreakable handle and holds a great edge.
B0002YTO7E This little  hatchet has a well balanced feel when swinging and is great for chopping kindling and small firewood. Looks well made and would recommend it
B0002YTO7E The hatchet is just the right size and comes with a safety cover which was a nice surprise.  It has a good grip and feel.  Like all fiskars products I feel confident in using it due to their lifetime warranty.  I would definitely buy/ recommend this hatchet.
B0002YTO7E great quality and balance. I'm not really into writing the product reviews so adding this filler to satisfy the required number of works.
B0002YTO7E I started buying Fiskars products for my floral business.The small pruners were exactly what I needed for delicate flowers.I was impressed by how easy they were to handle & super sharp.Next was to buy larger  pruners,then moved to gardening Fiskars etc. Just loved the sharpness and design.We recently bought a wood stove for our stand alone cabin/guest house& my husband needed more wood split than the usual fireplace wood.I got the axe,then he had to cut some &#34;splinters&#34; for starting the woodstove.This axe perfectly fits the bill ! .It is lightweight,extremely sharp,easy to maneuver,and once again,Fiskars,still made in Sweden(maybe Finland)produces far superior results.Top quality,lifetime guarantee,great addition.Can't find a fault,including a very fair price.
B0002YTO7E This stays sharp and never lets me down.  It is light weight and the head is very secure...it won't work loose over time like some wood-handled hatchets.
B0002YTO7E I like virtually everything Fiskars makes, and this little axe is no exception.  Kept sharp, it cuts any wood briskly and evenly.
B0002YTO7E You will not be disappointed with any Fiskars product, and no, I do not work for the company. Wish I did. All the Fiskars axes adn hatchets are wonderful. I went a little crazy a few months ago and ordered about one of every size axe/hatchet that Fiskars make and I love each one equally. The handle, the look, the design, the price. This is a top of the line product. Anything else other than a a Fiskars is a waste of your time and money. Ohhh, Just had a thought....I did buy the Fiskars sharpening tool as well. The Fiskars sharpening tool is a piece of junk. It broke when I tried to use it the first time and I was completely unimpressed, but I did not return it to the vendor, too much hassle. The axes/hatchets are GREAT though and you will love them.
B0002YTVJA These pads are useful where you must be on your knees a lot.  If you must clean up, work on the car, or other activities where you must kneel, then having one or more of these pads might be a good idea.
B0002YTVJA This pad could be larger and thicker. It seems a little overpriced for what you get. When they say ultra light, they aren't kidding. I also left this outside for a couple of days by mistake. It survived, but was the worse for wear.
B0002YTVJA This kneeling cushion was used for the sole purpose of gardening. The foam may be water resistant, but it is not very thick and your knees can feel the sticks underneath it. The foam does not have a protective coating like other kneeling pads I have used, and therefore it takes the shape of whatever it is sitting on (for instance your knees and sticks below your pad). The kneeling pad could be improved for gardening; therefore, I would not recommend this product for gardening.
B0002YTVJA well what can I say about kneeling mats other than I really like it. Right size and glad I was able to find this color. I use it all the time and it looks like it will last me a long time. Others I've bought before only lasted a year before falling apart. So far so good.
B0002YTVJA Yes, it's just a piece of foam with a hole in it, but it's light, it's tough, and it makes working on your knees much easier. I suppose you could recycle an old foam camping mattress into several kneepads,, but if you don't already have one to recycle, this works just fine.
B0002YVDSW I at first was disappointed with the item when I pulled it out of the box as it is VERY light. But don't let that fool you: this trowel is very strong and perfect for loosing up weeds (in between flagstone or in gravel), mild digging (2-4&#34; rocks) and full potting. I am going to buy another for my Grandma as this item is so light it will be perfect for her. I imagine it cannot handle excessive force, but given it's weight it is pound-for-pound as strong if not stronger than a metal or other material counterpart. PLUS it can't rust, which is great for me since I live near the ocean.
B0002YVDSW I was disappointed since I thought it would be stronger. I still use metal trowel for digging when durability of a tool is needed.
B0002YVDSW For some reason this was going for a very low price - I bought it because of that and only afterwards learned how nice a lightweight trowel it so have!
B0002YVDSW I am not happy with this trowel because it bends when digging in hard/compacted soil. I suppose if you have sandy loam...you might be good. Not for me.
B0002YVDSW Seems like every other week or so it randomly drops to 84 cents as an add on item. You simply cannot beat that price. I got several for my son and his friends to play with in the dirt and some for the front and back yard. It is a ridged plastic but dug fine in hard dirt for me. Don't go prying up rocks or it might break but for general digging it is just fine. But you can abuse it all you want and if it does break you are out less than $1.
B0002YVDSW This is a pretty cheap and lightweight trowel.  It is made from heavy duty plastic.  The tip chips a bit when used with rocks, but is perfectly fine for everyday use.  It seems nice and strong.  The handle does not bend.
B0002YVDSW I bought two trowels from Amazon, one with a really big scoop and this one.  I use this for my smaller plantings.  It is well made and that is true with Fiskars.  You can count on that manufacturer to sell a good product.  It is small and that is what I was looking to buy.
B0002YVDSW One day I couldn't find my old garden trowel (a neighbor had borrowed it for concrete!) so I ordered this one. What a difference the lightness alone makes! A GREAT product.
B0002YVDSW I needed a trowel that was non metallic for digging in dirt when treasure hunting.  As long as you're not digging in extremely hard dirt, this works just fine.  I don't use it for anything other than this so can't comment for gardening use but I'd say it probably would work just fine.
B0002YVDSW What do i like about this, it's great for light work.  Like planting small seeds where you sprinkle them and I also like it that it wont rust.  I wouldn't even think about chopping stuff with this, but it is a good tool in the gardners box.  But the price verys so much I got this for a one buck as an add on item.  Don't pay to much for this.
B0002YVDSW While not as strong as a trowel made of metal, Fiskars 7978 Composite Trowel is still strong enough to handle basic gardening tasks.  Made out of a composite plastic called `FiberComp', the tool is very lightweight.  The blade is oversized, quite wide, and appears to be quite sturdy.  The rock solid handle is probably the strongest part of the tool, and snapping the blade off would take a great deal of force.  The handle has a spot on the top for your thumb, and a slot at the end for hanging.This tool will not corrode, and if not abused, it should last for a long while.  The price at Amazon is a little steep, so may want to check your local hardware store for a better deal.
B0002YVE54 Occaisionally this drop to less than $1. I ordered a couple as it was so cheap. I use it a bit in the garden but it is also great for kids to use in the sand or dirt.
B0002YVE54 It feels light in my hand and this composite material is so strong, I've never had a problem with any of these tools.  Since it is so light it seems like there is less stress on my forearm/wrist as opposed to the heavier metal one I was using before.
B0002YVE54 I wanted a non metallic tool when treasure hunting with my metal detector.  This won't set off my pinpointer and perfect for loose dirt and/or getting debris out of the way on the ground.  It's light weight so easy to carrry.  I'd use it for gardening around the home but for me flowers are nothing more than something to aim for with my mower ... so really not used for the \"proper\" purposes!
B0002YVE54 excellent tools as are all the Fiskar tools I've purchased.... for non-metallic tools, they are very nice and strong, non-magnetic tools......
B0002YVE54 Fiskars 7977 Composite Cultivator is certainly not as strong as a similar cultivator made of metal, but it's stronger than you might expect, and is a tool that is well-suited for light duty gardening.  Made out of a very stiff composite plastic called `FiberComp', tool is very lightweight.  The handle is rock solid, and while much thinner, the tines are surprisingly hard as well.  While this tool is most useful in soil that contains some moisture and is somewhat soft, it is capable of more rugged performance.  The handle has a spot on the top for your thumb, and a slot at the end for hanging.This tool will not corrode, and if used properly and not abused, it should last for some time.  The price at Amazon is a little steep, so may want to check your local hardware store for a better deal.
B0002ZINDY Earlier this fall, after a very expensive service call from a plumber, I found out that some creature chewed through the rubber tubes of my forced air heating system (plumber left me a chewed tube as evidence). I recall seeing some dropping in the basement, they did not look like mouse dropping (tubes rather than balls), so I got both a mouse trap and rat/chipmunk trapBig Snap-E Rat Trapas I don't want to have another service call.I am attaching a photo of both next to each other for size reference (I was wondering about this before buying both).  This weekend I set them both up, and they were fairly easy to set up. The instructions did not mention what to use as bait, so it took me some research to find what works best. It appears that many people find that peanut butter works best because it is sticky and cannot be easily carried away like a piece of cheese.I placed the traps on cardboard I cut away from a large cereal box.  This will make it easier to handle the disposal of the intruder.I was a bit worried that I will have trouble setting it up as due to a recent back surgery I can't put a lot strength into pushing on levels, but it was not hard. I had to push on the level until it caught a hook. The trap was fairly easy to set off, while I was moving it around to place in the right place it got set off. Luckiness I was not moving it with my hand.  Note that it got flipped and moved about 2 feet away from where it was before it triggered.Ali Julia review
B0002ZINDY This Snap-E Mousse Trap by Kness for $3.45 was set for a small yard rat (Woodrat I think) and it was sprung the next morning, but no rat.  I'll rebait and set again tonight or tomorrow and see what happens.  It sets easily and the Bait bowl is good for seeds or peanut butter.  Will hold up to rain and wet as it is plastic.  I will Modify my review if I feel it is required.  It's OK.
B0002ZINDY I had this very mousetrap in Logansport, IN for six years in a house rental and it served me well.  I was renting an old stone house by a wooded area with a field next door.  Not to mention, I'm lazy when it comes to mowing the lawn, so it often became a field mouse paradise especially late in the year.  I typically stop mowing in September waiting for winter.  That means the mice are gonna come my way to get out of the cold and go crumb hunting or carpet chewing in my house!I could hear the little sneaks in the evening when in bed. Knawing on the carpet edges, or some box they chewed into of my food. I wanted them out.  I noticed down in the half basement they liked the smell of salt near the top of the water softener.  I could tell by the dropings. I bought one of these mouse traps, and baited it with Andes mint chocolate. Mice appear to love the stuff.  I jamed it into the little hole and set the trap near the salt smell.  It wasn't a half hour later I got one, and scored three on the day!Over the next few years every time it got cold the mice would sneak in the house and I'd clean them out with the trap.  It usually managed to get them all, one year I got over 30.  A huge accomplishment for one little trap, at the time I've never bought a second.  The beauty of the thing is that it's easy to set using the second bar, and easy to release the dead critter.  A hungry cat lived nearby, so I would fling them over the fence by pulling on the second, no-touch mouse bar, and kitty would finish them off.I moved into a \"new\" (new to me anyway, built in 1955) house a little over a year ago in Fort Wayne, IN.  I noticed the past owner left out mouse poisons in several areas.  I couldn't have them around because my little dog Sandy would probably eat them if he found any. I searched the web for this type of mouse trap, and lucky found the same one I used nearly 15 years ago in Logansport. I bought two for me this time, and two for a friend, and it took only one day to clear out all five mice in my house.  My friend said his apartment was clean in just a few days.  I still baited with chocolate, he used cheese, but I think mice prefer the Andes mint chocolate bars better!
B0002ZINDY Its the old fashioned spring loaded - knock 'em dead trap.  Safer to handle compared to many others of this type and the most effective of the traps i used this very &#34;mousy&#34;  season
B0002ZINDY Great mouse traps. an upgrade to the wooden ones. My mice were licking the peanut butter off the wooden ones so i got these to try. the same night i caught one. These things will get them becaue they have to use there legs to trip the trap.
B0002ZINDY There really isn't all that much that I can add to whats already been said about these new fangled traps.  Let it just be said that they are best design and have the best function available if you are in the market or favor the old fashioned original traps we all grew up with.  I've been setting mouse traps for over 40 years and have never really gotten my finger smashed.  Yet I still shudder and am nervous every time I set one.  Everything in the old traps is there and exposed and you fully have to pull back the spring action to set it.  This trap utilizes a V shaped mechanism where the trap and spring handle are split and half, and only a fraction of the strength is needed to set it and get the same deadly tension.  You simply lift the handle that is standing straight up to release the victim in the end.  Also, this trap employs a small cup for bait as opposed to the inefficient little hook thingy that for too many of us I'm afraid, has only served as a buffet for many a mouse that managed to get the meal and make a successful escape. The little cup necessitates the mouse digging at the meal with the tension platform totally surrounding it.  I have never seen yet a mouse escape with the meal with this thing in charge.  This is it folks, the proverbial better mouse trap.  It's cheap, always available here on Amazon, (they are also carried but often are sold out at my local Lowe's) and most of all they do the job they are intended for just great.  My highest recommendation...
B0002ZINDY Of the newer snap traps, the Snap-E Mouse is the best built I've tried.  It's made to last awhile.  Unlike the traditional traps, the Snap-E makes disposal of the victim's corpse much easier; no touching the mouse and an extremely easy to operate release mechanism.  Definitely worth a little extra money.
B0002ZINDY I get no joy out of killing them, but the voles have driven me to this. Nothing has worked, not the castor oil, the bleach, the ammonia, the commercial pest deterrents,  or the dish detergent. This week I set up traps, some the old fashioned wooden types and one of these Snap-E traps.I've only caught one vole; it was with the Snap-E within hours of setting it. Set up is simple, no tricky bar to set. Filled the bait cylinder with peanut butter and pulled back the metal bar until it clicked into place. Removing the dead vole was easy too. Wearing gloves I lifted up the bar so the vole could drop to the ground. I buried it right there.It's an unpleasant business, but the Snap-E trap is efficient and effective.Update - I've caught two more voles with this same trap. Removing the vole is so much better with this trap than with the wooden one.
B0002ZINDY But not mine. It has managed to set off one of 3 I have set up, but it avoided getting caught, just as it has for 3 wooden d-Con traps. When I got these I was very optimistic because the bait is actually hidden and the mouse would have to investigate the smell and put its hand on the trap releases to get a better look at the food. Nothing seems to trick this mouse. I don't know what to do. It's been 2 weeks since I set up these traps.Does anyone have any food suggestions to bait with? I've tried peanut butter, walnuts and ranch dressing.
B0002ZINDY For years my family has relied upon the original old-fashioned wooden mousetraps to catch any mice that might be roaming around.  Recently, it seems that the mice are becoming smarter because they eat the cheese & peanut butter clean off the trap without setting them off. After this happened a few times, I decided to try to find a better mousetrap and came across this SNAP-E MOUSE TRAP.The trap works on exactly the same principles as the old wooden traps.  You place the bait in the middle of the trap and pull the spring back to set it.  The difference is that the trap has an incredibly strong spring.  Because of this, the trap is made of a sturdy plastic.These traps are incredible!  There's no chance of the vermin licking the trap clean because the trap is very sensitive.  Also, with the powerful spring on the trap, they are killed instantly.I have tried using other types of traps before, but these SNAP-E MOUSE TRAPS are by far the best mousetraps to catch & kill a mouse with.  Highly recommended.
B00062KQ42 Hey everyone,I bought this looking for a cheaper alternative to my Jobe's organic fertilizer hoping this would save me money. Sadly, I have yet to see any results from this. I applied it to herbs, veggies, etc and had no change in the plants at all.I decided to do a side-by-side comparison between the two. I'm comparing this product toJobe's Organic Vegetable & Tomato Granular Fertilizer 4-Pound Bag. Here is what I got.I'm testing this product with squash, all the squash has been started from seed.With Earthworm Castings;Pro: Holds more water, so less watering.Pro: Better price.Con: Little to no growth. It's been a few weeks now.WithJobe's Organic Vegetable & Tomato Granular Fertilizer 4-Pound Bag;Pro: Fast growth.Pro: More leaves, and has blooms.Pro: Seen results within a few days.Con: Price.Con: Don't hold water like castings.My suggestion so far: Mix them both together.If anything happens to change with this I will update my review. But right now the castings appear to help very little.
B00062KQ42 Used this with my plants this year and I really think the extra nutrients in it have helped them grow.
B00062KQ42 Just works for what it should.  It amends soil and is clean ie no bugs. Other than that I have not a lot else to say.
B00062KQ42 I use earthworm castings to feed my plants and to provide some free earthworms that seem to come with the product.  I guess there's eggs in the sack.  I also use castings to spread around the base of any plant that's having white fly trouble.  Seems the flies don't like castings and so they leave.  I add a few cup-fulls of castings to each potted plant too.
B00062KQ42 Most people have already said what needs to be said.Excellent product,good for TLO mixes,composting and top coating n teas.One more word,seriously.LMAO!
B00062KQ42 Bought this to use in the potting mix for my peppers and it works great.  Once you've got your plants potted use this stuff ever 3rd week with a rotation of CalMag and Fish Emulsion and your peppers will really love you and POP!
B00062KQ42 I have an old mallow bush that has had a white fly infestation every year beginning in the spring and running into November.  It is the only place in my yard where whiteflies have been a problem. Because the honey bees love the mallow flowers, I have not wanted to use a systemic or spray with harsh chemicals so the white flies have been right at home there for ten years or so.  In early March this year I placed about a half bag of earthworm castings on the ground under the mallow, spreading them several feet on all sides of the bush.  To my delight and surprise - no white flies on the mallow or surrounding area this year. They've moved away from my yard.  The honey bees are not at all turned off by the castings and continue to enjoy the flowers.  Now that I've seen how well they work, I will never again be without a supply of earthworm castings.  I can't believe I didn't know about their benefits earlier in my gardening adventures.
B00062KQ42 Real easy to work with and no stink. It mixes in quick and my plants are happy campers. Life is good.
B00062KQ42 I've used other brands of earthworm castings, but this is my favorite.  As soon as you open the bag you can see and smell that it is genuine worm-poop.  No, it doesn't stink, it just smells earthy and composty, but very identifiable.  My germination rates have increased tremendously, and better yet, the survival of my sprouts after germination as also increased.  Since using this additive to my germination mixes, my success in the greenhouse has really boosted my confidence.  I even started my own little worm farm, but they could never produce as much as I need, so I will definitely be purchasing more.My only complaint would be to the seller as far as shipping goes. (subtract 1 star) The bags are heavy.  I bought 4 of them with several other items.  They were tossed in one end of a long, narrow box, the other lighter items in the other end.  Guess how my box arrived?!  Duct-taped like crazy from the carrier (thankfully) because the heavy end of the box was totally ineffective for shipping heavy items.
B00062KQ42 _Depending on the plant you put these on/in, it'll do a fantastic job.  For what I grew, rumor was that I needed about five more products to aid in growth.  This turned out to be pretty much the only thing I needed (besides soil, of course).  A definite buy.
B00062KQ42 Nothing like worm poo to help fertilize the garden.  Worm poo is supposed to be spread at a rate of 1lb of poo for every 10 square feet.  So be mindful of how/where you need to use this stuff.  I purchase it for my raised garden beds.  It is one of the things that I use to refresh the garden at the beginning of the season.
B000667W4A A baby red squirrel...well....this is his dream buffet...attaching photos! I will attach 5 photos as proof...He's a cutie and he is very photogenic! I bought three of these. Scroll down to Customer photos the last 5 photos are mine... It's a very cute squirrel but to call this squirrel proof is totally FALSE!
B000667W4A I splurged on this double sided feeder, and placed it outside my den window so that I could watch both feeding stations.  This feeder replaced an older \"squirrel-proof\" feeder that had rusted away two years ago, and had been a sore disappointment in both the birds it attracted, and the squirrels who turned it into the neighborhood hangout.I've filled this with a good quality backyard bird blend, and have been THRILLED with the birds we've seen during the first week!  We've had the usual cardinals, blue jays, and sparrows, but for the first time, we've enjoyed chickadees and yellow finches.  It has been a true delight to watch during afternoon feeding time.For over 25 years I've maintained one or two feeders, and done very low-key suburban backyard birding, all in the same 1920's heavily-treed neighborhood.  I have to say that this is the most successful feeder I have put up yet in terms of the birds it has attracted, and the fact that no squirrels have yet made it their hang-out.  As far as the seed spilled on the ground, there's another group of birds that seem to find that attractive, so it isn't going to waste at all.The feeder comes with a perfectly adequate pole, as well as a hanging arm, your choice which to use in your yard.  The pole put it at window height in my yard.
B000667W4A We've been inundated by squirrels raiding (taking over) our platform birdfeeder that came with our country home.  After extensive searching and reading of consumer reviews, we decided on the Heritage Farms bird feeder.  It looked extremely durable and it holds a lot of seed.  The perches are weight adjustable so you can exclude blue jays or pigeons from eating the seed if you want.  I had the feeder set up in no time and it took about 1 hour before the first bird lighted on it and started eating.  Soon, the word was out and several birds were enjoying the seed.  We look forward to many years of enjoyment - it's built like a 50's metal toy truck, if you're old enough to remember!!
B000667W4A The squirrels quickly learned how to open the lid. One morning, I awoke to see a large grey squirrel scrunched up INSIDE the hopper, chomping away at the seed! I chased him away, took the feeder down, and made an insert of heavy 1/2\" hardware cloth. I opened the top and crammed the hardware cloth over the seed (I made it to come way up to the top but didn't fill the seed to the top, hoping to discourage the squirrels) and re-hung the feeder. That worked for 2-3 days, until the squirrels learned that once they opened the lid, they could push in the sides of my \"wire cage\" to get to the seeds. So there he was again, inside the hopper, wedged between my wire insert and the window. The squirrels later learned how to remove the insert! My idea didn't work. Secondly, this feeder is usually sold complete with the pole sections, the grounder and hardware for mounting, for the same price as this one. This is the feeder only.
B000667W4A We are looking for another feeder, so when I got to this page I thought I would tell you why this is the one we're going to purchase.We got our first `7536' feeder  over 10 years and we still like it.  For one thing it holds an entire grocery store size bag of sunflower seeds and for another  the birds love it.  Frequently both sides are filled with our feathered friends while there are others waiting in the tree for their turn.  [Thus our interest in another feeder.]Presently we have Chickadees, Nuthatches, Cardinals, House sparrows, Wrens, Gold finches, the occasional flicker and small woodpecker visiting.  When we lived it Texas it was convenient to exclude those pesky, though attractive, jays.Initially I think (okay--my memories a little faded after a decade!) it did keep the squirrels at bay, but that hasn't been the case for many years.  In fact, our local `free-range' squirrel has the glossiest coat you can imagine.  But we don't really care as he is so jealous of the feeder that he keeps other intruders away.The lapse in squirrel-proof-ness is probably due to years of collected grime and dust that clog the springs.  That and just the passage of time.Four Stars.  Our feeder is doing just fine after 10 years.  I think the other reviewer is wrong in saying that this feeder is available for less money.  I think what he has seen is the one sided version of this same feeder.  I say this because we have searched around a bit in order to save money.And about the squirrels--we saw a PBS special one time that showed what a gray squirrel would actually do for lunch.  They had these squirrels climbing, jumping, and riding in little wagons through a long tube to get to a bird feeder.  I concluded after watching those experiments that `proofing' was a ridiculous notion.  LOL.
B000667W4A This has been my best 'Squirrel Proof' Feeder to date and I now have six various kinds of feeders meant to keep out the 'grey hoards'.  When filled with mixed seed it also attracts the greatest variety of birds of any feeder I own, particularly Eastern Cardinals. Is VERY heavy when fully loaded and I found that hanging it is more secure than using the included pole. You MUST use a long and sturdy hanger to keep squirrels from hanging onto a branch or tree trunk and bypassing the weight triggered closing mechanism. Will keep out at least 90% of your Squirrels which usually content themselves to forage on seeds dropping to the ground below the feeder.
B0006856EQ This product is great to use along with Hydrofarm CK64060 Hot House with Heat Mat or just for 2-3 small to medium house plants that need extra grow light.
B0006856EQ I received this grow light stand with light within two days of ordering it.  Assembly took my husband ten minutes for stand and light fixture,  He's a carpenter so he can easily put things together.  \"This is easy, it just takes common sense!\" he commented.  For someone like me who needs step-by-step instructions though, it may have taken me a bit longer.  There are instructions for the light fixture assembly but he didn't even open those.He noted that the light fixture is slightly uneven on top (the hooks aren't evenly placed) but that is because an inch is needed for the electrical cord once the light is hanging from the stand.  So don't let the uneven hook mounts fool you.  Once the lamp is hanging there is very little wiggle room for the lamp to dangle.And what a bright light it is.  My little 10\"x20\" germination set almost seems too small!  Depending on how far away the light hangs from the seed box (the distance is easily adjusted with the white cord) this light could easily provide light for a seed box twice the size with regular rotations of the seed boxes.  After 12 hours ofnon-stop burning, the lamp did not get hot.The stand is sturdy.  But what amazes me is the brightness of the light.  Just one lamp in the dining room provided more light than a night light at night.  I may have to find a more inconspicuous place for this thing.All I have to see now is how long the provided lamp works.  This stand is a tad expensive but if it provided the medium to grow seedlings evenly, it's worth the price.
B0006856EQ I purchased one of these last year and used it this spring for tomato and pepper seedlings.  The ease of use and amount of light provided by this item was amazing compared to an old plant light I'd purchased many years ago.I just ordered a second one and will give my old light to a friend.Since I had a lot of seedlings, I draped a mylar sheet over the entire thing and it reflected the light wonderfully.I really like how easy it is to adjust the height.  My old light only has 3 static levels and you have to maneuver the entire light fixture on the arms from one setting to another.I've already purchased 4 bulbs and expect the two lights to serve me for many years to come.
B0006856EQ I replaced a very expensive growing system that uses proprietary bulbs and plant containers with this item, a few inexpensive clay pots and a shallow pan/tray to keep the pots in.  Live plants I've put under this light immediately start growing toward it and plants have much more room to spread out.  I'm just now trying to germinate some jalapenos so we'll see how that goes, but just for keeping fresh potted herbs from the grocery store alive indefinitely this thing is terrific.  A couple of transplants from the proprietary system (cilantro and mint) were struggling in their confined spaces but now are exploding.  I bought a live basil plant from the grocery and it is thriving (although parts of it are going to be sacrificed on top of a pizza tonight).My only complaint was that the power cord wouldn't connect tightly to the light fixture.  It kept falling out.  I didn't know whether the fixture or the cord was the problem and I didn't want to return the whole thing, so I went to Hydrofarm.com and sent a note via the \"contact us\" page describing my problem.  In a couple of days a very helpful guy named Nick wrote back and said he'd seen this before and a replacement cord had always fixed it, and could he send me one?  Long story short, the replacement cord he sent me did the trick.  Thanks, Nick!A minor thing to know: I put mine on a timer.  I have timers all over the place but realized that this requires a grounded (3-outlet) receptacle and none of my timers were 3-outs.  So I got the Intermatic TN311 for cheap here on Amazon and it does the trick.  No fancy stuff, you can't control it with your smartphone or otherwise do cool tech tricks with it to impress your friends and neighbors, but it is silent and it just works.
B0006856EQ This was a little difficult to put together for me with my disabilities. But I did it! I wish it had two lights. I tried to start seeds with it, but they do better in my Aero Garden . I'm hopingIt will be enough to keep my pepper and tomato plants going until spring. The replacement bulbs are not all the same, so be careful that you get at least what you got with it. I'm still trying to find some that are affordable and will do the job.
B0006856EQ I had always just used a regular lamp and a south facing window. And only had limited and some what pathetic results despite years of trying. I finally decided to stop messing around. Put this on my Amazon Wish List for Christmas and was happy to get it. Combined with a seedling heat mat under my seedlings I am seeing faster and healthier growth in all of the seeds I planted. Many of those only sprout in full sun, and I do not think any of them would have come up without this lamp. Very excited, and have just ordered another one!
B0006856EQ To address some things in other reviews:1) My Hydrofarm box was packed inside another box with padding materials, unlike others who've complained that theirs was not and thus arrived damaged.2) The frame was not warped, twisted, or otherwise misshapen.3) Mine does have the blinds-like pull string to adjust the height quickly and easily, no s-hooks in sight.Those points address
B0006856EQ This starting system is well built and perfect for starting your seedlings, the T5 light does a very nice job, I would even go as far to say it's a must have for your home growing!!!
B0006BFQJS I was somewhat skeptical that a lopper could handle a 3 inch branch - that's usually something that I would use a hand saw for. But this lopper actually comes through! It's the first lopper I've used with a ratcheting head which took me some time to get used to. You open the handles wide and the head snaps fully open. You then repeatedly open and close the handles and the jaws ratchets shut until the branch is cut. While this may seem to entail a bit more work, it's much easier on the arms and shoulders since you're cutting only a portion of the branch with every stroke. The head locks in the closed position for secure storage.The extendable handles work well, and have a click stop every few inches. No problems with the handles extending or retracting unexpectedly.The head is an anvil type head, so it's best used on dead wood since the anvil crushes the limb when cutting. Live wood is best cut with a bypass lopper so there's a clean edge.I use this mainly to chop up cut branches into manageable lengths. Makes quick work of the process. Good build quality - hoping for many years of use.
B0006BFQJS I've had these loppers for about a year now. They have a wide jaw and can ratchet through some fairly big limbs. However, they tend to bind, to jam in the open position, and the handles flex too much and can pull right off the blades, although they are easily reinserted.I do not regret the purchase, but these loppers need to be somewhat higher gauge. They are delicate for the force that you can apply.
B0006BFQJS This a very good tool and cuts very nicely. I agree that it does a nice job cutting, however, I give it 4 stars because the handles are a bit weak looking and flex easily when trying to cut live branches that approach 3 inches, and I am afraid I will snap the handle if I put too much pressure. That happens when the handles are fully extended or not...so 4 stars. With that said, it works as advertised. It can be locked closed. Be careful and it should get the job done relatively easily. I just wish the handles were sturdier.
B0006BFQJS If you clear any brush this is the tool of choice.  It will take off 3 inch branches with ease and the telescoping handles allow for a long overhead reach for limbing trees.  I couldn't get along without mine.
B0006BFQJS I only had to keep this for one day to realize that it had a manufacturing defect which may or may not be evident on others.The cutting blade only has a washer on one side.  When you try to cut something as large as 2&#34; the blade will bend to the sideand cut into the stop.  Bad deal.  I returned it for a friskas which I am happy with.
B0006G51KC The Perky Pet 203 CP is difficult to fill and clean since the only opening is the diameter of a soft drink bottle.  Perky Pet makes other models which open on both ends allowing you to clean and fill the glass jar though the larger end.  That means that you can use a soapy paper towel (rinse well afterwards with hot water to remove all traces of soap), to clean the bottle rather than having to purchase and use a narrow bottle washer brush.  This model also lacks and included hook for hanging.I have and far prefer the Perky PetPerky-Pet 130TF 8-Ounce Glass Top Fill Hummingbird Feederwhich has not of the above shortcomings and is a easy to fill and clean.  It comes with a small \"S-Hook\" for hanging, too.
B0006G51KC I'm generally satisfied with this purchase - I mean, the hummingbirds use it, so what's to complain about?  The actual materials and construction do feel a little chintzy, and after filling and flipping over for hanging, I always end up with a hand streaked with sugar water.  Acceptable, but nothing special.
B0006G51KC Works great, the humming bird loved it. I would recommend this to anyone, great product!Bees don't get caught in the feeder so it is wonderful
B0006G51KC We've seen Hummingbirds around our backyard, but never thought to put up a feeder.  While I was looking for something else, this feeder was displayed...The pros:+ Reasonably priced & free shipping was included.+ Small 8oz size, with a nice shape... easier to hold on to!+ Hardened glass+ Removable perch.+ Hanging wire is included.+ Small size = easier cleaning & fresher nectar.+ We haven't noticed any nectar dipping out of the feeder.The cons:- The attachment screw for the removable perch is steel, I upgraded ours to stainless steel.- The first feeder had to be returned, as one of the yellow bee guards was missing.  The Amazon return process was very easy & I had the replacement within 2 days.  Now that's customer service!&#9642; Our homemade nectar:To make a batch of homemade nectar, we add 1/4 cup of regular sugar to 1 cup of boiling water.  We use a 2 cup measuring cup, filtered tap water & 3 minutes in our microwave gets the water to a fast boil.  Pour in the 1/4 cup of sugar, stir & let it cool.  This is the exact amount needed to fill the 8oz feeder.  We decided not to color the nectar, as most say it's not necessary.&#9642; Our cleaning routine:The cleaning is very easy & should be done at each refilling.  While the freshly made nectar is cooling, we prewarm, then fill the glass bottle with boiling hot water & let it sit.  No need to scrubing the inside of the bottle.  Next we pull off the bee guards & set them in the sink to be cleaned by pouring boiling hot water on & thru them.  The last item to clean is the base & perch.  You guessed it, more boiling hot water is used to flush everything clean.  No need to pull anything apart, the boiling hot water will get to all the nooks & crannies.  Cleaning = piece-of-cake! :)&#9658; Notes:&#9642; It's easy to tell when the feeder is completely empty, as the Hummingbirds will move from one flower to the next testing each flower for nectar.&#9642; It disturbs the Hummingbirds to remove the feeder for refilling, so we do this now after dark.  When we did this during the day, one Hummingbird would come within a couple feet to investigate!&#9658; Update - April 8, 2013The Hummingbirds have started visiting our feeder, so I've upgraded our product rating to 5! :)&#9658; Update - April 28, 2013We have regular vistors now & it's a real treat to have the Hummingbirds frequent our feeder.  The formula we're using seems to be perfect, as the Hummingbirds love it!Not want wanting to be without a feeder, we decided to buy a spare one... just in case ours needs to be replaced.&#9658; Update - May 15, 2013When the \"spare\" feeder was delivered, we were surprised to see the bee guards had been redesigned.  Instead of the square shape, the bee guard is now rounded... a more realistic flower shape.  Today we installed those bee guards & right away we noticed the Hummingbirds spending less time probing & more time perched & feeding.  Yes, the improved shape is a winner in our book!&#9658; Update - November 24, 2013We never realized Hummingbirds stayed around our area this late in the year.  We don't get as many vistors, but they do come by, so we make sure the feeder is kept filled.&#9658; Update - November 29, 2013 - A problem & a solution!&#9642; It's getting cold now & there's a problem with the nectar freezing!  I had to use a hair dryer to melt the ice that had formed.  This worked, but I decided a better solution was needed.  I wired up a single red 7 watt, C7 incandescent indicator bulb (like a Christmas or nightlight bulb) & attached it to the glass (touching) with Velcro ties.  This keeps the nectar in the upper forties when the air temperature is below freezing.  I have a red bulb installed & the red light doesn't look bad at all, especially at night!  I'd post some picture, but this listing doesn't allow pictures to be posted. :(&#9642; We noticed that the Hummingbirds perch on the side that has the bulb, so we think they enjoy the heat given off by the bulb as they feed.&#9642; The temperature has dipped to 10F & there's no ice forming on lower part of the feeder.  The heat from the small 7 watt bulb can't keep the entire feeder ice free when the temperatures are too low.  We notice the Hummingbirds like to sit near the light to keep warm while sipping nectar.
B0006G51KC While I try to always keep plenty of flowering vines and plants around that are hummingbird favorites, I also make sure to keep nectar feeders available throughout the entire hummer season.  They always seem to show a preference for certain natural flowers; but there are many stretches of time when they're feeding solely from the feeders.Several years ago, someone suggested to me that I put out my hummingbird feeders earlier in the spring (early to mid-March here). The male hummingbirds arrive earlier than the females in order to find an ideal feeding and nesting spot.  This gives them a leg-up (wing-up?) on the other males in wooing the females when they finally arrive. Well, I did as suggested and it worked! For the past three years, we have ended up with a nest in our large crape myrtle tree at the end of the porch. It's been fun to watch as the babies begin to fly and drink at the feeder. Hummingbirds are devilish little things...quite territorial and aggressive (even with their siblings). Because of this territorial nature, I've had to hang an extra feeder to reduce the squabbles. Hummingbird habits may vary by region or type, but having the multiple feeding holes on each of the feeders has been unnecessary since they fight each other off and usually only one bird will feed at a time.I've been using this feeder in addition to theAspects 429 Hummzinger Highview Feeder.  While the Aspects model offers the advantage of slightly better visibility of the birds when feeding, this Perky-Pet Pinch Waist feeder has one difference that I find very beneficial.  Because it's important to not leave nectar in the feeders for more than 2-3 days during very hot weather due to spoilage and bacteria build-up, this model by Perky-Pet is considerably less wasteful of the nectar.  With the Aspects model, you must fill the feeder up to a fairly high level in order for the hummingbirds' beaks to reach down through the hole to access the nectar.  However, with this Pinch Waist style, I can pour just an inch or two into the bottle at a time (rather than filled nearly all the way to the top as seen in the product page photo).  When the bottle is inverted, even that small amount of nectar is immediately available for feeding.  As a result, I'm not having to regularly throw out and replace old nectar.  I just put in however much nectar they'll eat in 2-3 days time and then rinse the bottle with hot water and add more nectar.  It seems to be the  birds' favorite feeder, too, since it appears to receive much more hummer traffic than the other one.
B0006G51KC I have had several feeders that leak or the hummers don't like it including the Aspects 153 & 367 models.  I admit the Aspect model are easier to clean but if the birds don't care for it...  I live in Florida where hummers at my location are not large as in Texas and Cal.  So the size is better for refilling here.  Bees are not a problem here  and the yellow bee guards do not draw them to the feeder.  In fact, I cut small hole in the guards so the hummers could feed easier and also I liked the contrast of yellow because I could have taken them off completely. As for the color you could paint them with hobby shop paint or just nail polish.  Anyhow, I like it and the birds like it what else do you need.
B0006G51KC Took a while, but the humming birds finally found the feeder.  I'm hoping we're on next years rotation and they tell their friends.  I had no idea humming birds were attracted to red...
B0006G51KC To begin with, we have and use a very large number of feeders and have for years.  We have a very large number of different feeders which have been collected from here and there over the years.  We have been using this particular feeder in our arsenal for about six years now - as a matter of fact at present we have five or six of them in active use.Like most things we purchase and use in life, there are good things and bad things about this particular feeder.  Nothing is perfect and nothing is absolutely bad and useless.  Most hummingbird feeders fall into the middle and probably one of the biggest problems with this feeder and other feeder is simply expectations.  Some folks set the bar very, very high, while others more or less are willing to take the bad a long with the good.  We personally fall into this category.Now let's start with the positive:First and foremost, and I feel the most important, is that these feeders do attract hummingbirds and the little guys seem to like them. During peek season we actually have trouble keeping all of our feeders filled on a daily basis, ergo, we rotate the filling and cleaning session.Second, these feeders are extremely economical.  To maintain and use as many feeders as we have would be a major financial strain if we used only the high end feeders exclusively.  We have quite a number of these too, but hey there is only so much money in our household to devote to this one project.Third, the four perches provided are a welcome addition and I feel is one of the big attractions causing high usage.Forth, these feeders contain only 8 oz of nectar solution.  This \"forces\" me to continually check them and since we maintain so man feeders there is less likely hood of my getting \"lazy\" and not changing the unused (a rare occurrence) as often as I should.  There is less likelihood of cloudy and contaminated nectar.fifth, these are easy to hang in various locations and in winder they are quite easy to store and do not take up all that much storage space.Sixth, these are plastic and if you drop one, something that I frequently do, they will not shatter.  It is discouraging to drop a 20 or 30 dollar feeder and spend an hour making sure you get all the shatter glass cleaned up to say nothing of the loss of money.Now the bottom side:First, these are not \"forever\" feeders like most of the glass feeders we use.  They will over time, depending upon how much sun they get per day, deteriorate, become brittle and break.  We personally get from two to three years use out of each feeder but at that is an acceptable cost for us.Second, yes, these things are just a bit more of a pain to clean than some of our other feeders.  We do need to use special little brushes and to do the job right, they must be completely disassembled.  This is not a great burden though and truth be told, I kind of enjoy the process and it gives me a chance to check everything out to make sure all is well.Third, the bee guard is not 100 percent effective.  Small bees can and do get into the feeders and the guards are completely useless as to the ants we have here.  On the other hand I find that a coating of Vaseline to the wire holding the feeder pretty well stops the ant problem and since these things are being constantly cleaned and refilled the few bees that do get in, while unsightly, are not that great a problem.All in all, for us, the positives far outweigh the negative.  Is this the only feeder we use?  No, most certainly not.  I took a look the other day and we have about 10 different feeders in use at this time.  By the end of the summer we will have more when the birds become more active.  Is this be very, very best feeder we have?  No, but they price wise and effective wise they serve their purpose quite well.We are quite satisfied with this feeder and will continue using them as long as they are available.Don BlankenshipThe Ozarks
B0006G51KC I hadn't put out a feeder for several years, but a little green hummer kept bopping over the the patio this past week whenever I was outside.  He'd hover and dart around the chimes and lights, making it obvious that he was looking for a feeder.So ... I ordered two of these because I wanted some that were small, affordable and had a bee guard.Thanks to Amazon, they arrived very fast and my little hummingbird has already found it.He's happy and I'm no longer feeling guilty.These are easy to fill and just the size I wanted.
B0006G51KC I used Perky Pet feeders for many years and was always satisfied, however they must have changed their quality control people because the ones they sell now are junk. If you just screw the bottle on to the base snugly, they leak, and if you try to tighten them they twist off and have to be discarded. The flowers and the wasp guards do not stay on after a couple of washings and have to be glued on.
B0006G51KC This is a good Hummingbird feeder, but once you start feeding Hummingbirds, this is way tosmall.Once the  Hummingbirds started coming to the feeder, I had to refill this at least 3 times aday.I then bought the BIG large feeder, and had to fill it everyday.Please do NOT buy the colored hummingbird food. The Red Dye is Unhealthy-poison to the Hummingbirds.The red yellow feeder and sugar attracts the hummingbirds not the red dye.Your can mix your own hummingbird food using :1 cup white sugar, too , 2 Cups hot, or warm water to melt the sugar.Stir very good till all the sugar is melted.. It should be a bit thick.Do not give it to the birds till it cools down.Do not be discouraged if it takes a few weeks before the hummingbirds find your feeder.I could only give this a 3 star for the small size.
B0006G51KC We really enjoy the free show right outside our kitchen windows where we have hung two hummingbird feeders. We have visitors from dawn to dusk, though they tend to go take a nap on really hot sunny days - perhaps the nectar gets too warm to suit them. It's so interesting to watch the different feeding strategies - some hummers hover and dive in for quick sips; others perch on the foot rest and guzzle. It is rare to see 2 or more birds at the feeder at the same time as depicted in the illustration, since they are quite territorial, but it does occasionally happen. The birds seem to have learned who refills the feeder. Several times when I've been in the backyard weeding or watering, a hummer will hover right in front of my face, maybe 2 feet away, and make eye contact. I'm sure he's saying \"hey lady, the feeding trough is empty!\" Sometimes they buzz right by my head when I'm sitting out there reading. As I said, they're always entertaining :)We have seen some bees on the yellow part of the flower, but not enough to be a nuisance. The major issue I have had with the feeder is the tendency to drip after you refill it. I always bring it indoors to clean it under hot running water, then refill with homemade nectar (4 parts water to 1 part sugar boiled briefly until the sugar dissolves). When I refill it in the kitchen sink and carry it outdoors I invariably dribble a little sugar water on the floor. Do you know how hard it is to clean up sticky sugar water from the floor? I should know by now that it would be better to refill it outdoors!Others have criticized the plastic parts, which won't last forever, but at the price, I don't mind having to replace it every few years. I had an all glass feeder a few years ago which was quite a pretty piece of art, but I gradually broke off all the flowers and perches, and it only lasted about a year...
B0006G51KC One was well packaged and the other not thus the plastic bird banches that stick out one was twisted off,  Both had different tops.  and unsure if they will even survive one season,  Was very disappointed in these,  They look nice but are very cheap
B0006G51KC I love this feeder.  I only have to fill it every three days as it is in the shade the majority of the day.  I've had mine well over a year with no sign of aging or even fading of the plastic parts.  The glass holder is sturdy and has not broken even though I've dropped it twice on my kitchen floor.  I am ordering another one today while on sale.  Glad would pay the full price for this, though!
B0006G51KC The pinch waist glass container holds just enough nectar to be consumed before it spoils.  Our delicate, tiny hummingbird guests enjoy being able to light on the little perches at each fake flower and drink without having to hover.  This is a simply-designed, low cost feeder that performs well and doesn't leak.  I don't see how a more expensive feeder could make our precious hummingbird guests any happier than this one does.
B0006G51KC Cleans easily and the hummers seem to like it.
B0006G51KC The body of this being glass is very nice so it will last in the hot sun and survive the dishwasher.  However, it makes it pretty heavy, so if you are using a window hanger, make sure its on there REALLY good.  The body comes unscrews from the top hanger easily, backing it a breeze to take down and refill.  Not sure 4 seats are necessary as hummingbirds don't like to share, but it doesn't effect its usage.  Wish the body was a little bigger to hold more as the birds go through it every 3 days, but that would probably make it too heavy.  Didn't influence my rating though.
B0006G51KC We have lots of hummers and every year I seem to need to add or replace a feeder. This design is definitely their favorite.
B0006G51KC Well, despite what Mr. One-Star Review says, we've used Perky Pet Hummingbird feeders for years (dare I say decades) and love them.  More importantly the Hummingbirds seem to like them.And do get the one with perches!  For regardless of what the sources tell you about the high energy levels of Hummers, when we've had feeders with and without perches, they use the latter more.  I mean, who doesn't like to rest for a spell.As to accessories:Skip the special food.  You can make your own 'nectar' by using 1-part regular sugar (not honey or brown sugar) to 4-parts tap water.  You boil the water briefly to drive off chlorine, then dissolve the sugar thoroughly.  (Don't boil too long, you'll mess up the 1-to-4 ratio.)  After the solution cools, you can then dye the sugar water red with regular household food dye.BUT do buy more bee guards.  They are cheap and should be replaced every season as apparently Hummingbird spit is pretty disgusting, and the guards will get a mold that might not be entirely cleansed away and might make the birds sick next season.Finally, do take one of the bee guards off.  We have a chickadee who has been coming for several years, who apparently has a sweet-beak.  It's funny to see him line up with the rest of our tiny friends.And whether you go low-end like this one, or high-end like some might steer you, make sure that you keep everything reasonable clean.  This is someone's kitchen afterall.Regards!Pam T~
B0006G51KC I purchased one of these feeders in the spring, along with one or two others of different design.  It didn't take long for this to win the popularity contest.  Before we knew it, this feeder was the object of pitched hummingbird battles, while the other feeders were virtually ignored.  We quickly picked up two more of the Perky Pet (what an awful name) feeders and now we have more hummers than we've had in years.  Around here, it's mainly Blackchin and Rufous, but perhaps some others will notice the crowd.The smaller capacity is an advantage.  There's less chance of solution going bad, and the glass is easy to clean.  We're finding that the feeders need to be replenished about every two days, so there's little chance of gumming up.  A little pricier than some feeders to be sure, but the birds sure like them.
B0006G51KC A few weeks ago we helped my mother clean her garage and came across two of these feeders, both brand new and in their original boxes. Mom did not want them, so we gave one to a neighbor and brought the other one home.Nothing happened for the first few days... we were initially a bit disappointed. Then, after two more days we noticed that the fluid level dropped a bit. Following directions, we emptied and cleaned the feeder at week's end and then refilled it -- and that is when the nectar carnage really started!  As week #2 of our feeder experience got underway, the feeder emptied in about four days and we began to see hummingbirds coming and going at all times of the day.Guess the word got out!Now, in the middle of the fourth week the feeder is emptying every 2.5 days or so.  We have wonderfully colored green, yellow, blue and kinda magenta hummingbirds flying around in singles and in pairs, and they are awesome to watch. They love this feeder, flying in to land on a perch and sipping until content, then buzzing right off.Highly recommended!  Totally fascinating.
B0006G51KC Often sold in garden stores, but the price here was better. It's outside all winter (down to 25 degrees) and has held up well.
B0006G51KC Our hummingbirds show up every spring, hover at the window until I put the feeder out. They seem to like this kind for some reason. I have had other types and they ignore them. Whatever works ! The hummingbirds have voted.
B0006G51KC We've had this feeder for a year and have had good success attracting hummingbirds with it. The bright red color apparently does a good job luring them to our window. It's a little inconvenient to clean but I don't mind because my wife does it.We have it hanging on a hanging device attached to a deck rail in front of a window. The only problem with this set up is that I can barely see the hummingbirds who invariable decide to perch on the opposite side of the feeder.Watching the hummingbirds is a joy. It might be a good idea to add a water baffle to the top to discourage ants. It really works.
B0006G51KC The old glass Perky Pet nectar feeder that still have is from the late 1980's or early 1990's.Hope this new &#34;Perky Pet Glass Nectar Feeder&#34; will last as long as that old feeder is lasting!With the construction being very similar i think it might. Differences being:new style has perches & new style has a threaded top & plastic cap where the old style did not have perches & it has a rubber cap & a grove in the top of bottle for a wire to hold the cap onto the bottle.The bee guards on the new feeder really do keep the bees out.If Looking for a glass nectar feeder that the hummers would like;this one by Perky Pet would be an excellent choice!
B0006G51KC MY ORIGINAL REVIEW WAS 3 STARS.  I STATED THAT IT WAS CHEAPLY MADE BUT FAIR FOR THE PRICE.  WITHOUT SOLICITATION FROM ME, THE COMPANY WROTE ME AND FOLLOWED UP.  PRETTY AMAZING AS MY ORIGINAL REVIEW WAS 3 STARS, NOT TOO BAD.  BUT I REALLY APPRECIATE A COMPANY WHO WORKS THIS HARD TO MAKE SURE THE CUSTOMER IS SATISFIED WITH THEIR PRODUCT. HAVE BEEN USING THE FEEDER FOR SEVERAL MONTHS NOW AND IT WORKS FINE.
B0006G51KC Buzz, my Anna's male hummer who has claimed my yard and this feederas his own, seems to like this feeder.  I have two now, I rotate them each weekas I clean, refresh them.  They are a bit hard to clean, I use a toothbrush to cleanthe feeder part.  The newer one is a bit different than the one I got a couple years ago,the perches don't seem as good, seem a bit short, but, it works so far.  Price is rightanyway, especially if you only have one or two hummers that use it.
B0006G51KC I have several hummer feeders and about half of them are this one, which I consider one of the best.  My only admonition is to clean it regularly and systematically, lest it become fouled with algae and other crud.  Of course, this is something we hummer aficionados should do any way, right?
B0006G51KC I have 2 of theses and I get lots of hummers! You must keep them ant free and clean and the hummers will come for food! Be sure to change the food often, especially if they are in the sun.
B0006G51KC I have another style of feeder, as well, but this one is the birds' favorite.  I've found that having a couple of smaller feeders also works better than one big one.  You waste less nectar.
B0006G51MA Purchased 4 of these feeders and one of them leaked profusly right away. Sent it back and Amazon replaced it with another one that also leaked. Since then, the other three started leaking also. Don't know if I can still return the entire batch since it has been a couple of months, but I am going to try. I had these same feeders in the past and they lasted several years. Somebody \"improved\" them.Update: I contacted the manufacturer direct since the Amazon return policy is only good for 30 days and they replaced all four feeders with no hassel whatsoever. Havn't received them yet, so I don't know how these will perform.
B0006G51MA The hummingbirds recognize this feeder right away (better than the saucer kind) but it started leaking after a couple months.  Pretty unreliable.
B0006G51MA There is something about feeding hummingbirds that creates an almost Zen like feeling.  Watching them as the fly around and feed multiple times a day.  They are actually quite friendly and many will fly within a foot of you or less and listen to you talk to them.We have had this feeder for several years and it is the best one we have owned.  It is easy to clean up with the large hardened glass bottle and the hummingbirds like the perches to sit on.  We like how the bottle screws into the base and then you can flip it and hang it.  I even have a photo of a hummingbird, a monarch butterfly and a honey bee drinking at the same time.In the summer time the humming birds can drink up the sugar water like crazy.  Now if I could only get them to stop fighting over it.  They all think that they own it and they sit there all day long and guard it like it is their personal lunch line.Feeding hummingbirds is fun and enjoyable.  This is the best feeder we have owned out of about 5 styles.  Try it and you will like it!
B0006G51MA The only reason I gave this feeder two stars instead of only one is that I like the glass bottle, much nicer than plastic.  Even at that, the glass is hard to clean unless you have an overpriced feeder \"mop\" or a flexible bottle brush.Despite the advantage of glass over plastic, this feeder is not even useable.  I hung it in the shade but it still leaks like crazy.  It leaks when the wind blows.  It leaks when the temperature rises.  It leaks just because it feels like leaking.  And that attracts ants, armies of tiny, biting ants.  I've tried filling it to almost the top and I've tried putting just a bit of food in it - doesn't matter, it leaks.Even if that weren't a problem, I still would not like this feeder.  The plastic bottom and the flowers inserted into it are next to impossible to clean.  The flowers have little ridges that cry out to be filled with mold and nasties.  A dirty hummingbird feeder is worse than none at all.  I think the manufacturer is doing the birds a real disservice by selling something that is likely to end up with dirt and mold, and be bad for the birds.So, this product is for the birds.  And very much NOT for the birds, not if you care about them.
B0006G51MA I swapped out my old plastic hummingbird feeders for this glass one because the plastic ones kept getting moldy and were so hard to clean properly. This one is the perfect size to hold 2 cups of homemade sugar syrup, which the birds love. It took a good few days to a week before the birds would use this feeder. I don't think they like the perches, as they loved my old feeders which didn't have perches. They don't seem to feed for as long on this feeder as my old feeders either. I also think they preferred my old feeders because they had the raised yellow flowers, this feeder has flat flowers which doesn't seem to attract them as much.
B0006G51MA I received this feeder from Woodstream (Parent of Perky Pet brand) as a replacement for the wildly poorly designed 120TF model. Although it had a tiny initial leak, which took a while to detect, it was easily fixed and has been serving well since.After filling the unit for the first time with home brewed sugar water (1 part sugar to four parts water), I found that the birds seemed to be able to down a cup of liquid in no time at all. The tiny leak on the bottom of the unit showed itself after my wife and I noticed that one of the hummingbirds was feeding off of the BOTTOM of the feeder, licking the bottom inside of the rim. An inspection of the area below the feeder showed a building crowd of ants feeding on the occasional drips. At the next refill, I took care to find the lead site using water during the cleaning (*** Note, I follow the instructions to avoid soap and detergent and use hot water. My experience is that hot tap water works great if you wash the unit twice a week as I do ***). After carefully drying the base, I used some liquid model airplane cement to penetrate the crack where the leak was coming from. Althernately, I could have used silicon rubber sealer, but my thought was that the glue would penetrate and seal the crack better while the sealer would leave a channel for the sugar water to be trapped in and breed bacteria. Also, the glue dries way faster and I had impatient customers hovering in my yard :-)This quick fix did the job and the 210P retains all of its food for the birds. In our case, the three birds that frequent our yard in the SF Bay area drink about a cup every 3 days. So, I do not fill the whole reservoir (16 oz or two cups) since the instructions, and most online commentaries, say to change the food out every 3 days or so to reduce bacteria growth and keep the birds healthy. BTW, if you leave your leak on the bottom un-repaired, it is also better to have less fluid in the tank because it will put less pressure on the leak and reduce the loss.Finally, if you really don't feel like you want to repair a new feeder, Woodstream customer service seems to be quite responsive. A quick call and they will send you a new unit. Happy Hummer-watching!
B0006G51YS My hummers had no trouble switching from the basic bottle feeders to this saucer, and I love it because it's the oh-so-easy to clean.  The built in ant moat dries out rather quickly, but I basically fail to fill it anyway, and haven't had any ant problems at all.  I now have 2 of these feeders, that hang from shepherds hooks, and there's no leakage problems whatsoever.  Remember:  change your sugar water frequently; every few days, to avoid spoilage.  I highly recommend this feeder.EDIT (04/2008):  I wish this feeder came in 8oz, since I don't really need 16oz, and don't get that many hummers (unfortunately).  But, I did also purchase a Hummzinger Fancy (12 oz), and surprisingly I just didn't like it.  It was easy to clean, but was deeper than the PPO, which didn't appeal to me.  I had put the Perky Pet on one hook on the south side of the house, and the HummZinger on the north side's hook.  The HummZinger didn't get much activity, which was surprising since the hummers are used to both hooks having a feeder.  After 2 weeks, I put the HummZinger away and went back to 2 PP's.  Activity resumed on the north hook...Considering both feeders are outside from April to November, and rinsed in hot water for every cleaning, they've held up well.  No cracking, minimal color fading, no flowers have needed replacement to date.
B0006G51YS This feeder is very easy to clean and to fill.  Lots of feeding stations.  There are perches all around, and the hummingbirds appreciate this.  Since there is no container above the feeding stations, you can see the birds from all angles, a big plus.  This would be a 5 star product if the design was modified a bit.  If the feeder was a bit smaller in circumference and a little deeper, it could still hold 16 ounces of nectar with slower evaporation and a little more stability when hanging.  This is a good, functional feeder that's reasonably priced.
B0006G51YS This thing is great! If I remember, I'll upload some pics. Totally easy to clean. the clear bottom and red top separate and its just a big space to easily wipe out - no nooks or crannies to worry about. Everything seems pretty solid and sturdy, and it is a bit bigger than I thought it'd be, which is not a bad thing. The only negative is that the brass hook is too small to fit on my standard iron shepherd's hook - I think someone else mentioned this too. No big problem though - I am just using one of those big plant s-hooks for now, and later I'll get a smaller one (so it doesn't hang quite so low). Other than that easily fixed issue, it's great! Bought this to replace a standard 'Best 1' feeder.
B0006G51YS At this time in 2008 our yards were a haven for over 12 hummers so it off to the Amazon hummer store.  We bought 2 new ones including the Pet 221.  My first reaction was this will be just perfect for them because they can sit while eating and even thought the construction is somewhat shoddy it would work well for the birds.  The little area to collect ants is well placed.So now comes spring and hummers we were excited to watch them and their new eating holes.  We made no changes to the formula or any other item except the feeder itself.  No hummers.  Well, almost no hummers.  A ruby red buzzed us several times at each location but would not feed.  One day while putting one of last years feeders one actually sat on the feeder while I was emptying it into the plants.  He fed and told me he did not like the new ones.  Well, not really.  But why would one hummer feed from the old and not from the new.  Right now it is time to retire the new feeders and revert to the old.  It is possible that the new has an odor in the plastic that the hummers do not like.  I do not know.  For now this has been a waste of money.
B0006G51YS Well, Iike the feeder, easy to clean and hang, but the birds really like it much better than my more traditional one that's like an upside down jar and that's what matters, they like it. I think I'll get another, but I like the traditional one as it's hanging in a window, but still, the birds like this one better.
B0006HGP7O This feeder is HEAVY. That translates to sturdy. No more little squrriel teeth mangling up the finish and function. Three small feeding slots are located on the front of the feeder. the perch, where the birds sit themselves to dinner, is spring operated. It stays open until something heavier than a bird grabs it. This would be the squrriels. the perch pivots downward, closing the feeding slots. The spring is adjustable, so depending on the size of the squrriels in your neighborhood, it can  be adjusted to thwart the little furball from raiding the seed bin. However, they may be able to hang from the roof of the feeder and reach some tasty morsels, but not a lot of seeds are accessible from the top through the slots. We use a variety of seeds, including sunflower seeds, and haven't found one that won't go through the slot from the supply bin.this is all metal, except for the windows, which are mounted into the feeder walls and serve as supply indicators. the top opens with the twist of the windvane. This is where you fill the feeder. It is a twisting affair to close and open the feeder, I don't see how squrriels have the strength to open it, so that will end the pop-the-top burglars. It has a heavy handle to hang it with, or there's the pole/base mount that comes with it if you want to place it on the top of a pole. It's built to last.
B0006HGP7O When filled this is a very heavy bird feeder so be prepared with a steel hook on a post. I doubt that your going to be able to tree limb mount this due to its weight combined with the narrow space between the roof finial and the underside of the handle. But it is a lovely, well constructed, metal bird feeder with a weight sensitive perch. The squirrels can still eat anything that falls on the ground but between the slippery metal and that perch they won't be stealing from inside. And the lid comes off easily while still being able to fill and secure. The bright red color means you can easily spot it outside. This holds a couple pounds of bird seed.
B0006HGP7O I've been working my way up to a large permanent bird feeder over the last couple years. We get some really beautiful birds (Cardinals, Blue Jays, and a yellow crested bird that I don't know) and I love seeing them in the yard. But these feeders I've gotten at the local stores don't hold up. They weather poorly and break or look terrible after they fade in the sun. Which is exactly why I love this one!This is a huge bird feeder, made almost entirely of metal, with a metal roof that helps water pour off it easily. This isn't going to break. And since the top is silver it wont fade there either. Overall, the construction of this feeder is great. Even the part that closes if a squirrel steps on it is metal!How does it work? The ledge that the birds perch on closes down and covers the food openings if too much weight is applied. This works great as birds wont push it down but squirrels will.It has the hanger you see in the picture and also a place in the bottom for a post (it goes up in to the house about 4-5 inches, so is solid). The post looks to be about 1-1.5 inches think and fit on the end of my shovel.Top quality! Highly recommended.
B0006HGP7O An extremely well constructed feeder, easy for owner to fill, but so far impossible for squirrels to get to the seed. Owing in part I'm sure because of the squirrels ability to get into (either opening or chewing through) other feeders they are very large and do not tolerate well inability to get to the seed they want. The solid steel construction and effective protection of clear plastic windows have made this one of only three feeders on our property the squirrels and/or raccoons have not been able to break into. The simple, wide opening (but securely fastening) access on the top of the feeder make it extremely easy to fill the cavernous feeder. My 91 year old Father-in-law spends a great deal of time at his dining room table reading and looking out his rear window at this feeder and he loves watching the squirrels trying unsuccessfully to get into the feeder! Strongly recommend this feeder for anyone plagued by squirrels raiding their bird feeders. christina & bogie
B0006HGP7O I received this very large box via UPS and couldn't imagine what was inside. Unlike most things today that ship in parts in order to spend less in shipping but, consequently, may not be built as well in the end.  While the main photo shows the front, the sides are equally as big and it's nothing short of adorable.These are not cheesy plastic parts that will weather and crack. This is made of sturdy metal and the roof of the house is like a metal barn roof with a galvanized steel look.The weathervane is also metal and cut but polished with no sharp edges, just as a large one would be.The perch is made so that if birds sit on it it stays open, but anything heavier, like a squirrel, will close the opening.You have a door and windows to further taunt said squirrel to get to see the buffet closed for business until he can starve himself down to bird weight...aww, such torture, Mr Squirrel!The metal bar that holds the feeder is tough and meant to stay in place on a branch without ever breaking away.Truly a well made and adorable piece, sure to delight all the birds that can line up on the perch and feed together, and sure to torture unlimited squirrels......fortunately for them, I also have a squirrel feeder.  Werd.
B0006HGP7O This is an attractive high-capacity bird feeder in the style of \"The Tank\" as commonly known at the Audubon Society shop.  It functions by closing access to the feeder when the squirrel puts its weight on the bar.  Birds which are much lighter in weight than squirrels will not lower the bar and can feed happily and freely.Overall a much more affordable alternative to The Tank, the capacity of this bird feeder is 12-lbs and depending on how hungry/greedy the birds are in your area, the seed can last up to a week or more before needing to be refilled.  This is perfect for skittish birds that tend to avoid areas with a lot of human contact.This feeder is also available in red and a green whereas the Tank was only available in green.The only caution/con is that a strong sturdy branch is needed to hang this from.  Also this bird feeder needs to hung high enough so that squirrels will not be able to stand up and feed from the feeder by bypassing the weight trigger that closes access to the feeder.Overall highly recommended.
B0006HGP7O I have two of these feeders.  I have had one up for about a year now (We feed birds year around) and the one being reviewed here has been up for approximately 2 months now.  These two feeders are in addition to nine other feeders we have about the place.  We live on five acres which we have turned in to a bit of a bird sanctuary.  It is heavily wooded for the most part with a small orchard and garden on one side.  We also have a very, very large squirrel, raccoon and possum population.  While it is extremely difficult to count squirrels, I would estimate that we have at least 35 hanging about the place.  I like squirrels for the most part but they are a pain and it costs a lot of money to keep them fat and happy.  With our large number of oak trees, hickory and orchard fruit (in season) the little tree rats do quite well for themselves.First, these feeders are quite easy to mount.  I have them both mounted on small tree stumps I have had to cut that were too near the house.  They are relatively easy to keep filled.  They are designed to discourage squirrels and so far both have been quite effective.  I have had no mechanical problems with them so far.  There are a couple of things to note and remember when using this particular feeder.  First; keep in CLEAN!  Each and every birdfeeder you own and use should be thoroughly cleaned frequently...very frequently.  These feeders are NOT water proof and the seeds in them will get wet and if you do not keep the wet seeds out they will gather mold and mildew.  Not only can this be deadly for the birds, it will eventually cause the spring mechanism to malfunction...the gunk will build up.  Maintaining bird feeders properly is a lot of work!Secondly, if you have raccoons, be assured that a determined raccoon and absolutely destroy one of these feeders in very little time!  They can and will dismantle it.  Hey, a raccoon can dismantle a Sherman tank of there is food involved so a feeder...no feeder, stands a chance if they set their little minds to it.Third, birds can be and are rather sloppy at times.  The spill seeds.  Due to the designed of this feeder, this wasted is at a minimum but still and all there is some spillage present which ends up on the ground and thereby attracting squirrels and other critters to the general area.  Not much you can do about this.Forth, it took out birds a little over two weeks to get use to this particular feeder.  It was slow in attracting birds at first but once they \"caught on\" both feeders are as popular as the others we use.  Do keep in mind that birds react differently in different parts of the country, a fact we have noted after living in a great many parts of the United States.  This review involves country birds living in the Missouri Ozarks.  For all I know east and west coast birds may hate the thing....you just never know about such things until you give them a try.Fifth, when you clean your feeder, use just a very, very, very small amount of 3 in 1 oil on the movable parts.  By doing this I have been able to avoid and mechanical problems.This feeder, while possibly just a bit pricy, is very attractive and a pleasure to view.  We have been very satisfied with both of our feeders.Don BlankenshipThe Ozarks
B0006HGP7O I have owned this type (not brand) of feeder for decades, and it is the single-most effective way of enticing a variety of birds while discouraging squirrels.  The perch bar is counterweighted so that anything heavy will pull it down and close the access to the seeds.  It's a simple, brilliant design.  This Perky Pet version is a good implementation and improvement upon the original design.The Perky Pet has one major improvement over the last feeder like this that I owned:  metal perches.  Frustrated squirrels gnawed through the wooden perch on my last feeder, and I kept having to replace them with wooden dowels.  I also like that there are two perching spots in front of the seeds, one for smaller birds like goldfinches and one a little farther away for larger songbirds such as cardinals.  On the left side of the perch, there's a weight adjustment lever to set the sensitivity of the closing mechanism.  I wish Perky Pets had provided a quick set guide to show which setting was the most/least sensitive so I didn't have use trial-and-error.  The most sensitive setting will close the door when too many small birds or some large birds, such as jays or grackles, land on the perch.  The galvanized metal roof is not as attractive as a painted version, but the rest of the feeder looks nice.The top of the feeder opens by twisting the cardinal weathervane on top about a quarter turn.  The center part of the roof lifts up.  I really dislike how difficult it is to align the latch and close it.  Especially on a cold, windy day, I don't want to be struggling with finding the inside hole while my fingers are going numb.  Otherwise, the construction is first-rate, with squirrel-proof metal and an inaccessible (for squirrels) plastic windows.  (Anyone who has owned a feeder with a plastic feeder with an exposed edge knows how quickly squirrels can chew right through it.)  Because I have mine mounted on a tree, the deer can empty it if they put some effort into it.  The squirrels cannot.I also own the Perky PetSquirrel-Be-Gone Wild Bird Feeder, and that works well, although birds such as cardinals that prefer hoppers or trays often stay away.  Plus, this one has a much sturdier construction.  If you are only going to get one feeder for your yard, I recommend this one.--  Debbie Lee Wesselmann
B0006HGP7O Update 5/15/14:I do like the look of this feeder, but after using it for a while, there are issues.  The biggest issue is that rain gets inside the feeder from the top (where the cardinal is).  The food ends up wet, clumps, and molds.  I've started putting in a very small amount of food and tilting/shaking the food forward toward the opening.  Also, the locking mechanism (turn cardinal to lock lid) has become very difficult.  It is hard to get it to catch properly so the lid remains lose.  Maybe if you live in a very dry climate you wouldn't have a problem - but with Florida's afternoon rains, this is not the best choice.Original review:I was pleasantly surprised by this bird feeder!  First, it is very nice looking and larger than I expected.  The \"weather vane\" turns to unlock the roof.  Lift off the roof, add bird seed, then reattach lid.  Easy!!!  The weight triggered perch closes off the food if squirrels or large birds get on the perch.  There are 4 positions to vary how easily the perch lowers and closes the food supply.  Nice looking, easy to use - I'm definitely happy with this feeder.
B0006HGP7O There are many things you notice right off on this feeder.  It is all metal, very attractive and built very well.I am impressed!!I loaded it up with bird seed and within 2 days the birds adjusted to it and actively feeding.  As you can see by the picture there are clever designed \"windows\" so you can easily see the amount of remaining seed.Included is the heavy hangar and again clever designed mounting system with screws so you have options on how and where you place it.  I do have it mounted under cover, but it appears to be water proof with its tin roof and painted body. I wouldn't hesitate to put it out in the rain.This would make a great gift for yourself or for someone else.
B0006HGP7O The Squirrel Be Gone birdfeeder is undeniably attractive.  Painted fire engine red, it is shaped like a barn, with a tray that is meant to just bear the weight of birds, nothing heavier while they access the feed from small openings, with a metal handle that fits in the side holes for hanging and a little weathervane piece on top, which by twisting you can open the removable roof part and fill the feeder with seed.Mine, however, was shipped without any kind of instructions in the box, although I was careful to make sure I didn't throw anything resembling them away by accident.  I received it in several pieces: four bolt parts, the barn part, a red base-looking part (which I assumed was meant to provide some kind of \"anchor\"), plus the handle which attached to the sides.  Feeling vaguely like a preschooler with a Fisher Price toy, I untwisted the weathervane handle and tried to bolt the big red base piece onto the bottom with the screws using the appropriate screwdriver. They kept falling out, regardless of how much I tried to tighten them, although the smaller \"anchor\" part stayed on without bolts.  The next step was to figure out where the bolts did go.  Unfortunately, repeated examination of the holes did not yield the answer.  Two holes on either side were meant to attach the silver handle, which I did without trouble. So far, I can put the feeder out on a flat surface or table, so the birds can enjoy the feed, but I doubt that that's going to keep out the squirrels.Overall, the feeder does look like it would be successful to foil most squirrels, but I can't really grade it on that. So I'll give it three stars, and hope that other reviewers are much more helpful.  I don't know whether it was the lack of instructions, some glitch in the specific feeder I got, or my own incompetence that's responsible for this experience, so I'll just wish anyone who does purchase the feeder luck.
B0006HGP7O I received this bird feeder and I was really impressed with how sturdy it is made.  It will be very effective at keeping squirrels and field mice from hoarding my stash of bird seed.  It should last many seasons.  I really love the baked-on red enamel and the nice tin roof.  I am well pleased.
B0006HGP7O Although I have come to the conclusion that where a product is made is no important to me (it is made in China), I am giving this bird-feeder four stars because it is well-made and very attractive. It looks just like a barn on my daughter's farm. It is red, has a weathervane on top, windows and a metal roof. It is supposed to be a deterrent for squirrels who sit on the bar because they weigh too much. Our backyard squirrels hang upside down on the post and get into anything, but so far they  have not been attracted to this feeder. I have the old feeder up in the backyard and the birds loved it. It is just blue and clear plastic- we stopped putting birdseed in it when the new Perky-Pet Country House feeder arrived. It has been up for six-days and today is the first day that I was able to observe a sparrow actually eating seeds from it.  Apparently, the birds are taking their sweet time in adjusting to their new source of bird food.  We feed our squirrels peanuts I buy by the sack and because we gave a resident feral cat who is blind and old, we also get a possum and very big raccoon coming to our back-door to eat cat food and drink fresh water. This bird-feeder is an attractive addition to our small back yard and I trust that in time our usual back yard birds (Cardinals, Finches, etc.)  will return. The Mourning Doves eat the seed that falls to the ground and since there hasn't been that much activity at the new red feeder, they too aren't visiting us too frequently. I am giving them all time to adjust to their new food source.Well, here is an update: after using this bird house for approximately two months, it has broken. The metal rod that holds the rooster on top (this secures the top of the opening where seeds are poured into) has vanished. This morning I found the roof of the birdhouse on the ground and cannot find the rest of the pieces anywhere. Perhaps an outraged squirrel or large bird came along and broke it to get at the seeds inside. I now would recommend that you do not buy this bird feeder unless you just want it for decoration.
B0006HGP7O I can't complain about the squirrels because I put out peanuts and corn for them so I am inviting them into the yard. But they seem content to eat corn and peanuts. They don't bother my other feeders. They are like little monkeys in the yard. I like to watch the squirrels. However this feeder still seemed like a good idea.I have had it up for a few weeks. I have black oil sunflower seeds in it. The birds hit it regularly.It looks great and seems quite durable. I have mine hung from a garden hook.
B0006HGP7O I love this feeder.  It is a little bit bigger than I expected, but I absolutely love it.  I especially like the weathervane on the roof, which is also the latch that opens and closes the top.  The opening to fill the feeder is quite large so it is very easy to fill and the feeding area is great for handling the peanuts and sunflower seeds I put in and hasn't jammed or anything like that.  An interesting feature is being able to control the bar that is meant to keep squirrels out; I haven't figured out what adjustments I need to make, but it is a neat feature. Overall, I am very happy with my feeder and I am looking forward to getting a lot of bird traffic in my backyard with it.
B0006HGP7O I love my wild animals, especially birds!  I have several bird feeders and love to attract as many birds and variety of birds as possible.  My one or two problems are squirrels and big black birds.  I was thrilled to see this adorable Perky-Pet Squirrel-Be-Gone Bird Feeder. It is just so cute...just like a little red barn with a weather vane on top.  It is also very well constructed.  It is working great at keeping the squirrels out of the bird feed.  My squirrels can empty a feeder in just a little bit, but not this one.  I love watching them try and try to get food out of it.  I don't want to hurt the squirrels as my husband suggested using a BB Gun on them so I am just so happy that they will not be harmed, but also can't clean out the feeders.  5 stars!
B0006HGP7O This feeder will most certainly light up any back or front yard, it is THAT pretty.  The paint is a solid and thick laquer, and I like the metal perching bar instead of wooden dowels which can get chewed away by annoyed squirrels over time.  The feeder has a large solid hanger and also comes with pole mount.The only reason I gave it four stars instead of five is the filling access.  This feeder top loads, and in order to open the roof piece one must turn the squirrel weather vane.  Opening the roof is easy, but closing it again requires some finesse and delicate realigning of the inside lock.  One needs to be able to look inside to get it realigned, so mounting the feeder on a high pole as we like to do is out of the question.  If the company can figure out an easier way to lock the roof this will be a solid five star feeder.
B0006HGP7O As is often common for me, I've ordered something and didn't read the size of the item and it is waaaay bigger than I expected. I thought this would be the size of most average bird feeders (softballish size), but it's about 3x that size (basketball size). I realize I'm comparing a square shape to round with that, but I couldn't think of anything else of similar size that everyone might understand...So, other than my shock at the size, I was pleasantly surprised by the quality workmanship on this bird feeder.It is made of metal, with the only plastic piece I can see being an adapter you can put on the bottom if you want to be able to mount it to the top of a pole (but it also has the heavy gauge wire you can hang it from that you see in the picture.Another reviewer commented that blackbirds can sit on it without activating the drop-down that blocks the seed (which is how it prevents squirrels from getting the seed, a heavier critter, when it steps on the perch area, causes it to drop down and close off the access to the seeds.) However, there is an adjuster setting on the left side that allows you to change the spring tension making it more sensitive or less sensitive to weight. I've found it to be fairly sensitive and not a problem. HOWEVER, the one thing I do worry about is the way the mechanism closes off the seed access - I'm worried that a critter could have it's beak or toes in the seed area before the metal part drops down and the critter might be hurt or get something caught when it drops down. This is probably pretty unlikely, but it was something I noticed none-the-less.As mentioned in other reviews, the feeder does not come with instructions, but I found the use to be pretty intuitive. The little mini-weather vane on top of the house locks and unlocks the access for filling the feeder (when unlocked you then lift the panel from the top that the weather-vane is connected to and a large area is opened to use for filling).I agree with the other posters who say that the red color attracts the birds so they quickly check it out and find the seed.All in all this is a great feeder, I do wish it was a bit smaller, but that's my own problem as I should have read the dimensions rather than assuming it would be the size it 'looked' in the picture.
B0006HGP7O I wanted to replace an old bird feeder that was similar in style to the Perky-Pet Country Style Squirrel-Be-Gone.  Because both are weight activated, I falsely assumed the spring-action mechanism and construction of the Perky Pet would also be similar, but I was sadly mistaken.We discovered upon arrival that there are no directions.  In our case, inserting the metal handle into the feeder wasn't much of a challenge (our older model hooks in the same way).  Those who have never owned this type feeder might be scratching their heads wondering how everything connects.  Perky-Pet could easily avert assembly frustration by including a few instructions.Our older model is constructed of heavy gauge metal.  The hinged roof opens up entirely for easy seed re-filling and shuts back up tightly.  The Perky-Pet is made out of lighter metal with lots of sharp edges.  The weathervane cut-out, although cute, is a badly designed seed-filling port.  It just doesn't open up or shut very well, and seed filling is cumbersome.  Crafty squirrels use the weathervane as a good grasping point and toe-hold.  They easily outwit the feeder and help themselves to seed (see customer image).  I figure it's only a matter of time before they learn how to open up the weathervane port too.  Only a portion of the roof comes off, and it leaves a gap between the stationary roof and cut-out weathervane.  I have had this feeder only during snowy winter months, but I wonder about water seepage into the seed chamber when spring rains finally arrive.The weight activated perch bar is controlled by an adjustable spring, something akin to paper clip strength.  No matter which setting I use, it mysteriously moves to a different setting.  Living in a woodsy area, I don't know which animal to blame for that, but our old feeder had much sturdier spring settings that stayed in place.  We never encountered this problem.To its merit, the Perky-Pet does feed birds and if the spring stays in place, it also keeps out bigger pesky birds.  Maybe in your neck of the woods it will even keep out squirrels, but as my picture attests, it sure doesn't around here.UPDATE:  Just as suspected, the squirrels finally figured out how to open up the weathervane (customer photo). Now they make a daily raid.  Not many birds even use this feeder so I'm taking it down for good.  Perky-Pet should omit \"Be Gone\" from this feeder's name and simply call it \"Squirrel Country House.\"
B0006HGP7O I've had this feeder up for over a month and have observed the following:It's heavy, very heavy; too heavy for a shepards hook so I placed it in my apple tree. It's also big and holds a lot of seed. I have the red model. It's pretty, very attractive and looks great.It's not squirrel-proof but is squirrel resistant. Since the feeder is in a tree, squirrels are able to jump on top of it. They hang upside down on it and slobber all over the feed ports while trying to get the seed out. They don't get a lot of seed but they make a mess while trying and at the same time annoy the birds.Several times during the night an animal, I am guessing a raccoon, was able to remove the feeder from the hook, throw it on the ground, and then try to rip the top off, slighting bending the sheet metal. To the feeder's credit, most of the seed did remain inside although the critter was able to slightly bend the metal up a bit on one side. I've added a piece of duct tape to the side that has the gap. [Update: I found the feeder on the ground a few more times so I added a small baffle on the hook above the feeder. This appears to have solved the problem. The critter has not been able to remove the feeder from the hook. 7/2013]The weather vane knob that opens and closes the top fill area doesn't lock securely. It could be improved if the manufacturer adding a grommet to give it some tension. It pops open very easily and several times I've found it undone. It's also difficult to get it back on after filling.The spring tension adjustment hook on the perching bar is ineffective. When a critter jumps on it, the hook pops out and there is no longer any tension and large birds will not be able to eat.The inside of the feeder has sharp edges so it will be a little challenging to clean inside. The outside ports are already getting gummed up for a rainy week and squirrels licking it, but the outside cleans up easily.The feeder is water tight. After a rainy week the seed inside remained dry.Birds like the feeder. The first birds to appear were the House Sparrows and Cowbirds. The shy birds like Cardinals and Goldfinch waited a few weeks to make it was safe, but now all the usual feeder birds are eating from it. I tried various seeds and even a mix. I get the best results from black oiled sunflower seeds.I have owned many different types of bird feeders and all have their faults. The only way to make one squirrel-proof is to put it on a pole with a baffle where squirrels can't reach. This feeder is a decent compromise for someone who wants to hang a pretty feeder in their tree. A plastic, light weight feeder would be eaten and shredded in days. This one should last for years.UPDATE: Sept 1, 2013Not chipmunk proof. For the past week the little critters have been climbing the tree, dropping down over the roof of the feeder, sitting on the top of the bar and filling their pouches. By sitting on the top they are not heavy enough to close the deterrent bar even on the lightest setting. I added a squirrel cone to the hook above the feeder but they are still able to climb over it. Once the chipmunks go into hibernation at the end of October this problem should go away. The birds still enjoy the feeder and it really does prevent most squirrels from gaining access.
B0006HGP7O The Perky-Pet 338 Squirrel Be Gone II Country House is cute.But it's flimsier than it looks from the photos. The construction is thin sheet metal, with sharp edges.I don't know why there are so many positive reviews. It's a less effective feeder than cheaper options (i.e., the birds don't like it -- at least our birds in the midatlantic), and my squirrels have been able to get out the seed. Meanwhile, the seed has a tendency to get stuck with the awkward portals and under the levers.The feeder can be hung from the metal hanger (which is shown in the photos), or it has a large shaft through the middle, so you can stick it on a pole.The weathervane also serves as the latch to open the top, but it's also poorly engineered.
B0006HGP7O Squirrels seem to give up very quickly on this feeder, as their weight closes off access to the feeder tray.  While that is a great, money-saving aspect of the feeder, and I really like the large size (fewer refills) and level-check windows, the downside of this type of feeder is that it limits visits from beautiful larger birds (woodpeckers, cardinals, blue jays, etc.  Finches, sparrows, and wrens seems to only visitors due to the small landing area it offers.
B0006HGP7O It is nicely constructed. It is made of metal, so it will hold up. The perch is weight triggered so larger animals like squirrels will lower the perch and block the food. You can also adjust it dependent on the size of the birds in the area. You can adjust it for larger or smaller birds. It is larger than I expected and will hold plenty of food. If you twist the Weathervane, it will unlock the the panel on the top for easy access for refilling. It also comes with an attachment (including fasteners) that you can place on a stand and you can place the feeder on the stand, easy to place and remove from stand. Over all this is a nice feeder.
B0006HGP7O I must say, I was thrilled to be able to get this through The Vine!! These types of feeders are SO expensive (but really, they're worth the price because they work!). Thirteen years ago, when we bought the home we live in, there was a similar type of feeder (adjustable, spring level) squirrel proof feeder mounted on top of a pole in our back yard. I was excited because I'd never owned one and wanted to see first hand how (and if!) they worked. I was super pleased with the results! Still have that feeder, same place...and it's going strong!! I must say, that the older one is heavier duty than this one (no clue on the brand, but there are some out there that are more expensive than this one from The Vine); but this one still does the job! I love that it holds so much bird food. We feed black oil seeds exclusively and they work great in this feeder. The lever/bar shuts when the grey squirrels attempt to get to the food:)~ we have little red squirrels that use the feeders and I don't mind them at all ~ they are not hogs and they don't make a mess;) ~ they can still get the seed because they are very light in weight.This feeder, as I mentioned, is not as heavy duty as some you will find on the market, but again, does the job equally as well. There are adjustable levels (spring activated type), so you can decide which you want to try out. I always keep it at the lightest possible level because all the birds (but no grey squirrels) can use it without an issue ~ even bluejays. It comes with a heavy duty (attached) handle as you can see in the picture, but it also has a mounting bracket so you can put it on a post. The weathervane twists to come off. That is where the seed goes.Highly recommend this feeder so far!
B0006HGP7O It's cute, no doubt about that. The photo shown here is not exactly what the product looks like though. The \"weather vane\" serves as a handle for removing part of the roof in order to fill it.  The weather vane has to be turned about a quarter turn or less to \"unlock\" it, allowing you to lift part of the roof away.It's biggest flaw is the sharp metal on the roof.  The photo doesn't show how they cut out a square area of the roof that you lift to fill the feeder. The edges of this square metal piece that lifts off are rather sharp. They tried to dull the edges some, but the metal is relatively thin, which makes it relatively easy to cut yourself. Very poor design, and unfortunate. The outer edges of the roof itself are the same way.Durable metal, but the roof should have had more safety built in, such as rolled edges. Also, it's not as easy to clean as the \"tube\" type birdfeeders.
B0006HGP7O This feeder is quite large, and holds up to 12 lbs. of bird seed. It may be more feeder than you need, unless you have a huge number of birds visiting your yard. The size can make it hard to find a good place to hang it, unless you have a shepherd's crook. It also comes with the hardware required to attach it to a post rather than hanging it.I've hung mine very low on my rhododendron bush so my ground-feeding birds will feel comfortable using it. Even with it so close to the ground, there seems to be no pilferage from squirrels or other furry creatures. Just don't hang it so low that the squirrels can eat from it without stepping on the bar. Their weight on the bar is what causes the feeding ports to be blocked.The feeder is quite sturdy, made of metal except the windows, which are plastic. On my feeder, the bar that sits across the front for the birds to perch on does not sit straight across. It slants down to the right, which makes the whole feeder look slightly lopsided. It's not a big deal, and the birds don't care, but if you prefer symmetry, it could start to bother you after awhile.
B0006HGP7O Perky Pet's feeder is big, beautiful, and bright, a beacon for our birds who found it within an hour after it was hung. It was disconcerting that the feeder came with no paperwork, but I did figure out how to fill it with seed, and how to adjust the tension. The weather vane twists off for filling, but it is a little tricky to line up for reinstallation. Fortunately the feeder holds so much seed that it won't need to be filled often.The fit and finish of the feeder is very good; I've found no paint blemishes or defects. My one complaint is that I wish the weight sensitive perch that closes when squirrels stand on it was a bit more sensitive. A large blackbirds can alight on the perch at one time and devour quite a bit of seed; I've noticed that two blackbirds in the perch at once can close the door to the seed. We have another squirrel proof feeder in the yard that seems to be more sensitive and closes access to the food more readily when large birds try to gorge themselves.Bottom line - This is an attractive feeder that our squirrels haven't figured out YET.
B0006HGP7O This is a good sized feeder and it looks good in the yard.  It seems to be a favorite for the smaller birds.  I've had it in the yard for a couple of weeks now and the squirrels have so far ignored it.  Be careful when you are handling this feeder because the edges on it are very very sharp so use care when taking it out of the box.Updated review several months later:  The feeder has been out in the yard for several months now and it still looks good.  However, the squirrels have now discovered that can climb onto the top of the feeder, unscrew the latch, push it off and then they climb inside and have a picnic.  So I will have to come up with a way to make it so that they cannot unscrew the latch.
B0006IXXEG I put them pout. I saw a few birds pecking at it.The price is good. it looks, texture wise like good suet to me.
B0006IXXEG These work very well, the only problem now is that one only lasts 2 days at the most so I limit to how many I put out, usually 1 a week along with other bird feed too
B0006IXXEG Time to re-order, the birds seem to love it, so do the squirrels.  One will last about 4-5 days unless a raccoon comes along, they'll eat the whole thing at one time.  I've wired the suet cage shut so they can't open it but they'll sure put a big dent in it.  I like to give back to nature since we've taken so much from all the wild animals.
B0006IXXEG Song birds really enjoy this..woodpeckers not so much
B0006IXXEG I bought this case of suet cakes for my new suet holder.  I was trying to attract more birds to our yard in our new house.  The birds (mostly the woodpeckers) have really enjoyed these suet cakes.  It is a great price for the case of 12.  I am pleasantly surprised and pleased with how much of a success these suet cakes have been.  I will definitely be purchasing more in the future.
B0006IXXEG Like this one, I use them both and mix outside for the birds, Much cheaper this way then one by one at the stores.Love it, well, the birds love it...
B0006IXXF0 I have found less expensive and higher quality products at stores nearby. The birds don't seem to like it and I will be looking elsewhere for my next carton of suet.
B0006IXXF0 Glad to have discovered these...Heath Outdoor Products DD5-12 Suet Peanut Cake, Case of 12...just started building a Bird Sanctuary and am learning about different types of bird food....and feeders....These are great so easy t just peel them open and drop in the feeder.
B0006IXXF0 I've stayed away from suet for quite a few years because what I've seen in feed and pet stores are small cakes that would be fairly messy to handle. When I finally bit the bullet and ordered the Heath Suet Peanut Cake, I didn't expect much. However, they are well packed, fill the suet cage fully, and reasonably priced for the case of 12.It took two days before the Chestnut-backed Chickadees found it. Then word got around and we had Oak Titmice, Black-eyed Juncos, Bewick's and House Wrens, House Finches, House Sparrows, Scrub Jays, and our ever-plotting squirrel (Sydney) come to the feeder two to three times a day.I put the suet at the end of a relatively flexible branch in our tangelo tree. That stymied Sydney; he just couldn't hang on, so now s/he waits on the ground for whatever scraps may fall. And the positioning is a good way to control the Scrub Jay. They're a little too heavy to get a good footing (\"beaking?\") on the feeder and lose balance, but not until they've taken a tiny chuck of suet. That's where Sydney comes in again.Anyway, we've never had so many chickadees and finches and wrens before. Heath's Suet certainly seems to please the palates of locals.
B0006IXXF0 These suet cakes are great for those that have a bird feeder with the square holders on them.  All types of bird love these, including cardinals, blue jays, wrens and others.  They also last for a while as week..usually a week for us as they have lots of visitors eating them.
B0006IXXF0 The birds really seem to love this flavor - I've tried others, but they prefer this one.Regular visitors to this suet include Blue Jays, Downy Woodpeckers, Hairy Woodpeckers, Red-Bellied Woodpeckers, Flickers, Titmice, Chickadees, Nuthatches, Carolina Wrens, and even a Baltimore Oriole!I use this suet in tray feeders, hanging feeders, and I cut the squares into 4 pieces to use in the log feeders (it's much cheaper than buying suet \"rods\" for the log feeders.)Highly recommended.
B0006JO0X8 I have had this unit for seven months, now.  It honestly is just a cheap device, turned out cheaply, to cash in on the solar craze now going on.  I'm all for great-quality solar panels that provide reliable energy.  This unit does not.  Yes, it reads fine on my multimeter, when I check it, but the battery on my RV is not staying charged.  I have gone through two charge controllers, so I have to think that the panel just might be the culprit, here.  I am in a city with almost 90% very sunny days.  This panel gets full, blazing sun, just about daily, for seven hours.  You get what you pay for, and you don't get much, apparently, at the price this unit goes for.  My RV battery performs as it should when it is not hooked up to this unit.  It charges and holds charge when I'm on the road.  Again, it looks like a case of a badly made solar panel.  Spend more for a better unit.
B0006JO0X8 Sunforce 50032 15 Watt Solar Battery Charger -  I have installed it on my Boat to keep my electronics deep cell batteries charged.  Trolling motor batteries mostly.  Works well.  Pricy, but what is that money for anyway.
B0006JO0X8 I purchased 6 of these for a backup system for my home. Two Northern units and 4 Sunforce units all 15 watt. ( these are the exact same units btw, northern's are cheaper). With two inverters, a 2500 watt, and a 300 watt pure sinewave for computers and such. Hooked through a 7 amp charge controller to a pair of 110 amp hour deep cells in parallel for a total of 220 amp hr's.I first hooked two panels up to see how they did, they worked well in very low light but couldn't ever get the batteries to \"full\" on the controller. I then hooked up a third panel and that gave enough to bring the batteries to full after a full day. With six panels hooked up, it will bring the batteries to \"full\" in a very few hours from a 30% drained condition.These units are less then optimally placed and rarely get full sun, but do very well even without that. Two panels in full sun may very well have been able to bring the batteries to \"full\" but location is a problem for me. One other product of note is the P3 international \"Kill A Watt\" electrical useage meter. Doing a survey of electrical useage in my house to get ready for this project was an eye opener to say the least.Great panels, at a good price, that do what you pay for...all you can ask for.
B0006JO0X8 I bought this, then bought the set of 4 that comes with extras. Works like it says but for the money your better off buying the set.
B0006JO0X8 It comes with a nice long cord which was long enough to reach from the corner of the room of my RV down the refrigerator vent where I connected it to my 7 am charge controller and ran a wire underneath to the battery.  This cord has a plug on the end to connect to one of several connectors included. (No wire splicing necessary).  It comes with connectors for connecting to a cigarette lighter, alligator clips for connecting directly to battery posts, as well as a connector that just splits off two wires with the insulation already removed for you in case you need to wire them directly into something, or extend them with more wire.  It also includes a LED test light that can plug directly into the solar panels cord to test whether the panel is working.I have attached two of these solar panels to the roof of my RV camper.  They keep the battery fully charged even with the propane detector still using electricity.  I was able to screw the panel directly into my rubber roof with the screws provided with no problem.  They are very secure and they were a great investment.
B0006JO0X8 This is a sturdy, well built solar panel which is great to keep batteries topped up. They are only 15w each so don't expect a lot of power but they are small and easy to install. I have 4.
B0006JO0X8 Puts out 24 v in Sept PA sun @ 15 w power. With voltage regulator and deep cycling storage battery with or without inverter will keep your house/ shed/ workshop low amp tools and lights running from sundown to bedtime. I have cut my electric bill $10 per month with this unit so in two years it will have paid for itself including all accessories. Great panel, great shipping.
B0006JO0XI As a few others have posted, in here, the quality control on this Chinese unit is poor.  The wiring on my unit was reversed.  Once I set things right, the unit worked correctly for about four months before complete failure.  My battery died in the bargain, due to the unit failure that allowed my battery to drain completely with no load on it except this unit and the solar panel.  I'll try one more and then update this review.  Update:  I just ordered: KINTREX SPC0601 Solar Charge Controller - 7Amp, 100 Watt,...  At just $10, on this site, it's a far better deal and has an extra indicator light for low charge condition.  The connectors should mate up perfectly if the pictures are accurate. As far as the reversed wiring goes, in all electrical applications with connectors, an exposed contact is normally the ground, coming from a power source.  The hot side is recessed and/or shielded to keep you from grabbing it and then a grounded object or contact, which would result in a shock.  This scheme is reversed, obviously, in the non-powered side of the circuit, ie., the thing you're sending the power to that mates with the connection just described.  When I called Sunforce's rep, in Canada, and spoke with him, he denied knowledge of any other incidents of reversed wiring.  That's really curious, as others have posted about the reversals, as I mentioned, above. UPDATE: 4/2011- The Kintrex unit works flawlessly.  You are well-advised to go with it and leave the reviewed unit, as above, alone.  It costs much more and is inferior.
B0006JO0XI Sunforce 7 Amp Charge Controller - I installed this on my boat to charge one battery for my electronic fishfinder and chartplotter.  It is still working and keeps the battery charged well.
B0006JO0XI I do understand electronics and how these things work. For my curiosity I purchased one of these and opened it to verify the design. From my observations I found that it is a very basic 'Linear' charge controller design to prevent Lead Acid batteries from getting overcharged & severely undercharged. Nothing more nothing less.It does work as advertised and your costly lead acid batteries do not get 'boiled' from prolonged charging in strong sunlight as the circuit merely shuts off power flowing to the battery once it reaches the cut off preset of +14.2 vDC. It then waits there illuminating the 'Green LED' till the battery voltage drops to below 13v and the cycle repeats. It does not have enough brains to 'trickle' charge at a 'float' charge level after the initial bulk absorption phase has completed. Therefore lead acid batteries that have SOC more than 80% Especially the ones that do not have any phantom loads and do not get used that often may not get fully charged with this basic design. In reality you are actually losing ton of Solar Power going nowhere using this basic ON/OFF switch sort of design.It however does have beefier QTY 3 Blocking diodes in ''parallel'' on the + VE bus line to have lower forward resistance? when the charge controller delivers power to the battery. This seems like a good idea for delivering whatever the solar panel has to offer to the connected battery minimizing loss, But as they are not thermally coupled I do have some concerns about thermal rundowns on one of the diodes in extreme situations. That explains why certain people have had their controllers blow up for no reason. - Makes sense?On the plus side, When these work, These Blocking diodes prevents any current from flowing back into the solar panel at night and does not drain the battery when left alone unused. This also prevents any damage from back-feeding voltages getting into the solar panel itself thereby protecting it from accidental abuse of reverse polarity. This also explains why the charge controller works only when there is Sunlight falling on the panel as it uses 'Solar' input voltage to illuminate the LEDs. You cannot view the state of charge (SOC) of your 12v Battery even if it is fully charged - until a partial sun shines on the solar panel! to activate the circuit.Bottom-line: For the price you pay you do get a 'basic' charge controller that may suffice certain installations that are rated to use 100w or less Solar panel capacity & for batteries with need for low amps for charging but for real utilization of your precious Solar energy and storing them into your Lead acid batteries you need to invest little bit more and get a 3 stage Maximum power point tracking (MPPT) Solar charge controllers.Three stars! from me. Thanks for reading my review!
B0006JO0XI I have two 20 watt solar panels connected to this controller, along with eight 7Ah 12V sealed batteries on the output side. I've had absolutely no problems for the last three years...the batteries charge up during the day and feed my yard lights for a few hours each evening.  It's worked reliably as annual temperatures cycled from near freezing to 105+ degrees.
B0006JO0XI Functions just as advertised-please see my other reviews to see what you can use it for. Much better than jury-rigging an old auto voltage regulator as it automatically protects from overcharge or overload. A car regulator will fry unless its an old fashioned electro-mechanical and that would be less efficient than this product. Great item!
B0006MTRJ2 I was looking for a short hose to put between a faucet and the control center for my irrigation system (connectors, timers) so I can place the connectors on a stand which is easier for me to reach. Photo of my set up attached under customer photos.Turns out it is difficult to find a short water hose.  Even though I don't need a water hose rated for drinking water this hose was the right length and I got it. Overall it works fine: the length is good and it handles my high water pressure fine. However, the connector to the faucet is plastic and even with a brand new washer and Teflon tape I have a small leak.  Nothing major but you can see in the photo that the mulch under that connection is dark - it is always a bit wet. I don't have any other connections that leaks so I know how to make good connections with the aid of Teflon tape. The long hose with a metal connector that was used on this faucet before did not leak, so the problem is with this particular plastic connector.This hose is not totally perfect, but it has been at work for a few weeks 
B0006MTRJ2 I bought this so that my dehumidifier could drain directly into the sink instead of collecting in the basin.  It connected easily and has not leaked yet.  The length was perfect for my application.  Seems like it will last a long time.
B0006MTRJ2 Said to be drinking safe, this cute little 4 ft hose is perfect for me as a split-off from the main faucet where I have the big hose. On a hot day I like to drink the really cold well water which comes out after garden-watering. The connections are tight. I always put a bit of Vaseline on washers at the beginning of the season, OR replace them with new rubber ones. I do this on sprayers as well. Maybe that's why I had no leakage problems.
B0006MTRJ2 I must have six or eight of these small hoses.  I always find a use for them!  When they are on sale, I purchase several to keep them on hand.
B0006MTRJ2 These work for the purpose I bought them, but what a pain to have to run to the store and buy washers for them.  I bought five of them.
B0006MTRJ2 This is a good quality water hose that is safe to drink from.I keep a bowl of water outside my workshop door so the dogs can drink whilst they are out with me. I was always wary that water sat in the regular garden hose could have leeched chemicals, and I would be tainting the water of my four legged friends. I now use this hose instead.  Piece of mind, for just a few bucks.Some reviewers appear to have been shipped hoses without the rubber washer. If you dont use a washer, then it will leak. Mine came with the washer and does not leak. The washers wear out over time and need replacing, I keep these on hand:Gilmour 01RW Rubber Hose Washers
B0006MTRJ2 I have a spout in my garage that sits about two feet off the floor. So I needed a short length hose to use for filling up buckets, watering can, etc. This fit the bill perfectly. Install was a breeze and it is well made, so it should last for a long time. The only draw back for me was that the hose is way to stiff. It sits in a curled up position and always retains back to that position no matter what I try to do to remedy it. Overall not a deal breaker for me as it has exceeded my expectations.
B0006OIZN4 I positioned the fly trapper next to my double doors leading to the deck.  I am surprised how many insects it traps -- I didn't know so many were visiting.  I like it because, of course, it works but also there is no odor to deal with and changing glue boards is a snap.  The boards are cheap enough to keep it relatively clean all the time.  A good investment.
B0006OIZN4 Must be working because I Am seeing fewer micro-flies flying across My screen. I lost the glue trap so put some Black Flag fly paper next to It. But I really want an Electric fly swatter that runs 24/7 on house AC Its a joy to the ears to hear that popping.
B0006OIZN4 My first reaction to this product is that it is very expensive for a single unit. But if it works better than the others, perhaps it is worth it. I bought 2 units and plugged them into different locations in the house. After two weeks of testing, they have only caught 2 mosquitoes and 1 small unidentified bug. I have seen fruit flies cruise right past them and there is still a pesky fly buzzing around my house who seems to have no interest in the traps.In addition, the UV light is rather cheaply and flimsily inserted into it's holder so it moves around and causes a loud buzzing noise which requires you to readjust the light from time to time. The buzzing noise is loud, you will hear it if you are in the same room. Finally, this unit is missing an on/off switch so the ony way to turn it off is to unplug it from the wall and find a place to put it which is ackward because of the sticky tape which slides out very easily and the fragility of the UV tube and the fact that it is not terribly secure in the socket.I realize a good trap is hard to come by and none of them are perfect, it could be that this unit is one of the better ones on the market but at $34 a pop, it just doesn't strike me as good value for money. At this time, I cannot recommend it.I'm debating if I should give Flowtron a try, the only thing holding me back is that it is not designed for indoor use which is what I require.
B0006OIZN4 Bought two of these to try to deal with mosquitos that sneak into the house.  Have caught quite a few small flies and gnats, too.  Ordered an extra pack of glue strips.  Be careful to slide the strip in properly and it will be catching flying pests right away.Nice that these are for inside use but an on/off switch would be a good addition.  To turn off, you have to take out of wall socket.  Since the light is pretty bright, I only put them on at night when we leave the rooms or if we are going to be gone for most of the day.A variation that might also work would be a model that could be plugged in but then attached higher up on a wall where the glare of the light would not be in human sight all the time.  Like the large units you see in commercial buildings but scaled down for residential use.
B0006OIZN4 I would rate this product at 5 stars easily based on how well it works. I give it 4 stars because I opened the package and realized there was only one glue card in the box. I did not think this was a big deal until the next morning I realized how well it worked and the glue card was full! I had to order some more glue cards and I am still amazed at how fast they fill up. Many different types of flies and even mosquitos get stuck on this thing. It works great!_Bottom Line_  I would recommend this product and suggest buying more glue cards ahead of time because this light actually works and the cards will need to be changed often!
B0006OIZN4 This Fly Web Fly Trap is actually much larger than expected and did work somewhat to help control my fruit fly infestation. We tried three products side by out of desperation and here are the results after 48 hours:Terro 2500 Fruit Fly Trap; used as directed, caught 2 fruit fliesFly Web Fly Trap; large plug in light based trap with sticky pads, caught 11 fruit fliesFly Paper Strips, Fly Catcher Trap, Victor Fly Bait 4 Pack; the old standby, not attractive but effective, caught at least 32 (perhaps more)The Fly Web product performed right in the middle of the other two products we tried, but no telling how many it would have caught if it was the only product we used at that time. It also only comes with one sticky pad (which turned out not be an issue since the card was far from full), but refills are availableFly Web Glue Board 10 Pack.We are sticking (mild pun intended) with the Fly Paper Strips going forward.CFH
B0006OIZN4 I have tried and tried to fild a product that would get rid of those pesky knats!! and fruit flies around the house, and I must say I HIGHLY recommend this product, and is the only thing that has worked well thus far. I keep this running day and night and you would not believe the amount of knats and fruit flies this thing catches!! You better buy more sticky pads, because this thing will sure get filled up quickly. This product receives an easy 5 star rating form me.
B0006OIZN4 We live in the country with horses on our property and cows on our neighbors. We have large fly traps (Stinger 80 Watt - 1.5 Acre traps) setup away from the house to attract and kill flying pests. I bought one of these to deal with the pests that inevitably make it inside the house.We are house training a puppy, this involves long periods of time when doors are left open, and hence a lot of flies getting in the house.When I set up this unit I counted 12 flies in the kitchen. Sadly, half of these remained the following day. It did catch some flies, but doesn't seem to attract them as one might hope. I tried placing the unit in various places, and ensured the only light on at night was the one from the trap.It will catch some flies, but it is not going to catch them all. I'm sat watching a fly just 6 feet away from the light who is happily wandering around the counter top with little interest in the light at all, even though the light it the brightest thing in the kitchen right now.Another point to consider when choosing this unit over an electric one:The sticky pad surface is illuminated by the light, meaning all the catch is displayed like a gruesome killing field; in comparison to electric killers that typically have the insects fall in to the bottom of the unit. The electric method comes at the expense of that annoying arcing sound as the insects get zapped, this unit is silent.
B0006OIZN4 Some seasons, I get a lot of small flying insects in the house, mainly because I like to operate my whole house fan.  The main offenders are gnats and small mosquitos that get through the bug screen on my windows.  This unit is great because no matter how small, these bugs will stick to the glue strip.  I bought a spare bulb and spare glue sheets jsut to have them on hand.My only wish is that the unit would add a power switch.  I only operate it at night (makes a good night light in the hallway!) and must physically unplug it and set it down to turn it off.  Either that or a darkness-sensing switch.
B0006OIZO8 This is the replacement glue boards for the absolutely awesomeFly Web Fly TrapThese glue boards are very sticky with a small strip on the edge where there is no glue. Easily slides in/out of the Fly Web Fly Trap. These glue boards get so packed with flying and even crawling critters that the card is hardly white! Inexpensive yet very effective when used with the light. Once they are on the glue board they are stuck, period._Bottom Line_ Yes, I would recommend this with the Fly Web Fly Trap to let the glue board and light do the work for you! Easily throw away the critters instead of wiping up splats!
B0006OIZO8 These Fly Web Glue Boards work as well as the single included glue board that comes with theFly Web Fly Trap. To be clear, this is not a standalone product, they are designed to be used in the \"Fly Web Fly Trap\".The Glue Boards have a protective sheet that needs to be removed before they inserted in the dedicated slot of the main unit. This is easy to do and it works reasonably well.We did a comparison of the \"Fly Web Fly Trap\" verses theTerro 2500 Fruit Fly TrapandFly Paper Strips, Fly Catcher Trap, Victor Fly Bait 4 Pack, with the old fashion but very ugly Flay Paper Strips winning hands down.Recommended, if you own theFly Web Fly TrapCFH
B0006OIZO8 These pads are great!! and the only thing that I have used that is 99.9% effective with knats and fruit flies.
B0006OIZO8 Talk about &#34;stick to.&#34;  This board has it.  I positioned the fly catcher next to my double doors leading to the deck.  I am surprised how many insects it catches -- I didn't know so many were dropping by.  I like it because, of course, it works but also there is no odor to deal with and changing glue boards is a snap.  The boards are cheap enough to keep it relatively clean all the time.  A good investment.
B0006OIZO8 Holds a ridiculous amount of flying nasties that you don't like. Cost is one dollar per sheet, and sheets can last 3 days (if you live in the rainforest and leave all your windows open, or about two weeks if you live in a normal urban home.I live deep in the woods in the Midwest, and change these about once a week and the house is free of all flying buzzers and buggers.
B0006OIZO8 These work and fit fine into the original units, Web Fly Trap by Gardner, as advertised. And while not cheap, not terribly expensive.
B0006OIZO8 This glue board is for use with their Fly Web trap ([...]).  THis is a great product because unlike bug zappers it is safe.  it also catches very very small flying insects like gnats and baby mosquito's.
B0006TYH2M I have tried several hummingbird feeders and while I've only had this one a few days it should be great.  It comes apart easily.  The liquid goes in the bottom section so nothing has to be turned upside down for filling which should eliminate sugar water dripping.  It even has a built in ant trap in the middle.
B0006TYH2M Don't even bother buying another hummingbird feeder.  This is the best.  It's easy to clean and refill.  And the built-in ant moat works great.  I bought the smaller one last year, and the hummers LOVED it.  So I upgraded and bought the larger one for next spring.  Now I'll use both in separate locations so they don't fight over it.
B0006TYH2M Easy to fill.  Easy to clean.  Easy to judge when a refill is necessary.  Ant-proof.What's not to like?  I have 3 and they are busy all summer long.
B0006TYH2M Hummzingers are the best feeders.  It's easy to clean, and attracts lots of hummingbirds.  I have another smaller hummzinger feeder, and am happy with that one as well.
B0006TYH2M Experiments have shown that BPA is harmful to animals with negative impacts on functions including development, metabolism, reproductive activity and many more (E.g., see Science Daily \"Harmful effects of bisphenol A demonstrated experimentally\", January 22, 2013, or Google for a very long list of other articles. The danger of BPA has pretty well become common knowledge at this point and doesn't seem to be disputed.)I emailed Aspects to ask if this feeder contains BPA because it was not clear that it did not. I received a reply from Carol that Aspects does use BPA in this and all their other polycarbonate feeders. She also said they have no current intent to make a BPA-free feeder. Let's encourage them to change that stance!I think it goes without saying that we should not be feeding our beautiful wildlife chemicals that harm them if we care about them as much as we like to think we do. Even if one isn't concerned about the first generation of hummingbirds, consider the likely possibility that the chemicals are also transferred to offspring during gestation and may accumulate through generations. Furthermore, consider the food chain and the general fact that we're putting these chemicals out in our environment.Nalgene and other companies have removed BPA from their plastics and still make very strong and aesthetic plastics without it. This feeder has many _great_ properties, but it's not the only feeder with them; personally I will buy alternatives until Aspects decides to make a BPA-free hummingbird feeder to purchase one of theirs. I would love to see them do so.
B0006TYH2M Attracts the hummers amd keeps them around.  Much easier to clean than the glass bottle variety.
B0006U2FJ8 I feed birds all winter and the sparrows, cardinals, finches, etc. - all come to eat.  In past years water that wasn't ice was the one thing they needed to sustain them.  I bought this to use in a birdbath so that my birds could drink, as well as, eat all winter.  It's very economical to use and the birds think it's just a rock at the bottom of the bird bath.  I'm very pleased with this item.  I would recommend it to anyone interested in keeping our &#34;feathered friends&#34; going over the winter.
B0006U2FJ8 This piece of equipment does a respectable job of keeping at least a little part of the surface of the bird-bath free of ice during the winter.  Once the temps get down close to zero F., there's not much open water left for the thirsty birdies, but it has never allowed the surface to totally freeze over.
B0006U2FJ8 And hasn't GOTTEN to -20 below! It's the end of January here in CT and we've had several nights of 0 to 15 below (including wind chill). I just went out to check on the birdbath and it's iced up solid as a rock. There isn't even any remote warmth towards the top of the &#34;De-Icer&#34;. I gave it a four star because I truly like this thing! It's worked through anything above 0 up until this point. I'm really not sure that anything 50 watts would go to -20, but I figured in this part of New England, I wouldn't have to worry. I'm hoping it's not broken at all, but I'll have to wait and see if it does its job when it gets a little warmer (like in the teens or twenties).Again, four stars, because it was totally worth it up to this point and we don't get this bitter cold weather here very often (or for very long periods of time). I just thought it should be mentioned so prospective buyers would be aware:)
B0006U2FJ8 I used this during the Nebraska winter with temperatures regularly dipping into the single digits.  The de-icer keeps the water warm enough for algae to continue growing.  Of course, the area of ice-free water will depend on how cold it is:  After all, this thing is not a 1000-watt power hog.  When temps dip into the single digits, I typically see about an 8-inch diameter circle of ice-free water.  User submitted pictures illustrate this accurately.  (My bird bath is about 2.5 inches deep at its deepest point).It is my understanding that birds do not bathe during the winter because of the danger that their feathers will become wet and subsequently freeze.  Therefore, I don't think it's important to keep the entire bird bath ice-free.  Instead, birds just need enough clear water for drinking.  Indeed, drinking is all I've seen them do during the winter, even on days when the entire bird bath is ice-free.  Because of that, I see no reason to buy a super warm energy hogging de-icer.The cord is heavy duty and the de-icer itself has some weight to it.  Still, I put a brick on the cord to keep the de-icer situated properly in my bird bath.I get more birds at my bird bath during the winter than I do during the summer...most likely because it is the only source of unfrozen water for some distance.  Squirrels also enjoy the open water.  I'm very pleased with the purchase.
B0006U2FJ8 Bought this in the summer (much cheaper then) and put it out about 2 months ago.  We have our own \"homemade\" fountain which consists of a large pot that holds about 10 gallons of water and a shallow dish on top.This product is able to keep the water liquid, combined with the moving water from the fountain.  Night time temps have averaging about 15 F.  The birds have been flocking to it.The cord is very, very short, about a foot long.  That is one drawback because you will need an outdoor extension cord. It is sturdy and does not get too warm.  You can easily pick it up with your bare hands when it is running.Did not notice the impact on the electric bill.
B0006U2FJ8 This little heater is actually one of the few products I have ever purchased which was far better than even advertized.  I have three birdbaths and have one in each.  These work wonderfully and I have had no problem what so ever even on the coldest days and nights.  I also have a smallish fish pond near my porch and I have used two of these things in it.  As with the birdbaths, they work perfectly.  Normally I have to remove the fish during the winter, but so far have not had to go through that chore.  We live in an area where we have frequent freezing weather but never down into the single digits so I don't think that will be a problem.  People do not realize that birds drink during the winter months as they do during the summer and that this can cause them problems if they do not have a reliable source of water.  I must say that the squirrels and other critters that surround our place enjoy it too.  As I said, this is a product that I truly got my monies worth from.
B0006U66B6 Well constructed and made of heavy brass.  Valve turns smoothly with little effort.  Will definitely buy more.  The black plastic ring helps you hold it while attaching it to the hose.
B0006U66B6 I GOT SEVERAL OF THESE AND PUT A QUICK CONNECTION ON THEM TO USE ON THE FAUCET TO SLOW THE WATER FLOW BECAUSE WHEN YOU USE THE FAUCET TO SLOW DOWN THE WATER FLOW IT WILL EVENTUALLY CUT A SMALL GAP IN THE FAUCET CAUSING IT TO LEAK AND THEN IT WILL HAVE TO BE REPLACED.
B0006U66B6 Must have shut-off valve so you dont have to keep running back to the main valve to cut the water on/off when changing attachments.
B0006U66B6 I was looking in the big box stores for this, but all I found was plastic or a poly type.  Gilmour makes quality items, and you can rest assured it will stand the test of time.
B0006U66B6 I wasn't sure if I should buy it.  Glad I did.  Solid product.  Easy to connect and turn ON and OFF.  Does not leak.  Just feels solid.  Able to use grip to apply added pressure when tightening.  Good product for the price.
B0006U66B6 High Quality materials used.  I purchased to replace a low-quality plastic one I previously bought elsewhere.  This one appears to be made of heavy metal.
B0006U66B6 I hooked these up to all my garden hose attachments so I could put a quick connect on my hose. Before the quick connect I put on this brass shut off valve. Now I dont have to run 100 feet to turn off the water, or kink the hose to switch attachments.. I love it
B0006U66B6 I bought a couple of different Gilmour Brass Shut-Off Valves as a way to block water flow from leaky outdoor faucets. There are better and more expensive alternatives but this valve works just fine for me. Replacing the washer in a faucet here in the Atlanta area by a plumber will run about 85 bucks or more. You can do it for a lot less yourself if conditions are favorable for you to do so. By that I mean if you have easy access to turning off your water supply and you have the tools and replacement washers to do the job. Or, you can take the easy way out and attach this valve to your faucet and have control of the leaks. Some outdoor faucets do require washer replacement to stop the leak because of the way they are constructed. I am fortunate not to have that type. My only complaint is that the Bosch Corp chooses to have these valves made in China rather than creating jobs here in the USA. But this is a review of the valve itself so I must give it 5 stars and a big BOO! to the Robert Bosch Tool Corp for pimping jobs in China though they have a presence in Peoria IL.
B0006U66B6 this is well built and serves it's purpose functionally.my complaint is that the hole inside the shutoff valve/bearing is considerably smaller than the width of the hose connection.  when putting this on, you are basically blocking off around half of the capacity of whatever is after it in the chain.i use it at the end of my hose, right before my gilmour quick connects, so that when i change out my sprinklers and nozzles, i don't have to walk across the yard to turn off the hose so that i don't get sprayed (so lazy).  it works fine, and i haven't seen any real loss of range with the water, but i think the change would be noticeable if i put another hose after this connector.
B0006U66B6 This is solid compare to the similar plastic connectors. I also found the valve easier to twist. My wife can even twist it off and on. The large female side allows the connection to be made flawlessly and drip proof.
B0006U66B6 I needed a shut off valve when cleaning a spa with a hose vacuum. This one is surprisingly well-constructed and functions easily and well.
B0006U66B6 Before ordering, I was afraid of having a cheap plastic bearing inside.  No where in the internet, including manufacturer's web site, I could check the spec on this part, nor anyone of reviewers commented on the type of ball inside.  This one does incorporates metal ball bearing, but have a similar characteristics as $0.99 plastic part, badly leaking water at the joint.  Time wasted to make it function like a simple shut-off valve, in order to save time required on returning, just priceless.  Now, I understand why unusually high number of negative feedback on this junk.  Over last few years, we have become so acquainted to junk imported from China, it's just amazing how some users will tolerate badly designed and manufactured pats.I had no idea that designing a water shut-off valve was such a difficult task, that requires a special skill.  It's made to leak, no matter how much connector is tightened.  I thought Gilmour was a reputable American manufacturer, and I'm totally off.  Do engineers at Gilmore check the prototype before sending its design to full production, or do marketing people actually check if it's viable product?  Please do not write reviews without thoroughly checking them first, or post phony reviews your untruthful reviews are wasting other people's valuable time.
B0006U66B6 I have these Gilmour connectors all around the house, and I love them.  They are practically indestructable, and exceeds my expectations.  I have them hooked up to hoses, bypassing our water softener.  I also use the double connectorsGilmour 13 Brass 2-Way Connectoras well, which are equally as good.  A must have for every home.I recommend using this with a small piece of teflon to prevent corrosion at the connectors.  If corrosion does take place, it can become very difficult to unscrew it.
B0006U66B6 I ordered these as they were not plastic and were made of brass.  They are heavy duty and work well so I am glad that I purchased them.
B0006U66B6 This is exactly as advertised.  It is a solid piece, feels substantial and does exactly what I wanted.  The price on this was dramatically lower than the same thing at the local big box store and hardware store.
B0006VK68E Works great to get seeds started and roots going; especially along with using the Hydrofarm JSV2 2-Foot Jump Start T5 Grow Light System
B0006VK68E To start with I do a lot of gardening. I have over 15 species of fruit tree in my yard, a 1000 sq ft garden, and also have a wide diversity of flowering plants in my yard to promote species diversity, attract beneficial insects, and, of course, for ascetic appeal.I use this humidity dome for both cuttings and seed starting. To cut to the chase the product does indeed work as intended with some caveats.Lets start with the heat mat. The heat mat itself works as intended. It keeps an even and warm temperature, but the diagram says to place it under the hot house, so the perfectly heated mat sits below not one, but two pieces of plastic with air in between them. Plastic is not a good conductor of heat, so the mat becomes far less effective if used as indicated. For myself I have a fluorescent tube light hanging a food above the humidity dome, so the heat inside stays a nice 85 degrees Farenheit.The dome itself has 3 vents. 1 at the top, and one on each side. Even with a number of adjustments airflow is stagnant. I open the dome and let a fan sit on it for a few seconds in the morning and evening to prevent stagnant air accumulation.Also it comes with a very, very small sample of Clonex, which is inconveniently placed in a package that makes dipping cuttings quite difficult. I get the product placement thing, but they didn't plan that one out too well.I'd rather pay less and skip the Clonex. I do however own and use Clonex religiously as I have found it to be the most effective rotting gel around. I just don't want a messy and small sample pack of it.I decided on 3 stars because all my cuttings and seedlings have done quite well, however, they also needed regular attention. An ideal humidity dome would require far less attention. on top of that the instructions tell you to place the heat mat in a spot that reduces its effectiveness.
B0006VK68E I wanted a heating pad so I figured I'd get the whole kit.  This kit is a bit disappointing because the plastic dome does not fit well on the base so there is an air gap.  I have this sitting on a wooden floor and the heater has worked fine.  I just think it was very overpriced for what I got.  The plastic parts are thin and would require me to be careful if I want to use them for years to come.  I had hoped for better.
B0006VK68E This does not come with the pellets. It also does not say that it does. Maybe the description has been edited after someone complained, but it clearly says that its a \"72-insert tray\" NOT that the inserts are included. Here are some tips.If you don't want to spend the money for more jiffy pellets at least get a good seed starting soil or add a B-vitamin fertilizer to a traditional potting/garden soil to assist in healthy root development. If you use a traditional soil with fertilizers be sure to add a diluted plant fertilizer when sprouts appear. Seedlings burn easy, you do not want to over-fertilize them. This will make transplanting difficult!!Mold can grow very quickly, which is why commercial hydrofarmers use fungicides. Root rot is one of the most common killers of hydro grown plants. You can purchase a good fungicide for around $8. If you get a concentrated version be sure to follow the dilution directions exactly. More is NOT better.You should also be aware of your water quality if you are using tap. Some municipal supplies are highly chlorinated and/or not pH balanced. This can result in sprouts that appear then quickly burn, yellow and die. If you want fantastic results get a pH/Chlorine kit ($20, or you could even get aquarium test strips to make it easier/cheaper) and check your water before beginning any sort of hydrofarm. Additives can be purchased to alter the pH, if your water is highly chlorinated, use filtered with a hydro-fertilizer.Some of the heat mats are not calibrated correctly, its a factory issue. Be sure to place the heat mat on a solid topped table, not glass, and to be extra careful (if you're worried) place a towel over the heat mat to help diffuse the heat (this will not negatively impact the effect the heat has on the seedlings). The heat mat is not even required, you could toss it as long as your hydrofarm is indoors and gets sufficient sunlight throughout the day to maintain warmth. They do not mention all of these things because if they make it sound complicated they don't sell as much product. In fact it is all VERY simple. There are just a few extra steps one should take if they are serious about obtaining great results. My personal opinion, steer clear of Miracle-Gro, use Schultz NPK 10-15-10 ($ the one with the eyedropper, very cheap) or Fox Farm ($$$ if you want to spend money). My grandparents were orchard farmers, I've seen these cheap plastic cloning trays work very well for many years with the proper pellet inserts and fertilizers.
B0006VK68E I cooked my seeds with this contraption. The heating pad would be infinitely better if it had temperature control. Though all in all I like that all the components were included.
B0006VK68E I placed seeds into a miracle grow potting mix, watered, then covered up the dome and in 3 days every one of the 12 species had sprouted to about an inch tall (or more in the case of fast growing sunflowers).Echinacea, red lettuce, romaine lettuce, snap peas, orange sunflower, red sunflower, chives, 4 different heirloom tomatoes, and dill - all of them are growing like weeds.  As soon as they're big enough for transplanting, I'll be using it again to sprout another 12 or so species for the spring garden.The moisture level is pretty constant after te first and only watering 10 days ago, since you can keep the dome mostly shut (or open it up if that's too wet).My only complaint is that the dome dribbles water when you move it since the set is designed with the clear plastic dome on top/over the edge.  But, that was nothing a tea towel under the seed bed doesn't fix.  For the price, I really couldn't be happier!
B0006VK68E This simple and inexpensive pad has been WONDERFUL.  The difference it makes in sprouting my seeds is incredible.  At first, I cautiously placed the pad and greenhouse on a table, fussing over it. Now, its on the tile floor (with a towel underneath to keep the cold ceramic tile from leaching too much heat) and works well without notice.It comes with a plastic egg-carton like tray to start your own seeds with your own soil.  However, I'm lazy.  I just put one of those square trays with the soil pellets in them ($5 from the hardware store) to start my seeds instead; fits and works perfectly.I will not be without this ever.  Temperature is great.  Keeps a consistent warmth into the soil.STRONGLY RECOMMEND.
B0006VK68E I find that convenience often outweighs the quality or even usability of the product. The thought that you could just place your plants out of sight out of mind while some miraculous grow kit does the work for you is an ideal based on nonsense. If it was that easy, there wouldn't be instructions.I have found that warmth assists in germination over 40 years of gardening. But I don't buy a dedicated germination kit. The standard seeding kits available for $3.00 are fine. I have one I like for the windowsill, not because I love the brand or soil it contains, but because it FITS ON THE WINDOWSILL!! That makes it convenient for me and agreeable to the wife.Heating pads are kind of silly. The cost is ridiculous and, if you really want to heat your seedlings, then put an electric blanket or throw under them. You can get a single blanket electric or throw for about $20 and you can sit like 6 of these starter trays on them and warm them all with a totally reusable unit.I did notice that when on the electric blanket, the seedlings start a bit earlier. And if in a colder area (basement/attic) the blanket was essential to get them to kick into gear. But the blanket is huge and you can cover a much wider starting area. If you want a smaller area, fold the blanket. Low temp is usually enough to keep my kit around 70, but your environment may be different. Don't put either outside in 20 degree weather or you will get chilling results.At any rate, these warming seed starting kits are a waste of money. If you have absolutely no sun exposure or are starting so many you can't keep them in the house on a window sill or near any window, then get a heating blanket and a grow light. Much cheaper in the long run.
B0006VK68E This Hydrofarm hothouse with heat mat is a simple and effective way to start your plants from seed. The heat mat in particular will last you years and years most likely. The hothouse itself is of questionable manufacture, being a flimsy plastic, but it does what it is supposed to perfectly. There is a vent on top and one to either side of it as well to help control the temp and humidity if you dont use a guage. The 72 seed cells are likewise nothing special, but are again, quite effective. I have placed a variety of seeds in this, from tomatoes, to peppers to quinoa to tobacco, and everything tends to spout within 4 to 7 days. Anyways, even though of flimsy manufacture, the price is right and the goods are effective, so i give this 4 stars accordingly. Just be gentle with it, and if necessary, save the mat in the event that you damage the hothouse.Enjoy!
B0006VK68E I bought this item to start seeds and try my hand at cloning for the first time.  In both regards it has performed to my satisfaction.  A few points:- The dome is thin plastic.  I mean like solo cup thin.  It wouldn't take much to completely destroy it.  My small accurite thermo sitting on top makes a nice dent in it.- It leaks.  The condensate on the dome rolls down the sides and out of the edges.  This could have been easily fixed by making the dome fit inside the base instead of the outside.  Try not to put anything you don't want wet underneath this.- The heat mat, despite being several layers of plastic below the grow chamber, keeps a nice amount of warmth and humidity in the dome.  On last measurement I was at 89% RH and 81 degrees with half the top vent open.  The ambient temperature of my basement is around 65f.- It's big!  From the picture it just doesn't look all that impressive, but when you get the box you realize this guy is pretty large.  Make sure and check the dimensions!- The holes for the inserts fit rapid rooters perfectly!Following some simple direction was all that was needed to achieve successful results using this item.  I filled the base of the item with Ph adjusted water just to where the bottoms of the cups were submerged.  Soaked my rapid rooters in Ph adjusted water as well and dropped my seeds/clones in.  Plugged in the heat mat and set it under my 2ft T-5 fixture.  Within a week I spotted a few seeds germinating, and my clones looked just as good as the day I clipped them.  A week after that my clones had put on a decent amount of roots.  Mostly I have been screwing around with cloning just to see if I could do it, and I am 20 for 20 thus far.I think the real trick is to just leave the damn thing alone.  The more people fiddle around with the top off the more time it takes building up the humid environment again.  That's my trick anyways and it seems to be paying off.  I will only take the top off when it is time to transplant.I read several negative reviews about this item before I purchased it, and for the most part they are correct.  Despite being happy with this product I deducted a star because of the slight water leakage.  I mean there is a electrical device sitting under this thing that leaks water.  I'm no electrical engineer, but common sense tells me that one should take precautions when using this thing.Once again though it is the price that makes me recommend this.  You aren't going to find anything even close to this price that has the utility of this item.
B0006VK68E Bought this for my floral/dried flowers and spice business.The heated mat is the answer for it's ease of growing.My plants for the garden were germinated and on their way ,even when growing season was delayed .I bought two and now have a garden growing mostly from seeds(great seeds available on Amazon)
B0006VK68E Some have said that they thought this was a bit pricey for what you get. I agree - the little hot house is lightweight plastic, and they could have thrown in the peat pellets. I can buy a 72 peat pellet hot house by a competitor, with the pellets included, mind you, at a big-box retailer, for about $7.HOWEVER, that one only has a 2-inch transparent plastic top on it - and this one has 7 inches of growing room. In addition, this has some simple but effective adjustable vents in the hood - both ends and in the top - which are useful to control the humidity level.Since I had to go buy the pellets anyway, I got the 2-inch hothouse they came in. I started my seeds in it, and now that they're up, I've moved thed them to the Hydrofarm product, which offers increased growing space.What you're really paying for is the Heat Mat. It's a great idea to have a consistent heat under germinating seedlings! Before it arrived, I tried a few basil seeds in a kitchen window, and one night it got cold. Bang. Poor little guys are casualties.Now, in the Hot House with the Heat Mat, all my babies are fine, thank you! By the way - you will need aHydrofarm MTPRTC Digital Thermostat For Heat Matsto control the heat - sold separately.I've got them both, and they work well together. You plug the Heat Mat's electrical cord into the Thermostat, which plugs into the wall. Oh yes - the Thermostat comes with a probe you place inside the Hot House, where it can read the actual temperature your seedlings are at.Recommended!
B0006VK68E Very happy with the product.  The heat is consistent and I love the ability to adjust airflow.  The only suggestion and reason for 4 starts instead of five is that condensation tends to drip out.  The plastic could have been moulded with the lip turned up and drain ridges put in which would have kept the condensation in.  It doesn't pour out or anything but I've had to put a piece of cardboard and a garbage bag under the unit to prevent it from ruining my table.  Also happy with Amazon shipping to Japan for me since, even with shipping, it's cheaper than what is available here.  Will definitely be ordering more Hydrofarm products in the future.
B0006VK68E When I first opened the package, I was disappointed.  This cover and box is about the same thickness & quality as a jiffy mini-greenhouse that you could pick up for less than 10 bucks.  If you're expecting a heavy duty piece, this isn't for you.  It seems to do the job though.  The little side and top vents are the same quality as the rest, so don't expect anything mind-blowing.  On the positive side they seem to do a pretty good job controlling humidity.  I have them just a crack open to keep things nice and moist and the heating pad is generating enough heat to fog up the cover.  As long as it doesn't fall over and get stepped on, I am sure I'll be happy.  One misstep though and this thing is going to crack and be ready for the trash bin.  I WOULD buy this again, although I'd be much happier if it were 15 bucks.
B0006ZI6H8 I looked at many different hose timers and settled on this one because of the high ratio of 5-star to 1-star reviews. There will always be a few units that don't work properly or a few people that are hard to satisfy but this timer should please the most critical of users.This unit does almost everything that a standard, multi-zone sprinlker timer does except have multiple zones. You can select days to turn on or two or three days between waterings. For each watering you may specify up to four time periods with a start time and a duration between 1 and 360 minutes. The timer section easily slides off the valve body so you can program it at your kitchen table without removing it from the faucet. From the time I unpacked this device to the time I installed it and started its use took approximately 30 minutes. Let me tell you how I am using it.I had a deer problem with my front gardens. They would eat my flowers. I purchased a Scarecrow motion-activated sprinkler (see other review) and set it up to try. It was wonderful and completely eliminated my problem. Having determined that it worked, I wished to eliminate the need for me to turn it on at night and off in the morning. That is where the Orbit timer comes in. I connected the timer to my faucet via a Gilmour 13 Brass 2-Way Connector (see other review) and now have a deer-proofed yard without fiddling.Note that the timer requires two 9-volt batteries in a relatively watertight compartment and you must supply these. Not a problem in my book as it insures that I start with fresh batteries. They should last all season according to what I have read. So, as long as it works properly and lasts a few seasons, I won't complain.
B0006ZI6H8 This Orbit 62001 Lawn and Garden Digital Watering Timer is handy for automatic watering of trees and shrubs. It operates on two 9-volt batteries. It consists of a motor-operated valve and a timer.  The user attaches the female coupling of the valve to a hose bib and the male coupling to a garden hose or drip irrigation pipe.  The timer can be removed from the assembly for easy programming.  There are four watering cycles per day; it can be programmed to run seven days or any day(s) of the week, or every 2nd day or 3rd day. The timer can also be turned on manually.  However, each cycle or manual operation lasts only up to 6 hours.  I found it inadequate because I use the timer for drip irrigation, which by its nature can last a lot more than 6 hours.  Other than the short duration, this Orbit timer runs well.
B0006ZI6H8 This unit works reliably as described and being able to remove the programming module is a real benefit, but there are some shortcomings that need to be considered.  On the plus side, the thing works.  That's important to me as I tried another that wasn't so reliable and since I'm on a well and would be away when the unit is on, having it function correctly ranks very high on my list of required features.  Even if the battery runs out (it's suppose to last all season) the unit quits in the off position, so the water is not left running until the well is dry.A feature that I like very much is that the electronic module slips out of the spigot attachment bar easily so you can see the screen better for programming or reprogramming.  Sometimes a spigot is located where visibility is poor and it helps me particularly because the screen is not large and the instructions on the flip up cover are really tiny.  The programming would not be intuitive to me, but with the instructions right there, it's easy enough.Thanks to other reviewers, I had the two 9V batteries on hand, but didn't heed the advice to have a Y connector on hand for a second hose for manual use. I thought I could easily reset the unit to allow that.  Well, you can hand water by pushing the button for manual operation, but then you also have to set the number of minutes you intend to be watering manually, after which it resets to auto/run, and you can't just hit the program off button because 'off' doesn't allow water to flow.The problem is I have no idea how long I'll be using the hose manually.  It could be the standard 10'ish minutes of watering the hanging baskets, but I may want to alter that routine for some reason this time or I may be interrupted or maybe the dog bowl needs filling or a trash can needs to be washed or the car.  You get the picture.  In short, I don't know how many minutes I need and don't want to think about that every time, nor hold the + button for lots of minutes just in case.  That's just way more effort than I want to put into using the water for a dozen reasons (especially when it's over 100 outside).  Having the Y connector avoids that problem if the timer is to be installed on a frequently used spigot.The other brand I tried before (that I returned for non-performance) allowed for two hoses so I hadn't considered the extra annoyance of switching repeatedly from the hand-use nozzle to the sprinkler, nor the fact that my main hose is white and doesn't look very good snaked out through the yard to the sprinkler location (normally it's wrapped up after each use on a hose cart).  Sigh.  I've now ordered a Y connector and have to wait to hook it up.  (Yes, I know, why didn't I just drive in town to get one at the hardware store--well, I did, and the dumb thing leaked, so I've ordered a higher quality unit.) Who knew this would be so complicated.I do wish I could review my watering program as with the other unit, but that isn't an option with this one. It does show the time and day and you can push various buttons to see what you'd set as start time and duration.  Speaking of which, you will not want to reset start time very often because the buttons are rather hard to push and you have to hold the + or - button forever while it starts at 12am and moves up or down by the minute (not hour then minute, just minute, all 60 of them each hour) to reach your desired time.Bottom line, I'm not thrilled with some of this unit's features, but it works and that is the top priority.  With a separate hose for other watering activities, I'll be satisfied with this timer to handle my automated watering needs and feel confident while I'm away.
B0006ZI6H8 This timer looks good and works well. It is easy to program or to change functions such as days to water, watering time, etc. The ability to remove the control section from the valve is a real plus, I set it up in the cool of my house instead of our 100F+ Texas heat. Reliability remains a question. We have only had it about a month, but so far it works well.  It feeds a 12 psi pressure regulator and 150 ft of soaker hose, a very nice setup!Update 10/2010. We are approaching the end of the second full season of use with this water timer. It has worked flawlessly. For reliable operation, depending on use, you have to be prepared to replace a battery at least once per season.Update 5/2013. We are in our fourth year using this Orbit watering timer. We are ordering a second one as our garden is expanding. Usually we put the unit in storage for the winter, however, as it rarely gets below 20 deg F, and does not freeze for extended periods, we let it operate year around for the past year. The only problem we have had is corrosion on one of the battery terminals (that occurred several years ago), that supplies power to the valve. A thorough cleaning solved that and operation has been reliable since then.
B0006ZI6H8 Good news is it has held up for a couple of years, bad news is I had a hell of  time programming it, and it was very expensive.  It's not an easy unit to set up, but it does work if you figure it out.  I won't buy another (there are others on the market that work as well that are cheaper and easier--more like a digital watch--to program).
B0006ZI6H8 This would be a great timer. It is easy to set. Keeps the settings when you change batteries. Resists water. Allows manual override and lets you remove the timer from the valve to program. The big problem that it shares with most of these timers is lack of reliability. Mine stopped working within a week. The company was very easy to deal with and offered to ship a new one next day but I need a timer now or my plants will die so I will return it to Amazon.
B0006ZI6H8 Mine lasted for two seasons ,it worked well while it worked,,,,,I have used 4or 5 different timers and none of them last more than 2 seasons,,,My next purchase is the Orbit 91213....looks nice,,we will see.
B0006ZI6H8 So far I've purchased two of the Orbit 62001 Lawn Timers, but I've gone through about four of them with Amazon and the local mega-mart. The first 62001 I purchased in 2008 died (and it was my fault) when I left it out for a day during a freeze (note: I live in southern Texas, and by \"freeze\" I meant - it hit 30 for about two hours at night). The digital portion worked fine but the actual physical housing which rotated the open-and-close water flow restrictor would simply no longer operate. I replaced this unit with another from Amazon and it worked fine for the following summer. Having learned my lesson, I unhooked the timer for the next winter and left it in a dry, insulated, garage. The garage would hit a low of around 40 versus the outdoor temperature of 30 or less. The garage never hit freezing temperatures and the batteries were out of the unit until the following spring. When spring came, the same problem occurred - the digital portion worked fine, the physical water restrictor would no longer move. I ordered replacement #3 from Amazon and this time straight out of the clamshell the unit would not work - same exact issue. I returned the unit to Amazon and grabbed a replacement from the local mega mart - again, same exact issue.Now, I should state that I live in an area with hard water and yes I can see that being a possible issue.  Perhaps gunking up the the inner-workings of these timers and restricting the mechanics from moving about properly. However with my two \"mostly-broken\" units I've torn them apart and found no calcium build up on the regulator or even evidence of rust or circuit corrosion (I am not an engineer but when comparing a working to non-working unit, it all looked the same). I should also note that I have aOrbit 62032 Yard Watering Systemin my backyard and it has been working fine for three years running. After multiple tries with the 62001, I've stepped down to the slightly less functionally robustOrbit 62061N Single-Dial Water Timerin hopes that it might last longer than a year.I've given these units two stars (instead of one) because there is the slightest chance that I simply might have been unlucky with my four units. When these worked, they worked flawlessly day-after-day. Multiple timers and day-to-day nuances made watering during drought restrictions a breeze. I just wish they would last.
B0006ZI6H8 This unit is easy to program and was the closest hose timer that resembled  controllers on irrigation systems.  You can set days to water, set the start times and duration of 4 individual watering times a day, manually override, delay 24hrs for days it rains... perfect.  However, this unit will not be adequate if you have long runs where every little bit of water pressure counts.  When open to water, it is restrictive and you will lose some water pressure.  A shame really.
B00075M3W6 This was the third one I purchased as my other two just stopped working after 2 seasons. This one didn't even last this season. not wasting any more money on these things.
B00075M3W6 I have an odd birdbath arrangement on my deck that allowed me to test this unit's effectiveness. There is no question the birds prefer it, and though I still find mosquito larvae, there are fewer.  I have two identical birdbaths next to each other and found that when I added the Water Wiggler to one, the birds went to it exclusively over the other.  It was so obvious they liked it, I bought a second for the other bath.Last year I replaced two end tables and temporarily stored the old ones next to one another on my deck covered with a tarp.  I had removed the glass that had been set in the tops when I stored the tables and then a heavy rain created pools in the rectangular depressions.  I noticed that the birds found this arrangement just right for bathing as the depressions are shallow and the space is good sized.  Since I enjoyed watching the birds drinking and bathing, I decided to leave the tables there, but the standing water caused mosquito issues so I purchased a Water Wiggler to deter that and set it in one of the depressions.  Almost immediately, the birds gravitated to that space leaving the other unused.  Now both pools have Water Wigglers.  I still check them for larvae and algae and have to replace the water regularly, but that's easy and the birds are happy.  While I have a well-attended normal birdbath in my backyard, some birds won't go to it.  The thrushes and warblers apparently aren't comfortable there, but do come to the deck baths with the moving water.I found one set of batteries kept each unit working all last summer and fall.  I replaced the batteries this spring and they are going strong.  They seem to be quite sturdy as visiting night creatures sometimes knock them over or even out of the baths, but I put them back in each time and they show no signs of complaint.
B00075M3W6 I have owned this little unit for over a year and it works great.  Why? It is hard for birds to judge the depth of the water when it is not moving so they may pass over your bath thinking that it is too deep.  (this may sound silly to us, but it is true).  I get 2-3 times more birdbath activity now.  You still have to clean your water and I remove the Wiggler before winter.  The batteries last many months.  Honestly, the price is a little steep for what it is, but it is worth it for what it does - attracts more birds.  It should last many seasons with proper care.
B00075M3W6 Granted, out of the box this API water agitator doesn't look like much. Packaged with (3) metal legs, (4) rubber anchors and (1) metal agitator, set up takes seconds. I slapped in two D cell batteries (not included) and placed this unit into our bird bath. I like the fact that no wiring is required. It is quiet. The continuous agitation does repel mosquitoes. There is a rubber gasket in place to prevent water seepage into the motor housing. Trust me it doesn't work.I'm not a big fan of the snap in metal legs. The legs have fallen out of their slots on more then one occasion. I get about three months juice before its time to replace the batteries. I add algaecide to aid in keeping the water clear. It must work because I see both birds and butterflies dropping in for a visit. Now the bad news. It didn't even make through the summer. The high price tag on this lemon is another reason to think other options.
B00075M3W6 just recently bought this and it keeps the water moving which is what I wanted. So far it has not attracted any birds in fact it only about 5ft away from a mounted smaller bird bath which they do use to drink from , they just ignore this one but I will give it time and see what happens.
B00075M3W6 This 5.5-inch plastic and metal dome-shaped device when placed in a birdbath, armed with two D size batteries, wiggles the water creating silent concentric ripples from end to end. So why would anyone spend twenty or more dollars for a contraption that looks like a breast on stilts and just sits in the backyard birdbath? A fondness for concentricity? A touch of avian eccentricity? A passion for safe electricity? A love of simplicity? Read on.Rationale for the Water Wiggler from Allied Precision IndustriesStill water in a container eventually becomes stagnant, the sides and bottom of the water's receptacle becoming green and slimy with what we technically call gunk. The still water is also an attractive destination for mosquitoes, a safe place for these critters to lay their eggs ensuring the continuation of the vile species. A spinner on the bottom of the Water Wiggler agitates the water (but not the parched birds), creating continuous, gentle ripples in the birdbath's water and discouraging, maybe even preventing, mosquitoes from laying their eggs in birdbaths. The moving water is said to attract birds and more importantly \"helps prevent the spread of west Nile virus by eliminating still water in birdbaths.Product Features:Easy to install. (Unless you are very, very short, Shleppies!) Just set it in the water. No Wires! No plumbing! No cumbersome extension cords!Operates on just two D-cell batteries for a full season of continuous use. (Unless you live in a state with one yearlong season.)Operates 24 hours a day. (Great for those night owls)Silent. And very quiet too.Full one year warrantyMay use in the winter to agitate the water and attract more birds. (Probably won't discourage too many mosquitoes in the winter)In the Backyard Birdbath on Spud AcresWe used the water wiggler in one of our three birdbaths for two seasons, and despite my initial skepticism, seemed to fulfill most of its promise. The birdbath with the wiggler was by far the most popular, attracting many birds for baths, drinks or a ringside perch. A birdbath housing a Water Wiggler still has to be cleaned, just a little less often. I know I felt so much more comfortable knowing I wasn't contending with despicable mosquitoes or putting myself at risk of contracting a mosquito-borne disease. What does one do with a perpetually wiggling device while cleaning the birdbath? Sometimes I held it in one hand and cleaned with the other. At other times I enlisted a helper to hold the wiggler while I cleaned and refreshed the water. And there were also those times when I just laid the little round wiggler on its back.Several times a season I found the wiggler on the ground, spinning away, just wiggling in the breeze. I can only guess what manner of varmint villain caused the displacement of our innocent wiggler. Raccoon? Possum? Owl? Eagle? Or maybe one of those mischievous squirrels that live to antagonize. Except for the most recent occasion, it was just a simple matter of rinsing off and replacing the little wiggler. Several weeks ago, however, the entire heavy, cast concrete birdbath was totally toppled, the water wiggle lying in pieces on the ground. I tried to reinsert the spinner but it was too misshapen. Its one year warranty hadn't expired, but in our anguish neither Mrs. Spudman nor myself thought of contacting Allied Precision Industries for a replacement. The damaged wiggler now rests somewhere in the county landfill. Since the fallen birdbath is so heavy I can only guess that the culprit this time was a large raccoon, a deer, or one of the wild potatoes that lurk in the deep woods.VerdictI'm not sure if I'd buy another Water Wiggle since I'm not the one who bought the departed one in the first place. One must really love birds and backyard birding to spend such a hefty amount for this birdbath accessory. The West Nile Virus angle seems a bit far-fetched to me. I suppose in a small way one water wiggler in our backyard birdbath can reduce the potential spread of west Nile by an infinitesimal amount. Not providing any birdbaths at all would be just as effective, if not more so. All the birdbaths in the world combined are just a small percentage of the available breeding pools for mosquitoes.The wiggler's batteries are long lasting, and the rippling rings do seem to attract birds. The presence of constantly agitated water does seem to diminish the amount of yuck (technical term) growing on the birdbath's surface. But I'm still on the fence with this one, wiggling and waggling with my opinion. If you think the stated benefits are worth the price, then get yourself a Water Wiggler. Comments about the Water Wiggler on other consumer sites are mostly positive.
B0007CY2YQ Fiskars is a respected brand and I'd buy from them again, just not this particular pruner. The sliding lock mechanism is easy to operate and the pruners have a good spring to them.When I first got this pruner, it worked great. The cuts were clean and straight. After about three weekends of pruning (mostly rose bushes), the blades started dulling and no longer cut cleanly every time. Softer plant parts like dahlias flower stalks get squished and caught between the blades, causing them to stick together and not spring back open. This can leave a messy cut with jagged ends of plant tissue and cambium exposed, especially with stems that have soft, fibrous outer layers of bark, like green rose branches. For woodier cuts like camellia, it is still fine.Sometimes holding the pruners upside-down from the orientation pictured in the product photo helps deliver a clean cut. So, I rate this pair of pruners only average, because it has the same problem as my previous pruner with squishing stems.
B0007CY2YQ I use these pruners to cut flowers and bring them into my house. They are sharp and can cut through rose and peaony stems very easily. The size of the pruners make them easy to carry around in my back pocket and compete other yard work before getting the flowers. They are worth the money.
B0007CY2YQ Does snip well but parts are plastic thus do not feel it will last a long time, It is a good prunner for rose bushes etc,m and for the price a good item
B0007CY2YQ If you have rose bushes, the Fiskars Pruner is a must have. I love fresh roses in the house but hate those pesky thorns and always had a heck of a time removing them. With the Fiskars Pruner, I was able to remove all thorns rather quickly (it only took one or two times to get it down) and found the pruners to fit really well in my hand, eliminating any hand discomfort.  The blade is sharp and shows no sign of rust after using them for a season. This is a really useful tool and I absolutely would recommend others to purchase!
B0007CY2YQ These were not as sharp as I had hoped.  They are better for indoor pruning or light outdoor pruning.
B0007CY2YQ These pruners worked great on my rose bushes. I love to bring in fresh flowers and the thorn stripper was perfect. I was able to ensure I did not prick myself at all. The blades are super sharp, and I appreciate the handles being a reasonable size. They were very comfortable to for long use.
B0007CY2YQ This little hand held Fiskar's trimmer is perfect for cutting flowers to bring inside for a floral arrangement.  It worked nicely to trim up my rose bushes as well. Fiskar's really makes good quality hand held trimmers.
B0007LDXLA Purchased this snow removal tool for my wife, who uses her car on a daily basis for work.  While the car trunk is already filled with an assortment of semi-helpful gadgets, assuring her safety on the road, the Sno Brum is unquestionably in the top 5.  The tool is simple, effective, and does &#8220;what it says it does&#8221; easily. The tool doesn&#8217;t scratch the car body, is lightweight, and yet durable.  Don&#8217;t hit the snowy roads this winter without it!  All the more in Connecticut, a state in which a regulation will go into effect whereby cars may be fined up to $1000 for excess snow and ice flying off.
B0007LDXLA The Sno Brum works beautifully in plain, regular snow.  It has a large foam &#34;pusher&#34; that pushes show from the windows and surface of the car without stratching the surface of the car.  It is fabulous.  It can handle anything from a light dusting to several inches of snow (anything deeper needs to be done in layers or shifts), and makes it fairly painless to clear the car.However...  it is not perfect.  It doesn't work well in two different situations.1) The Sno Brum will not work well in any snow that has even a small amount of ice and/or freezing rain mixed in.  It can't deal with ice at all.  To be fair, other snow brooms can't handle ice, either.2) The Sno Brum doesn't work well against any irregularities in elevation on the surface of the car.  For example, it doesn't do well against the windshield wipers, against moon and/or sun roofs, etc.Overall, I am quite pleased with the Sno Brum and would recommend it for most winter weather situations.
B0007LDXLA I was never able to get this to extend and that was a real pain, especially since I bought it for my wife, who is short and catch reach the top of the van. Also, don't mistake this for an ice scraper; it has rounded edges meant to remove snow without scratching the roof of your vehicle.
B0007LDXLA Huge help moving snow off the top of my SUV. This makes snow very easy to remove even off of tall roofs. Takes just seconds to clear roof. It does not scratch the car.
B0007LDXLA Construction seems a bit flimsy but it works and I havent had any problems with it.  Its great for clearing snow off cars; especially large SUVs.
B0007LDXLA How could I have missed this before? The Sno Brum makes snow removal so much easier and faster.  Best of all, IT WON'T SCRATCH YOUR CAR!  GREAT PRODUCT!
B0007LDXLA This is as good as advertised for a car and I've used it for that and will keep it in the car.  But for me the good news is the threads in the snow brum head and handle are the same as with household poles for extending roller brushes or attaching mops.  I really wanted the snow brum to clear the snow off a large hot tub cover and was able to quickly attach the heat to a 10' extension pole.  The handle that comes with it won't quite reach all the way across the cover.
B0007LQ3RQ it is working as advertised to keep the squirrels away.  they've jumped on it only to see the doors close.  so far though I haven't found the answer to keep the sparrows off of it and that seems to keep the cardinals from using the ring.  they come to the area but limit so far themselves to the seeds that have fallen to the ground.
B0007LQ3RQ the birds love it!  got this for my husband to watch the cardinals and after just a few weeks we have to refill...and none of it because of squirrells.  it's a nice size so we don't have to change it every day.
B0007LQ3RQ So far my squirrels haven't penetrated or figured out how to get to the seed.  My two racoons decided to unhook it out of frustration and try and dig the seed out on the ground but I saved it and hung it up again and so far nobody has bothered it and the birds love it.  Very durable easy to fill and hang and holds quite a bit of seed.
B0007LQ3RQ We are enjoying this feeder so much!  the squirrell free mechanism works great and the adjustment allows us to cut off larger undesireable birds as well as squirrels.  we especially get a kick out of watching squirrells trying to access the food.!  It is also very easy to refill and we have not had any issues with the feed getting wet or clumpy.  Well worh the extra money!
B0007LQ3RQ Cardinals can get seeds, squirrels can't. Well made and relatively solid. Not really easy to clean, but not unexpected with weight-triggered closure device. Recommended as an affordable squirrel proof.UPDATE:  I can report that this feeder is actually bear-proof!  Well, almost.  It survived a bear's attempt to get through the plastic sleeve.  It was a little hard on the spring mechanism, but the bear didn't get any of the seed!
B0007LQ3RQ This feeder works so well, I brought a second.  I have alot of squirrels and most have given up.  I must confess a couple have leaped from the pole to the perch, but it closed and they gave up. They try to come off the top and try to chew on it, since it have a metal top, again they given up or fall off trying to stretch to the feeder opening.  This feeder is about squirrel free as possible.  I have loads of cardinals, finches,titmouse, woodpecker and no problems landing on it. It is expensive, I have seen ones in Wildbirds Unlimited for $100.  Worth the money.
B0007LQ3RQ This is a big feeder so refilling is minimized.  While little birds can enjoy several models, medium sized birds need the extra perch space this feeder provides. For whatever reasons, the Indigo Buntings prefer this feeder even though they're small and the Rose-Breasted Grosbeaks don't fit on the small perches of my other feeders so this is the only one they come to.  The little birds use it as well as the others.Squirrels, of course, can't get any food from it, although they can get the ring off sometimes.  There's nothing else for them to get a grip on although they have tried, but apparently the word went out, because they don't come around anymore.  I've got the ring on there pretty tight at this point.  There are easy directions if you have to replace it or tighten it.The feeder is also guaranteed forever so if the ring gets lost for any reason, it will be replaced free.  You don't actually need the ring, as there are perches around the bottom with access to the seed openings and not using it even further deters squirrels, but my birds seem to like it.  Even though the Grosbeaks are only in my area for a short time, they are so pretty, I'm eager to provide an environment that attracts them.The large tube of this feeder makes it easier to fill than other tube feeders and it's easy to hang high as it has a rigid hanger that allows you to hold it over your head to reattach on a tall pole.  It is a durable feeder and popular with the birds because they can still feed in large numbers even when the feeder is almost empty since all the feedholes are around the bottom.  A great squirrel proof feeder.  Highly recommended.
B0007LQ3RQ First of all, this feeder does not come with a hook, so if you plan to hang it in a tree, like I did, you'll need to order a metal extension hook unless you plan to mess with rope. I really like the hook I bought: Panacea 89017 Tree Branch Hook, Black, 36-Inch. The hook is almost the same length as the feeder, so they ship together nicely in the same Amazon box if you order them together. Within 48 hours of installing the feeder, I caught my 3 resident squirrels sliding down the hook from the tree onto the feeder and attempting to chew the seed holes on the feeder to access the seed. However, it was pure entertainment for me because 90% of the time the squirrels cannot maintain their balance on the tiny feeder roof and simply slip off 4' to the cushioned ground below (below pine tree, so lots of soft dry needles). In snow, they simply cannot hang on and slip right off. For a week the squirrels attempted to jump at the feeder or climb down the hook, and they finally seem to have given up and now simply feed off the fallen seed on the ground. I am delighted that so many bird species are using the feeding in the first 2 weeks: cardinals, house finches, mourning doves (feed on seed on ground), woodpecker, titmouse, nut hatch, chickadee, etc. Recently, it poured and hailed/sleeted at all angles, so I decided to buy a large, clear plastic baffle to provide added coverage from the weather: Aspects 182 Super Dome. It was a steep $40 (other reviews suggested a $8-10 one sold at most feed supply stores), but I wish I had bought it from day 1 because it would have kept the squirrels off the feeder completely. I like that it is clear and reviews said it lasts over time (it is also made in the USA). I did examine the feeder after 3 weeks of use now and the squirrels managed to scratch and chew the feeder in certain spots, which can be completely eliminated by buying the aforementioned baffle. The squirrels now have no way to surpass the baffle. You could obviously probably buy any feeder and use the baffle to prevent squirrel access...We have a lot of cardinals in our area, so I attached the cardinal ring from day 1 and extended all of the metal perches directly into the ring by twisting them at even intervals so that they full screw into every hole of the 'ring'. Another review mentioned birds getting stuck if you don't extend the perches fully into the ring. I find that the cardinals love the feeder, but they also like to just feed off the fallen seed 50% of the time, as they appear to prefer ground feeding for ease of watching for predators...The ring just gives the feeder a 360 degree perch, so most of the birds hop around the ring and explore the seed in each door. If they see me at the window and are shy, they also hop to a door of the feeder where they are more hidden.As for seed, I bought (on Amazon) the Kaytee Cardinal Blend, 7-Pound Bag and Kaytee Waste Free Nut and Fruit Blend, 5.5-Pound Bag. I created a large paper funnel with poster board I have, and scooped in 1 cup of one bag and 1 cup of the other bag to have even intervals of different seed. Even the chickadees and smaller birds love the larger nuts and seeds (I don't use any millet). They fly to the feeder and quickly grab 1 sunflower seed, then fly to a nearby pine street branch and peck away at it to break it open. Kaytee seemed to be one of the only seed brands that didn't have complaints from consumers about twigs and other waste. I do find it to be 100% seed. I also occasionally mix in some of my organic breakfast cereal, such as granola with chia seeds, which they love as something different.My final thought is that given how quickly the squirrels tried to get to the feeder and seed, I can't imagine using any other feeder.  The seed would surely be dumped in 1-2 days unless it were hung in a location where squirrels have no access. You really must buy this feeder if you plan to use the feeder in an area where you have squirrels. Other reviews stated that raccoons and deer can feed easily, so if you live in those areas, you might consider hanging it higher...If you're on a budget and can't afford this feeder, at least buy the baffle I recommend, which seems to be curved enough to prevent any squirrel from reaching any feeder you use below it.All in all, I spent almost $200 on the feeder, hook, clear baffle/dome, and quality nut/fruit/sunflower seed, but it was like a Disney movie today with over 15 birds and squirrels in my yard at the same time happily feeding at the feeder and on the ground.Other fun accessories to build your backyard avian habitat (see my other reviews):-->ceramic pedestal bird bath-->wood blue bird houseUPDATE: Have had the feeder for about 3 months and have many regular birds (many mated pairs) that come daily at regular intervals:1 cardinal pair1 chickadee pair1 titmouse pair1 gold finch pair3-4 mourning dove pairs (that feed below it and then sun themselves nearby)1 territorial catbird pair (they chase away all other small birds when feeding)6 regular house sparrows and their chicks2-4 song sparrows2-4 red-headed house finches that travel together1 agile-flying nuthatcher (swoops in, grabs a nut, flies off)1-2 grackles with a voracious appetite4 different woodpecker species (Northern Flicker, Hairy Woodpecker, Red-bellied Woodpecker, Downy Woodpecker)1 occasional ground-feeding cowbird pair (male with brown head)1 shy house wren pair (they mostly look for insects in the vicinity, and only occasionally use the feeder)1 inquisitive blue jay (doesn't feed from feeder, but watches it, and feeds off ground nearby)3-5 squirrels that feed on the groundThey all recognize me when I glance out the window and throw them fruit and large nut pieces...Also, the catbirds and grackles are VERY smart. They realized that if they both use the perch, the seed hatches are closed, so they only feed 1 at a time and get impatient while 1 feeds and the other waits nearby! I have so many birds frequenting the feeder that the feed level drops 1-2 inches per day. I did adjust the tension level of the perch to have it close with less weight, but it was sad to see the birds fighting so much because when 3 sparrows or finches landed, the doors closed and they got aggressive. I also saw the heavier woodpecker really stressing over trying to pry a nut out with the doors 95% closed...I decided to just recalibrate it and allow full access for all birds...it just means some will gorge and I'll go through more seed....I find that some species tend to wildly peck at the seed to get to their favorite morsels, so the happy mourning doves wait below for the shower of seed that falls...
B0007LQ3RQ This tubular feeds work exactly as advertised; the seed doors shut whenever the weight on the perch gets too much, so as soon as a squirrel puts his weight on it or a large bird tries to land, they are denied food.  The spring-loaded green base simply lowers over the holes.  So far, squirrels have been discouraged, and they haven't managed to chew through the feeder as they did to a cedar and plastic one I once had.The top comes off easily with a twist.  Filling can be a two-person job because it isn't easy to keep the tube upright if you need two hands to lift a large bag a seed.  I suggest getting a bird seed scoop, especially since you'll also have less spillage.  The birds, including cardinals, actually seem to prefer this feeder over a nearby hopper-type one.UPDATE, with an LOL:  Well, the squirrels have figured out that if they stick their paws inside the holes, they can keep the doors from shutting.  As long as they don't put their full weight on the feeder (they use the nearby hopper feeder to plant their hind legs), they can get food out, bit by bit.  I recommend keeping this feeder away from anything where they can balance and then stretch over to the tube.-- Debbie Lee Wesselmann
B0007LQ3RQ The best squirrel proof feeder out!  We purchase our first one in 2007 and recently the perches came loose and we lost them - a simple call and email to the company brought us a new set in just a few days.  Great support!  Feeder is easy to load and easy to use and works great.  When we lost the perches we purchased a new one and then got the parts for the old one - now we use two and they are wonderful - expensive but well built, last a long time and company stands behind them.  Worth every penny!
B0007LQ3RQ As a Christmas gift to a friend, I am helping her feed the birds.  She is confined to a wheelchair so watching the birds gives her and her cats a lot of pleasure.  We wanted to draw an assortment of birds, not just sparrows.  This feeder is drawing tit mice, gold finches and a few cardinals but not sparrows.  The squirrels have continued to be thwarted by it and it holds enough feed that I think I can fill it once a week.  We are very pleased with it!
B0007LQ3RQ Bought this about 4 years ago from another site (much more expensive). It worked well.The pole holding it gave out (wet soil from heavy rain and snow), and the feeder hit the ground (frozen grass). It literally smashed into about 10 pieces; I don't know if I even found them all.The interesting part of this story is that the thistle feeder hanging on the opposite hook of the pole and 2 poly rain rings (over the tops)  did NOT break. Only this feeder broke!! I suspect that it was either weather-worn, OR an old(ER) feeder with limited life to the plastic, OR that it was made of poor cheap material originally.A few feet away, I also had a large barn-type feeder on a pole which was not effected (anchored in cement), i.e., NOT attacked by an animal which the company seemed to want to blame: an animal attack.I wrote MANY times to the mfg for replacement.FINALLY, they said that an animal probably got at it, but they couldn't guess which one. DUH. I said that the other pieces which fell did NOT break, AND that the other barn style feeder, only a few feet away, was not touched, basically ruling out an animal attack in my simple assessment.Last email from mfgr: Their policy was that they could NOT replace the entire feeder!?I asked about the lifetime warrantee again.They asked for photos. I sent them.Then they asked what pieces were intact and which were broken.I wrote that they'd just have to look at the pix because I had never taken the feeder apart and could not say.Answer: NO REPLACEMENT; must have been an animal attack (their words).BOTTOM LINE: Forget the lifetime support. They won't replace the feeder.Be ware of expecting any type of replacement or support from the company. The emails were almost accusative; really off-putting, as if to discourage further contact. And I had shown them a photo of the pole AND the other elements on it which did not break. We exchanged probably half a dozen emails.I'd like this feeder again, but I'll be d....d if I spend money on something which is NOT supported when the mfgr says that it is supported for a lifetime replacement.Whose lifetime? An ant's?Probably made of SHODDY MATERIAL with a limited life is my conclusion.The company will insist that \"some\" animal attacked it, and they don't support animal attacks. Great excuse (not).
B0007LQ3RQ Okay, I like squirrels as much as the next person, but the greedy varmints that visit our yard just don't know how to share.  They would engorge themselves on our expensive \"patio mix\" birdseed until it was all gone.No amount of ingenious \"home remedies\" (vaseline on the pole, etc.) or expensive solutions (baffles, umbrellas, etc.) at our local birder's store solved the problem.Not expecting miracles, I purchased the Squirrel Buster Plus at our local Orchard Supply Hardware store.And boy has it delivered.  For years now, it has been our birds' best friend.  We've been able to fine-tune the adjustment to attract the most variety of birds.It's easy to clean, easy to fill, and it comes from Quebec! (So does my husband, so he likes that.)I just called the company for help in determining what I did wrong, after the last cleaning, in trying to assemble. Turns out I hadn't done anything wrong; one part was simply worn out. (We've had it at least five years, and it takes a lot of hard, beating sun as well as periods of constant rain, etc.)The rep offered to send a replacement part immediately.  You can't beat that.Now, our only problem is what to do with all the paraphernalia and squirrel-friendly feeders we wasted out money on. Give to someone who doesn't have squirrels, I guess.And yes, we do feed the squirrels. Separately.
B0007LQ3RQ I can't tell you how many bird feeders I have tried, and all went to the garage sale after this one came. Right away, the squirrel tried to get at it, but gave up. I loved it. The seed doesn't spill out with the wind we have been having in the mountains of AZ. I used the cardinal ring with it so the bird have a nice place to land even though we don't have cardinals around. It took my birds a little time to get used to this, but be patient, they will. Birds are creatures of habit like us. My other feeders is what they were used to, so they went there first. Now they are using this one more. It is well made, good engineering and I love the guarantee. The same day I got this one, the squirrel destroyed my finch feeder by pulling out the circle where the seed opening is. I lost all the finch seed, so I went and ordered Brome's finch feeder.  I have been relocating squirrels with my havaheart trap, as I had just too many, 16 squirrels have new homes now, but then a new obnoxious one showed up, so thanks Brome.Two years later: Wow they are just as good as the day I got them.  Since the seed feeding part is at the bottom, you are not left with old moldy seed settling there. I removed the ring, to make it harder for the Jays to take over the feeder and it helped. This is still the best feeder out there, worth every penny and less waste of seed. I went I bought 2 more of them.
B0007LQ3RQ The birds don't like it at all....I saw about four just sit at the feeder and try to figure out what they were supposed to do.  I think one of the birds actually flipped me off for getting this.  If you don't tighten the lid and bottom secure enough the bird seed will spill ALL over your floor, and it's amazing how quickly a full bird feeder will empty on the ground.  I would have to say that I can't see how a squirrel would get to the food...I will say that about it.  But what good is it if the birds don't get to it either?  I'll probably go back to one of the others and just feed the squirrels with the birds.
B0007LQ3RQ Pricey yes but you get what you pay for. This is my third feeder but this one is the best made bar none. It was already assembled but with very well written instructions on taking it apart and cleaning. It is VERY big/long and holds a ton of feed which is good and easy to fill. The top locks nicely too so critters cannot get the feed. The cardinal ring is awesome and within 2 hours many cardinals learned how to feed on the unit. Other feeders no where near match this quality and design.
B0007LQ3RQ This feeder I do really like. It helps me fight my squirrel problem &#34; but I do have some smart squirrels&#34;  a few have figured out ways to work around it but it is difficult and they don't stay very long. So it does work  and I like it.For any one who also has a raccoon problem you may want to try this one .  I know you told me up front in your detail about this feeder it was squirrel proof not raccoon proof .  But we were having a raccoon problem and this one he can't get off the pole and put on the ground or get the top off.  But you must be sure to close the top securely and tight.  I have two of these feeders now and the raccoon has stopped for now.
B0007LQ3RQ For everyone out there that is an avid bird feeding enthusiast, you are by now well aware that you will spend half your time selecting seed, buying feeders, setting up and tending to them, and the other half battling squirrels for control of them. Squirrel's are nothing less than amazing in both their tenacity and technique when it comes to getting at the bird seed we desire so desperately to keep them away from.  Squirrel baffles of all shapes and design are only effective about half the time at best. And weight sensitive perches are soon made obsolete or at least only partially effective when word gets around as to how to hang down from above and keep your body weight elsewhere. This very expensive squirrel buster is really nothing but a little better design on an old idea.  The weight sensitive perch is nothing new.  Its been in the arsenal of attack on squirrels for quite a few years now.  A weight sensitive perch is only as effective as what's overhead for the wily squirrel to hang his feet on and drop below.  The squirrel buster does just about as good a job at making the top of its feeder pretty near paw proof as I have encountered, but not totally.  My neighbor who owns one of these has seen quite a few squirrels attempt to drop from above to the seed below only to slip and fall, (much to her giggling delight).  However not a day goes by that some future Olympian worthy fellow somehow manages to lock his feet above securely and feast on the spoils now at his disposal below. Now that she has had it for a few weeks it has become an everyday event that at least a couple of squirrels beat the system. Its my opinion that there is no such thing as a foolproof squirrel busting feeder.  This one is close, but at the price their asking for it I don't consider it a worthwhile investment at all. Take away its design and its no better made than any other feeder costing half its price.  It will get just as dirty and is just as hard to clean.  Its all up to the individual of course.  But its my take that this feeder is extremely overpriced regardless of its promise and performance.  If you are interested in a feeder that is every bit as squirrel proof as this one and is about a third the price, try the Backyard Bistro bird feeder available on the web.  I own 5 of them and they are made of very tough impenetrable vinyl and aluminum and its shape and hardness makes it just as effective against squirrels as the buster here. You can even buy six of these in a case for the price of two of these feeders, and with free shipping thrown in.  Check it out and see for yourself.  And happy hunting!
B0007LQ3RQ A bird feeder is an act of kindness from one species to another. For all the birds do for us, and for all that we have done to them, the least we can do for our feathered friends in our own yards is to buy them some food in the worst of seasons and difficulties. Our homes are often sitting on the very land where trees, bushes, maybe a stream and more once provided for these birds. So give back some of what has been taken by purchasing and maintaining a birdfeeder or 2 or 3.We have had this bird feeder for 6 years and its still going strong. It is very well made and designed. The birds love it, the squirrels not so much as they have long given up hanging on the feeder trying to get food directly. The squirrels have been demoralized by the ingenious design where their weight drops the spring loaded cam, closing off the food access ports. The squirrels, somewhat sadly, now wait on the ground below for spillage from the birds above.You could buy a cheaper birdfeeder, a mistake I have made several times over the years. Learn from the mistakes of others. Cheap feeders are not squirrel proof or resistant and won't last.Squirrels cause 2 problems with feeders. The first you might have guessed; squirrels can eat so much seed as to double, triple, quadruple the cost of birdseed. Even a feeder for free, using so much seed wouldn't be a bargain!  But the 2nd issue which surprised me at the time, the squirrels will chew to pieces cheap feeders. Cheap feeders can look fantastic but the soft plastic parts such as the food reservoir made of flexible plastic can be hacked to pieces in minutes. So intent are squirrels that even my brome with a steel cap has intense chews marks on the edges, as the squirrels tried to chew their way to the food.A good bird feeder is an investment. It costs more but lasts a very long time and guaranteed, it saves money on seed, it keeps squirrels from becoming dependent on the feeder and their weight under control (lol)and is by far the better value by a very wide margin.Happily I can say Brome customer service is excellent. About a year ago the green perch ring broke as weathering caused this plastic part to brittle and snap. I sent an e-mail to Brome and they replied in a day, sending me a new ring free of charge by mail. On another occasion about 6 months ago, I took the feeder apart for cleaning and put it back together wrong. I called for service and they explained what I did wrong, a mistake probably nobody else would ever make -but as the Brome person explained the mistake, she mentioned I might have damaged the unit but not to worry, that they would replace the broken parts for free. As it turned out that wasn't necessary.In a small but most important way, you can pay back some of the damage that has been done to our feathered friends saving many of their lives, and you can do this easily from your own back yard with just a bird feeder or two, or three. Keep your feeder(s) filled and clean as your birds will really depend on them, and when the weather warms add a Hummingbird feeder or two. In the Spring your wintering birds will raise the next generation, all the while returning your kindness as they fill the sky with flight, your trees with song, while being with you and your family all the days of your life. Don't believe me? Just open your door and take a look and listen right now. :-)If you have kids consider making this their responsibility, a simple weekly chore and small life lesson on responsibility. I kind of think of it as one generation helping another, one species to another.\"Opie had been caring for wild baby birds that lost their mother, and remarked on setting them free that sadly the cage was empty. His father Andy quickly replied, \"Yes, son, it sure does. But don't the trees seem nice and full.\"
B0007LQ3RQ This feeder was a bit expensive (price has been dropping though), but when I  opened the package I could see why, the build quality and design is excellent. Plus it's very large.  My previous feeder was a square plastic tube with a moving metal cage with fake \"leaves\" around it to stop the squirrels.  It worked well enough for a year, but it had exposed springs and thin plastic, it was just a matter of time and the squirrels bent the metal leaves and ate through the plastic.The Brome is much heavier throughout, with a strong plastic tube joined up with metal and plastic parts.  The mechanical spring adjuster is totally enclosed within the unit so it doesn't rust and the squirrels cant get at it. It also comes apart easily for washing. The \"cardinal\" ring is an optional installation, other wise you set the perch length for the size bird you want to attract.So do birds like it? yes very much, it will hold 3 or 4 finch at a time, or two larger birds.So has it stumped the squirrels? yes they try sometimes, but are satisfied to hang out on the ground below.  I did have an unknown predator skunk the feeder once when I had it installed too low to the ground.  I suspect it was either Deer or raccoon that rocked it side to side dumping 1.5 lbs of seed out. I've moved it higher now and have not had a repeat event.I suspect with care this feeder will last many years.June 2008 updateA year later and this feeder has held up very well.  Squirrels have scratched the lid trying to open it but they still can't get to the feed.  The top appears to aluminum because despite the scratches it has not rusted. I like how easy this feeder is to clean and the spring mechanism is very well protected so it's still working like new. I continue to have deer problems with the unit, they appear to just lick the seed out of it, so I have to look to hang it much higher our of deer reach. I have cardinals, finch, woodpeckers, and lots of other great birds that love it.October 2008 updateI continued to have problems with deer getting at this feeder until I moved it to a much higher position.  I now have it suspended from a wire between two trees so the bottom is about 8 ft off the ground.  I no longer have any problems with ground animals getting to the feed and the feeder lasts for over a week without refilling. Squirrels try to climb down from the top, but they can't get to the feed and give up quickly.
B0007LQ3RQ I've hung a variety of feeders in my yard over the years, and this has to be the best of the recent ones!Once I got the hang of installing the perches and the ring (they fell off during the first day - I hadn't tightened the wing nut properly), birds have flocked to it throughout the day.  Filled with a premium mix of black oil sunflower seeds, safflower seeds, dried fruits, tree nuts, peanuts, stripe sunflower seeds, and so many other delicious things I'm tempted to grab a handful and snack, the feeder is home to titmice, nuthatches, cardinals, red-winged blackbirds, and chickadees.I find the shape absolutely delightful, and the deep pine green is very handsome.  The seed capacity is larger than my 23\" Droll Yankees.  I did have to add a large \"S\" hook to my current iron bracket to accommodate the slightly smaller triangular hook at the top of the hanging rod on the feeder, but this makes filling and replacing it easier, too.The squirrels have absolutely given up on it, though it hangs on their favorite maple tree. The Squirrel Buster really works!
B0007LQ3RQ We have several feeders on our property and every one has been plagued with greedy squirrels that monopolize the feeder and keep the birds away while they wipe out the seed. We have tried putting seed on the ground for the squirrels, greasing the mounting poles, and we even tried putting one feeder on a Twirl-a-Squirrel, and none of these tactics have worked. My wife found the Brome Squirrel Buster Plus here on Amazon and we decided to get one and give it a fair try. It has proven to be a very good feeder that's worth its weight in gold.This is a tube-style feeder that has six feeding ports on a spring-loaded, movable sleeve that slides down when sufficient weight is added. The idea is that the squirrel's own weight works against it and causes the sleeve to slide down, cutting off all access to the seed when a squirrel tries to steal from the feeder. The sensitivity is adjustable so that the weight can be tuned to help discourage other pests such as grackles.The sleeve is made of metal which is important. If it were plastic, a squirrel would quickly be able to chew through it and eventually reach the seed inside.It's not enough to simply rely on the sleeve to slide down. Squirrels are notoriously smart and would simply reach the ports by hanging upside down from the top of the feeder and helping themselves - except that this particular feeder is designed with a built-in baffle in the lid. It's not a traditional baffle that wobbles and moves; instead, the lid is shaped and painted such that there is no way to hang on to it while trying to reach down so squirrels simply fall off while trying.This is a well-constructed feeder that has a lot of thoughtful design features. As mentioned, the important parts (the sleeve and feeding ports as well as the baffle lid) are metal and are chew-resistant. The metal portions of this feeder have all been painted with what appears to be weather-resistant paint which will deter rust and corrosion (and it makes the feeder harder for a squirrel to hold on to). There are adjustable perches for each feeding port as well as an installable cardinal perch ring.We watched one very determined squirrel try to get the seed from the feeder and after trying for a while it gave up and dropped to the ground without success. The squirrel wasn't hurt, the feeder wasn't damaged, and all the seed was still there for the birds. This is exactly the result we hoped for. We still end up filling it frequently, but now the birds get all the seed, not the squirrels.This is a large feeder and it holds a lot of seed.The Brome Squirrel Buster Plus feeder is exactly the feeder we had hoped for. It is very well constructed, it holds a lot of seed and it keeps the squirrels out of that seed without hurting the squirrels. It is a little on the expensive side, but it's worth every penny and then some. With this feeder, you can get on to the business of feeding the birds without fattening up the squirrels in the process.
B0007LQ3RQ I bought this feeder after buying the mini model. I am well pleased with the mini. The 1024 is a large tube feeder with large perch easy to clean and fill.The birds like it too,good buy.
B0007LQ3RQ Pricey? Yes, but well worth it!!  I have purchased many bird feeders over the years (including Duncraft) but this feeder is the Rolls Royce in design, construction, durability and ease of use (filling, hanging).  Squirrels have eaten the last of my birdseed - this one will definitely keep them out - so ingenious!  I also purchased the weatherguard to protect the birds, as well as the seed, from the elements. I am sooooo impressed with this feeder - I hope the birds like it as much as I do!  (ha-ha)The weatherguard was a little tricky to install but if I can do it, anyone can!  Just follow the instructions that come with it.
B0007LQ3RQ I waited more than a year to write this review, because I really wanted to give this feeder a workout.I've been feeding birds for more than 30 years now, so I have a pretty good idea of what works and what doesn't, and this feeder does what it says it will.  It's completely squirrel-proof!I've had problems in the past, with squirrels decimating my feeders:  emptying them out completely, chewing them up, and worst of all, keeping the birds away with their aggression.It's great if you have problems with squirrels or even larger birds:  you can adjust the closing of the feeder to accomodate the weight of your desired birds.Another plus is that it's dishwasher-safe!Having said all that, the only negative is that only so many birds can feed at a time if they're sitting on the perch.  But, for those birds that take a seed and then fly away to eat it (chickadees, titmice, nuthatches, woodpeckers) it's great.  If some birds are \"hogging\" the feeder, you can remove the perch altogether.Highly recommended (I just wish it was less expensive!)
B0007LQ3RQ I love Brome feeders. This is my third one. I like this one because it's well made and the materials are good. The lid, base and cardinal perching ring are made of metal. This means the squirrels are less likely to damage it. The weight-activated shroud pulls down under the weight of a squirrel so the shroud covers the feeding ports. The shroud can be adjusted to keep larger birds out, too.Cardinals do not like to turn their heads to eat, so they don't like feeders with stick perches. If you want cardinals at your feeder, you NEED the cardinal perch ring. (Cardinals are also very timid/nervous. You'll attract more cardinals if you place your feeder near shrubbery or evergreen trees. The tree or shrubbery is necessary because the cardinals want to sit in the shrubbery or evergreen tree, waiting and watching to make sure it's safe to go to the feeder. Cardinals love hemlock trees, by the way.) If cardinals don't interest you, you can buy the same feeder WITHOUT the perch ring for a little less. It's called \"Squirrel Buster Classic\".I almost didn't buy this feeder because it's so tall. I thought I'd have to hang it extra high to keep squirrels from climbing or jumping onto it from below. Silly me. If squirrels attack from the ground or climb up the pole and grab the ring or shroud, the shroud will close the ports.If a squirrel gets on top of the feeder and stretches his front feet down toward the ports, he can't get to the seeds because the feeder is too tall for the squirrel to reach the ports! Brilliant.Squirrels are unable to get the lid off, so they cannot get to the seed from the top of the tube. The only way squirrels can get to the seed is to chew through the tube. I hope they'll get frustrated enough to leave the feeder alone before they think of chewing through the tube.I can't speak to the durability of this feeder because I've only had it for a week. But I can say that my other Brome feeders have held up very well. Excellent feeder.
B0007LQ3RQ Been watching squirrels trying to get at the food for weeks now; none have successfully been able to get at the food.  Plenty of room for lots of birds; looks nice hanging from a tree in my back yard.
B0007LQ3RQ After just a few days of replacing our old bird feeder and food, we have many birds coming back to feed again!  I put this inSongbird and Cardinal Preferred Blend Bird Foodand the combination has been perfect.  Our old bird feeder would collect the seeds at the bottom on a tray, which would get wet from rain and mold quickly.  Because the seeds are housed inside the feeder, there was no mold to worry about.  We have a lot of squirrels around, but they never seemed to bother our old feeder or this one.  The pirch is great for the birds, but I suspect as soon as a squirrely tries to get into the seeds, he'll be sadly disappointed that he can't get them.The picture on Amazon doesn't do the size justice. I was able to get almost all of the bird food in the above link in the feeder.  Great product, excellent design, and the birds and myself both love it!Edit:  After having this product up for a few months, I have noticed many birds at all times of the day waiting to feed.  The squirrels have noticed it as well, but the seeds remain protected inside.  After refilling the seeds, I forgot to screw the top green lid back onto the clear tube.  The squirrels quickly figured out how to lift it up, and I found one head first in the feeder eating the seed.  Can't fault the squirrel...but make sure to give a nice quarter turn to make sure the lid is on tight.In addition to the cardinals, there have been some finches and other smaller birds that have showed up also.  It is so nice to look outside and see wildlife enjoying a little food.Still a 5 star product, without question.
B0007LQ3RQ Stellar Jays and squirrels cannot get into this feeder. Chipmunks...are a bit light, so they still can get there if the pole isn't greased with baby oil, so still have to oil the pole, but the major feeders are not able to get much unless they are quick or clean up from what is dropped by the smaller birds. It's well built and looks great.
B0007LQ3RQ I bought this feeder because we were having trouble with our old one as the squirrels were getting more food than the birds.  I researched bird feeders for weeks and the only one I found that sounded like it would cure our squirrel problem was the Brome 1024.  I was really hesitant about paying so much for a bird feeder, but went ahead and made the investment.  It has been worth the price in every way.Now after about three months of having the Squirrel Buster feeder mounted on a post in the back yard the thing is working just as advertised.  The birds found it the first day I had it open for business and so far not a single squirrel has manged to steal seeds.  I have the feeder setup on an 18 inch long hanger bracket so that helps discourage squirrel attacks, but if one of the furry critters ever did manage to jump onto the feeder itself the clever feeding port closing system would slam shut.The seed capacity of the Brome 1024 is huge and provides food for several weeks in our yard.  So far we have had mostly Juncos and Black Capped Chickadees visit our feeder.  The feeder is easy to fill and to clean.  It is made of nicely finished metal mostly, with the seed hopper being heavy transparent plastic.  This is a quality unit and will certainly last for years.I think this bird feeder is the best one on the market.  You won't regret buying one.  The birds will thank you.  The squirrels won't.
B0007LQ3RQ Others do a better job of explaining various qualities of this feeder but as indicated by title - since the feeder ports are large amount of seeds fail out as the feeder closes on the squirrel. So yes the enemy is kept out, but I do lose a bit of seeds in the process. My best defense has been to put a squirrel feeder 30 feet away and to place a corn feeder when they're being extra pesky.
B0007LQ3RQ Pricey but worth it since it's good for life.  The hardest part is setting the tension so cardinal can feed but not Jay Birds.I can't say enough about Brome bird feeders.  It hold seed and I use sun flowers seeds and mix a some nuts and fruit with it and most all birds love it.
B0007LQ3RQ The feeder does just as the name suggests, busts squirrels (mine have been very unhappy with me, they seem to be glaring at me from the trees).The feeder was  easy to setup and seems to be well made.  I just had to snap the perch ring together and figure out how to attach it (instructions helped there). And put some seed in.I did have to change the sensitivity of my feeder.  At the middle setting, it was too sensitive and would block the feeder when cardinals would land on it.  I had a lot of finches and small birds, but the big birds couldn't use it.  So... I've adjusted it, the bigger birds can use it, though the squirrels still can't (more glares).One thing I want to specifically call out is, how GREAT the instructions are.  The instructions are clear, well written, with great images, and printed on nice paper that will endure (that is a step up from 99% of instructions almost any product delivers).  The instructions go beyond the basic setup and configuration, and provide clear details on how to take the feeder apart and clean it.  Explaining that a clean feed is important for healthy birds.  Well done!
B0007LQ3RQ This is my second purchase of this feeder; it most definitely prevents the squirrels from eating the bird seed; birds seem to like the feeder, especially the finches; Wild Birds Unlimited sells these feeders for a much higher price
B0007LQ3RQ My squirrel hangs upside down on the tree next to the feeder and eats upside down without touching the perch ring.  So, YMMV.  He seems very frustrated with the level of effort and doesn't really eat at this feeder a lot.Also, I purchased this feeder in April 2013, and it is now August 2013.  It is due for a cleaning.  The crud solidifies after rainstorms and stops the lever mechanism from working.On a happy note, it takes apart very easily and with very little effort, even while cruddy.  I did not put this in my dishwasher to clean; I thought that was gross.I am not sure if the lever is working again after the taking apart, cleaning and reassembling, I will update my review if it doesn't work, and on the Brome warranty for the item.Also, please note this feeder is HUGE; it is almost 3 feet in length, so you will need a very sturdy branch to hang it on.  It does not come with a hanger.  It cannot be mounted on a pole.All in all, though, four stars.  I like that this feeder holds a whole bag of seed, so it needs to be filled every few days instead of every day or twice a day.Buy in confidence! :)
B0007LQ3RQ Does exactly as described. No squirrels, just birds.  Works so well that we now feel sorry for our squirrels. Would recommend.
B0007LQ3RQ Over the years, I've tried many different types of feeders hoping to win my war of attrition with the super smart and athletic squirrels which populate the oak forest in which I live.  The better ones were those with wire cages surrounding the small opening wire mesh which held the sunflower seeds.  But even those were subject to nearly constant squirrel assault because those little critters could knock out a small number of seeds just by jumping on the feeder and reaching into the mesh.  These feeders also limited the types of seed I could offer my fine feathered friends because they cannot hold small seeds.But with this Brome Squirrel Buster PlusBrome 1024 Squirrel Buster Plus Wild Bird Feeder with Cardinal Perch Ringfeeder, I've struck gold!  It has completely frustrated the army of squirrels.  Within a day, they stopped trying to get to the seeds.  Within a week I found I no longer had a zillion squirrels hanging around my deck.  The amount of seed lost due to these critters has been reduced to nothing and my bird food lasts twice as long between refilling.  Birds (being birds) still drop some seeds, so there's still a few squirrels that hang around my neck of the woods, but the plague is over!  And I actually kinda' like the little beggars... in small numbers.The feeder is very well built, with many thoughtful design features.  It's easy to refill and clean.  It can be adjusted to discourage larger birds such as scrub jays from dominating the feeder so that more song birds are present. And it's easy to set up.It ain't cheap, but in this case it's well worth spending more for the very best.  You won't be disappointed in this fine product!
B0007LQ3RQ I hung this feeder ~3 feet from the nearest object so squirrels would have to jump pretty far to get to it.  I have had them still jump to other feeder i replaced, but this one is skinny enough for them to think again.  The other birds can still get fed.  I used to have to fill my feeders every day, but now I have had this feeder for a week and it still has about 4\" of seed left.  I Recommend hanging a feeder with fishing line (spider wire).  This allows you to hang it low so a squirrel cant get to it from the top.
B0007LQ3RQ It has been such a lot fun  watching the squirrels go nuts trying to foil this.  Not happening.  I'm saving a lot of money on bird seed, using this feeder.
B0007M4VRO I like this can. It gets a LOT of use AND a lot of compliments. When people ask where I got it because THEY want one, it is worth it just to see the shocked look when I say Amazon.com! Great product. Great price. It works as expected!
B0007M4VRO As mentioned in other reviews, this is NOT for cars and trucks.  I bought it for use on the riding mower, filling smaller cans and for my dual sport bike.  It's virtually impossible to fill any of these without spilling.But worst of all, it split along the seam at the top and sloshes gas out when carrying and fills it's storage area with fumes.  Forget it!
B0007M4VRO I have this and several other cans with this new stupid design (thanks liberals) due to all the tree hugging environmentalists. You end up spilling more gas with these new cans and need 3 hands to try and use it with some success. These are worse for the environment then the old style which were fine.
B0007M4VRO I purchased this fuel can because I have a small diesel Kubota Tractor. I needed a five gallon can in order to fill the tractor's tank. The tank on the tractor is conveniently located on the top of the tractor. I have found it pretty much impossible to fill the tractor with diesel from this can without spilling all over myself, and all over the ground, creating both a safety and environmental problem.The ill conceived idea behind this gas can is that the pour spout is rigid and you have to rest a lever on the pour spout on the rim of the gas tank, pushing up on the lever, and then releasing the flow of gas. This does not work at all. You end up having to manually pull the lever up with your hand. Remember the can is 5 gallons, and it is too heavy to try and support with one hand. So, for this device to even come close to working, you need at least 3 hands, and preferably four. In frustration, you finally take the pour spout off, and pour directly from the can into the tank, which pours diesel all over yourself.Making the device even more useless, it does not have a vent opening anywhere, so even under ideal circumstances, you can not pour from it.One wonders if they even ever tried to use this thing before they sold it.AVOID ! ! !
B0007M4VRO To call this &#34;spill proof&#34; is ridiculous! If the can came with a simple screw cap and a separate funnel it would be fine. Instead it comes with a cap that you have to punch out the center to fit the spout, thus rendering the cap useless for sealing the canister, and an incredibly poorly designed spout that just does not work. I ended up ignoring the spout and using a plastic funnel instead. If I can find a replacement cap at least I won't have completely wasted 20 bucks. Not recommendedPros: will hold 5 gallons, does have 2 handles, is fairly stableCons: the nozzle is a waste of time, there is no separate cap for storage - the nozzle has to be in place
B0007NP05U I purchased this product in September 2008 based on my positivie experience with the B&D cordless weed trimmer.  I have used it to trim a 20 foot Bottle Brush and a 10 foot bush.  I was able to trim both of these bushes, cut down weeds and blackberry brairs, and then use the battery in my B&D weed trimmer before it died.  B&D claims the pole hedge trimmer will cut up to 7/16 inch branches.  That is was I got and found the cutting action good.  You can lock the head into different positions to the pole: 180, 90 degree, etc.  You can use it for clearing ground growth, which is great.  The  rubber covering on the pole in front of the hand guard is very comfortable and makes handling the hedge trimmer easier.  The disadvanges to this product are:  1. It is heavy and the weight is at the end of the pole (the cutting head). When you swing the pole to cut a bush the head it is going to want to keep moving.  If you are on a ladder, you could lose your balance trying to stop it.  My wife can not use it because of the weight.  2. The pole does not telescope.  It is about 6 feet from the handle to the end of the cutting bar, but if you need more reach than that, you have to have the arm length and strength to supply it.  3. It only comes with one battery.  Final thoughts, check the tension were the handle and the cutting head join.  I notice mine did loosen during the job.  Make sure your getting the best price.  Prices vary across the internet and the various bricks and morter stores.  Happy trimming.
B0007NP05U I bought the NPT318 a week ago and I put it to the test this past weekend. The back of my parents yard is lined with Arborvitae 8-10' high and 4-5' wide. The cost of getting landscapers to trim them run $1500- $2000. It's a 2 day job. The last time I trimmed them I used an exta long electric hedge trimmer and a ladder. This year I used the B&D; Pole Hedge Trimmer. Now the comments about the weight. The time I minded the weight a little was the second straight day I used it. Standing on the ground got most, but not all of the branches.  On a few of the Arborvitae, I had to get on a ladder and extend across to get the tops. It seemed heavy at the time because I used the trimmer for at least 6 hr. straight the day before. But I liked the trim
B0007NP05U After reading the listing and reviews, I expected a length in the range of 5 feet and that's what I got. With that in mind and my expectations in check....this is exactly what I needed to trim a huge hedge. The trimmer has many adjustments that will allow you to trim a hedge that is up to around 8 to 9 feet tall if you are around 6 feet tall. You may think this trimmer has a huge extension length but it does not. It has two sections that couple as one section and that is it. What it does have that is nice is a head that pivots in so many directions. This thing works and I am really pleased with my purchase. As far as heavy...15 minutes is about tops before you may want to rest your arms.
B0007NP05U I like the trimmer very much although find it too heavy.  I'm not a big person.  I also find because of being able to set the trimmer head in different positions it's actually faster to do the job. For the front of hedges I position the head perpendicular to the pole then put the trimmer against the hedge and walk the length of the hedge. I don't need to swing it back and forth. On the hedges ~4' tall I make two passes.  Very quick.  The problems come on the top or backs of hedges when again the house.  Then it becomes heavy.  But, again I don't have to keep swinging it back and forth like a hand held to reach.  I would recomend it to anyone other then people that are smaller or older than I am.
B0007NP05U Update: Stopped working effectively after about 16 hours of use.  James on a twig slightly larger than a matchstick and then makes a whining noise and a nice electric burning smell until I whack it with my hand a few times, then it'll work in a promising manner until you actually bring the blade to bear on a hedge.  I've found that the cutting bar is so flimsy you can bend it permanently without much effort.  Might be why its jamming all the time.  Might be interesting to try to bend it to a semi circle for custom cutting before I jam it into the garbage can...No power, fibber marketing guys, impractical for anything other than marginal light duty work here and there.  Very first piece of outdoor equipment that I've bought that just stopped working after a short usage period.  Maybe i've been fortunate.--------------------original review:I'll say something good first.  Its not the worst hedge trimmer i've used. (update: yes it is)That having been said, the box shows that its ten feet long, and after fiddling with it for 15 minutes trying to figure out how to extend it and reading the manual twice, i came to the conclusion that this includes the height of the person holding it.  Love the marketing spin...The cutting end is a good 7-8 lbs.  Try holding that at an angle on the end of the (actually) four foor pole for a while.  Would have been brilliant to put the motor on the bottom and some kind of actuation through the pole and just the blade on top.The specs say it'll cut almost a half inch.  Not exactly.  Anything about a third of an inch or so will stop the blade dead.  Now you've got a heavy cutter on the end of a long pole stuck on a branch.  If you're lucky, you're also on a ladder.Not worth a hundred bucks.
B0007NP05U A bit disappointed in the quality of this trimmer; does not feel sturdy and the weight is not balanced well. I also have an Echo gas pole trimmer with a telescoping pole with reach up to 21 ft. that is substantial in weight, but well-balanced and rock-solid. Bought this one to be used on light-weight work on smaller shrubs and be able to work standing up versus bent over using a Mantis gas trimmer that has been great, but gets heavy after awhile. I like the ease of the pivot adjustment and is a snap to take apart for storage. The charger provided should have been the type that can be wall-mounted; this has to be laid on top of a flat surface. This trimmer is good for light work, but leave the heavy thick shrubs to gas trimmers.
B0007OER2G I wish I had known about this product years ago! I have a big driveway with a big eucalyptus tree over it that seems to drop leaves all year round (I'm in S. Cal). I've been either sweeping or vacuuming constantly, and eucalyptus leaves have a way of \"sticking\" to the ground. This sweeper picks everything up effortlessly. I now have a clean driveway all the time, I almost hope for leaves just so I can push it around. Plus, my kids like to do it, too.Pros:-Effective at picking up otherwise hard to pick up leaves-Effective at picking up various debris-Not so hard to clean-Not so hard to push-Environmentally friendly-Good value for the price-Good exercise!Cons:-Not good at sweeping up mounds of leaves and debris-Sticks and long pine needles get stuck in various parts (not hard to remove, though)-Leaves a thin line of fine dirt it can't pick up each time (you can make a couple of passes to get it, though)It does take some experimenting to figure out the best height and walking speed for the surface you are on, but once you figure it out, it works fine. Despite the product claims, don't expect to pick up big objects or plow through big mounds of leaves or dirt and expect it work well. It is NOT a vacuum cleaner. At first, I was a little dismayed in that it feels too light, i.e., a little cheap, but I got over it. I am also concerned how long the brushes will last, but I hope I can buy replacements.Overall, one of the best outdoor maintenance products I have bought in a long time. It makes it so much easier to always have a clean driveway and patio. Highly recommended.
B0007OER2G I normally use a mulching blower/vac for the yards, but this sweeper is a quick and easy solution when I want to do a quick clean-up without hauling out a really long electric cord and the blower. Additionally my blower won't pick up cans, paper, and shouldn't pick up stones or mulch unless I want to break it.At 21\" wide I use this like I would a mower except it doesn't need a power source or gasoline. It can be used on the driveway, walkways, sidewalks, around the pool, on the porch-------any place that has a hard, flat surface that isn't covered with dirt or sod or sand.I most frequently use this after the lawn is mowed or edged or when leaves pile up by the pool area. It replaces using a broom and is way easier. It contains a refuse receptacle that is easy to remove. Normally it is large enough to hold everything so it only needs to be emptied once, but sometimes when there is a lot of clippings, etc. I may need to empty it more frequently.The SpinSweep is compact when not in use. It folds up and I hang it it the gardening shed when not in use.If you need something to pick up yard waste around the paved areas of your home, this is a nice appliance to have as it is easy to maneuver and does a decent job quickly.
B0007OER2G This item is an impoved version of a sweeper called Clean Boy. I paid over 200 bucks for one. This is basicly the same thing, but well impoved for way less than half the price.  I use it for cleaning the driveway, around the pool and the curb.  It works very well, just dont excpect it to do anything unreasonable. Stores easy also, you can hang it up by the handle and the main unit will go flat againts the wall.  sorry my reviews arent the best.. but I can tell you this item was worth it...
B0007OER2G This is almost too good to be true. It is flimsy and simplistic but IT WORKS!!  I have a huge paver patio courtyard (about 2500 square feet) and always found keeping it swept clean to be difficult and a drudgery at best. Thus it didn't get done very often. With this sweeper it is easy and much more thorough. Just before I discovered this on Amazon my wife and I had spent several hours sweeping with a broom and a shop vac and thought we had it clean. I got this two days later and went over part of it again just to try it out. To our surprise it picked up a lot that we had apparently missed! I am still in the process of going over it all again and getting a lot but I have to believe after this first time thorough cleaning I will pick up less in the future if I use it with some regularity. Don't expect some heavy duty high tech machine but I think you will be very pleased with the job it does.
B0007OER2G I live on a corner lot and my yard is covered in trees.  This has difficulty with large leaves such a avocodo. I has also truble with macadamia nut leaves.  Small stuff it does great.  I have to rake first and then use this.
B0007OPJM8 After putting this together I found it to be quite unnerving. It reminds me of a javelin. Sure it's long, but it wobbles! Do I really feel comfortable holding a wobbling chainsaw over my head? No. It cuts at the high height level but it is very unsteady and takes a bit of muscle to keep it straight on the branch. The problem is the saw blade head is just too heavy compared with the shaft and bottom.  It basically sways in the air.  I will not be using the extension rather I will just stand on a ladder to reach the higher branches. There really should be a steel pole in each piece to give it some stability. One more thing is that the blade cover doesn't stay on. It should have been designed with a clip of some sort.I'm one of those people who always throws away the product box, but I think I'll be saving this one in case it breaks.Comment Comment  Permalink
B0007OPJM8 I have used this pole saw 4times in the little time I have owned it and it has done everything expected and even more. I am no stranger to the B&D brand name and the products have always served me well. I have a gas chain saw which I use when my feet are on the ground but I never ever go up a tree or ladder with it but I do have need to cut limbs I cannot reach so this battery operated pole saw takes care of that need and does it very well and the best part is the price. Very good product for the price.
B0007OPJM8 This is my fourth Black and Decker cordless product and I have rated it the lowest of the four.  It should come with two batteries.  Because it is a chain saw, it is very sensitive to the amount of juice in the battery.  If you have a low battery, it will grab the limb being sawed.  This is potential dangerous and/or could cause you to get the saw hung up in a limb 10 feet above your head.  Make sure you have a fully charged battery before starting a job.  A second battery would be very helpful to ensure you can get though any job.  The saw is fairly heavy at the head but the battery end does provide balance.  I bought this saw because a couple of my palm trees are too tall for me to cut from the ground.  I must get on a ladder to reach them.  The last time I did this, the sawing motion of my manual pole saw caused me to fall off the ladder.  Once I got up, I decided I was going to get a powered pole saw.  Since I had the other B&D tools, this was the one to get.  Please note, Black and Decker specifically warns against using this tool on a ladder and my review is not suggesting that you do this.  It works very well on palm fronds and seed pods.  I tried it on a crape myrtle tree, but found the saw bounced on the small limbs and did not give a clean cut.  Other reviewers have noted this as well.  I also found the pole saw too heavy for the large number of limbs which needed triming the crape myrtle trees.  You can adjust the length of the pole by removing the center section.  The saw handles better if you don't have the center section in, but if you need it, use it.  This is a good tool, if you understand the battery must be fully charged, you can handle the weight, and the limbs to be cut are thick enough to support the weight of the saw while it is biting into them. Amazon had this product to my house with in a week of ordering it.
B0007OPJM8 This is the ideal device for light tree maintenance, making fast work of branches up to about 4-5 inches in diameter. It will zip through smaller branches in seconds and while it can cut through much bigger trunks it's much slower than a gas-powered chainsaw for these pieces. Typically I get around 30 minutes of use on one full charge which takes between 6-9The product comes with a carry-bag and breaks down into three pole components, a battery and charger. It's quick to assemble though don't forget to put the battery in last to prevent any accidents. When fully assembled it's not particularly heavy though can feel a little unwieldy and it takes some skill to cut the branches to avoid them collapsing on you.Apart from the low cost and typical Black & Decker quality, I particularly like this over a regular chainsaw for safety reasons. It's much, much safer to stand on the ground with a chainsaw on a pole than climbing on ladders trying to get into trees with a traditional chainsaw. It's also better for avoiding bugs and debris.The unit needs very little maintenance other than occasional chain tightening (wrench included) and I lightly oil the chain each time before use. The instructions explain the details but it's very simple. Overall, I couldn't be happier with this tool and while it's not going to take down entire trees it does make trimming and pruning a breeze.
B0007OPJM8 18 months ago I was up on an 8' ladder trimming branches. The ladder legs bent, I fell 5' to the ground. I won't go into the details but I'm still recovering from the fall. The old ladder is in the garbage dump and I have a new, stronger, ladder. But I still don't want to go up a ladder unless I really have to.I bought this pole chain saw to augment the four 18V Black & Decker tools I already have, and to reduce the number of times I must climb a ladder. I assembled it in two minutes, was able to trim branches from the ground. It worked easily, cut easily, and disassembled easily for storage in the bag provided.I really like these 18V tools from B&D.; I also have a B&D; 36V lawn mower. No more gas, no more electric cords, no more spark plugs, and no more oil. I can mow & edge two lawns, and blow off the sidewalks and driveway in 20 minutes.I think this is a great addition to my B&D; collection.By the way I've been using the B&D; tools for two years. I keep all the batteries on the charger 100% of the time when they are not in use. I haven't had to replace a battery yet, and they all seem to hold a charge as well as they did when new.
B0007OPJM8 I had a sears reciprocating blade pole saw, that cut very nice and clean, but broke after 10 minutes of use (I tried 2 before returning it for my money back).  This B&D; unit doesn't have a blade, it has a mini chainsaw on the end and man can it cut.  I was amazed how it chews through branches 5+ inches  thick.  It seems to be pretty good quality and even though some plastic, it is holding up well.Pro's-amazing cuts from the ground without climbing the tree-very aggressive cut rate-fairly light-pretty easy to use, very easy to use without extra extension-powerful battery-blade cover and attached oil bottle is convenient-gets branches that you would otherwise have to call the tree man to doCon's-this is a real chainsaw so don't be fooled into thinking it's a toy, keep kids away too-safety is a concern; safety glasses, heavy gloves, and a hard hat are good idea-the lower the branch the easier to cut, high branches end up right over your head and there is risk of them falling on you-it's hard to undercut the branch before top cutting to prevent tear out-it leaves a rough cut like a chainsaw, not smooth like a tree pruner-battery life is good, but it comes with just one so you can easily find yourself stuck in mid cut. A second battery is highly recommended.-included charger is a slow charger; 6 hours if completely dead. B&D; makes a fast charger for 25 bucks.I find this tool very handy. I purchased a B&D; 18V broom ($70)just to get 2 extra batteries and another charger.
B0007OPJM8 I used this product around my home and it does everything everyone else said it would do. The only thing I wasn't sure of was the weight of the unit and holding the product for about 45 minutes to an hour with the maximum length of 14', but I got used to it. I believe the amount of time for the battery is about 45\" to 1 hour which was great and meant I could stop after that time. Works out perfectly for us older guys.
B0007OPJM8 Having used mine for a couple months, I have to say this is a great tool for basic tree trimming. No, you are not going to take a tree to the ground with this, but for keeping your landscape looking good or fixing winter and storm damage, this is a great tool.First thing you will want to do is buy that Firestorm 18volt battery up above. It lasts longer and has much more power than the one that comes with this tool. Also keep in mind that dead wood takes more out of the battery than green wood as does cutting bigger branches as the saw is running constantly as opposed to off and on with cutting small branches, so your battery mileage may vary.Second, the saw comes with a hex/screwdriver to keep the chain tight and to remove the bar for cleaning and a little bottle for Bar & Chain oil. Use them! Keeping the saw clean, chain tight and lubricated is the most important part of keeping this tool running. Oil early and often.Third a safety warning! The safety switch is also the trigger locking switch and when you are using this saw at it full length it can be a little dangerous. When you saw thru the branch and it and the saw drops, the trigger lock may keep the saw running on you.Also, if the chain slips and the saw stops because it is jammed, remember to release the trigger lock! The electric motor can burn out because it is still on till the lock is released! As to fixing the jam, just unscrew the hex bolts, clean out any debris and reset the bar & chain, remembering to readjust the screw that tightens the chain.I am very pleased with my saw and I am looking forward to getting more 18volt tools in this line.
B0007OPJM8 I've had my B&D Pole Pruning Saw for 1 week now.  I bought this based solely on comments made on this site by people in the review. They did not disappoint.  This is a nice product. I've used it 3 times now and it cut though all branches smoothly. It is lightweight and very well made.  Before I bought this I used the Woodzig Pole saw. That is not in the same league. The B&D is far superior.  I think you will be very satisfied as I am with this product.
B0007OPJM8 Worked great on branches up to about 4 inches.  Seemed kind of flimsy at connections but otherwise I like this item
B0007OPJM8 This chain saw is not for huge jobs, but for cleaning out roots from beds or for sprucing up a tree which has become a bit over grown between seasons, this saw does the job.  Caveat:  get another battery and charger if you are really going to town on trimming branches then you won't have to wait a few hours for the 1st battery to recharge to finish your project.
B0007OPJM8 Arrived on time with good packaging. Battery charged quickly.  Went to work on some branches that were too high to hang off a ladder for.  Cut right through them.  Can get heavy when used overhead for more than 10 minutes.  If you plan your work load, and mix sizes and locations of the items to be cut, you won't fatigue your arms.  Your arms will usually give out before the battery does.  Can't stress enough to keep the chain oiled.
B0007OPJM8 When presented with a $750 estimate to trim trees and bushes in my yard, I decided to buy a pole saw and do it myself.  I bought the Black and Decker cordless and am very satisfied with its performance.  I have used it on oak limbs up to 5\", holly up to 6\", pear up to 4\" and ligustrum up to 4\".  It has had absolutely no problem with any of these limbs.  You do need to plan your project; i.e., saw a bit, pick up, saw again, etc.; otherwise, the battery will run down.  The batteries seem good for only 30-45 minutes continuous duty; it's really necessary to have a spare. Another reason to break your work up is muscle fatigue.  Although a light tool, its length (especially at full extension) will cause you to discover muscles you had forgotten you possessed, and I visit the gym 2-3 times weekly to lift weights.  Again, this is a perfect tool for the home gardener; however, I do not recommend it for heavy duty professional work.  Make sure you read and follow the instructions.
B0007OPJM8 QUICK SUMMARY:  This is the 2nd time I've bought this pole saw.  My first one broke after two years of use, but it was useful enough to me that I was willing to buy it a 2nd time.  Read my review to learn what NOT to do.  Recommended!My first Black and Decker pole saw broke when the screwhole threads inside the metal frame (these are the screwholes you use to make the chain taut) somehow got stripped after I tried tightening the screws once.  Apparently, you have to be CAREFUL not to overtighten these screws, or else you'll damage the screwhole threads, and the screws meant for tightening the chain won't tighten anymore, so your chain becomes too loose to use, so you can't use it anymore.  My lesson learned is your lesson learned!I also should admit, too, that I pushed this pole saw beyond its intended means.  By that, I mean that I was cutting big limbs off my front yard's black olive tree, the largest of which was probably about 10\" in diameter.  Yes, it's really intended to be used to cut much smaller branches and limbs, but I had to cut big limbs off my tree before hurricane season!What I like:- it's reasonably lightweight, though hard to use when you're stretching on a step ladder- no electric wires to accidentally cut, or that unplug from your saw!- the battery keeps a reasonably long charge- the chain is easy to tighten and replace- it's relatively inexpensiveWhat I don't like:- you have to manually oil the change every so often- you can overtighten the screws bringing permanent damage to your saw if you're not careful!- you have to assemble the wand fully to use the saw; I wish you could just plug-in the battery directly or almost directly into the saw so you more easily cut-up the fallen branches into smaller piecesFinal tip:  Take the time to read the manufacturer's advice on how to properly store and care for your battery.  I didn't, and my older saw's battery suffered because I didn't follow the charging instructions correctly.Recommended!
B0007UQ2LO I have a non-heavy-duty version of this hose, which has worked well for me for a year or so now, and I wanted another NeverKink, because these hoses seem to be flexible and easy to coil by hand, yet able to keep water flowing.This hose is quite a bit more rigid/inflexible than standard garden hoses and other NeverKink hoses, which makes winding the hose onto a hanger a little more difficult, and handling the hose a little more difficult in general. The hose does seem like it will stand up to a lot of use, though.My only major gripe is that the female end of the hose seems to have developed a leak already, after only a few weeks' use, seemingly at the point where the hose is crimped onto the brass fitting. I'll probably buy a replacement female connection from the home center and put it on.
B0007UQ2LO Too heavy and kink. Hard to carry around. Expensive to much for female gardener. I am not able to drug around to water my flower beds.
B0007UQ2LO Doesn't kink and excellent build quality.  Just make sure to run water through the hose before watering your plants because I notice some white residue within the inside probably from manufacturing.  It came out while I was filling a bucket of water.  No big deal just a heads up in case there are sensitive plants.
B0007UQ2LO Sure, this kinks a lot less easily than a rubber hose, but NEVER SAY NEVER!!!  It's a decent hose with nice HD brass ends, but it WILL kink.  Keep in mind if you're using a hose in colder weather, rubber is the only way to go.  These vinyl hoses STINK in the cold and have a memory of how they're stored.  They're awesome in warmer climates though!Overall we're happy with the hose, but believe it shouldn't claim that it'll &#34;Never Kink&#34;.
B0007UQ2LO This holds up really well, an doesn't kink.It is not drinking water safe, and has a very strong plastic smell when first used. It does the job I intended it to do.
B0007UQ2LO This is a heavy-weight hose and heavy-duty. I already had purchased the 100foot one for my backyard and like it very much. It doesn't kink and it seems to be well made enough to last a few years before I'll need to replace it. This one is made with the same quality. It doesn't kink and it appears well made enough to last. I put it in my front yard where it gets regular use and it is doing what it is supposed to do, so I have no issues with it. In fact, if you are looking for a heavy duty hose that won't kink and will stand up to regular use, I have no problem recommending this one. In fact, as time goes by I'll probably be purchasing another one for my side yard, just haven't decided what size to get yet. It is a bit pricey, but I think it is worth it. It is made out of recycled materials and you can't drink from it, but that is to be expected now a days. Again, it is a heavy hose, so I wouldn't recommended it to those that are frail, arthritic or weak. Moving it around will wear you out. Other than that, it stretches out easily; you don't have to fight with it.Tip: uncoil it and lay it where you want before turning the water on. If you leave it coiled up, then turn the water on and try to move it about it will be like moving an iron pipe. It becomes rigid when the water flows through it.
B0007UQ2MS Great little hose to water my plants and drink from. It does leak a bit. I do like the easy connector. I just wish it did not leak so much. A handy little hose for just about anything. Also, it is fairly priced and no problems with kinking.
B0007UQ2MS I needed a 75' version so I added this 25' size to my 50' hose of this same type.  It is lightweight and easy to deal with.  In fact, it's so much more maneuverable, I'm really surprised.  We've had some hot weather these last few days so I've already had to water considerably and this hose has made the chore much less awkward.  I also like the fact that I can spray the vegetable garden and not worry about toxic stuff from the hose material mixing with the water and affecting my crop.  I've replaced all my hoses with this type and am very pleased with them.
B0007UQ2MS There is little more annoying than a kinked hose, especially when watering vegetables. This hose solved that problem for me!
B0007UQ2MS The end you see in the picture with the handy plastic thumbscrew attached is actually a few threads shorter than a standard hose. I have a rain barrel that I wanted to use this with but it will not get a bite on the plastic faucet. My standard 50' garden hose attaches okay, as well as a quick disconnect adapter that I was using, but not this hose. Other than that is is a good quality hose and I will still use it to get water from my barrels to the gardens, just not as I originally intended.
B0007UQ2MS This is the 2nd roll I've purchased, so that should tell you how much I like it.  I got a 50' roll first, and liked it enough to buy another 25' roll so I would have enough and some extra to cover all my yard.This is the first hose I've used/owned that you didn't have to be super careful not to kink.  It always seemed like the higher end the hose was, the softer it was, and the more it would kink on me.  I can just roll/unroll this hose when I need it, and no issues so far.  Highly recommended.
B0007UQ2N2 DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON OTHER HOSES THE BEST  ONLY THING IT HAS FUNNY CONNECTORS IF YOU USE REEL LOOK CLOSELY  I CAN JUST GET IT THROUGH MY MODEL SUNCAST
B0007UQ2N2 For years I fought with a 75 foot hose that leaked at the couplings, kinked and resisted being rolled up. This hose didn't do any of those irritating things and I was not soaking wet by the time I finished using it. It rolled up very nicely on my hose reel. I'm pleased with this purchase.
B0007UQ2N2 Years ago I bought a commercial grade 5/8\" rubber hose to fit on my hose reel.  This hose has been a pain to use, as it's heavy & is constantly kinking.  My search for a lightweight kink resistant hose found this.The pros:+ The shipping was free when I purchased mine.+ Drinking water safe.+ Nice clean white color with a blue stripe.+ Light weight.+ Resists kinking.+ Easy to rewind on my hose reel.The cons:- On the expensive side for 1/2\" x 50' hose.- The hose has a funky plastic piece molded on to the female fitting. I'm sure it's to increase the ease of use, but I find it annoying. I'd be happier with the plain old brass only fitting & I may opt to cut it off.Overall, I'm happy with this hose.  It much lighter than the old commercial grade rubber hose I was using + it doesn't kink! :)&#9658; Update - May 27, 2014I decided to cut off that piece of plastic on the female fitting.  Under that plastic was the standard brass fitting. :)
B0007UQ2N2 The one thing I've always hated about gardening is hoses--until I found this one. When I opened the hose the first time, I was able to uncoil it easily and then hang it on a holder with much less hassle than my other hoses.  It's lightweight and easy to handle.  I'm so pleased with it, I'm replacing all my hoses with this type.  Although we don't usually drink out of the hose, I do fill my dog's water bucket and with my current hose, I have to let it run for several minutes because of the milky, soapy water that comes out at first.  That can't possibly be good for the dog or anything else.  That doesn't happen with this hose.  I get clear water immediately.This hose is white with a blue stripe, which is great for a boat or RV, but a little glaring in the yard.  Still it's so much easier to use I can live with that.  I have to move one of my hoses several times in dry weather to hook to different soaker hoses and some things need to be hand watered, so weight and manageability are really important to me and this hose scores a 10.
B0007UQ2N2 I have a need for many hoses on my property, and it am always testing out new hose ideas.All my hoses are never kink, but in reality, after a few months or a year they do kind a bit.  You may not think that is a big deal, but if you have as much waiting to do as I do daily, you would &#34;get&#34; it.I also like that it light weight.  The color is nice also and the price reasonable.
B0007UQ2N2 Very light and easy to use, we replaced our heavy garden hose for this one.  Also, good to know it is safe to use when washing my dog.
B0007UQ2N2 This hose is goood so far. I leave the hose in my lawn and there hasn't been any damage or kinks. Defintiely recommend this product.
B0007UQ2N2 Over the years, I have bought and thrown away hundreds of dollars of hoses that were \"commercial\", \"professional\", \"industrial-strength\", \"kink-proof\", \"life-time guaranteed\".Nearly 1 year ago, I bought 3 of these and this hose is the best I've ever used.Unlike every other hose, this Apex hose doesn't have the dreaded coiled memory effect which makes it so difficult to coil up.While these hoses are not truly kink-proof, they're very kink-resistant.Even though they're 1/2\", the flow rate is surprisingly good and I'm using 2 of them together.Since they're not heavy, it's easy to hang up.  My other hoses were so difficult to hang, I simply left them on the driveway which made the place look sloppy.  These are so easy to hang, my wife hangs them each time.I used to loathe the prospect of dragging out 100 ft of heavy hoses to water the garden that I would neglect watering and plants died.You'll love this hose.
B0007UQ2N2 This hose is just as described.  Very nice and light.  I connected it and in spite of having purchased some of those rubber rings to prevent leakage, I didn't need to use any except the one it has.  It does not leak at all, and is very easy to take around my patio to water my plants.  I was considering purchasing the &#34;new&#34; green ones that expand to double or more their size, but everybody reports having trouble with them and so I looked for an alternative.  This is it for me!  Light, but very nicely made.
B0007WFG2I I recommend this Hori Hori knife to other gardeners every chance I get.After I started using my Hori Hori I loved it so much I never went outside into the yard without it on my belt.Every few steps I take it comes in handy. I love rearranging the plants and i'm always weeding. Now I just whip out the Hori Hori and dig up a plant, then use the knife to dig the new hole to replant. I'm always using it to remove weeds. I use it to cut the roots off the celery and lettuce before I bring them into the house. I use it to harvest vegetable from the stems.Honestly I'm sure i've never had a gardening tool this useful. I bought one for my mother. I'm planning to buy another for a friend at church. It's the perfect gift.This model is very sturdy and easy to keep clean. I keep this knife cleaner than I keep my car. It's the first time i've ever paid so much attention to keeping track of my tools. The rest of them are scattered around the property until they get tripped over.I have not yet sharpened the blade. I think that might be a chore but it will need to be done at some point. I've used mine for a few months now and i'm assuming at the end of this season it'll need sharpening.
B0007WFG2I This is an excellent digging tool. I have one other with a matte blade which I have used for years. This knife has depth markers incised into the shiny stainless steel blade which help with determining the depth to dig for various bulbs and corms. It also has one jagged blade which helps when you have to cut a root.
B0007WFG2I This product is very obvious in its high quality. I don't understand why a quality product like this doesn't come in a genuine leather pouch, because anyone would pay the extra money for a pouch that will last as long as the knife.
B0007WFG2I I looked at all the Hori-Horis available on Amazon and read all the reviews before settling on this one as a present for my girlfriend, an avid gardener. She was impressed by the quality, and likes how it can be used as a shallow trowel, a bulb planter, a perennial divider, a root cutter, and more. It's very handy in her garden, which borders on a nature preserve full of invasive plants. It's attractive and well made, too. I'd recommend it for any outdoor gardener.
B0007WFG2I I bought this last year so this is the first spring I have had to use it.  I am seriously impressed.  I am using it for popping out weeds, hacking down dead vegetation and planting.  It doesn't dig a wide hole and does not work as well as a trowel for removing dirt while planting, but it works much better than a trowel to plant in my horribly rocky clay areas and the blade makes it easy to puncture a hole to put the plant tag.The sharpness of this is tool makes it extremely useful.  I think the serrated blade will make sharpening difficult, but for this price it is well worth getting a new one when it gets dull.  I will definitely do so and am buying some for gifts for my fellow gardening friends.Also, if you wonder what the difference between the models 1515 and 1516, according to the company's web site this one is a stainless version of the black 1515.
B0007WFG2I This is one of the greatest garden tools I have ever owned. Since buying one for myself, I have given a couple to others as gifts, and bought a second one for me - as I tend to put things down and sometimes forget where. With 2, I keep one in the pocket of my lawn tractor seat cover - and therefore always know where at least one of them is!!!
B0007WFG2I This is a very sturdy and well made tool.  I think, though, that my soil isn't all that suitable for it's use.  I still end up getting a regular shovel, because I'm not crazy about stooping.
B0007ZGUJS This thing is huge! I use it with my lump charcoal in my 22.5 weber performer grill. One scoop will basically fill one of the weber charcoal briquette baskets (which i use with my lump charcoal). This was 100% easier and faster than picking up a couple of pieces at a time with my tongs.UPDATE: I just bought a 2nd one for my dog's food as well and it works great. Definitely multi-purpose tool.
B0007ZGUJS What can I say, this is a top quality cast aluminum scoop that is great for scooping charcoal out of the bag and into the chimney.  This thing seems indestructible.
B0007ZGUJS I own this scoop, use it for putting lump charcoal in and taking ash out of myWeber 721001 Smokey Mountain Cooker 18.5-Inch SmokerWorks great, perfect size, constructed to last forever, aluminum so it won't rust.  I also use it on myWeber 1421001 Performer Charcoal Grill, BlackI keep my lump in the side bin, and store the scooper with it!  Amazon is (always) the greatest place to shop!
B0007ZGUJS I love to barbeque even in the winter but hate getting the black smutty charcoal dust all over my hands while prepping the grill. I have seen plastic scoops that don't hold up or are too small but this one is perfect. It's aluminum so it won't rust and is weather tough. It's heavy gauge so it won't bend while serving hefty helping of coals to the grill, and it's stylish and affordable. Who could ask for more?
B0007ZGUJS This is a fine little scoop. I use mine for scooping charcoal into my chimney starter, and it's big enough, strong enough, good enough, and darn it, people like it. While I wouldn't go quite so far as one reviewer in saying that it looks like a $100 item from a specialty store (wish I owned a specialty store in his/her neighborhood lol), it does look well made, the finish is decent, and it is sturdy enough to lift a lot more of whatever you're lifting than will fit into the scoop.That's the scoop as I see it, hope some of you find my review helpful!
B0007ZGUJS I also didn't expect it to be so big, despite some reviewers mentioning the size. I bought it to scoop rock salt out the salt bag and I'm impressed by how much it holds. The quality and attractiveness of this product is actually overkill for this use, but that's okay because it's nice to be surprised in a positive way.
B0007ZGUJS I buy 50 pound bags of dog food and have been using plastic bowls to scoop out the chow into a bucket to carry into the dog pen to fill poochie's dish. After going through several bowls which tend to crack and break, I purchased this aluminum scoop.Hot dog, does it work so much better than a bowl!! It's strong and durable and will last no doubt for many years. I didn't measure how much, but the scoop holds a lot, and I can fill a bucket in no time.What else can I say about a scoop? It's strong, has a nice finish to it, it's easy to use, and holds a lot. In fact it's so nice, I'll probably have to hide it from the Grill King so he doesn't scarf it to use for the charcoal.
B0007ZGUK2 I've always felt it's probably a little unsanitary to use an aluminum beer can with inked labeling on a hot grill.  Maybe not, but it gives me pause.  This device works as a more stable and possibly more healthy alternative to a can of Bud.  It is also perfect if you want to use other liquids such as wine, juice or whatever.  The only downside is the clean-up.  It consists of four parts, each of which get coated with chicken drippings and need some serious scrubbing to get off the cooked-on residue.  I've found a dishwasher alone doesn't really remove all of it.  A little scrubbing is necessary to really get the device clean.This is certainly a useful item for us backyard cooks.  It's a little inconvenient compared to using a beer can that can be tossed in the trash after using.
B0007ZGUK2 With or without the beer this device puts the bird in the best position for grilling.  We use beer, soda and fruit juice .  If there is an issue with this unit it would be lifting the unit off the grill with the bird in place.  Handles are to close to grid to get a grip without burring yourself.  I use a couple of heavy forks to lift off of grill - easy work around.
B0007ZGUK2 this works great wish the tray was a little bigger & deeper but still gets the job done like that its stainless steel worth the money.
B0007ZGUK2 I picked this vertical roaster for multiple reasons. Like many other reviewers, I made a few beer-butt chickens that decided they would rather fall over and make a mess as opposed to stand up straight and tall and cook like a well-behaved poultry. Secondly, I own a couple of cookbooks buy Steven and when I saw that he endorsed this product, I took a leap of faith that he didn't back up a piece of junk.He did not.This is a small, but well made and solid piece that works great on my Weber One-Touch Silver charcoal grill. I usually roast 4 lbs. birds, and they fit on the apparatus snugly and securely. I have NOT used the included cup/infuser, only cans of cheaply priced domestic beers. The results have been great. I like to put a little onion or potato in the chicken's neck to help seal in the moisture, but that's me.The unit is stainless steel, and dishwasher safe and it cleans up nicely. The 12oz. beer cans fit securely in the ring, and it seems like a lot of thought went into the design accept in a couple of areas, which I'll get to in the next paragraph. The handles are secure enough where you can hold the whole thing chicken and all by one handle and not worry about it breaking or bending.The only cons that I have found are that the drip pan could stand to be a tad deeper and I wished the handles angles upwards a bit more because its tough to fit a gloved or mitted hand between the hot grill grate and the underside of the handle to lift the unit off the grill when its done.Other than that, job well done and I really recommend it! The additional separate can/infuser enhances the versatility of the device so you can flavor the bird with wine, OJ, sake, sodas, or broths. That's pretty cool.Happy grilling and enjoy your chicken-on-a-throne!
B0007ZGUK2 This has to be the best chicken rack out there.  It's easy to use, easy to clean, and pretty to boot.  I gave this to my husband with the cookbook, **Beer-Can Chicken: And 74 Other Offbeat Recipes for the Grill** (http://www.amazon.com/Beer-Can-Chicken-Other-Offbeat-Recipes/dp/0761120165/ref=pd_bxgy_ol_img_b/105-3317259-8297264) and it's been terrific recipe after terrific recipe ever since.  You CANNOT make chicken this good in the kitchen--it's better than any rotisserie, better than any baked chicken --ever--.  You've got to try this--you won't be sorry!
B0007ZGULG The Good:  These skewers are perfect, much better than traditional round ones and infinitely better than wooden ones.  For everyone who has ever had the frustration of trying to turn your food on the grill only to have the skewer turn inside the food and the food stay stuck to the grill, these wide rectangular skewers are perfect.  They are very long and very durable as well.  I have cooked numerous meals with them to include beef, vegetables and chicken.  Every one came out perfect and I never had a problem with the skewer sliding around inside the food itself.The Bad:  Even though these are stainless steel, after cooking with them and washing them off they rusted.  I quickly solved this problem with a Brillo pad and before I put the skewers away in the drawer, I coated them with a very light coat of olive oil.  Problem solved.
B0007ZGULG After chasing food around the typical round metal & wood skewers for quite a while I decided to go on the hunt for a better skewer, and I found them! The \"flat vs round\" design allows whatever food you have on them to stay in place so that everything cooks evenly. The point, although sharp is not overly so but still sharp enough to easily pierce raw meat and the 18\" length gives you plenty of room to \"load em\" down with goodies or space the food out whichever suits the food being grilled. The loop handle makes it easier to grasp the skewers with a mit or tongs.A previous reviewer mentioned the 18\" length and I'll agree depending upon your grill this length may be a bit long and they may be a tad better 2\" shorter [that reviewer just cut his to fit].I gave these skewers 5 stars as I don't anticipate having to find anything better for kabobs!
B0007ZGULG I must not have been paying attention when I bought these, because I can clearly see it now - but they are thick! They work great, but you have to cut some good sized vegetable slices and be careful when putting them on the skewer or they will crack and slip off. But if you do it right they make some great kabobs on the grill!
B0007ZGULG These are perfect kabob skewers.  Very sturdy, sharp point to get through food, wide flat edge so the food doesn't spin around when you are flipping them as it invariably does with round skewers.  More expensive than bamboo skewers but unless you lose these, they should last forever.  Pay attention to the measurements as these bad boys are long.  I have a WSM 22.5 inch and 22 inch Performer and these fit but not on my 18 One Touch Silver or the little Smokey Joe.  If you have a small grill these may not work.  Otherwise, they are perfect.
B0007ZGULG Nicely constructed skewers. They don't roll. They are not too wide and hold the food well. So what else could you want?
B0007ZGURK I use these gloves every time a bbq, so that means i use them at least once a week!  the gloves work great for taking hot meats out of the smoker.  Havent had any issues with these gloves EXCEPT for cleaning them, the exterior part is fine, but as soon as moisture gets on the inside of the gloves, it starts to kinda smell.  So make sure when you clean them that you dont get water in there.EDIT : less then a week after i reviewed these gloves, one of the fingers somehow got a rip in it and when i reached into a 200 degree pork shoulder without realizing of the rip... that was fun.  The other glove is still fine.. but now i need to order a new pair  :/  Lasted 6 months
B0007ZGURK Anyone who has had to struggle with a large, hot, slippery piece of meat can appreciate these. We use them with our smoker to move meat around and put it on plates.  Works fantastic for what we need. Also really easy to just wash while still wearing them just under the faucet.  They are a little big and stiff but not too clumsy for what we use them for.
B0007ZGURK I picked these because when I'm smoking meat I want to grab the meat instead of sticking it with a pitch fork or something. Half the time it's too tender anyways and it wants to fall apart. These gloves make it easy to transport the meat from the grill to the pan.
B0007ZGURK I HAVE USED THESE SEVERAL TIMES SINCE RECEIVING. THEY WORK GREAT I PULLED MEAT RIGHT OFF THE GRILL WITHOUT FEELING ANY HEAT, THEY ALSO PROVIDE A REALLY GOOD GRIP ON THE FOOD. MY HANDS ARE VERY LARGE SO THEY COULD HAVE BEEN A BIT BIGGER BUT FOR 99% OF FOLKS THEY WILL FIT FINE.
B0007ZGURK I don't know if they will make your hands sweaty when they are used but they will stop my hands from getting burnrd
B0007ZGURK I wanted to use these gloves when handling hot food and still have the use of my fingers, as when cutting a hot chicken. My problem is that they get very slippery making it difficult to hold food and try and cut or pare it. A bit of chicken grease on these gloves will make a chicken hard to cut, certainly with a paring knife. Grabbing a leg or thigh off a well-cooked chicken and trying to pull it off the body is hard because the gloves are so slippery.On the other hand, they certainly work for picking up food off the BBQ, like a chicken, pork butt or brisket, and they're long enough that you won't burn your wrists over the fire.They aren't very tactile, so I'm not sure there's an advantage to having fingers rather than a traditional mitt design. This is thick rubber, so you don't really get any feedback as you would with a thinner glove, and because the glove is very loose fitting, I found  it a bit hard to use if you're handling food.Clean-up is the same as washing your hands, which I think is a good thing. Simply put some hand soap on them, and &#34;wash your hands&#34; and the gloves are clean and ready for the next use.In summary, I like 'em, but after using them a couple times, wouldn't buy them again.
B0007ZGURK I've been BBQ'ing for many years now and am sorry to say it took me way too long and too many burned fingers to invest in a good pair insulated &#34;Q'ing&#34; gloves. They are large but as I only use them to pull items from my smoker I don't mind that they are a bit big. Are easy to clean when you wash your hands with the gloves on. Good investment if you BBQ or Smoke a lot.
B0007ZGURK I received a kamado-style grill this past Christmas and just like anyone would who gets a new gift/hobby, you invest in it. As part of my investment, I realized I would need some insulated food gloves if I really wanted to cook on my new grill (especially if I smoke large meats like turkeys, briskets, and ribs).Even before I got the grill, I knew I would need them for future purposes because this past Thanksgiving, I baked my very first turkey and while carving it, I realized that I had no insulated gloves specific to handling hot meats (especially when I carved it.) At first I thought about oven mitts, which does allow you to handle the meat without burning your hands but I realized it wouldn't be very sanitary considering all the gunk that gets on cooking mitts. The only other gloves I had were these latex gloves that you get out of the \"cleaning\" section of your grocery store. While it keeps your hands clean, you still 1) burn yourself and 2) don't really know if it's \"safe\" for handling food.So after shopping around and finding recommendations from several BBQ forums, I decided on these gloves. While other reviewers say you can get \"better\", I ended up buying these and find they were worth it for the following reasons:1) These are affordable compared to other barbecue gloves on Amazon. The $14.23 price point (as of December 2012) makes it very competitive.2) Is actually designed to handle hot food and is insulated so it won't burn you.3) The outside material is \"rubber-like\" and is designed to handle food. What this means to the buyer is that 1) it's safe to handle your food and 2) the rubber outside coating means it's WASHABLE. The majority of the gloves on Amazon were made of some type of porous cloth. Anyone who has ever had oil/juices/grease/food touch cloth knows it can get extra dirty over time if you don't wash them.4) I know these gloves aren't \"GRILL\" gloves, but I've also used them as such (meaning I've touched the grates on my grill/smoker with these and it didn't seem to damage them). There is a disclaimer though, that says it's not designed for temps beyond a certain temperature (can't remember what), so if you're doing high-heat cooking, I'd advise you not to handle things that are beyond that temperature. It's listed on the box.Overall, very happy with these as I've already used them a few times with my smoked turkeys. My next cooking project is pulled pork!
B0007ZGURK These worked great for handling hot meat.  We also used them to adjust the hot racks in our smoker.  This partially melted the gloves so maybe that wasn't a smart idea.  Still useable, but a little rough and melty looking on the finger tips.Find it difficult to wash inside and out.  Some reviewers washed as if you were washing your hands but I require more disinfecting than that.  I would first wash while wearing them, then soak them, and even ran it through the dishwasher.  The melty fingers definately made it more difficult to clean.  Overall not that hard, just stating its not a wiz bang situation (and lord help you if you get the inside dirty)
B0007ZGURK great for using to adjust or remove meat from the grill and smoker
B0007ZGURK If you smoke meat, these gloves are a must. They are food grade and insulated.Allows you to handle the meat in the smoker without using tongs or heaven forbid, forks (bad word).Always put a cuff at the bottom, unless you like the feeling of meat juice running down your arms.Easily cleaned, mild soap and water.A little stiff due to the thickness of the coating and insulation, but nothing to complain about.I store mine in a gallon baggie. Note: Fold gloves and put a paper towel over the outside of the glovesbefore trying to put them in the bag. Try it without the paper towel and you will quickly know what I mean.
B0007ZGURK If you smoke or BBQ then you need a pair.  Pulling meat or trying to grab heave meat off a smoker would be tough without a pair.  Just wash your hands in the sink with them on to clean.  Great gloves an a must have next to the smoker.
B0007ZGURK I'm a bit of a fanatic when it comes to handling foods on the BBQ and the smoker.  Before the food is cooked I prefer to use disposable nitrile gloves for prepping meat and putting it on the BBQ/smoker because I can \"feel\" the product I am working with.  While the food is cooking I prefer to use leather gloves for handling non-food utensils, hot lids, water pans, charcoals, wood, etc.  If the food needs to be handled while cooking or smoking though, or once the food is cooked/smoked and needs handling, pulling, etc, these are what I use.  They can be cleaned easily by putting them on, soaping them up, and washing your hands under the faucet.  They are an essential part of my backyard BBQ/smoker work and greatly appreciated by the folks who will be dining with us.
B0007ZGURK Great interior, temperature protection, and fantastic for breaking down pig.  Don't wash, let them season, and be careful about getting water in the interior.
B0007ZGURK Good product.  Quality item at a great price.  Don't waste time or money....  This is a good way to go.
B0007ZGURK As others have stated these gloves do have an over whelming &#34;plastic&#34; smell to them when first opening the package, but that smell did go away. They do repel heat fairly good, but my gripe with them is that they are waaay to slippery. You cannot grab any type of meat or pull any meat apart as your hands will slide all over the place. I didn't use them to grab any hot metal objects, so I cant comment on that. But I rarely use them now only to grab meat from the grill (with a fork or thongs as I don't trust these gloves and the meat might slip out of my hands) and place them on a plate or cutting board, so for what I paid I cant be to upset. Also I didn't want to get water inside the gloves when cleaning them because I didn't know how the glove would dry being wet so I wear them and wash them as if I am washing my hands with warm water and soap.
B0007ZGURU These are essentially fancy leather welding gloves. Welding gloves have to protect you from being burned by spatters of molten metal, that cool almost immediately upon landing on a surface at room temperature. Cooking mitts, on the other hand, need to be able to hold a 400 degree object for many seconds without transmitting the heat. They also need to insulate even if they're wet.I found that this glove, despite being well made and attractive, is no good for holding hot items. At best, it protects hand and arm while grilling, if you're using tongs, lets say, over a very hot fire. Just don't expect to be able to hold a hot pan for more than a couple of seconds before the heat is conveyed directly to your tender skin and you have to put it down immediately or drop it.
B0007ZGURU haven't used them yet but they are really good  quality and will be good not to get burned when we use our fryer
B0007ZGURU I really like these. I have been able to keep the hairs on my hands a bit more intact, and they are certainly comfortable for my rather large hands (usually wear XXL gloves).  I can't say they make me grill any better, but they sure make it a lot more comfortable...
B0007ZGURU These gloves fit my size 9 hands a bit on the large size but after leaving them out one nice Florida rainy night they now fit just right.  The long cuffs are just right for opening the lid of my Weber Genesis 6611001 E-310 637-Square-Inch 38,000-BTU Natural-Gas Grill, Black.  I have used leather gloves before this and my forearms were always a bit too warm for comfort.  I cook outside about 4 times a week, summer, fall, winter (if you can call it winter in Florida) and spring working between the rain showers.
B0007ZGURU I was using the silicone oven mitts &#34;grill gloves&#34; that I purchased at Homedepot to cook on my grill and smoker.  The only problem was that those gloves made it hard to use any grill tool such as Fork, Spatula and Tongs while cooking.  I still need those silicone oven &#34;grill&#34; gloves to pick up hot items off and on the grill.These glove make it easier to use your grill Spatula to flip burgers and not worry about the flame touching you.  Or using the Tongs when flipping other meats or vegetables.  Since the glove comes up to my elbow I no longer feel the direct heat and making my cooking sessions more enjoyable.  I would recommend these gloves to cook on the grill.  But still keep the other heat resistant silicon oven mitts to put on and take off items off the grill.  Since those can take the heat better.  DO NOT TRY TO PICK UP ANYTHING HOT with these glove.  The heat transfers real quick and your going to take these gloves off right away.  I read that from other reviews on this product.  Which I found out by beta testing these gloves.
B0007ZJ1IK I saw this at Walmart for $20.00 but this was like $5.00 less. Works good and is built much better then the cheap junk I got from Harbor Freight. The locking mechanism for the stem rocks!
B0007ZJ1IK I am impressed with the quality of the air chuck and the pressure gauge.  The air chuck seats and 'grabs' very well (better than other models I've owned) and the pressure gauge matches the readings of two different gauges I have at home.  I was initially worried about the quality, as I've owned two others that did not measure pressure accurately (one had the needle fall off the gauge).  So far this seems far better quality.
B0007ZJ1IK Tire inflator works pretty well. I noticed that my unit was not like the one in the picture; it was the MP6000, not the MP6000AV -- the gauge only goes to 100psi and so it formatted differently than displayed.  Not a problem for me as I'm only doing car tires but if you have a semi or RV tire this could be some concern. The gauge is a little hard to interpret since the graduations aren't very instinctive to just glance at.  I didn't have any problem whatsoever with the tire clip that some have expressed concern wouldn't fit on smaller car tires; it fit fine on an 06 Chevy Aveo and an older 90s Nissan sentra and I can't see how it would cause problems for any other car as it's very slender.  Perhaps I got the improved design?  who knows.  In any rate, the unit is of high quality, no leaks of any kind.  I used to use a 12V cigarette plug inflator but that thing is crazy loud and takes forever just to fill up a few psi so I've happily retired it to just emergency use.  Well worth the money to get a good inflator so you can check you tires frequently enough.  With the rising cost of gas, even a few psi can make you lose mileage quickly.  This unit basically pays for itself.
B0007ZJ1IK Purchased this since my 09 honda fit had a light on for the tire pressure. Took it to the gas station but the light never went away since their gauge was inaccurate. I used the inflator and it was very easy to use. The hose clamped on and was able to get air and a good reading on the pressure gauge. I put too much air but luckily this has a built in pressure release so I was able to have exactly 33 psi on my tires. Whether that gauge is accurate or not my air pressure light went away. I also use this on my 99 jeep xj with problem. The gauge has rubber around it so it helps protect the glass. This gauge is nice and for the price you can't go wrong.
B0007ZJ1IK I LOVED this filler & gauge, until I started blowing tires. I had a hunch the low price for this gauge was too good to be true. Although the convenience of the filler/deflator is fantastic, the quality of the gauge itself is horrible. After blowing two tires on one recent trip, I used two other quality gauges to verify the pressure. It turned out that my tires were all over inflated by 15-20 PSI. I filled them cold like I always do (either in the evening or the morning), but they were way over inflated. This had never happened to me before. I have two of these inflators (one in the garage and one in the RV), so I pulled out the other one to double-check the gauge on that one. Compared to my other two high-quality gauges, that one was off by almost 10 PSI too. So I threw both of these in the trash and stopped using them. It's a shame too, because I loved these things. It's not worth it if the gauges aren't accurate though.
B0007ZJ1IK Great big clear gauge, my favorite inflator.  Even works on motorcycle tires, very accurate readings, Looks very well made, should last for a few years.
B0007ZJ1IK works as it should..no problem..i always change the air chuck filler valve to the ball push on type..it a matter of choice..easy and cheap to change..don't like the lever action..because 1.its hard to keep on, slips off 2. hard on valve stem if its old 3.wrong angle...its a simple fix..plus the overinflat check valve is a nice feature..the last one i had lasted 5 years and i misplaced it..by the way i am a mechanic of 45 plus years..always looking for tools to make the job easier.
B0007ZJ1IK This is a nice addition to my tool chest. The gauge is accurate and the one hand operation is great. The pressure relief valve comes in handy when you over inflate any thing just make sure you buy the correct female coupler so you can put it to use right away.
B0007ZJ1IK This works very well as a tire inflator. As best I can tell, the gauge is accurate - at least within a few psi of accurate.  The bleed valve is a nice feature.You will need a quick connect.  This one works perfectly -Dixon DCP20B Brass Air Chief Industrial Interchange Quick-Connect Air Hose Fitting, Plug, 1/4\" Coupling x 1/4\" NPT FemaleI had no trouble with the valve connection and the red hose is plenty flexible to get wherever you need it.  This is good for car tires with the big valve, but you will need an adapter for a presta valve.  These work great -Slime 23042 Presta to Schrader Valve AdapterThere is a marking on the handle of this that says 100psi max, but the gauge reads to 150 psi.  I did not have trouble getting my tires to 120 psi with this (using a presta adapter).
B0007ZJ1IK I got this to go with my Craftsman air compressor that I recently got as the compressor only came with a basic inflator for the tires.  I wanted one that had a gauge on it so you could read the tire pressure when you are inflating the tires.  My compressor uses the &#34;M&#34; fittings, so I  bought the Campbell Hausfield kit to go with it to be able to get it to connect to my compressor quick connects.The inflator is fairly simple to use, just put the chuck on the tire stem and pull the lever on the chuck and inflate.  The gauge seems to be fairly accurate as I compared it to a regular tire gauge and the readings were the same.This inflator seems to be good quality and will work for what I need which is occasional use around the house.  It is a decent price at around 14 bucks.
B0007ZJ1IK The inflator is made well.  My only issue is the gauge which is hard to read.  The numbers should be larger.Update 11-2009  This will not work with needles for inflating a basketball.  I have no idea why.
B0007ZJ1IK I bought this because I have trouble getting a good seal on my dual RV back tires valve stem. I have not yet tried it but I think this will work. I have a Sears tire inflator and the chuck's mechanism for making a good seal on the valve stem is the opposite of this inflator. I have clearance problems when I try to use the Sears tire inflator on my dual back tires. I will give this 4 stars. After I tested this on my dual back tires I will revise the rating.I tested this inflator on my car tires. I am glad I bought this. I found out that  my other tire inflator with it's built in gauge was under inflating my tires about 6 psi. The chuck has a good and tight seal on the valve stem. I will give this product 5 stars.The built in spring loaded chuck lock is very simple to use. Press on the lock insert the chuck as far as it goes on the valve stem, release the lock and you have an air tight seal on tire's valve stem. I also like the inflation trigger, one can gradually adjust the tire inflation to it's recommended psi.I tried this on my RV with difficult to access valve stems on the back dual tires. It turns out it could not get a good seal on the valve stem. It seems to me the valve stem on my RV is longer than the hole or the chuck lock could not lock on the valve stem. For my cars it works well.I think the gauge works well. I have the pencil type gauge,which I think is not accurate. As soon as the chuck is tight on the valve stem the tire's inflation psi shows on the gauge. One can then inflate using the inflation trigger or deflate if necessary using the release valve on the handle. Price is good..
B0007ZJ1IK Handy built in gauge so you know exactly how much pressure you are putting in  your tires. I use it for everything from lawnmower to truck and it works accurately and easily.
B0007ZJ1IK Last spring my old tire inflater that I had purchased from Northern Tool years ago finally failed me. I was going to order another one from them but then I found this one on Amazon. I was very impressed with the price. It had more features than my old one and it was lower priced plus it was on sale too. What more could a man ask for?This unit has performed flawlessly for me and I believe it's been six months now that I have used it. I love the gauge on it and it's accuracy. I like the fact that I can lock the air outlet on to the the stem of whatever I am inflating. I love the knob allows you to release air without removing the inflator because you over inflated. I like the trigger like lever that releases the air into the tire.This unit should last for years with proper care. It feels and looks like it is made of quality workmanship and material. It just has a good feel to it to me. I don't know how long this tool would last in the hands of someone who abuses their tools. If a tool user is someone who slams their tools around or runs over them with a car because they were in too big a hurry to put the hose up, this tool may not last that long. Quite honestly if I see someone like that working on any of my stuff I will not go back to that garage again unless I think the mechanic is just having a bad day.All in all I think the average person who does most of their own work at home will really like this tool. I have yet to find any negatives on mine.
B00080OD9Q I received my saw today...money well spent. I opened the box, checked the chain, filled it with oil and went to work!!!  Having read all the  reviews submitted made my decision - an excellent decision it was, from  the selections offered.  Poulan is apparently affiliated with Husqvarna and so you get two great companies giving you a great chainsaw.  Ron
B00080OD9Q I got this saw after an ice-storm in Tulsa caused serious damage to a dozen trees.  It had no problem cutting through a 16\" oak trunk.It's a workhorse that performs well. It tends to drink oil, but I guess that's good for performance and chain life.There's a gizmo that's a screwdriver/wrench for chain removal.  I lost mine because THERE'S NOWHERE ON THE SAW HOUSING TO STASH IT (are you listening Poulan).  Otherwise, chain adjustment and removal are pretty straightforward.
B00080OD9Q I recently had a large Bradford pear tree fall during a bad thunderstorm, and from its size and bushiness, I knew I would need a chainsaw to cut it all up small enough to haul to the curb. In addition, I also had a sick oak tree that needed to go to the curb with it. Although I am not particularly scared of chainsaws, I didn't like the idea of tangling with a \"Texas Chainsaw Massacre\" type of gas saw. I felt I could get more safety and ease of use, and almost as much power (but certainly enough power to meet my needs) with an electric chainsaw. This Poulan seemed to have everything I was looking for, especially with the power category checking in with 4 HP, so I had it overnighted with some oil and had at those trees over the weekend. I was pleasantly surprised at the impressive cutting power of this saw. As soon as I put it to a branch, chips were flying and wood was falling. It helped make quick work of both trees. I actually took the time to read the manual beforehand to be sure I understood the safety mechanisms, including the highly effective automatic chain brake, and I had no trouble operating the saw. When the chain finally slackened and fell off the bar (after almost two hours of fresh-out-of-the-box cutting), I thought I would be able to get it back on in short order. In this area, however, the manual is a little lacking, and it was only when I put the manual aside and used my brain power that I was able to reattach the bar and chain to the saw and make use of the adjusting mechanism to tighten the chain. This saw does use a lot of oil, which is good for the life of the saw, but it makes clean up a bit of a chore with all those oil soaked wood chips in the main housing. Still, once you know how to take apart and put everything back together, the saw is not that difficult to clean up. As 
B00080OD9Q We purchased the first of these in a refurbished unit and did quite a bit of work on it before it started having trouble. The repair was minor but the bench fee was nearly the price of replacing so went ahead and bought a 2nd one - used the chain etc from the first as spares. Pleased with the purchse. For a fraction of the cost of having tree trimmers come out for one visit this gets the job done fast. Strong enough to make quick work of most jobs plus, living in a hurricane prone state means we often need to remove limbs, large branches or even trees that come down during a storm. Rather than wait days or even weeks - this allows us to move about the yard without danger. A must own - great price. reliable product.
B00080OD9Q UPDATE 3/18/2010:Last week the winds hit 60 mph and another tree came down....a 60 foot pine. This saw did it's job, and at the risk ruining the chain, I'm going to try to get through the rootball. In my first review I said you don't need a gas chainsaw, and I meant it, however, when you have no power, a gas chainsaw is a Godsend! (At least, I think it would be). LOL. Even still, I am so happy with this purchase. This is such a great saw, my neighbors used it as well, and they love it, too. The only thing to keep in mind when you are cutting thick pieces of trunk is that you don't want the tree to collapse onto the blade and lock you up. This can happen if you get cocky (and it's easy to do with this saw, because it is soooo capable!).Two weeks ago we had 50+ mph winds and as luck would have it, my neighbors tree fell into my driveway (and SUV). FYI this is MY responsibility, as it is an act of God. This is according to my insurance company. Had I informed my neighbor in writing that his trees were endangering my property, I am told it would have been his responsibility. I just mention this for anyone reading so they can start sending out letters. Anyway, as I said, as luck would have it, and I am a lucky guy, the tree just dented and scratched the SUV, but nobody was hurt. Since my neighbor offered to help clear the tree and was never heard from again I decided to order this chain saw and clear it out myself. Please note the base of the tree is a bit over 22 inches! I ordered this chain saw because it was the biggest I could find, and because I had heard good things about Poulan. I should note that a couple of years ago I used a friends 14 inch chain saw, and another FYI, take breaks every half an hour if you are not used to it, and make sure the chain is sharp, otherwise you could end up damaged the ligaments in your hand/arm. I wore a brace for 6 months. So, back to the review....Because of poor weather, getting home late, etc., I did not have a chance to dispatch the tree until tonight. I can honestly say it took me less than 45 minutes, working in the dark and by myself. This is one awesome chain saw. It is not as heavy as I thought it would be and very easy to handle. Make sure you add enough oil, but be careful as it is very easy to overfill, as I found out. Also be sure to tighten the chain, especially in the beginning as it becomes a bit slack and there is a very real danger that it can come off and really hurt you. This does draw a heck of a lot, so make sure you are using a very good extension cord (12 gauge), and probably not more than 50 feet. As far as kick back, I experience very little, and only when I knew it was comming. For example, when I was about to hit another branch, and even then it was nothing major. The kickback guard is probably not going to do all that much if it really comes back at you hard, but read the booklet, as it tells you how to avoid it. Do not try to use this on small twigs or branches, it will just whip them around. Always wear eye protection, and always pay attention to your stance and be sure the saw is directly in front of you, not on the side. Also, if you are cutting a thick trunk, as I did, it is better to have a friend in case you need to put a wedge in the cut (sometimes the tree can come back on itself and lock up the blade, and that could be VERY dangerous). Always keep it properly oiled and clean and you should be very happy with this. I prefer this over a gas powered chain saw for many reasons. It does not require gas. You don't need to play with a choke. You can turn it on and off easily and quickly. Honestly, you don't NEED a gas chain saw unless you are going to be doing a lot of serious cutting. This will do just about everything a gas chain saw can, unless you need the portability of gas. That is the only reason I can see getting a gas one over this. I am not happy with my purchase, I am thrilled! I can't imagine anyone not loving it.....just remember, read the booklet! and, be careful.
B00080OD9Q Written in the blush of new ownership:  Let's be clear, this is not a go into the forest and cut wood for the winter chainsaw.  I bought this saw to use as a shop tool for preparation of blanks for woodturning.  Having said that, it cuts very well, has sufficient power for the purpose, is not too loud and is well balanced.  It is well made for the duty for which it is designed.  Several have reported that the sprocket gear was plastic.  Mine is metal.  It looks like it might be pretty light, but it is metal.I expect it to hold up well under the use that I intend for it.  I would expect it to hold up for normal home tree maintenance use.  I would not expect it to hold up to days of bucking logs.Cold experience:  Over the past 10 months or so, I have cut about 10 short log sections into chunks and cut some vertically for bowl blanks.  I don't think this constitutes a lot of use.  The painted name on the bar is barely marred.  The chain is still quite sharp.  Today I was cutting a log vertically which is the easiest cut for a saw as you are cutting with the grain.  Chain is nice and sharp, everything is great, except suddenly the motor is running and the chain is still.  Fast forward through a lot of diagnostic stuff to learn that the sprocket in the inside of the saw is in fact plastic and has in fact melted.  I was looking at the outside sprocket when I said it was metal.My money was completely wasted.  This saw is junk as a number of other reviewers stated.  The best part of the whole thing was when I called Poulan customer service at 3:55 PM Central time and was told that the \"general questions\" section was closed, their hours being from 8:00 to 4:30 Central time.  I can't speak for customer service but their engineering department is clearly closed.Avoid this purchase.
B0008IT0GE This Gilmour brass quick connector is made in China.  As with other Gilmour products it has a warning that it contains a chemical known by the state of California to cause cancer. That is nothing new about China using dangerous chemicals. On the good news side the parts of the connector that are handled have a rubber cover which hopefully is safe.I have been using the plastic quick connectors and they have worked well but I just wanted to see how a brass one would perform. The main difference that I have noticed is that the plastic ones are easier to connect and disconnect. However, both types provide satisfactory performance and do not leak. The main difference is that the plastic Gardena connectors that I have been using cost about half the amount of the brass Gilmour.  The Gardena connectors are made in Germany.
B0008IT0GE i was skeptical about these, but i tried them anyway.  glad i did.i was worried that they may affect the water pressure somehow, and my worries were unfounded.  these things are great.  i'm using them for everything.the only problem is that you will realize how many of them you actually need, and you'll buy a lot of them.FYI, i was able to pick up the male+female connector set at lowe's for around $6 (HD doesn't carry this brand).  you may want to check there first before ordering here.  but as far as the product itself goes, it's top notch.
B0008IT0GE Chunk those cheap plastic connectors and save tempers.  I could have used several sets of these years ago; however, today one is sufficient for present needs. I use teflon tape to assure 100% drip-less action and now can disconnect our hose with ease and speed.  Gilmour makes life so much simpler when all parts work well and last far longer than the plastic ones.  Additionally, this connector set is a no issue set.  Put it on the bib and forget about it.  When winter comes it will stay in place and be ready for use in the spring.  I highly recommend and will buy another as soon as I get a new connector elsewhere.
B0008IT0GE I have one of these on each spray nozzle that I own so it is easy to change nozzles in a few seconds by popping one off and another on.  If a rubber washer is used, there is no leaking from this connector.  It is extremely easy to use.  I also recommend a piece of teflon tape around the threaded areas to prevent a corrosion/ chemical reaction and fusion when the different metals touch water and each other.There are two kinds of these connectors by Gilmour.  The real brass connectors are excellent and get a 5 star.  The \"metal\" connectors are horrible and get a 1 star.  I did get some from Lowes, and there seems to be a problem with corrosion since they are \"metal\" (aluminum) and not brass.  The problem here is over a small amount of time (months), water hardness deposits and corrosion prevent the connector from locking into place with the female.  The smoothness of operation that it started out with, becomes rough, and a struggle over time. STAY AWAY FROM THE \"METAL\" ONES AND ONLY GO WITH THE TRUE BRASS ONES!!!I found an interchangeable solid brass connector like this at Ace HardwareACE BRASS QUICK CONNECTOR SET, also made by Gilmour that even has an automatic shutoff built in!  I also give that one a 5 star rating because you do not even have to shut off the hose to change between nozzles.  You can use regular Gilmour males with Ace Hardware females interchangeably. If you are going to fill buckets, I recommend this regular Gilmour brass connector, as opposed to that one, since that has the automatic shutoff feature which won't let you fill the bucket without a spray nozzle.
B0008IT0GE These are not brass.  They are made from cheap pot metal (recycled mix of aluminums) covered with a thin brass plating. (The similar looking Orbit brand is made this way too.)  They will work well for a while, long enough to lure you into writing a great review for them, but they will eventually fuse to the real brass fitting on your hose and your faucet and may not be removable without ruining both your hose and the faucet on your house.  Before they get to that state, as the metal deteriorates, they will begin to dribble, so you will be tempted to tighten them further, making later removal impossible without damaging your hose and faucet.  Since the metal is aluminum, not brass, the inserted piece will scratch a bit each time you insert it or detach it, and over time this accumulation of wear will cause it to leak at the fitting.  The black plastic over the fittings will twist and fail to grab the knurled metal beneath it, so you may have to use a wrench to install.  Again, these will work very well for a year or so, and after that you are cuing up for a big problem.  Gilmore alleges a guarantee on these, but other reviews have said they do not respond if you call them on it, so your only recourse would be if Amazon would cover it, which is unlikely at the point where these will start giving you trouble.  Either way, they aren't going to pay for your ruined hose fitting and faucet.The good news is that there is a better set available on Amazon, also made by Gilmore, and unless they have cheapened the design or materials since I last purchased them, they are far superior: Gilmour 09QCGT 2-Piece Green Thumb Brass Quick Connector Set for Hose
B0008IT0GE I have about 5 sets of these for each hose at my house as well as my Gilmour foam gun, AR pressure washer, CR Spotless, and a couple of hose nozzles.  The brass is strong, the mechanics are crisp, and the rubber gives excellent impact protection.  The only thing you will be replacing from this equation is the o-rings every year or so, depending on use.  This set will make your life a whole lot easier, and no more struggling in trying to loosen or tighten the hose from the house.
B0008JGSCM Forget about the cheaper plastic varieties - this is the one to get.. no plastic on this one at all and has held up well so far.Once you repair a hose, it will never be the same, but if you have to squeeze some more life out of your hose, this would be the coupling to use.
B0008JGSCM Man, are garden hose attachment departments at the box stores dismal, filled with plastic Chinese junk. Not a quality fitting to be found. Luckily, Amazon has a wider choice and this Gilmour coupling is of high quality.The threaded part is nicely machined and the clamp is a heavy zing alloy. In fact, once on the hose you will notice that heaviness. Should last a long time and when that hose is finally replaced, years later someone will find this fitting in a shed, or buried in some weeds, and use it again, good as new. I know this because I found a couple of brass hose nozzles buried in the yard, fixed them up and they are as good as new, probably over 50 years old, maybe more.Hecho en China....as with lots of brass stuff now. Brass has lead in it, laws here are strict about lead pollution, likely not so much in China. As long as pollution is ok to export, this is what will happen.The Gilmour coupling seems to be the same as the Nelson one, but is quite a bit cheaper. You get quite a bit of heftiness and weight for your money but really, how much should even the best hose fitting cost? Two stars lost for that.
B0008JGSCM I needed to replace a leaky connection.  I had gone down the plastic route before and it is a fine line between tightening it enough so it will NOT leak, but at the same time, NOT over tightening it so that the plastic does not strip out.  It is a very fine line.  Then I found this rascal and those concerns are history!
B0008JGSCM I expect this nozzle to out-last my hose and reuse it several times over. Also, being made of brass, and aluminum my hose nozzle doesn't get stuck on the thread like those plastic ones that expand when it's been out in the sun too long!
B0008JGSCM In the past I've always limited my search for hose couplings to local hardware stores.  That was a mistake.  After searching Amazon and finding this highly rated product, I decided to give it a try.  Boy is this a heck of a lot better than what I've been getting.Installation is a cinch and once you have it screwed on, it isn't coming off.The threaded part of this coupling is nicely machined and screws together nicely with other attachments.  After I tried one of these, I immediately bought more and used them to replace the couplings on my other hoses.
B0008JGSCM This coupling worked well.  It's easy to install and so far I have no leaks.  It's sturdy, much better than the plastic coupling I had purchased earlier.
B0008JGSCM Hose leaked, about a foot from the end, cut it off, slapped this baby on.  No leaks.  Sprayer went on and everything works as expected.  Might want to have something on hand to lubricate the inside of the hose before installing.  Was an extremely tight fit on my hose, and be careful about twisting to get it seated, as the threads are fairly sharp and managed to open a few spots on two fingers when it slipped a little.
B0008JGSD6 Rather than 12 different patterns this is more the more you squeeze the more you get. Last nozzle we bought last less than a year and it had rusted solid to the hose so this one I applied blue grease in hopes it doesn't rust together.
B0008JGSD6 As soon as you put this in your hand you will kick yourself for not having bought it sooner.  Like many, I bought $1, $5, $7 nozzles that lasted all of one season.  They are just cheap junk.  We forget about how often we replace them because they are cheap at the time.  This particular model is their heavy duty, which should last though hot summers and cold winters.  It has brass components, a nice sturdy feel and is rated for both extreme hot and cold water conditions.  It attaches easily and does not drip at all during use.  A small depression of the handle gives you a gentle fan while a full depression gives you a powerful stream.  Compare this one with that cheapo you have now and you will clearly see the difference.  It is certainly money well spent.
B0008JGSD6 Ideal for commercial or industrial useInsulated molded grip for spraying hot or cold waterMale hose threaded front for attaching accessoriesBrass head insert for maximum resistance to extremely hot waterMade in USAMine says made in CHINA, average quality, not worth 8.00 though.
B0008JGSD6 I am glad I purchased this nozzle. This is a quality product that feels well made and sprays like its internal components are top grade. In a day when things are often cheaper and worse, here is a nozzle that is well made, feels solid in your hand and puts out a great spray.
B0008JGSD6 It is getting harder and harder to find nozzles like this that have infinately variable spray, ranging from a fan to a steady stream just by squeezing the lever.  Most new ones require you to twist a nozzel on the end...which is a waste of time when washing a car.  I have used this before.  I have 3 worn out ones in my garage.  I was happy to see  they have a lifetime warranty which I did not know.  The picture does not show it, but it has a nozzel shield surrounding the threads on the spray end.  Helpful in case it falls up against a fender!  Works great.
B0008JGSD6 I have bought so many hose nozzles over the years, from cheap to not-so-cheap.  They last a few seasons and then get clogged, leak or just plain break.  This Gilmour nozzle feels like it will last forever.  Nice solid feel, easy to use, good control over spray and velocity.  The threaded front is a bonus.  I add a &#34;water breaker&#34; to turn it into a gentle shower head for watering potted plants, without slowing me down by restricting the water volume output.  I can also screw on a pressure nozzle for a more focused spray and still have the pistol grip on/off.  Really happy with this purchase!
B0008JGSD6 It took a minute to decide how to adjust the spray but once I found that it was great!  this is a precise spraying nozzle.  And i've tried a bunch.  this one appears to hold up well and wish I had bought it sooner.  a good productWell made for the money.
B0008JGSD6 Nozzles exactly like this (except for the plastic cover) have been around for at least 40 years, manufactured in a dozen companies, and sold under a wide variety of brand names---for a very good reason---they are the best design.  They are perfectly and easily controllable, durable, and don't leak.  Functionally speaking, you can't buy a better designed garden hose nozzle.IMPROVEMENT ON A CLASSIC> The plastic grip cover and plastic handle provide insulation if very hot or very cold water is flowing through the nozzle.> The larger grip is more comfortable> The plastic lever is rust-proof.  Unfortunately, most recent \"classic\" garden nozzles of this type are made with cheap, poorly chrome-plated, levers which rust easilyNote the little thumb screw at the end of the piston can be used to adjust the type of spray when the handle is maximally squeezed.  If you wish, you can tighten the screw (you may need pliers to do so) back from full unfocused flow to the tightest stream (with the handle lever fully depressed) for long throws--that makes long throws a little easier.One reviewer complains that there is no \"medium\" strength, e.g., for filling buckets.  What do you expect?  The actual \"problem\", as far as that reviewer was concerned, is the nozzle is \"too good\"---it delivers full pressure, at all but the tightest mist setting.  Although it does have a \"closed\" position, this is a nozzle, NOT a valve. If you want a VALVE to reduce the PRESSURE, then install aMelnor 390S Hose Shut-OfforGilmour Brass Garden Hose Connector With Shut-Off Valve 03Vjust before the nozzle.  Or, close your faucet part way.  Alternatively, to fill a bucket, loosen the thumb screw, then \"open 'er up\" (squeeze the handle lever all the way)---the result is is maximum unfocused flow, which is perfect for very quickly filling a bucket, etc.CAVEATSHere in the tropics (South Florida)--the year-round heat is hard on all garden tools.  After a year or two, the zinc metal body can seize on your hose and be difficult to unscrew.  I suggest greasing the screw threads with silicon grease when you install it on the hosePermatex 22058 Dielectric Tune-up Grease - 3 oz.If you don't have silicon grease on hand, buy a tube---it terrific for improving electrical connections and refurbishing rubber items, and even for lubricating things such as this.  While you are at it, lubricate all your hose connections (both the threads and the seals) to prevent leaking and to make it easy to screw-on and -off the hoses and accessories.Why not petroleum-based grease?  Petroleum-based grease damages rubber seals.  However even petroleum grease is better than no grease (besides most hose gaskets are now plastic, not rubber)After 2 or 3 years of abuse the action can begin to get stiff, presumably caused by internal corrosion (or the original grease having deteriorated or lost).  Ideally, keep the nozzle dry---at least don't keep it in a muddy puddle, or half-buried in acidic soil.  It is good idea to lubricate the piston with grease when you start to notice it getting stiff. (With the water off, squeeze the handle to expose the brass rod.  Apply a liberal amount of grease to the piston).  If the nozzle is very stiff, take it off the hose, spray it heavily with WD-40, let it soak for 15 minutes or so---that will probably adequately loosen it up, but is not a permanent solution---you still need to grease it.But those are the extremes---reasonably well taken care of (or at least not abused) a nozzle can last 10 years or more.ALTERNATIVES> Folks with arthritis or weak grips may be happier with traditional brass nozzles, such asDramm 12380 Heavy-Duty Brass Adjustable Hose Nozzle.  These are virtually indestructable, and hold any particular spray pattern until you change it.> High quality all plastic versions are available for use around salt water.Gilmour Salt Water and Marine Nozzle 474S> There are cheap plastic versions you can get for $1--$2 in \"bargain bins\", which are a good deal for the price, but are not nearly as durable, and through an Amazon vendor when you add shipping your total cost is the same as a zinc or high quality plastic sprayer.> There are versions with \"select-a-pattern\" spray heads on the front, which sabotages the virtues of the basic design, reducing the sprayer body into a mere valve  I find constantly having to rotate the head to select the 1 or 2 spray patterns I use to be very annoying.  For example (not recommended)Gilmour Pistol Grip Nozzle 327 Teal/Red> Several models combine the full-action of the basic design with a \"select-a-pattern\" spray head.  These are worthy of serious consideration.Gilmour Select-A-Spray Comfort Grip Nozzle 594 Black/TealorGilmour Select-A-Spray Metal Nozzle 584.  The select-a-pattern makes several tasks easier, such as filling a bird-bath, and finely misting very delicate plants.NERD CORNER:  The zinc body corrodes through electrolytic action.  I.e., the zinc will \"sacrifice\" itself (and corrode) to protect iron or any other metal of lower electrolytic potential which it is touching, or with which it is sharing a conducting solution (such as a water-saturated acidic soil), or salt-water .  So try to keep it dry and away from unpainted, ungalvanized steel, or salt water.  (Galvanized steel is iron coated with zinc for this very purpose, to prevent the iron from rusting--not as a barrier like paint, but rather by electrolytic action).What about those other pretty, fancy, mostly plastic sprayer nozzles (which cost 3x--4x more) that you see at the garden center?---they don't work nearly as well, and won't last nearly as long.  I know this for a fact---my wife keeps buying them---indeed we have a bin of discarded (mostly still functional) \"pretty\" sprayer nozzles, which have \"fallen out of favor\" for various reasons.
B0008JGSD6 As you may know, there are a lot of junk gardening tools around.  This particular nozzle is well-constructed, has adjustable spray and a keep-on lever, and does not leak.  That's good enough for me.
B0008JGSD6 Threads not good and I had to toss it in the junk pile.Saving it for a crooked hose thread where it might workwith a force crank. Be careful. If buying retail look for damaged orimproperly mfg threads.
B0009J5NRW this took less than a minute to assemble and its holding all the tools I needed it 
B0009J5NRW I had a little corner in my carport where tools and other items seemed to gather, and it was getting junky looking.  I placed them in the tool rack, and it looks nice and neat, and kind of cool, too.  This little caddy actually held quite a few tools!
B0009J5NRW My husband loves this. I thought it was a little expensive, but it really does keep everything together in one spot. We even have our edger on there, and everything fits nicely. Its a thick, heavy plastic, but looks nice.
B0009J5NRW I am glad this rack has casters which makes it easier to move around. The roof of my tool shed is low and I have to move it out from under the roof to store and remove tools. It is an excellent accessory to contain a number of tools in a small place.
B0009J5NRW I purchased 2 of these for my landscaping business to try to organize tools that get used often but not everyday. It holds a lot, but is top heavy. If it had a wider base or could be fastened down it would be great. I think it would be fine for a homeowner to use for a few miscellaneous tools.
B0009J5NRW The rack was easy to assemble, it rolls with total ease, and is sturdy.  It offers a great way to organize those things that otherwise clutter the garage.  I don't have to look and dig to find them anymore.  It's Rubbermaid so it should last a long time.  The rack is a winner.
B0009J5NRW I bought this organizer to clean up the stacks of tools I had leaning against every wall in my shed.  It did the perfect job.  My husband even commented on the great choice I made.  Very durable and sets up in just a minute.
B0009J5NRW Normally, I would give a cheap plastic item like this two or three stars for a price tag of around $50, but I have made an exception for this wonderful product here. If there was a king of cheap plastic products, I suppose rubber made should have the crown.When I first un-boxed this item prior to assembly, I was quite concerned about how stable it would be. After the 10 second assembly (2 seconds of looking at the picture on the box and 8 seconds to then put it together) I was quite surprised how study it really is. As long as I don't toss/yank my tools around when I am storing/removing them, I would be the least bit surprised to see this thing last a life time.Did I mention yet how nicely all my tools are organized in the garage as apposed to the previous pyramid stacking in the corner. Before to get to one tool I would have to move two or more items, now I can just reach and grab the one I want. That is something worth paying more for.All that being said I give it five stars. Although I believe this item could be cheaper, being that it may last a very long time I can understand Rubbermaid wanting a bit more profit for it. Also you would be hard pressed to find it cheaper than this.
B0009J5NRW The best benefit is that I can roll it out to the yard and have all my stuff right there - no more walking back and forth to the garage ort trying to carry too much at once!  I like the wheels it comes with - they are not a cheap hollow plastic that easily snaps and they actually roll over the gravel. They will need to be sprayed with WD40 from time to time to keep them nice.  I fit all my handled yard tools on it, and find it just as easy to access tools as the kind of thing that hangs on the wall. If it had a large handle on the side, like a push-cart has it would be 100% perfect for pushing it around as hanging a towel or two on. Just a thought, manufacturer.....
B0009PUQAK Got tired of buying all those little cans for 3+ bucks each, so got this to hookup the 20lb tank I got from Lowe's to my newCuisinart CGG-200 All-Foods 12,000-BTU Portable Outdoor Tabletop Propane Gas Grill.  Works great.  No problems at all.So when grilling at home, we'll be using this.  For camping or tailgating or anything, we'll go with the little cans.It all seems so obvious...so if you're in the same situation - get this and save money.  It works, and you don't need any extra adapters.
B0009PUQAK Not much to review here.  Only thing it does is let you use a full size propane tank with grills that use the smaller portable propane tanks.It works, and is long enough to reach.
B0009PUQAK I love my new  trition camp stove and this connector  works perfectly. The first time I set it up I had to redo it a few times to get all the connections correct. The key was the stove part, it has to be screwed all the way in and pointed away from the front of the stove.
B0009PUQAK I got this for our Cuisinart portable grill. For home use it's fantastic because I don't have to rely on the little bottles and when they are going to run out. I just hook it up to my large propane tank. When I take the grill out it still works with the little propane bottles. Fantastic deal and the price is reasonable.
B0009PUQAK Had this for over a year now. Bought it to connect my Cuisinart CGG-200 to Blue Rhino Propane tank. On a full tank, this hose works great. Recently, the pressure seems to have dropped resulting in weak flames. Since it was working previously, I didn't suspect the hose and thought it was my tank. (but switching tank didn't help). I thought it was the grill inlet or burner being blocked but both appeared to be fine too after inspection.I deduced something could be blocking in the hose. Air/water/whatever? I never did figure that out but my only option was to find a way to clear the hose passageway. I turned on the grill and let it burn (irregular and weak flames). While burning, I turned off the propane tank and let the grill burn up the remaining gas in the hose until the flame died. I then turn on the propane tank and let it fill up the hose again and repeatedly ignite the burner. This approach works! So was it a lousy hose or was it due to elements caused by the varying weather since my grill is out in the yard 24x7? Anyhow, clearing the hose appears to solve the problem for me multiple times.If the hose is still working, why then did I rate it as 3-star? It's because I don't think a propane hose should require any maintenance at all. Just like a garden hose, it should behave as expected and not require workaround. I'm planning to get a different brand hose and see if such problem persist. If it doesn't, this rating should drop to 2-star.***9/28/2013***Hose still working good despite the intermittent weak flames issue. It appears my 'clear the hose' method resolved the issue consistently each time it occurs. I'm deducing it is the combination of changing weather (my grill is outdoor all the time) and long period of non-usage that caused the issue. In all fairness, since the hose is operating fine for more than 2 years now, I'm bumping the rating from 3 to 4 stars.
B0009YJ2RY I picked this feeder because I wasn't sure any birds would find my feeder, and I don't have a ton of disposable income.I'm happy to say that a squirrel family has adopted the feeder as its own personal buffet. It's my fault, I hung it too close to the house, but it's all I've got, really. So I watch the squirrels, who eat a LOT of food. But! Today I saw actual birds happily chirping and snacking at it!The feeder is plastic, so I imagine it'll scratch/fade/oxidize over time. Seed spills out the holes at the perches when I'm filling it, which is a drag. But that's me being picky. For the price, it's a terrific feeder!
B0009YJ2RY Very poorly made, the squirrels ripped this feeded apart several times until I just gave up. The squirells chew apart the plastic and have even tore the bottom out to get the seed.
B0009YJ2RY I have had this feeder for about 5 years now, it has never fallen apart. I don't know what the other people are talking about-wobbling-if its hung on a tree or pole hook it swings a bit but how does a hanging bird feeder wobble? Anyway its not the best made on the market, but the birds seem to like it. It is a pain to take apart to clean and it should really have metal perches instead of plastic. The squirrels have gnawed off two of the perches since they hang upside down and eat the Safflower seeds (even tho they are not supposed to like it)I am ready to replace it now-but will be looking for a feeder with the metal perches instead.
B0009YJ2RY I like  this feeder very much seems like there are a lot more birds coming around with it . More birds can eat at one time now
B0009YJ2RY What a bargain...Garden Song 480-12 Classic Bird Feeder...7.98 ...I bought three of them....I am building a bird sanctuary and I am trying several different types!
B0009YJ2RY First, this was given to be as a gift by my kids, and initially I loved it, and I thought that because of the design, I wouldn't have all the problems I'd had with other feeders. To be fair to Garden Song, the design looked like it would serve birds better than all other critters. But then, still sticking to design, it's not one of the sturdier feeders. The plastic is indeed cheap.Now, if you live in North America, you have rats - usually Norwegian Wood Rats. They may live down the block from you, but if you put up a feeder, you're going to have your own daily (and sometimes nocturnal) visitors. These aren't cute little mice carrying disease and eating the insulation off your wiring. These are wood rats carrying disease and eating insulation off your cable TV wiring and sometimes nesting in your attic or crawl space.I thought with just little spokes sticking out for the birds to perch on that (and the way I hung it) would discourage squirrels and rats. Face facts: NOTHING discourages squirrels and rats. Now squirrels and mice may be cute, but BIG rats, no. And all are destructive and reproduce like crazy. I moved the Garden Song as far away from our one maple tree as I could. Turns out that rats can jump and are as acrobatic as squirrels.This is for the birds, and as much as I love birds, I've had to shelve this feeder until I can find a way to make it rat proof.I emphasize that this isn't Garden Song's fault. ALL bird feeders are like grain bins and their attraction is irresistible. In fairness, I'm knocking one star off for the construction and nothing for its attraction to vermin.IF ANY OF YOU HAVE COME UP WITH A SOLUTION, I'D REALLY LIKE TO HEAR IT. I'd love to put this feeder back up.
B0009YJ2RY I got it for the birds, and so far the birds really like it.  Seems to hold up in our sometimes very inclimate weather with no problems.
B0009YJ2RY I think this feeder is just adorable and the finches love it. Although it is made from plastic it is very sturdy and the perches \"lock in\" to the tube...generating a very solid feel.  The \"comfort perches\" are amazing...the little guys feed longer from this feeder than any other, and the finches who are waiting for \"their turn\", sing up a storm of sweet melodies in anticpation.  The design allows for the seed to stay put without spewing all over and wasting expensive seed.  The size of the 6 little feeder holes discourage larger birds (doves, pigeons) from stealing the seed from the \"little ones\". The screw on cap makes it easy to fill and clean.  I live in Las Vegas so I will be careful not to leave it in the blazing summer sun. I highly recommend this feeder for bird lovers/watchers.
B0009YJ2RY Birds don't like this feeder and have never used it to feed from despite my moving it to various locations in my attempt to get them to feed from it. Useless!
B0009YJ2RY I have this feeder placed right outside my window of my ground floor apartment. I originally got it for the cats' entertainment, and am glad I did.I originally had a feeder bell hanging from the second floor apartment's balcony, but decided it wasn't enough.I purchased this feeder for the sparrows and used the cheapest bird feed available. After I switched to sunflower seeds only I am now getting sparrows, finches and starlings. The down side being that the perches were not designed for starlings so they have to reach around to one of the other holes to get their food.Anymore, I can get 5 or so on it at once with two or three hanging out on the chain it hangs from waiting in line.I really love this little feeder and have had it since December '08.  Never once had a problem with squirrels, but it may be because of the way I have it set up.
B0009YJ2RY I purchased two of these with the hopes of feeding a few of the neighborhood birds. I knew instantly this was a mistake, but thought I would give it a try. One lasted only a few days at best. A larger bird actually knocked off the plastic holder that keeps the food in and it all poured straight to the ground. Entertaining to watch and the birds all thought it was great to eat the seed off the ground.  The second one lasted a little longer - a few months perhaps, but again, the same thing happened. Food everywhere and a useless feeder.  I am back again to find myself two new feeders for this year and thought it would be wise to advise all of you of my experience.  Sorry to have to give it a one star, but I can't find a reason to even go for two.
B0009YJ2RY This is a lightweight, easy to clean, plastic bird feeder with a decent capacity. OK, the squirrels make light work of the contents but then you just need to put it out of their reach.
B000A0VOD2 We've been using earlier versions of Deer Off with regular success in protecting lilies and hostas from deer for some time. The Deer Off III version contains the same basic repellent ingredients (putrescent egg products and pepper extracts) as its predecessors, and provides similar protection.You'll want to avoid contact with the liquid in this container. While it won't make you gag, rotten eggs are a principal ingredient, and it certainly isn't a scent you'll relish contact with.Now, about the battery-powered sprayer. In short, it's rather silly. Mine did not work with batteries it shipped with. The motor ran, but didn't deliver any fluid to the approximately three feet of tubing that extends from the container. The enclosed instructions suggested replacing the OEM batteries with new ones. This solved the problem, and I was soon spraying with battery-powered delight. Which leads to the question: is this necessary? I think not. Havahart has conventional trigger-sprayer version of this product in 16, 32 and 128 ounce sizes: consider one of these instead and stop worrying about the batteries.The included instructions for the battery sprayer deserve a prize for one of the most obvious safety tips ever presented: \"Never place the nozzle in your mouth\".  Always good advice when the nozzle is connected to a container full of liquified rotten eggs!
B000A0VOD2 Havahart DO64MS Deer Off II Deer, Rabbit, and Squirrel Ready-to-Use Repellent with Battery Powered Sprayer is a product that should probably be used in conjunction with other methods to ward off deer.I had mixed results after a couple weeks of testing on petunias, ornamental grasses and around my vegetable garden.  The smell is not horrible and once it's dry you can barely smell it. Be sure and spray away from clothing as the scent tends to stick to cloth, especially in humid weather.After applying this to my various above mentioned plants, I had some areas where the deer stayed completely away and other areas where they ignored the Deer Off and just ate whatever they wanted anyway. This could be because we're in a drought and I'm watering these areas keeping things healthy and perhaps the deer see moist, succulent greens WITH deer off as a better option than the dryer, less moist things they're naturally feeding on otherwise. But, given that they've stayed away from about half of my plants, I'd say that in a good year this repellent may work fairly well.The battery-powered sprayer is a nice novelty, but I would be fine with a hand sprayer as well. Either/or.  Three stars.
B000A0VOD2 I live in an area where people leave their livestock to roam around. There are a lot of goats, sheep, donkeys that generally roam around and find their way home at night.The free roaming livestock make it difficult to have flowers, shrubs or plants around the house. You can be sure a goat will pass by and make short work of your flowers. The alternative had bee to build mesh wire fences around flowers. Although this was not meant for them i decided to try it out. Worked like magic!Stray livestock no longer come near my flowers or plants. they don't even bother tasting them. One whiff of the smell and off they go. I don't know how long the smell will last though. It's been working ok for the past week. The battery powered spayer is also easy to operate and makes the application a lot easier that if it had been manually powered. Don't know about deer, rabbits or squirrels, but if you have your neighbors livestock disturbing your flowers, this will surely keep them away,
B000A0VOD2 Deer? (check)Rabbits? (check)Bears? (check)Turkeys? (check)Squirrels? (check)Alligators? (not yet and they don't care about our trees or veggies anyways)One month and a couple of strong rain showers later the rabbits are back and we saw some deer. One application appears to be effective at least for a couple of weeks for as long as the weather stays dry. I will grant this product 4 stars (I like it) because there can't be a universal and permanent solution to wild life invasions for those of us who insist on living in areas claimed by wild creatures as their own. I like it because is one non-violet way of keeping the unwanted away from places we want to protect. It's not a 'five-star' because the marketing claims of 3-month effectiveness are wildly exaggerated and because the price is a little bit at the high end.This is how it worked for us - took notes throughout the test:BEFORE APPLICATION: Rabbits seen almost daily, deer come and go as they please because the dogs' invisible fence prevents them from protecting the area.WEEK ONE: Weather was dry. Saw a bunny, no deer.WEEK TWO: Weather was hot, mostly dry, a few light showers, one thunderstorm. No rabbits or deer.WEEK THREE: Weather normal, a couple of showers. Spotted a couple of rabbits in the evening.WEEK FOUR: Back to the 'before application' state.The attached sprayer makes it easy to apply the repellent and, for as long as you're not moving against the wind it appears to be safe to spray without a face mask or any other kind of protection. Don't forget to shake.
B000A0VOD2 This really works to keep the critters away from your garden.It's particularly effective against the deer who eat your flowers/plants.The battery-powered sprayer makes it easy and quickly to spray the contents onto your plants. The other side effect is that dogs and cats will also be repelled by this, so you won't have the neighborhood pets peeing on your flower bed :)
B000A0VOD2 I got this repellent primarily to keep squirrels away from around our bird feeder. I paid close attention to see if the product was actually working and I did see a s difference. Squirrels were still around but they would not come close to the area I treated with the repellent. The effect lasted for a few days (which is expected) so I am pleased with this repellent.The battery powered sprayer works well and it makes it a lot easier to spray. I do recommend this product.
B000A0VOD2 We have experienced both squirrels and rabbits in our yard last season, and I picked this up to prevent the same from happening this season.What impressed me is this is not poison to pets, since we have three small chihuahuas and two cats who are at risk in our yard. Instead, it uses egg to make it smell like something dead, and capsaisin to make it taste awful. So when you spray it, it is safe to spray directly on the plants that you are using in your garden.In fact, this is approved by the OMRI as an organic product, so it can be used safely!The sprayer is a bit cumbersome, but it is still a lot easier to use than a simple spray bottle and allows it to be sprayed over a larger area. This larger bottle covers up to 1000 square feet, and will more than cover my anticipated garden area for this spring.
B000A0VOD2 (Original Text: April 20, 2013)I hate how my spring flowers are devoured by hungry rabbits as they emerge in the spring and I was very happy that none of the protected plants have been gnawed on this year.The \"Deer-off\" spray is easy to apply and the big bottle I have of it will last me the entire season and maybe even more.I was afraid that it would smell ghastly when I sprayed it on my plants, but I didn't notice much of an odor at all. I don't have a problem with deer eating my plants, so I can't say how suitable it is for that, but it seems to work very well for repelling rabbits. The only thing I've needed to do is to refresh the spray on the plants after a rainfall.The only negative thing I have to say is that the included batteries were completely dead and I needed to insert 4 fresh alkaline batteries.Update: Aug, 2013I've been spritzing my garden vegetables over the summer and it's done a good job keeping the critters at bay. I'm pretty happy :)
B000A0VOD2 We were anxious to try this product because we have been having a huge problem with animals in our garden. The directions were easy to follow and the spray nozzle was very easy to use. However, the results were mixed. The rabbits and squirrels seemed to stay away, but the Deer Off had absolutely no effect on the deer that were eating our veggies. We used the product as suggested, but still the deer were getting a feast. I would not use this one again.
B000A0VOD2 First, be sure to read all the instructions on the sheet folded into a tiny packet and tucked in the side pocket with the sprayer.  Then, shake the container well (remove the side-hanger for the spray handle first) as settled particles will plug the spray pick-up tube.  (If you forget as I did, I used an old plastic milk jug with plain water in it, inserted the sprayer pick-up tube and ran it until it finally cleared.)  Replace the side storage pocket before or after spraying... it is a very well thought-out device to store the spray nozzle/handle. The battery-powered spray nozzle is a nice feature; much easier on fingers not having to keep squeezing the sprayer.  Plus, it is possible to take the spray wand off a bigger spray container (or buy a spray wand) and exchange the tip to reach farther if needed.  I have had squirrels using the top of my board fence to gain access to my awning and roof, as well as run down the length of the fence top teasing my dog.  It would just sit there on top of the fence chattering and driving the dog nuts!  I sprayed all areas where the squirrel could gain access to the top of the fence and all along the top of the fence.  No sign of any squirrel since.  Thank you for a product that finally works, even after a couple storms with rain.7/9/2012:  Saw a squirrel on the fence top yesterday so it is time to re-apply.  It lasted a good month which is nearly ... no, it is ...  a miracle.  I've never had this type of product last more than a day or two at most.  I love it!!!
B000A0VOD2 We live out in the country, and my wife is an avid gardener.  We also have a roaming band of deer, usually 3-4, as well as rabbits, I've personally seen 3 at once in our yard.  We don't have many squirrels, I guess the cats and coyotes take care of them..  We have experimented with bloodmeal, and a variety of other home remedies that haven't worked very well.This product however, has worked quite well.  We have not seen any rabbits/deer, or prints from either in any of the gardens we have applied it to.  The battery sprayer works well, I'm not sure it's really necessary for the size of our gardens, I probably wouldn't pay extra for it.  I will purchase the concentrate in the future, as the pre-made mixture will not last a season, and seems to come at a premium price.
B000A0VOD2 I've always loved feeding squirrels and birds in my back yard.  That is, until this year, when we adopted two puppies who seem to be BORN squirrel chasers and bird killers (Yorkshire terrier/poodle mixes). As soon as this proclivity evidenced itself last Spring, I had to stop feeding. The squirrels didn't cotton to their new status, and started munching on our pecan tree instead.  Not the nuts.  The TREE.  Unfortunately, this wasn't evident until midsummer, when even large branches started to die.  They'd skinned the bark off large portions of the tree's large branches & by the time we saw evidence of it, our arborist said it was much too late to save. A producing pecan tree has been reduced to a small, sad pile of barbecue wood.I wish I'd found Deer Off sooner; I think we could have saved the little Pecan, because IT WORKS. I'm using it now to discourage the one surviving squirrel from being caught and mauled by the dogs.  I've sprayed it along the top of a wooden fence and into several crape myrtles that were his favorite perches.  So far, so good.  He's staying in the front yard, except for the occasional barking he does at the dogs from the untreated roofline.  And the neighborhood is quiet again.  Peace reigns : )It's easy to spray, thanks to the battery-powered spray head & it even comes with 4 AA batteries so it's ready to go as soon as you are. I was surprised that this didn't have an offensive odor (to humans)--even while spraying, I didn't notice a particularly strong odor, even though the ingredients include \"putrescent eggs.\"  But the squirrels and the dogs did.  It doesn't seem to bother the birds.  I applied one treatment exactly one month ago today & it's still working. If you've got a squirrel problem, give this a try.  It's working for me; highly recommended for its ease of use, quick application, and effectiveness.5/24/13 Update:  I got lazy and stopped applying this, since it seemed that all was quiet on the Western Front.  RIP Bobby Joe Squirrel, dispatched by the Tornado Twins.  I feel guilty : (
B000A0VOD2 I have family in New Jersey that have been struggling with an ever-increasing deer population for decades. This provided the perfect location to give Deer Off II a try. Given how ineffective other products have been, I wasn't expecting much when I first applied the spray. But after just one use, I could see the difference.Now, after six months, I can say that Deer Off II is more effective than any other commercially prepared product that I have tried - not sure why since the ingredients - egg and pepper - seem to be similar. The odor is noticeable but not nearly as strong as I was expecting and less offensive than most.What really made a difference to me was the ease of use. Deer Off II comes with a battery-powered sprayer, which makes application a breeze. The sprayer runs on 4 included AA batteries so you can spray right from the bottle without any mixing, which many other brands require.As for the applicator itself, a small battery-powered pump is contained in the spray handle. It worked smoothly and provided a consistent and strong trajectory. You will need to prime the pump for a minute or more the first time you use it but after that, the product comes out easily.The cost of Deer Off II compares to similar ready-to-use products. Concentrates work out to be less expensive but are more cumbersome to use. While the cost may be a bit more, the motorized sprayer makes a huge difference when spraying larger areas.I admit I was skeptical about Deer Off II but after six months of using it, the results have been dramatic.And for New Jersey, that is saying a lot.
B000A0VOD2 This year's early and warmer spring resulted in an abundance of overactive rabbits in our yard, with our day lilies being the biggest casualty.I was favorably impressed by the battery powered sprayer which made application really easy. While I don't have conclusive evidence of its effectiveness, I haven't noticed any additional damage since my first application 3 weeks ago. Fingers crossed.
B000A0VOD2 I kind of like the deer that live near my home, and I'm all for bunnies.  But squirrels!!!  They are demonic.  They undermine asphalt and make holes for the horses to step in.  Hate 'em!So, this allows you to treat areas with a spray to \"discourage\" them from showing up.  It doesn't kill them, just makes them feel unwelcome, like they should be moving on.  I'm not sure how long they'll stay away...I will update the review if they rush back in droves.  I'd also like to know, once the rain starts, if that effects how long it works.It's intended to use around plants and shrubs you want undisturbed (I'm hoping it keeps the skunks out of the salad bar, I mean, lettuce), but since it has pesticide warnings, I didn't use it near my vegetables.  But the plants that they seem to love along our yard borders is where I put it, in hopes to keep them out.It is supposed to work by creating a gross taste and smell to them, although it's odorless when you spray it.For now, those bad guys are gone.  I didn't have to murder them, so I don't feel bad, and so far as I can tell, this is going to last at least through the summer into fall when the squirrel population seems to explode. The bottle promises three months, which is a bargain, and I plan to use it just once or twice year when they are at their worst.Oh, and the sprayer uses a battery so you don't get tired spraying everywhere.  Overkill it seems, but useful.
B000A0VOD2 Since we live in the country, we have a lot of wildlife in our yard.  While they are cute to look at, they can do a lot of damage, and some of them don't smell very good(SKUNKS)!  We have had a problem with raccoons and skunks destroying flower planters and digging up newly planted annuals. This product helped keep them out of the flowers and the battery powered sprayer makes it easy to use.One winter the deer \"trimmed\" all our shrubs, even the ones right next to the house. Since our area was hit hard by EHD this past year, we didn't have that problem this past winter; and I was delighted this morning to see three deer walking down our driveway. I love watching all the wildlife, and just try to keep them out of the flowers and vegetable garden.
B000A0VOD2 I've maintained a garden patch for quite a few years and it has always been affected by some type of animals.  First, there were squirrels until I built a small fence.  Then there were deer until I built a bigger fence.  Then, squirrels found their way in from the top and others from below.This Deer Off seems to be helping more than any of these.  I didn't spray it around the whole yard (that's just mean), but I did set up quite the perimeter around my garden and I haven't had any animals intruding there whatsoever.  Is this the work of the Deer Off spray, or is it simply coincidence?  I'd like to think the spray is working just fine.
B000A0VOD2 PLEASE SEE THE UPDATE AFTER THIS ORIGINAL REVIEW.We have been plagued with squirrels for years.  Our neighborhood has vast numbers of large oak and pecan trees with a smattering of fruit trees.  These provide food and shelter for these little critters so they multiply like crazy and typically overrun the area.  They dig up flower beds, destroy container plants, dig holes in the lawn and devour one small bite out of every pecan and piece of fruit before it matures.  If that's not bad enough, they have chewed through the wood trim on our home and made nests in the attic.  Squirrels are NOT cute little cartoon critters.  They are destructive tree rats.  Over the years, I've tried to keep them at bay by using various home remedy methods--from putting ground red pepper around plants to using a pellet gun to permanently remove individuals.  Nothing worked.  They liked hot pepper and for every one I killed, three more would take its place.With this in mind, I was skeptical of \"Deer Off\".  But I was willing to give it a try and I actually think it may be working...at least for the short term.  After spraying a liberal amount of \"Deer Off\" around the base of trees, in flower beds and around container plants, the squirrels seem to be staying away.  It's been a little under two weeks since the initial application of the product and I've only seen one squirrel at a time in the back yard.  In the past, they came in gangs of more than a dozen--sometimes as many as two dozen at one time.  So far so good.The label says \"Deer Off\" deters animals by smell and taste but it is odorless to humans \"once dry\".  I never noticed an odor as I sprayed it and I have a pretty sensitive nose.  It's also supposed to last for months even after rain or watering of plants.  I can't verify this but I'm keeping my fingers crossed.  If there's anything I dislike about the product it is the silly battery-powered sprayer container.  I've noticed this trend in lawn care products recently and I don't like it.  Batteries and battery-powered pumps add an unnecessary expense to the products, they add unnecessary complications should electrical components fail and they add unnecessary waste to landfills.  It's not difficult to pump up a sprayer and let air do the work.  And, of course, air is free.  In my opinion, the advent of battery-powered sprayers is a dumb marketing idea that should be rectified as soon as possible.I'm giving \"Deer Off\" four stars due to my short term observation that it appears to be working with the local squirrels.  Docked one star permanently for the battery-powered sprayer.UPDATE 06/12/2012:I guess I was too optimistic.  The squirrels are back.  Digging in the lawn, digging in the flower beds and digging in the plant containers.Yeah, that didn't last too long.  No big rains to wash it away either.  It just quit working.  And at over 30 bucks for the large bottle, I can't recommend it as a temporary solution.
B000A0VOD2 Results were mediocre.  It definitely did not work on squirrels!! I thought the battery operated spray unit would be a positive but it was not.  The sprayer broke after minimal useage.  I won't buy this product but will look for something more effective and a sturdier applicator.  Save your money!
B000A0VOD2 I have a lot of rabbit and deer damage in my garden if I don't spray.  I like to alternate various sprays to keep them guessing.  This worked very well against both rabbits and deer.  I sprayed some potted begonias that had been eaten down to stubs and they are now thriving and the same with some balloon flowers.  I assume it was the rabbits that were eating them although I never actually saw the culprit.  At any rate this spray took care of the problem. It also protected my day lilies against the deer than had been munching on them.  Easy to apply too.
B000A0VOD2 I'm a terrible gardener. So when I finally got my watermelons to bud and start to grow I was extremely happy... until I went out and checked on them one day and either the deer or rabbits ate them all.This is a hazard for me as I'm right next to a very large forrested area. While I enjoy seeing the wildlife I didn't want to keep losing my fruits and veggies to them so I got this Deer Off. I'm happy to say that I've not had any part of my garden taken so far. And since I localized the spray to just around the garden I still see the animals on the far side of the yard (a couple hundred feet away.)I'm happy with this product and wish I'd gotten it prior to losing my watermelons.
B000A0VOD2 Anyone engaged in the often futile battle of deer vs. the garden plants knows that high quality repellent is important as is the delivery system.  Those of us who have come close to carpal-tunnel syndrome from squeezing sprayers have  just been saved by the gleefully easy-to-use automated delivery system in this Deer Off product.  Not only does Deer Off work very well, but it is now a pleasure to spray when all you need to do is pull the trigger and hose down the plants you want to protect from those voracious appetites.Although Deer Off works very well, it is not rain fast, and needs to be re-applied after rain.  Also, deer will grow used to anything, so it is best used in rotation (every 2-3 months) with another type of deer repellant.The true innovation in this packaging though is the battery operated sprayer.  I hope to see it in additional products (herbicides, insecticides, etc.).  It uses 4 AA batteries (which come with the package).  Switch from Lock to On, and you are ready to go.  The nozzle adjusts between stream and spray depending on your target.  Nothing could be simpler.
B000A0VOD2 I found Deer Off II to be effective.  I have used it several times.  The ingredients are not too different than some other products.  In this review, I compare Deer Off II to Deer Stopper and my home made solution as I use these three equally. I tend to switch products each season/year, and I tend to buy over the internet rather than locally.  My reasoning is that over time some animals will become used to a repellent and it may not be as effective.  While it still works to a degree, if everyone in your neighborhood is buying the same brand spray from your local store, while the deer may not like it, once they are hungry enough, they'll learn to live with it.  I don't have any scientific data to back that up; it's just my humble opinion.So back to Deer Off II.  I find it stops the deer and rabbits in my flower/shrub garden.  Unfortunately, deer tend to travel in groups, so if you get five in your yard and each bite at a bloom, well there goes 5 or 6 blooms by the time they realize \"Hey this doesn't taste good.\"But in general, I find they tend to avoid the areas sprayed with Deer Off II.  Its main ingredients are egg and pepper, which are common in this type of repellent.  For me, Deer Off II has been effective.  I have a good deal of deer around my home and it seems to have kept them at bay.You can, of course, make your own spray by adding an egg, some chili powder, and a couple of squirts of dishwashing liquid to a gallon of water and letting it sit in the sun with the bottle capped.  The egg will soon go bad and you'll have a very inexpensive alternative.  Then each time you add water to the gallon bottle, you add another egg.  The only issue there is home made spray tends to wash off with each rain, whereas store bought products adhere longer through rains. The dishwashing liquid helps the home made spray adhere a little.The odor of Deer Off II is noticeable, but no worse than other products.  Store bought spays tend to smell a little more than the home made spray.  Obviously you want to be up-wind when you spray no matter what you use!  Deer Stopper has a less offensive scent than most other products, including Deer Off II.So, why buy Deer Off II and not a different brand?  The ingredients are about the same.  The biggest selling point is the Deer Stopper II motorized spray.  It runs on 4 AA batteries (included), so you can spray right from the bottle without mixing, pumping, or getting trigger finger cramps.  You could certainly buy/mix any product and add it to your own manual/motorized spray, but this one comes ready to use all the way around.  It's nice to finish spraying without a red finger or cramps from constantly pressing the trigger.As for the motorized pump, essentially there is a small battery-powered pump  in the spray handle.  It works well and has decent trajectory.  I tend to do a wide spray from a foot or two away anyway. The instructions say to prime the pump by holding the trigger for several seconds.  I have found you need to hold it continuously for about a minute he first time you use the bottle.  After that, there is spray in the hose and it comes out almost instantly. The cover for battery compartment is a little flimsy, so if you plan on reusing the bottle keep that in mind.  Although the first set of batteries will probably last you several refills of the bottle.Deer Off II is similarly priced to other read-to-use products. It does cost a bit more than other sprays I use, only because I tend to use concentrates. This is a 64 ounce bottle, ready to use, whereas something like Deer Stopper  concentrate costs about the same but is a 32 ounce bottle which mixes at a 9:1 ratio, so it yields 10 quarts, or 320 ounces - about 5 times more than Deer Off II.  Neither product compares in price to home made spray which is just the cost of a few eggs and some chili powder, but again the home spray requires frequent respraying.If you don't need to do constant spraying of a large area, or just can't be bothered with mixing concentrates or home ingredients, Deer Off II is a great solution.I would get this product again.  It works well and is very convenient.  The motorized spray is very nice when you are spaying a large amount of flowers, shrubs, etc.
B000A0VOD2 I got this at a neighbor's recommendation and I am glad I did.  I live in Deer Country and it is not uncommon to see deer strolling on local lawns even in bright daylight.  This is an effective product and deer are repelled by the taste.  I was surprised that this product had the flavors of peppery egg, which deer and small rodents apparently don't enjoy.Although this product has a bad smell, it is not overpowering and it does do the job.  This does not have a strong odor and is not human repellent based on that.You get a  motorized pupmp that runs on batteries.  It does work well and it is easy to aim and spray.  I would certainly recommend this.  It is gentle on your foliage and other greenery.
B000A0VOD2 Call me a skeptic but living here in the California Sierras, where deer ate all the rose bushes and some of the vegetable garden that wasnt fenced well enough, we have tried everything from soap hung on trees, a sprinkler set up that shoots water when a deer comes near (creates an ice hazard in winter), and even a home brew of urine hot sauce and liquid soap. None worked well.This works!!  The label says it has egg solids so if you have anyone who  is allergic to eggs, don't use it.  Cannot be used on food crops, but the vegetable garden is securely fenced so we are safe there. It was the newer rose bushes I was concerned about.  You do have to reapply after it rains and its not as strong if the air is moist or you have snow on the ground.The container says it will repel deer, rabbits, tree squirrels, but it seems to repel skunks, and even opossums, and a neighbors dog. Don't ask me how.
B000A0VOD2 I sprayed this on my yard, not to protect any of my greenery but to stop the squirrels from climbing up the wall and into the gutters and roof. So far, I can't tell if its the rain or the Havahart spray that stopped the squirrels but so far I haven't seen any squirrels running around in the general area. This leads me to believe its the rain that is shooing the squirrels away. I will save the rest of the Deer Off when spring time arrives or when the squirrels come back around.
B000A0VOD2 Rabbits have been feasting on my new lawn and I was excited to be able to try Deer Off from the Vine program. However, while rabbits are one of the critters it says it repels, I guess rabbits didn't read it. The first try I liberally sprayed it all around the perimeter of the grassy area I was trying to protect. But, judging by the fresh rabbit droppings I found each morning afterwards, I suspected it wasn't working. My second try I liberally sprayed everywhere, perimeter and main lawn, and later that night I checked outside and found 2 rabbits feasting away. Maybe they like eggs, but it doesn't appear to work on rabbits, at least not the ones I have here in San Diego.
B000A0VOD2 This didn't seem to accomplish a whole lot and I found getting it up and running sort of fussy. Maybe the wildlife in other areas is a little more bothered by it, but here it just ended up being more trouble than it was worth for the amount of actual effect that I felt I was getting.
B000A0VOD2 I have been using this for a little while now and while it seems to work fairly well it only lasts a week without rain and if it rains you pretty much have to go out there the same day and reapply or you get to wake up first thing in the morning to your strawberries that hang near the fence being eaten...It's good idea for the most part but it's something that just doesn't really seem to be a lasting benefit and it seems to be a more natural avenue for repelling the deer and it does work just not nearly as long as I would like it to.I've been using it for a couple month on the garden/around it to keep the unwanted animals away and it does seem to work pretty good so far, just as I said, it doesn't last nearly as long as I would like it to.
B000A0VOD2 The Deer Off II repellent with a battery powered sprayer is a great idea. It really does make it much easier to spray large areas. The Deer Off II repellent targets the deer, squirrel and rabbit's sense of smell and taste. I have a rather large flower garden which the deer seem to think was planted for them. The Deer Off repellent has effectively kept them away for several weeks. It does need to be sprayed after each rainfall, but with the battery powered sprayer, that is no problem.
B000A0VOD2 The instructions for this product are easy to follow and I had it ready to spray, theoretically, within seconds. However the sprayer just wouldn't spray. I checked and replaced the batteries. I took it apart several times and still couldn't get it to work. I read the directions again and noticed a phone number with the pledge that the company's highest objective was to serve the customer. So I called and got a toy company. They informed me that they had been bought by another company and they didn't have a forwarding number. I got on the internet, located a working number, and finally got to talk to a human being after the usual push button 1, then 2, and so on. She said she would be happy to send a replacement product. But I needed to get a specific number off the bottom of the package. I hunted down the package but alas, the number had been defaced. Too bad for me and I was unable to get a replacement.I decided to just sprinkle the product around my flower garden but it didn't have any effect at all. So maybe the liquid needs to be sprayed directly onto the flowers which was impossible to do without the proper sprayer. So basically it was worthless. I've tried other products from this company that worked. Maybe you will have a different experience.
B000A0VOD2 Great for protecting baby fruit/nut/landscape trees from deer rubs.We have a lot of property in GA, mostly timberland, but with some fruit/nut trees planted on some cleared land where we have a small hunting cabin. We've tried a lot of different methods for keeping deer from rubbing all the bark off and killing the young trees -- this spray seems to be pretty effective. Just apply it around the time they start leaving rub marks, and trees stay safe, and alive. A little expensive, but a good option for those who don't want to bother with physical measures like protective sheathing or fencing.
B000A0VOD2 I have been waiting until Fall to try this product, because the biggest problem I have with deer and rabbits is eating my strawberry plants after they are done producing for the year.  So I have sprayed the leaves with Deer Off a few days ago and removed the bird netting I keep over the plants.  The liquid is pretty thick and does not easily come out of the sprayer.  It took about 20 seconds or so to prime it, and then the liquid came out in spurts and large droplets.  The instructions say that there's a 'mist nozzle' that you can attach for a finer mist, but I didn't find it anywhere.The spray smells somewhat like eggs, but is not really that strong to me.  It rained a couple times since I sprayed, and the dried liquid appears to still be present on some of the leaves.  So far, none of the leaves have been chewed, which is a good sign.  I'll keep checking over the next couple weeks and if they are still there by then, I would reapply and call it a success.But, one thing you might consider.  Not all animals will avoid the repellant - it really depends on both the animal population and other food sources in your area.  If you live in a place where there is abundant food besides your garden, then this repellant will probably work for you.  Also, if animal populations are low, this will also likely work.  However, if you live in a high-traffic area for garden pests, or there is little other natural foods for them, or animal populations are high (thus making competition for food high), then this repellant is likely to not work.The best solution really is a physical barrier for the plants you want to preserve.  I use plastic 'deer fence' around my raised bed garden, and as I said above, I use the thin, nylon bird netting over the top of my strawberry bed.  This has worked extremely well, and I don't have to continually apply a repellant and hope that it will work (remember, it only has to not work one time for you to lose your plants!).  So I think this repellant would be best for plants that you really can't physically protect (like the tulips at my Mom's grave come to mind, or any other place where you cannot provide a physical barrier).  In these cases, apply liberally and often - say, once a week or so - for best effect.  Or the alternative is to use plants that they won't eat, like marigolds, daffodils, lavender, foxglove, phlox, iris, hyacinth, verbena, bleeding heart, and many others.  Rutgers has an excellent page listing 100s of landscape plants by deer resistance: (...)UPDATE 11/14/12:  Just an update to let you know that nothing has eaten my exposed strawberry leaves since I removed the netting and sprayed on the Deer-Off.  Maybe it really does work?  ... or I just got lucky this year and nothing has come by to eat them, but that's unlikely.
B000A0VOD2 I bought this to try at my parents' cabin.  They have a major problem with deer eating their ornamental plants, specfically tiger lillies and hostos (or is it hostas).This particular product is nice because it the sprayer is battery operated.  So my parents like the convenience.Now for the disadvantages... I'd rather smell my own flatuence after chilli than smell this. It's awful.  But, then again many other chemical sprayers reek.  Also, this is not a set it and forget option.  You need to pay a lot of attention and reapply.  Lastly, you cannot use it for plants that will bear fruit or vegetables for consumption.All and all it's a new twist on an old concept.  I'd use it again.
B000A0VOD2 Living near the woods, we have all kinds of critters:  chipmunks, squirrels, rabbits, racoons, and deer.  In addition there is my nutty dog, so I don't want to use anything toxic around her.  Deer Off has non toxic ingredients, and so far seems to repel the critters, though it's still early in the season and I haven't yet planted my flowers due to the cold weather.  I especially like that Deer Off doesn't require mixing, an improvement over products I've used in past years.  So far so good, but I'll update on effectiveness when my garden is planted.
B000A0VOD2 I thought it was the rabbits, but then someone told me that rabbits don't eat chrysanthemums?  Anyway, we realized that it was a doe and her super cute fawn.  We sprayed just the flowers and bushes where they were having lunch.  Now the deer are still playing out there in the back yard and the flowers are still in order.
B000A0VOD2 Guess I don't understand the difference between all the various varmints and how they could be immune to something that smells and tastes nasty to some animals and not others...Seems to be working to some degree but at the high price I have to wonder if it's worth it..  Rated this as 'It's okay' but if price was lower (it's only 64 oz) I might have a BIT higher opinion of it. Don't mind higher prices if a product does the job you need it to do.  That is, IF it does indeed prove useful over time....DC powered sprayer is great and is only way to go when you have old stiff fingers like I do, saves much pain and frustration...  I didn't prime mine with the battery power however, I tipped the bottle on it's side and put some pressure on the bottle to force liquid through the tube first... then it didn't take but a few seconds to get it out the spray head with power on.I also put the clear plastic sleeve back on that it was shipped with to hold the \"holster\" on the side of the bottle better...  otherwise it just hangs loose and is a bother when you carry it around.  You could also just wrap the middle with packaging tape etc.
B000A0VOD2 I spray the deer off on all my flowers and fruit trees, it works pretty good.  I have tried other products and nothing keeps the deer from eating the flowers or fruit trees.  The deer off works for a week or so on the plants that my sprinklers spray daily, longer for the plants that I spray that do not get watered on the area I spray.  As long as I remember to spray the flowers the deer tend to not eat them, only a few times a really hungry deer came through and ate a few of the plants that were sprayed but not many.
B000A0VOD2 UPDATE:  I sprayed another round of Deer-Off on my chestnut tree trunks & the deer have avoided my trees (no fresh bark rubbed off of the trunks).  However, the Deer Off does not deter my squirrels, and, without hesitation, they scamper up the tree trunks to get the chestnuts._________________________________________________________________________So Far, So Good because it isn't prime rut season and, to me, this is the full test of a product because that is when the deer really tear up my 5-7 year old chestnut trees.  Squirrels & Rabbits are not an issue until the nuts fall in September (squirrels), so I cannot comment on how the spray is a deterrent for these animals.We have a regular deer herd that hangs out on our property (about 5-6 deer).  They have been hard on my chestnut trees and, while, I want to be kind to nature, I really don't want them eating my trees or rubbing on the tree trunks.Since it is late May, the deer have been fairly quiet, and, prior to the Deer Off, ate a few leaves (especially on a newly planted chestnut - munched the top right off of it).  I have not noticed any further activity, and have noticed that the deer seem to choose to stay over in neighboring properties rather than in our yard.  However, rut will really put Deer Off to the test, so I will update this review after rut.As for the spray itself, the battery operated trigger (batteries are included!) is great.  After priming (takes awhile), the spray is ready to go & puts out a nice, steady stream.  The scent is not nasty, so the job of spraying is not bad at all.Deer Off is advertised as safe for use with kids & pets.  My dogs have been in & around the sprayed trees & have exhibited no adverse reaction at all.  They can tell there is some sort of a scent, so they sniff the trees.This product holds promise.  The battery operated sprayer is nice & there was enough repellent to spray 8 trees with some left over.
B000A0VOD2 I live on an acre lot in a rural subdivision. White-tail Deer are a daily nuisance inthe neighborhood and over the spring and summer, I used Deer Off to help protectazaleas, day lilies, and other ornamental plants around the yard.During this time deer continued to come into the yard on a regular basis but theydid not nibble on the treated plants nearly as much as when I left them untreated inearlier years.I sprayed three times in a six-month period through early fall with one extraspraying after three days of heavy rain. The battery-powered sprayer worked welland was easy to control. You do need to shake the container well before and duringuse so that the sprayer will not clog up. I had to unscrew the nozzle and clean it upa few times but that wasn't a big problem. The product smells pretty bad as you arespraying, but the odor goes away quickly (at least for humans) once it dries.All in all Deer-Off is an effective product that will help keep deer from eating yourplants. Bear in mind that flowers and new growth that come out after you spray arenot treated and are subject to getting munched. You have to stay on top of thingsand spray after big rains as well.
B000A0VOD2 The product works very well, just like many of the other reviewers have mentioned. We used to have deer coming to eat our plants and flowers quite often, almost on a daily basis. But with this repellent, we haven't had any issues.The one thing I didn't like was that product wasn't shipped well - the cover had come loose and there was some spillage when I removed the product from the packaging. So beware when opening - the cover may not be closed all the way.
B000A0VOD2 While the product only worked until it rained, the battery powered sprayer made respraying easier than other options.  On the good side, having a periodic deterrent seems to discourage deer enough that they are getting less likely to come around.  I actually have day lilies for the first time in years.  Squirrels are a different matter and I need to keep up the respraying consistently if I want them away from my birdfeeders.  I just don't have to respray all around the gardens every time.The container comes with a sprayer in the 'holster' which attaches under the cap.  After opening the container the first time, you put the hose of the sprayer down in the container and close it with the hose's cap through which the hose is threaded.  The holster does a great job of holding the sprayer when not in use. The unit comes with batteries installed and is ready for use. It takes as much as 30 seconds to 'prime' the sprayer when pressing the trigger at first, but not so long during subsequent applications.  You can adjust the spray from a fine mist for nearby application to more of a stream if spraying something further away.I spray around my birdfeeders where it's easy to see how effective the product is and sure enough, no squirrels come to the area for several days. When it rains, however, they were back.  The birds aren't deterred at all, but my dog is.  He doesn't like the scent any better than the squirrels apparently.  I didn't find the scent to be a problem for me while spraying though.Unlike the granules, which I also tried, this method is more cost effective as I can get many applications from the one large container.  For deer of course the granules aren't very useful as I've found I really need to actually spray the foliage the deer would be inclined to eat.  I've tried dozens of deer deterrents and although some are as effective (like the rosemary oil spray), I really do like this battery operated approach as I have rather a lot to spray.  For the squirrels and night critters, I just like the ease of use this product offers.  If it worked longer, I'd give it five stars, but so far I don't mind reapplication too much.
B000A0VOD2 My package arrived intact and was easy to assemble:  insert hose into the container, screw cap back on, and unlock the sprayer.  When done properly no liquid and its smell gets on your hands.  This is good for those who don't want to deal with any overspill, smell or residue.It took a while for the liquid to come through the nozzle but it did spray out evenly over the surface I was using this on:  a sun-drenched dirt area of my garden popular with cats in my hood.The spray does seem to keep the cats away.  I haven't seen new poop in a while.Two complaints, though.  This stuff is expensive and it doesn't last as long as advertised.  The battery-powered sprayer seems more like a gimmick to me.  I'd prefer hand-pump action instead.I live in the high desert where dry, warm weather persists long into the year.  We don't get deer down here (they stay higher in the foothills) but we do get our share of stray dogs and cats roaming through at night.  This stuff keeps the cats away, but so do other Havahart products that sell for much less.
B000A0VOD2 This product was easy to set up and start using. The sprayer is battery operated so spraying it around the garden was a breeze. Fortunately there are no deer in our area, but I have all sorts of smaller critters digging up my garden... squirrels, rabbits, cats, and raccoons.  I applied this product a few weeks ago to certain parts of my garden that I have noticed digging in and so far so good. The areas have not been dug up again (which is usually what happens when I repair the damage the critters have caused).  I will update my results when more time has passed. I really like that this product is pretty much odorless. I have used other products in the past that were really nasty smelling. They not only kept the critters away, but they kept me and other family members away because the garden smelled so bad.
B000A0VOD2 I started using this on my trail to keep the deer away, now I have been spaying it around my straw garden. I have not had any problems with deer or squirrels eating my plants. The sprayer works fine, and it doesn't hurt pets or wildlife. You do have to spray again after it rains, but other than that, this has worked pretty well for me so far. The instructions say to clean the sprayer to prevent clogging, but I have never bothered to do this. It has never clogged up on me. The product is made from eggs, but I have never really noticed any smell from using this.
B000A0VOD2 Buying this product for the battery powered sprayer alone is worth it.  The sprayer evenly and accurately applies a fine mist of Deer-Off without any leaks or drips.  It can reach a couple of feet further into my plants than using a hand sprayer alone.The product itself is ok.  It is basically cayenne, rosemary and garlic (and other natural herb repellents) suspended in a water resistant base containing egg whites.  This base is what helps keep the herb-mixture stuck on to the plants to do their job.  Does it work? Yes, as well as applying cayenne and peppermint soap would. Does it have better staying power? Yes, but only in light rain and light wind and not in a thunderstorm.  I usually keep my dog away from my vegetable garden because I sprinkle cayenne, white pepper and peppermint soap on the leaves and around the border, so I have not actually tested to see if this is pet-friendly or not.After a few weeks, squirrels and bunnies are still staying away from my garden. The deer are still munching away but that may be because there's a pack of them and a bite of each deer before they each decide to move on is destruction enough.  The neighbourhood skunk that likes to dig around my stone wall has probably stopped coming around because there isn't any new stench.Overall it works as well as my homemade formula, is more convenient (i.e. no mixing and fermenting) and I really love the sprayer.Recommended.
B000A0VOD2 This Havahart \"Deer Off II\" works better than expected at keeping squirrels from getting into my old Victorian house through the eaves. This has been a big problem for us in the past when we could hear them running around in the ceilings and having one die in the walls, causing us to shut off the room for over a week due to the smell. We also tested this on the flowerbeds in our front yard and it did keep the bunnies away as well, but we like the deer that come into our backyard so did not want to discourage them by spraying this where they tend to wander.This is very easy to use once you get the unit primed and the electric sprayer works well to apply it in hard to reach places, which was important for us since we had use it from a ladder. The odor is not as bad as expected, but it is definitely noticeable when applying the spray. This will have to be reapplied every few weeks, more often if there has been a lot of rain, but it is effective so we will keep using it as long as it works.Highly Recommended!CFH
B000A0VOD2 If you have deer eating your vegetables and just pillaging your garden (like us) then this spray will help.  The motorized spray is nice so you don't need keep pumping a trigger.  The order isn't to bad either I mean their is an order but no worse than other sprays.  It will definitely work and to save your garden.
B000A0VOD2 This time of year is tough on deer so they are a major threat to my expensive plants.  They're even munching on my trees and did their damage.Since applying this repellent, they've not eaten anything.  Only problem is having to reapply the repellent after it rains.
B000A0VOD2 In my neck of the woods (rural New Jersey) we are infested with Deer. Yes, they are beautiful animals but enough is enough. (I am sure they think the same thing about humans!) They will eat most anything and almost nothing deters them for long. We have tried every spray on the market, made our own concoctions, used those little zapping sticks and finally just fenced in the back yard and moved most of our plantings to that area.* We still have a few plants in the front that  the deer ravish, including a little Japanese maple they completely strip and eat the bark too. So, my hopes for this repellent weren't too high and the spray lived up to those relatively low expectations.The spray bottle itself is fine. I did have some issues getting the battery powered sprayer to work, the hubby stepped in, tightened the lid, kept constant pressure on the pump, was able to get it primed and we did get it to spray eventually. I personally don't mind pump spraying, so the battery powered feature wasn't a strong selling point for me. The spray is similar in ingredients, odor and effectiveness to most everything we have tried. It works as long as you apply it faithfully after each rain. 90 days? No way. I deliberately applied the spray, left the trees alone for 2 weeks (we have had a few good showers) and now have shredded trees and plantings.So, if you are willing to spend the time and the money to apply this repellent on a regular basis, it will keep the deer away. If you are not, try something else . . . prayer and a shotgun perhaps?*Last year we had one deer who would literally jump the 5 foot fence and leap from one fenced back yard to the next eating the neighborhood's plantings. He is gone this year, I assume someone had enough and shot him - lol.
B000A0VOD2 Great product to keep those pesky animals away from your plants and shrubs. It works! Ease of use is the fact that it has a powered sprayer. This new technology is taking hold with other products like bug sprays and is making user friendly real!
B000A0VOD2 I had trouble getting this to spray. Some of the other reviews offer useful tips on this problem.The active ingredients are similar to certain related products: \"Contains putrescent eggs solids (4.63%), garlic (.001%) and capsaicin (.001%).\" My experience with these is that they work well for up to a couple of weeks, although they need to be reapplied after a rain, or even after heavy sprinkler use. A downside of this formula is that the smell of garlic will permeate the garden.
B000A0VOD2 I live in a rural area where deer abound aplenty.  Every year there is a battle to see who can win- us with our plants and gardens, or deer with their insatiable appetites.We have been using Liquid Fence for quite a while with great results, but after a while of pressing the trigger over and over and over, it gets a bit tedious considering our garden and elderberry bushes are pretty extensive.This version of deer repellant is a bit different.  The square container is about the size of an antifreeze container.  There is a black cap that screws on top and a hose the comes out of it.  There is a sprayer nozzle that attaches to the hose and that has batteries in it.  The actual repellent is human safe so it can be used on gardens safely.It does tend to not have the severe garlic smell that some people find repulsive with Liquid Fence, but more of a calm scent which still does the trick.We just planted our garden this last month and that is when the deer often eat off all of our plants. We have been using this repellant and so far nothing has touched our plants.Application is a breeze.  I just press down the nozzle and out comes the stream.  I can make it softer or more precise and harder depending on what I need.  My application time is cut way down now and I can quickly tour my yard spraying every week and I am free to spend more time on other things I would prefer to do.I highly recommend this stuff. It is wonderful.  So far, no rabbit or deer problems with our garden and believe me there are plenty of both in our area.  A few times of raining a week and it still works with weekly spraying if we have some serious rain.
B000A0VOD2 I'm pleased with the product itself. It's a non-lethal way to get critters (in my case, squirrels) to come to the realization that next door is a much nicer place to be than in my backyard. The song birds who frequent my bird feeders also agree that \"someplace else\" is the absolute best place for squirrels to hang out.The smell is not too bad, but you certainly don't want to be getting any on your clothes if you value the company of others. Note the wind direction before spraying!The spraying part is where the product falls flat for me. It comes with a battery powered spray head. The spray head works provided that you prime it first and make sure that the batteries are seated properly (they come with batteries packed in the sprayer, but they can get knocked about in transit).The problem is that this fancy spray head really doesn't serve much good. It's too weak for spraying large areas. For that you'll want to use a garden pump sprayer (you can get a cheap one for a few bucks at a home improvement store, or can invest in a really nice one such as this:Smith 190216 2-Gallon Max Contractor Sprayer With Heavy Duty 18-Inch Wand and Shoulder Strap)A garden sprayer will allow you to efficiently cover a large swath without much effort.On the other hand, if you want to cover just a small area or be really precise, the battery spray head again falls short compared with a regular trigger dispenser. The battery version lacks fine-level control, and the spray pattern is either too wide or too narrow -- it's hard to adjust the spray head to find the right middle ground.  The only plus to the battery pump is that it is helpful if you have very limited hand strength.This is a worthwhile product, but skip the version with the battery sprayer and get the version that has a conventional sprayer (or none at all).
B000A0VOD2 The Ready-to-use Deer Off II worked very well at repelling squirrels for about 2 weeks, not the claimed three months, and then its effect diminished.I tested the ready-to-use Deer Off II in my back yard because I've had to pick up Squirrel droppings to prevent my dog from eating them.  I did not find squirrel droppings in my back yard for about two weeks after application to my shrubs and the perimeter of the small yard.  Two weeks later I'm finding an increased number of squirrel droppings.Its battery operated sprayer worked very well.  I like the safety lock just below the sprayer's trigger. I intend to use the sprayer for my weed killer even though the power could be improved.
B000A0VOD2 First of all, the battery that came with it didn't work, so I had to buy new ones.  The lock switch on the spray head is hard to lock and unlock. It took awhile for the liquids to start coming out after I held down the spray trigger. Probably like 5 minutes. Anyways, once it starts, it work ok. Doesn't have much pressure to spray far. Anyways, after spraying like quarter of the bottle on my trees, entire backyard smelled like burned wood. I haven't seen squirrels on those trees so far and it's been 2 weeks.
B000A0VOD2 I've used this product in the past and am still using it in a concentrated formulation because it is cost effective. I live near a wooded area that is inhabited by deer and other creatures. I also have a couple of resident rabbits in the yard. This does an effective job of keeping the critters away from my flowers and succulents. It is easy to use and has a big plugin that you don't have to mix it. Spray the plants as directed and forget it. The only negative is that normally given the amount of rainfall we experience, this does not last for 3 months. I spray about every  6 weeks. Doing this diligently duing the growth season seems to keep animals away. The deer have stopped feeding on the hostas, plumeria, etc.This size is great for an average yard and should last for at least one season.
B000A0VOD2 As the title of my review says, the electric sprayer is excellent. It took probably a minute of priming (pressing the trigger with nothing coming out of the sprayer) during my first use before the spray started to come out; since then, it sprays right away when I pull the trigger.The spray stream goes about six feet or so, and it's easy enough to aim it at trees or fence or whatever. You can adjust the tip of the sprayer in order to make the spray more of less focused (that is, more stream or more misty).I'll use this spray bottle even after the repellent is gone. It will be useful for weed sprays, insect repellents, etc.The repellent itself has only been moderately successful in our yard. Our issue is bunnies and they haven't seemed to be bothered by the repellent - their activity in our yard after a couple of applications of the repellent is basically the same as before the applications.
B000A0VOD2 I've put a lot of money and care into my landscaping and have had trouble preventing deer from eating much of it, so I thought I'd give this a try.Since applying this product I've seen deer in the area a few times, but they haven't even come into my yard.  To be fair, it hasn't rained since applying this, so I don't know how effective it would or how good a job I did with applying this to the underside of flowers and leaves.Really liked the electric applicator and the holster on the bottle.  It did take longer to prime than what I expected, but it was a breeze to use once it was primed.  Very easy on the hands.  Did get a little on myself when adjusting the spray and there is no evidence of an offensive order I've noticed when using other products.I will purchase this again in the future.
B000A0VOD2 My small garden had frequest visits from rabbits, squirrels, and other small pests.  However, regular applications of the HAVAHART DEER OFF II stopped the night time visits cold.  This was true even in the late fall when rain comes a little more frequently to the area - the DEER OFF II was not easily washed away and continued to protect my leafy greens.I also appreciated the battery-operated sprayer.  As someone who easily gets hand cramps and forearm pain from typical pump sprayers, I was happy to pay a little extra for the battery-operated bottle.  You don't really have to use alot, depending on the size of your garden, but it made my hand very happy.This product was ideal all the way around - HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!
B000A0VOD2 We wished there was a way to keep the rabbits out of our yard for several years now but we didn't know of a way to repel them. The problem is that the rabbits run through our yard leaving their pellets all over the place. Our dog thinks that it is food and it drives us crazy trying to keep our dogs away from it. I decided to give this a try but didn't have high hopes that it would work. I sprayed the perimeter of our entire yard well over a month ago and haven't seen a rabbit since then. I also haven't seen any more rabbit pellets so this seems to have worked very well. I was able to spray the entire perimeter of my yard and only used about a third of the bottle so one bottle should last the entire year.My only complaint is that the sprayer didn't want to work at first. I had to run hot water through it for several minutes before it started to spray. But once it get going the battery operated automatic spray is wonderful. My hand would have been tired by the time I was finished but with the automatic spray it was a breeze.Even considering the problem with the sprayer at first I think this is a really good product.
B000A0VOD2 Egg white, Capsaicin, and Garlic are 5% of the product, who knows what else...There are no indications that the product is non-toxic but I expect it is. There are only warning about irritation if it gets in your eyes. This is expected as Capsaicin is the hot in a hot pepper.I would like to see more information about how and where the product is safe. It should be safe around birds, but is it?As packaged the primary recommend use is to protect seedlings from getting nibbled, and it seems to work well in that regard.I would like to use it around my bird feeders to fend off the squirrels there as well.The battery powered sprayer is a great addition to this type of product. Powered by 4 AA batteries, it isn't a power sprayer and your old fashioned pump sprayer will beat it easily. However for quick spot applications the battery power is sufficient to do the job. The spray itself is a good balance between too light of a mist and a washout dripping product. A couple seconds on each plant was enough to get good coverage and the large capacity jug will easily last the season.
B000A0VOD2 And they were eating everything in our yard and garden.  Our fruit trees, blueberry bushes, raspberries, creeping phlox and Asian lilies seem to be their favorite plants to chew on and sometimes destroy completely.  I sprayed them all down with Deer Off and the only plant I've noticed new nibbling on is my creeping phlox, and I'm not sure why it's not working for that plant.The battery powered sprayer makes it so easy on my hands (I have arthritis) and the smell wasn't as noticeable as some other things I've tried.  So far it seems to be working well, and I'm hoping that keeping my fruit trees and berries sprayed this winter will keep the rabbits from girdling them.The label states not to use on garden plants that you will consume, so I sprayed the perimeter of my wooden garden boxes, but that didn't repel the rabbits and squirrels at all. I even have a 14 inch tall hardware cloth fence around two of my garden boxes, but I still have problems with some kind of varmint getting in and eating all the sugar peas. Any suggestions would be appreciated!
B000A0VOD2 So far so good!!!  Even after the rain for two days the deer are leaving my plants and shrubs alone finally...easy spray with the battery powered sprayer so my arthritic hands did not give out spraying.  A great product from Amazon at great price that actually deters the critters.  You will have to try this to see how easily it works. (Havahart DO64MS Deer Off II Deer, Rabitt,and Squirrell Ready-to-Use Repellant with Battery Powered Sprayer)
B000A0VOD2 I am not quite ready to make a large declaration of \"Eureka\" for this product. The reason is because we wanted to use this to see if it would help keep the rabbit and squirrel out of the garden and it isn't yet time for the big test as we just got finished planting. For now I can say I haven't seen an increase in critter and I haven't experienced any negatives from the product. I will make sure to update in a few weeks when things get ready to harvest to talk about how well the product really worked.I can say the product was easy to apply and the smell isn't overpowering. I felt safe using it near fruits and veggies growing (but did not spray it \"on\" any of the raised bed garden frames).Will definitely update in a few weeks.
B000A0VOD2 I like the fact that Deer Off is all-natural or I wouldn't have used it.  It comes with a battery-operated sprayer that works fairly well and delivers a good stream.  I walked twice around my garden while spraying a steady stream of Deer off around the perimeter.  The sprayer should be flushed out with clean water after each use.The odor around my garden wasn't unpleasant to me.  An application is supposed to last for 90 days but long before 90 days I saw rabbits in the garden.  On the plus side I haven't seen any signs of deer in the garden, and they potentially eat a lot more than rabbits.So it's effectiveness is inconclusive but at least it doesn't hurt to try.
B000A0VOD2 We wanted to use Deer Off on a weeping willow tree that deer have almost pushed over. They seem to think it's a good place to sharpen their horns.We staked the tree back upright and the deer have seemed to have left the tree alone. Don't know if it was the Deer Off, the time of year or because the deer could also smell us and where we touched the tree.Edit to add more information:When Spring got here, after planting our garden, we had deer eating our tomato plants right off at the base so we sprayed our entire garden with this. This Deer Off has seemed to deter the deer but it burnt our plants. Every plant we sprayed has burnt places on them.The sprayer is also not easy to use.
B000A0VOD2 I still have all my flowers out front so it must be working.  It has a mild smell when first sprayed but dries up and becomes odorless fairly quickly.  It doesn't bother my dog though as he still walks up to the bushes to urinate on them, so dogs, or at least him, must not be bothered by it.  I use this in combination with the Havahart Solar Powered Water Sprinkler in my backyard raised garden bed and so far so good.  If you have trouble with rabbits, deers, and squirrels, give it a try.  It's safe around humans and pets.  I recommend it.
B000A0VOD2 I've had this on the plants for about a week now and so far I have seen less damage from the deer.  That might be somewhat seasonal, so I'll have to watch and see over the long term how effective this is.  I've also sprayed it around the trash cans to keep the raccoons away and it has been effective at that too.  I can certainly smell it myself, so this is not something you'll want to spray onto plants  near a door or window.  Thanks to the powered spayer, it is easy to apply.  In that regard I think this would be an excellent product for anyone with limited strength or mobility.  I can definitely see this as being helpful for an older person with a lot of property or greenery who has a critter problem.
B000A0VOD2 I have used the granule version of this product and had great success, so I thought I would give the spray version of it a try.  The spray version seems to work as well as the granules and goes a little further since you can control the spray much easier than pouring the granules.  This product keeps animals out of my yard, and I have seen a less number of dreaded armadillos digging my yard up.  The spray also helps with dogs and other animals, as they do not seem to like it and it seems to keep them away (added bonus).  What makes this even better is the battery powered sprayer (if you have ever used a pump sprayer, you know how terrible these spray containers are).  This battery powered sprayer is super easy and you just pull the trigger.  It worked great!!!  It even says that it is reusable and fits most gallon size containers.  So once you finish with the Deer Off you have a sprayer that you can continue to use on other tasks (I see a future for my weed killer).  This is a great package, you get the deer off which seems to keep all critters out of my yard, and a reusable sprayer that can be used with my other yard chores!  I am very happy with this and have had a significant decline in armadillos in my yard (also less wandering dogs)!!!
B000A0VOD2 We've had continual issues with deer, rabbits, squirrels and chipmunks eating our flowers, vegetables and fruit.  We've tried lot of things to reduce the problem and this is the easiest and about as effective as it gets.  I was somewhat concerned that the spray might damage the plants or have a repulsive smell.  I sprayed it on many kinds of flowers, several kinds of fruit and tomatoes with no ill effect and no noticeable smell once it was dry.  The deer seem to be repelled, with no evidence of any damage from them.  On the negative side, the chipmunks aren't deterred at all.  They love to eat petunias and proceeded to gobble them up.As a side note, the sprayer runs on batteries and is better than hand pumping.  The adjustment for the type of spray is a bit lacking, but it sort of works.If you have deer problems give it a try.  If you're trying to control chipmunks, don't waist your time.
B000A0VOD2 works great, smells bad  great dispenser.  If you have a smaller garden this is what you want.I often use a much larger back pack sprayer, but this is much easier.
B000A0VOD2 We had a woodchuck last year, a big woodchuck, that decided to set up camp in our backyard.  She(I believe it is a she) ate everything she could get to, nothing was safe.  Thankfully the vegetable garden had a fence but we lost half of our unfenced flower garden.  As soon as things started sprouting this year I started spraying but not what I thought was excessive.  We have not seen our big friend in our garden this year but I did see her in a neighbors yard the other day so I'm hoping it was the Havahart Deer Off and not that she moved to a better neighborhood.We don't have a problem with rabbits or deer and the only issue we have with squirrels is they like to bury nuts in our garden and flower boxes in the fall, so we will see how it goes with them later in the year. The sprayer works well and I'm really interested to see how long the pump lasts and will update as to that also. Recommended.
B000A0VOD2 My property by the hillside attracts many critters scavenging for food during the hot, dry months.  The main pests are wild hares, mice, gophers, and on rare occasions, a deer.  This Deer Off II was sprayed on foliage along the slope behind my backyard while I usedHavahart Critter Ridder 3146 Animal Repellent, 5-Pounds Granular Shakerin my front/backyards for combined repelling in two zones.  The motorized sprayer is simple and useful but does take a minute or two to prime up (fill with liquid repellent) during initial use.  After two weeks, I haven't seen an critters during daylight hours and there are less burrowed holes on the ground.  I do appreciate this sample but $32.53 for 1/2 gallon (64oz.) of liquid repellent is rather costly.  The  manufacturer claims of covering over 1000 sq. ft. and lasting 3 months per one application remains to be seen.  The putrid scent of rotten eggs may deter rodents and herbivores but might actually attract scavengers like crows, coyotes, and skunks.  Overall: good critters deterrent to keep them off my property but questionable long term effectiveness.
B000A0VOD2 We had a deer nibbling on our garden, she snacked on the cucumber plant, corn and peas. We sprayed this on the garden and she hasn't been eating anything lately but it is hard to tell for sure because she had a fawn and once the fawn was big enough she is venturing further away so she just might not be coming to the garden any more? That is why I am not positive it is the product that is working or if she just changed her pattern of travel.
B000A0VOD2 I had always avoided buying Deer Off because of its price -- I always make my own repellent in the kitchen -- but the motorized sprayer attracted me to this version of the product.  I have 1.5 acres, and protecting all the susceptible plants and shrubs with my home brew and a spray bottle gets tiring.  The Havahart combination of deer/squirrel/rabbit repellent and a motorized sprayer makes treatment MUCH easier as well as effective.First, the results:  Most of my plant damage comes from deer and groundhogs, although rabbits also get their teeth on some of the more tender plants.  Since this cannot be used on vegetable gardens (you don't want to taste this stuff!), I treated the shrubs and plants the deer tend to munch on.  I had previously triedHavahart Critter Ridder 3146 Animal Repellent, 5-Pounds Granular Shakerwith mixed results.  I applied this product on the areas that were still getting eaten.  Twenty-four hours after I applied Deer Off, I actually saw a deer back away from a garden without a nibble.  Success!  I also know from using a home brew that the deer that dare taste leaves treated with repellent tend to leave the plant alone in the future, even after the repellent wears off, which makes this longer lasting than expected or even advertised.  Obviously, new deer that come onto my property haven't had this same taste experience, so plants can be vulnerable after a couple of months.  Whereas the Critter Ridder discouraged animals from trying new snacks, it didn't deter them from old pleasures since it doesn't alter the taste of them.  This spray does taste bad to them-- and for that reason, it works really well.Second, the application:  The motorized sprayer comes with two AA batteries, already installed.  You need to shake the bottle, replace the original cap with the one at the base of the sprayer assembly, unlock the nozzle, squeeze the trigger, and you're applying the repellent.  The sprayer does need to be primed the first time.  Instead of the several seconds I expected, it took almost a full minute to get the stuff through the tube the first time.  In fact, it took so long that I removed the sprayer to check for holes or crimps in the tubing.  I was convinced that something was wrong despite the motorized sound.  Be patient!  After the first priming, you don't have to wait that long again.Third, the specifics:  This repellent is basically putrified eggs, garlic, and hot pepper.  The egg smell drives animals away, and the hot pepper and garlic, while adding to the nasty smell, serve as taste repellents as well.  This does not smell as bad as mine on application, and I cannot detect much of a scent after it dries.  If you or anyone in your household has an allergy to eggs, do not apply.  Because of the hot pepper, it will burn if you get it in your eyes.Pros: Sprayer works well once primed; repellent actually works over the course of 2-3 months; relatively mess-free, unless you apply on a breezy day.Cons: Price per ounce compared to a similar home brew; you can't use it on vegetable gardens.If you want a ready-to-apply deer repellent that comes with an easy-to-use spray applicator, this product is great.  More frugal homeowners may wish to mix their own from concentrate or create their own.-- Debbie Lee Wesselmann
B000A0VOD2 it was easy to assemble, it was easy to use and gave a continuous full spray and that's all it did. The rabbits came last night, and I sprayed it about 8 p.m 3 times with the spray being just inches above the plants to give full coverage. I did that 3 times just to be sure and the plants were fine. 10 1/2 hours later, all the 25 ft. row of collarobi (sp) had been eaten down to the ground and the same with the two 25 ft. rows of beets. They even ate the tops off the onions about 5 inches down. It DOESN'T work. All the fancy packaging and the battery powered spray doesn't matter if it doesn't work and it doesn't.... I have fence around the entire area so rabbits and squirrels are about all that get in, coons and skunk and deer can't. Save your money............. put barbed wire around your garden...UPDATE: I tried this 3 times and nothing worked about it, including the motor on the sprayer. I had to pour it into another sprayer to use it and YES, I turned it off after spraying and I even put new batteries in it and nothing..... The spray handle with the motor for spraying was the only thing that worked in the first place and now even it is useless...
B000A0VOD2 I live in the suburbs so don't have problems with deer or even coyotes, but rabbits, squirrels and mice seem to think my back yard is a Grand Central Station for rest, food and play--and this is with a dog. The dog, however, is a very gentle wolfhound and they all seem to know she isn't going to spoil their fun or dinners.  I saw the Deer Off on the Amazon Vine program for review and thought I'd try it.First off, I had no trouble using the product. The battery powered sprayer was easy to use and pretty precise in terms of my directing the liquid. The smell is quite, um, odorous. So therefore, I waited until my neighbor went on vacation before I sprayed between our houses. She keeps her windows open I felt she would appreciate the smell just about as much as the rabbits, squirrels and mice. Good call on my part as the stuff really does smell.Now as to whether it works. I put the stuff on the side of the house where the squirrels like to convene to chat, play and court one another. I put more of the stuff in the back yard gardens where the bunnies seem to think the adjoining flower gardens are theirs for the munching. And finally I put some under the deck where I have seen some mice. No point in making them feel welcome to expand their territory and enter the house.I have seen far fewer squirrels dancing around the side of the house. Normally they run up the tree across the roof (either mine or the neighbors) walk along the fence and generally eat any bulb I plant! As far as the back yard gardens go, the nibbling on the plants does seem to be less frequent. One side benefit for me is that my dog is a digger and she doesn't seem to like the smell and has decided not to dig in the places I sprayed. This is well worth the price of the Deer Off and when I run out I'll definitely buy more if it will keep her from digging. My back yard sometimes looks like a grenade or land mine exploded with all of her holes. As far as the mice go? Well, they aren't in the house!
B000A0VOD2 I have lots of mulched areas in my yard. After using Havahart Deer Off II, I have noticed that the squirrels and rabbits do not go near those sprayed areas. It is wonderful to not have to clean up the mulch everyday...and plants can continue to grow! The sprayer was amazingly simple to use with the battery powered sprayer and it takes much less effort than using a hand triggered device. I don't have any deer around my property, so I can't address its effectiveness in keeping them at bay, but it sure worked for repelling the other critters. I'm looking forward to spring!
B000A0VOD2 I must have read the \"Please Read This Before Use\" single sheet of paper six times to no avail.  My motorized sprayer simply would not work.  I primed, I changed batteries, and I would have even attached the twist on wand had I been provided one.  To put it quite simply, the well-meaning sprayer was a total dud.  I'd suggest that if you do need this product (and I do) that you invest in a reliableSolo 420 2-Liter One-Hand Pressure Sprayerand forget about the innovative, but flawed sprayer.The \"Deer Off\" itself does work and there are several positive things to think about.++  You can safely use it around children an pets, but take note that you will want to keep it out of reach as you would any product.  Think pepper here.++  It has USDA approval to use in organic gardens.++  I could not smell odor once sprayed, but it is offensive to those critters you don't want chomping on your plants.++ Deer Off will repel deer, squirrels, and rabbits.CONS:-- Unreliable, flawed motorized sprayer--  The critters may head for your neighbor's gardens (this can be either a pro or a con, depending on how you perceive it).--  It's difficult to use this product in larger gardens due to the limitations of the spray.--  If you experience heavy rains, application should be repeated.I'm conflicted in applying a star rating for this product.  I'd give it five stars had the motorized power sprayer actually worked because application of the Deer Off should have been simple.  On the other hand, Deer Off appears to be working using an alternate sprayer.  The squirrels are leaving the sunflowers alone and the deer aren't chomping them off at the stems.  And so, this entire packet didn't live up to what it promised and I'm having to compromise at three stars.  It would have been better simply to send the Deer Off sans the dud of a sprayer and include a hand-held one.
B000A0VOD2 We have a ton of wild bunnies where I live and I love to grow green beans.  Unfortunately, the bunnies love the green bean plants too.  I was having a worse than usual year where they were chewing my beans down to the ground regularly.  I got the Deer Off and, guess what, I have green bean plants again!  It has completely stopped them from eating my plants.  I also love the battery powered sprayer.  My garden is decent sized and other sprayers make my hand sore by the time I'm done which makes me less likely to use the product as often as I should.  With this, I just hold the trigger down and it does all the work.  My only complaint is that it washes away when I water or it rains so I'm out there every single day applying the Deer Off.  If it rains or I water and don't do it, the bunnies are back snacking on my green bean plants.
B000A0VOD2 The local deer population pretty much rules my neighborhood. While the squirrels (A.K.A.--\"tree rats\") are entertaining, they can also be destructive. That's why I decided to give this product a shot. I was somewhat disappointed with what I received.The battery-powered sprayer is not very strong. The nozzle does not fan out the spray very wide nor far. That made it difficult to reach the branches of my trees that the little buggers like to nibble on.Thankfully, the product does not smell bad--something I was a little concerned about, considering that \"putrescent whole egg solids,\" capsaicin and garlic are its active ingredients. I like that it is made of natural ingredients that won't hurt other animals (especially pets).It doesn't seem to have made much of a difference keeping the pesky critters away from our trees or out of the yard. Although I did hear a squirrel scolding shortly after I sprayed some trees in my front yard, I really can't say whether it's a truly effective deterrent to these animals.
B000A0VOD2 We have a yard full of fruit trees that we never get to enjoy any fruit from.We also have a mature pecan tree and have to purchase pecans.The squirrels steal everything before it's ready to harvest.I was excited to try this and hoped it would allow us to sample some of the fruit we never get to eat.The battery operated sprayer is very nice, making it extremely easy to use.Our squirrels must be very determined little critters because they weren't phased by the product and continued to strip the fruit from the trees at their normal pace.Part of the problem may be their ability to leap from tree to tree without having to climb the trunks to get to the fruit.The product may work better under different circumstances.
B000A0VOD2 Easy enough to apply and not messy.In order to test it's effectiveness we not only applied this to our own trees but with the permission of one of our neighbors we applied it to two of her trees as well. This was two months ago and I have to admit that all the trees that were treated with this product were avoided by the deer. Including our neighbors two trees, while her other trees and bushes were chewed on instead. I suppose it will remain to be seen how long it will last over all, I'm sure we got the mileage we did because of the extended dry weather we experienced her in Wyoming this summer. Moisture I'm sure would wash away the Deer-off rather quickly otherwise.This bottle contained enough to cover 8 trees and 4 small shrubs. In a dry climate one dose can last up to two months, however I'm sure that in a wetter climate multiple re-applications would be necessary.
B000A0VOD2 The product is easy to apply. I use it around some raised planters, the garden, and our dryer vent which leaves the house only about 8 inches above the ground (we've gotten critters in it before). It does seems to work (for us on rabbits) as the plant damage is lessened in the raised planters and garden. Our yard is fenced so deer are not a problem and I couldn't test it on them. This summer the product lasts longer as it was extremely dry. I do reapply after it rains otherwise it loses it effect. Good to use/try if exposed plants are getting visits by rabbits.
B000A0VOD2 Here in Heber Springs we have many deer roaming through the town. I have a problem keeping them from munching on my bushes and stripping the bark from my trees. Other than that, I love to see them wandering around. I have tried other products that keep the deer off of my plants and shrubs, they work, but my poor hands pay the price after applying them. When I saw this product with the battery powered spray, I had to have it. It works and my hands no longer suffer. What's not to love?
B000A0VOD2 I live in the country and there are a lot of deer and rabbits out here.  I use the Havahart Deer Off II around the outside of my house to keep these creatures from dining on my lovely wife's plants.  This sprayer is so easy to use and it even came with the needed batteries.  The best thing about this sprayer is I just depress the trigger and it sprays where ever I point the nozzle.  No more pumping my old sprayer.  The container with the repellent is not even heavy to carry around while I spray.  Lightweight is good.  Most importantly, it did not kill my wife's plants or the woodland creatures.  Also, the battery operated sprayer is reusable.  I will purchase the Havahart repellent for my sprayer when I run out, but I think the half gallon will last awhile.  This is a great product.
B000A0VOD2 As a gardener, I'm familiar with Deer Off. Like most of the smelly deer repellents, it works, but has to be renewed after rainfall.As a codger, I'm finding hand-held sprayers somewhat of a chore, particularly when spraying the whole garden, so I welcomed the idea of an electric spray gun.Unfortunately, this one doesn't work.I read the instructions carefully, shook the container, inserted the feed to the pump and pulled the trigger. Result - not much. The pump whined away for a while, but nothing came out of the nozzle. Eventually, after several minutes, with the batteries starting to show the strain, the pump primed, and a stream of liquid came out. When I adjusted the nozzle to convert the stream to a spray, the result was disappointing - there wasn't enough pressure to produce a decent spray. I tried spraying some of my shrubs, but the results were unsatisfactory.As an experiment, I tried cleaning the intake with water, in case it had been blocked. During the process, I found an interesting phenomenon - the pump produced a good spray pattern when handling water, but not the thin sludge that is Deer Off.Bottom line - it doesn't work. It might be better with a more powerful pump.
B000A0VOD2 We live in a wooded area in Wisconsin.  Our woods begin where our lawn ends with the nearest house 1/2 mile away.  We have had \"issues\" with deer, bear, coyotes, raccoons and little ones like rabbits and gophers.  We've tried moth balls, pepper, red pepper flakes, etc.  Nothing really worked on a consistent basis.It is nice to see deer in the yard but my goal is to keep them away from our flower beds and trees.  Just a few days before we applied this a group of 4 deer were munching away on a tree we had just planted.  Our flowers are often grazed on also, particularly our lilacs.What impressed me right off the bat was the sprayer, first off the batteries were installed so we could go right to work and second it comes with a holster on the container.  The sprayer works great, you can adjust the spray and it sprays about two feet.The product does seem to work.  The plants and trees this was sprayed on have been fine for about a week.  There is really no concrete way to know for sure, we have gone weeks with no problems with no product used and then have had deer using our yard as a person feeding station.While I realize this is an expensive product I do not think you have to do more than a spray or two on foliage for it to work and given what a four or five foot tree costs and how depressing it is to find it stripped for leaves, not to mention flowers, it is worth it.
B000A0VOD2 The sprayer works well and it's so convenient to use.  Since I have arthritis I love the battery power.I used this on my bird feeder and it's absolutely amazing.  Not a squirrel since and it doesn't hurt the birds.  Where has this been all my life?June 2012 update: The pump only worked the first time and since then I've had to put the stuff in another pump to deliver.  Even then, when we got a prolonged amount of dry weather and the grass was dry, NO-thing kept the deer from eating my hostas and flowers.  I guess anything is better than starving.  Ditto with the squirrels.  They eat their way through the product to get to the food.
B000A0VOD2 My home is located about half way between where the deer reside and the lake that they like to visit. They usually stop by here to munch on my wife's hosta plants. When the deer are not enjoying the hostas there are rabbits that like to do the same. I have used various types of sprays but none have been effective in keeping the uninvited guests away from the hostas. I decided to give Deer Off a try in hopes of rescuing what was left of the plants.Deer Off comes in a fairly standard battery powered sprayer that is similiar, if not identical, to sprayers available at Lowes. I have purchased a number of these types of sprayers with insect killer and other types of contents. The Deer Off sprayer was easy to setup. The batteries were already installed so all that was required was to remove the storage/shipping cap and replace it with the cap with the attached hose. It takes a short time, perhaps 10 or so seconds, to prime the pumping action and a reasonably forceful spray is available to apply to the plants. There have been no unwelcome visitors since I sprayed the hostas so 5 stars is warranted. The battery operated sprayer makes treatment easy and the contents are effective plus I got an attaboy from the hostas owner. It's all good.
B000A0VOD2 We live on a 7+ acre area in the mountains.  It is a haven for deer.  Unfortunately, with deer come deer ticks.  It creates a risk for my family and my dog.  I found this product to be quite effective in spraying the immediate area around my house and part of the yard.The sprayer is relatively lightweight and not cumbersome to operate.  The unique delivery method of this device is the use of a battery powered sprayer.  If you've ever done extensive spraying, you can find my fingers getting pretty tired after just a few minutes.  This method alleviates that.The smell of the solution is quite strong so I had to put this in the periphery of the yard.  My dog didn't even like the smell, and neither did I.  With the frequent rain and snow that we have had, it hasn't lasted as long as I would have expected (roughly 2 months).Considering that this is roughly a $200 per year treatment (6 times a year), I need to see if there are more economical solutions.Overall, though, I'm pleased with the results.  The family of deer that sleep on my lawn are no longer there.  Maybe they're at the neighbors?  Hahahahahahahahahahaha
B000A0VOD2 I used this product on and around a bird feeder to keep the squirrels away. So far they are staying away. There were some things I liked and didn't like about this product.First the things I liked: This product is made from natural products such as garlic and pepper. I feel much better about using this in my yard, rather than toxic chemicals. Also, it really was easy to use, once the spray started flowing. However I did have to leave the battery-powered spraying mechanism on for approximately a minute before the product began spraying.The one thing I did not like: The directions say to remove the batteries and dry them off before using. When I did this I discovered two of the four batteries were leaking and corroded. Not a pleasant surprise in a new product. After I replaced them, the product did work, however when a product says \"batteries included,\" I assume they mean non-leaking, functional batteries! Also the spray mechanism and battery compartment door seem of cheap quality, so I'm not sure if the spraying mechanism will last long enough to use up all the product.Howev
B000A0VOD2 The Havahart Deer Off Ready-To-Use Repellant applied a lot of repellent quickly. It was easy to set the direction of the spray. The battery option was a great addition to spraying to keep the deer from eating and/or trampling our plants and it made the application process a lot easier. It appears to work well as there has been no damage of plants after the first application.On the other hand, there was no wand with our bottle of repellant which made it impossible to apply a fine mist/spray (packaging implied it should have been part of what we received). The bottom compartment was hard to open and the nozzle we had to use because of having no wand dripped while applying.Update: This spray is doing a fantastic job of keeping the squirrels out of the birdfeeders.
B000A0VOD2 I live in an area with lots and lots of deer.  They consider our landscaping to be a private salad bar, eating the more delectable perennials right down to ground level.  I tried a lot of different deer repellents, none of which worked very well.  I spoke with a fellow who runs a nursery about half a mile from my house.  I figured he must have a solution to protect his thousands of bedding plants.  He swore by Deer Off.  I tried it, and it really did keep the deer from eating my landscaping plants.  The only problem was that it was inconvenient to mix and apply the product.  So I was eager to try this ready-to-use version that comes with its own sprayer.  I can report that it's super convenient, and the sprayer works well.  Convenience is important, since inconvenience means procrastination, and procrastination means chomped plants.On the downside:  This is a more expensive way to buy Deer Off, and the sprayer requires batteries.  I wish it were a pump sprayer, but based on experience with similar products I'm guessing the batteries will last a long time, so no big deal.  You could achieve the same result by buying the concentrate and a pump sprayer, and leaving the sprayer filled with Deer Off.  That would probably be a more efficient solution if you have a lot of plants, but this package is convenient for smaller areas.
B000A0VOD2 There are at least two things I like about the Deer Off repellant product produced by Havahart [...].  First it is applied using a battery operated nozzle which avoids acquiring carpel tunnel syndrome by repeated hand-squeezing to keep the spray going.Second is that the product uses odors to repel deer, squirrels and rabbits instead of chemicals that could permanently harm these pests. I just want to keep them out of my garden, not kill them. The odors are produced from the active ingredients of putrescent whole egg solids and garlic  Putrescent whole egg solids is a distinct smell that mimics the smell of a dead animal and alerts nuisance animals that a predator might be nearby. In addition to creating a bad scent, Deer Off also relies on garlic and hot pepper substances to cause a taste irritation to stop deer, rabbits and squirrels from feeding on plants and foliage.The Deer Off scent dissipates and dries odorless to humans while keeping animals away from the protected area, up to three months according to the manufacturer (I'd be happy with one month). Because all-natural products are used this repellent will not harm pets, children or adults. One-half gallon of the repellent is enough to treat some 100 shrubs four-feet or taller or 1,000 square feet of garden area.Now that I can keep squirrels out of my garden I can concentrate on keeping them off my bird feeders.
B000A0VOD2 Hey, the deer around here are as thick as flies -- it is hard to keep the deer out of the yard and garden -- this product is one of the few things I found that has a chance of working. It is easy to use with the battery-powered sprayer, too.
B000A0VOD2 This is so easy to use wtih very little effort becasue of the battery powered sprayer. It works well to protect your veggie garden or flower garden from the bunnies, squirrels,and deer. It even kept the pesky ducks from the park next door away from my veggies.  Last a long time. Remember to reapply after heavy rain.
B000A0VOD2 We have lots of deer in our area and they will try to eat almost everything. I have used this on Fusicas, which deer really love, and they won't touch them. The battery powered sprayer makes this a little less messy to use as well as sparing the hands from pumping a sprayer.
B000A0VOD2 I live in Montana, and it is fairly common to see deer in your yard, even in town. It's not really a big deal except they do eat your fruits and vegetables sometimes, and they do leave the occasional mess. At my house, the problem was more with the squirrels. We have a lot of wildlife around my home, and the squirrels (I think) are always eating from my various fruit plants. It may be deer, I am not sure. However, I sprayed the problem area and surrounding areas with the Deer Off and it seemed to do the trick. Fruit hasn't been missing and I have seen less and less signs of unwanted animal activity during the night. Again, I am not exactly sure what animal I am repelling, I assume it is squirrels, but if you have any problem with deer, squirrels, or rabbits getting in your yard and bothering your plants, try this out. I think it is also available in smaller sizes if you aren't ready to commit to this large size.
B000A0VOD2 The rabbits had me at my wits end having destroyed a large section of a newly sodded lawn. The rabbits were having their way with me and I was losing the battle. I started using Deer Off, reseeded the bare sections, and now my lawn is green again. The \"power\" nozzle makes spraying a large area a snap allowing me to cover the perimeter of the lawn quickly. A single treatment lasts about three to four days or until we have a rain. At the first sign of the little vermin I get out the sprayer and re-apply Deer Off. I might be applying it a little sooner than really needed but when I see the first rabbit droppings I do a new application.I like it much better than the other product I was using because it does not have to be mixed and does not leave my clothes and hands with an awful odor.
B000A0VOD2 I was interested in trying this product to keep the deer away from the hostas in my yard.  In reading and re-reading the product description here at Amazon, I couldn't find out what was in it.  I'm allergic to capsaicin (chili peppers), and I've had allergic reactions to animal repellents in the past, so I needed to know if this product has any capsaicin. Fortunately, the product description includes a toll free number to call for more information.  The customer service representative on the other end of the line was extremely helpful.  She told me Deer Off contains not only capsaicin, but also egg solids and garlic.  So if you're allergic to eggs, capsaicin, or garlic, you shouldn't use this product.  She suggested I try another Havahart product, Defense, instead, which has eggs, but no capsaicin.So, while I didn't get to try Deer Off because of my allergies, I found Havahart Customer Service quite polite as well as informative and helpful.  But since this product contains food ingredients, the foods should be listed here on the product description page so that people with food allergies can easily tell what's in it before ordering it.  In general, if you have food allergies, especially to eggs or spices, always check the ingredients of animal repellents before using them in your yard.
B000A0VOD2 The battery-operated Havahart DO64MS Deer Off sprayer seems useful for those with weak hands, but at an additional cost of replacement batteries. This all-natural organic formula repels by taste and odor deer, rabbits, squirrels and possibly other nuisance animals unless they are starving or otherwise out of normal control, e.g. rabid.  This is not an industrial repellent working against anything that walks, but rather for the suburban home and garden use.  Its garlic, putrescent egg, and capsaicin are not offensive to all people and thus applicable not only in gardens, lawns, and landscaped areas, but also some basements, cellars, and storage.
B000A0VOD2 First thing I did when getting this, was something that the instructions don't mention:  spray along the perimeter of where you don't want the deer in.  Kind of attempting to use it as an invisible fence.  That didn't work.  Don't buy it if that's your intention.Then I tried using it how you're supposed to:  spray it directly on the plants that you don't want the deer to eat.  And...the deer haven't eaten anything (yet...it's been a week or so now.)  So, it looks like it works.  However, it rains a lot here in the PacNW, and I'm pretty sure the amount of rainfall is going to wash away the protection pretty easily...  so for me, a physical barrier (a circle of metal fencing around my fruit trees) is a bit more practical for my uses.However, if you are trying to protect a wider swath of plants all bunched up, then this will likely work well for you - spray it even over everything in the bunch and the deer will keep away...  Or if you have individual larger plants that are focus points of your yard (and thus, don't want fencing surrounding this), then this is also a great solution.Overall - it works, but make sure it's really what you want first.  Recommend in most cases...just not mine.
B000A0VOD2 When we were having problems w/ squirels scavenging and mucking around our backyard, we used this product. As far as I can tell, since we used the product, we haven't had any issues w/ squirrels and they haven't come back for quite some time even though we haven't sprayed again for many weeks.
B000A0VOD2 Havahart Deer Off II Deer, Rabbit And Squirel Ready to use repellent is excellent . I really like the sprayer, just add batteries and go. I have problems with my hand so this was great for me. No more pumping. So far I have had it around my plants for a few days and I have no deer or rabbit problems which I had before.Hopefully  it will  continue to work .I am one happy camper !!! You should give it a try.
B000A0VOD2 This contains the same ingredients as dog repellant, and it works on a large variety of animals, not just deer, rabbits, and squirrels.  This white milky liquid contains rotten eggs, hot pepper, and garlic.  It doesn't smell much to humans when you apply it, so I was able to use it around the garden close to the house without any noticeable after effects.  I never liked battery operated disposable sprayers, though.  It works fine, but I could have sprayed it faster with more power if it was manually operated.
B000A0VOD2 I cannot vouch for its effect on any other animals, but this product worked quite nicely in keeping squirrels away from bird feeders.  After application squirrels that had ignored all other attempts to scare them away refused to even try to climb the trees and posts I sprayed.Note: The battery powered sprayer is a nice touch though it will be more appreciated by people with larger areas to spray than I had.
B000A0VOD2 We have had a problem with squirrels chewing through our electric line that controls the motor for our retractable awning. The repair was quite expensive. The motor and lines are adjacent to a rain gutter and the squirrels made a nest near the motor using materials including the fabric on our outdoor furniture. I really enjoy the little rascals and didn't want to do them any harm, but finding an organic repellents isn't an easy task. This product is made by Havahart, the company known for its humane critter traps. The unit is a blessing because it has a battery powered sprayer and it is ready to use. There is no mixing of chemicals and it does not need to be attached to a garden hose, etc. The batteries are included. For those with large areas to protect, the hand grip is very comfortable. Each application is supposed to last three months. Since we just got this unit, only time will tell if our electric cable will deter the critters. The active ingredients include \"Putrescent Whole Egg Solids, Capsaicin and Related Capsaicinoids, Garlic...\"
B000A0VOD2 I'm pretty much a live and let live neighbor to the deer who live on our block.  They were here first and they haven't caused me any trouble.I feel differently about squirrels.The important part of the product description of this was the squirrel repellant.  We have had a 26 foot sailboat stored by our barn for about 6 years now and have recently uncovered it to start surveying what we needed to do to get it operational for our teenager by next summer.  While it was covered, a rather large extended family of squirrels seems to have moved in and made themselves at home.When we opened up the boat, they all scurried out the way they came - through cowl vents. As soon as we left, they moved back in.  We didn't want to close up the cowl vent and have them eat through fiberglass to get back in.  They probably couldn't do it but trying would do enough damage.Then we tried Havahart.  I trust Havahart around the pets.  We scared the squirrels out again; then we sprayed the tree branches above the sailboat and the cradle below it.  It's really easy to apply.  So far the squirrels stay away as long as the application is good.  But it's kind of like using sun tan lotion on the beach.  It needs to be reapplied when it gets soaked or snowed on.  (Snow hardly ever happens on the beach.  But you know what I mean.)
B000A0VOD2 We built a home that is near a protected wildlife area and had a real problem (yard is unfenced) with deer, rabbits, and not sure what other wildlife, munching down our landscaping pretty much constantly. Fencing would ruin the natural setting we enjoy, but we were definitely losing the landscape wars before we found this repellant spray. After the first application we noticed a lot less damage, and now that we got real thorough with the coverage of the spray, we have NO nibbles at all - plus it keeps the wildlife deposits (dung) away from the house. Recommended!
B000A0VOD2 Since I live near Yosemite national park, I get allot of deer.Deer off is ready to use right from the bottle,which comes with a battery operated sprayer you put into the Deer offbottle. This is very easy to use..Although I do find it does NOT go very far, or I'm spraying too much of it on a few of my plants.I wanted Deer Off for my  Organic  Veggies.It does say,\" For Organic Gardening\" in very little wording! But it does not say it can be used on Veggies !It says, \"Do not allow spray to drift onto plants intended for human consumptions!Since it says it is Organic, this is a bit confusing, and I'm dissapointed.I did spray it on a few plants I have that the Deer have been eating, and the Deer have NOT been eating those plants. Which I'm very happy about.It does say to use it very 2 to 3 months, or more often during periods when rain occurs.I used it every night for 4 days, and as I said, the Deer have stayed away.This contains egg solids which may cause allergic reactions in some individuals..Do not apply at temperatures below 40 degrees, or when wet ,or windy conditions.It does have a stinky small, which I'm sure is what keeps the Deer away.So far, I'm happy with this product, but disapointed, I can't use it on my veggies.I now put chicken wire over, or around my veggies, and put tin-foil on at night over some of my other veggies.The Deer do not like the tin-foil, and cannot get through the chicken wire..I would buy this again for my other plants that the deer eat.
B000A0VOD2 I've used this product for a few weeks. We've had a terrible time with animals eating our new plantings this year. We put out rose bushes, weigela, and spirea bushes this Spring, and I was at my wits end. I tried this, and it has helped. My advice to you is to try this product along with everything else and see what works. That's what I did, and the combination really helped.
B000A0VOD2 I like the battery powered spray, no more pain in my hand, but didn't care for the odor.  It looks like it's keeping the animals away.  But I think it'd keep anything away (including me).  It works, but be prepared.
B000A0VOD2 My mother is a senior citizen who has a lot of trouble with deer and rabbits eating her plants. She always plants lot of daffodils because they don't seem to eat those. This product is easy for her to use and it seems to be working.
B000A0VOD2 We have been using this product to keep the gophers out of our garden.  We live on a farm and it really gets to be a problem.  This product is quick and easy to use.  The sprayer works well and felt like good quality.This did so well at keeping the gophers (we call them rock chucks here) out that we sprayed a wide perimeter around the chicken coop to see if we can keep the skunks out.  Last year we lost 10 chickens to skunks.  So far, so good.  I know that we have had skunks in the are but none have attempted to get my chickens so I am pretty happy about that.
B000A0VOD2 We have a 900 square foot garden that my husband and I own & run on our church property in an urban area. I've been really fearful that the little rabbits are going to completely demolish our vegetables this year, things have barely started sprouting but they've already helped themselves to our spinach sprouts. We also see the burrowing holes they've started all over. The land our garden sits on is very large, and there is a LARGE rabbit population there. They are also very bold, and will come within 10 feet of us while we're working there.So, needless to say I was excited to try out this repellent. After just one use we saw the burrow holes stop, and rabbits seemed to keep themselves at more of a distance. It's spring now, so I will say that reapplying after the rain might get to be tedious, but it will be worth it. I really do think this product works.It's also easy to use, and doesn't really smell like much of anything to us. It feels like a safe product to use. We don't even spray it directly on our plants, we just go around the perimeter of our garden as well as very close to some highly sought after plants (like the spinach). I can't say if it works for deer or other pests, but as rabbits have been our setback, I CAN say that this repellent seems to work beautifully for that. Will update if this changes! Definitely recommended for now.
B000A0VOD2 UPDATE Dec. 22, 2012:  Do not let the solution freeze; it will no longer be viable.  Says so in the instructions.Squirrels are our problem.  We have huge 100+-year-old pecan, magnolia and oak trees in our yard.  We also have a few fig trees.  The squirrels do a lot of damage:  They eat bark, they tear off small limbs and bunches of leaves, they pester the bird nests, they eat pecans and they eat figs.  We've never seen them eat anything in our gardens, although we're forever digging out young pecan trees that sprout up from the nuts they've buried and forgotten.  Just in the past 5 months we have live-trapped about 50 of them (lured them into the trap with last year's pecans...).So I got this product to try out an idea I had:  To spray the tree trunks, part-way up.  I was hoping to prevent the squirrels from getting into the trees.  Last weekend I sprayed the trunks from a half-foot off the ground and up about 4-5 feet.This weekend I've been sitting on our front veranda and I've been watching for squirrels.  Last weekend they were bothering the momma birds and their nests in the magnolia trees.  There are quite a few nests in these two giant trees.  Last weekend the birds were kept pretty busy chasing off the squirrels and they made quite a bit of racket bickering back and forth, each in their own language.So, what did I observe this weekend?  No squirrels in the magnolia trees--not a single one.  I guess there could be other reasons for the squirrels to have disappeared from the front yard, and I guess that the squirrels will still be able to access our trees by jumping from our neighbor's trees, but all in all, my verdict is that this product works just fine.I also like the battery-operated sprayer.  For my long, slender fingers the nozzle could be more ergonomically correct and the trigger could be a little softer, but the concept is great and I appreciate the fact that I don't have to continually stop and pump up the pressure.  Our own big sprayer is a decent one and stays pressurized for quite a while, but our small sprayers lose their pressure quickly--and this is a small job.  So, I was glad to have this feature.  My husband sprayed the plastic fencing that he has surrounded the fig trees with and he reports that the nozzle gun feel great in his larger hand and better-padded fingers.UPDATE, June 25, 2012:  Our figs are getting big and several weeks ago we drove some metal stakes and surrounded two trees with plastic fencing to keep the squirrels out.  They're not huge trees yet and we'd kind of like to get to eat some of the fruit...  Well, I guess we overestimated the size of the squirrels and they were getting right through the holes.  When we saw them inside the fence, we sprayed the fence with this product.  Great news!  The squirrels have been stymied!  NOTE:  It is imperative that you re-spray after a heavy rain.  We don't get much rain where we're located so that's not too big a problem for us.
B000A0VOD2 I found that the motorized spray works great for me.  It is a lot easier to use than a squirt bottle as I am spraying the perimeter of my back yard and parts of my front flower beds.  I started a square foot garden this year and immediately had issues with rabbits coming in the back of my yard to eat a variety of green things.  After spraying with Deer Off II, I haven't seen any damage from rabbits.  Our area has squirrels, too, but as yet I haven't had problems with those.I suspect that I will need to reapply fairly often so I will update this review if I find the rabbits back or the squirrels coming to visit.
B000A0VOD2 This was so simple to use, comes with batteries installed in handle, shake it up and spray away. I have animal cameras in my yard so I know this really worked on the rabbits, I sprayed the base of my fruit trees, the edge of my whole yard at the base of the fence (1/2 acre) and the garden.The rabbits which were everywhere this year for some reason, they left, I did not see a rabbit for over two weeks after spraying, a squirrel who had just built a huge winter nest also left. I have not seen a deer in months so I can't say how it works on them yet, but the farmers should be pulling in the crops soon and than the deer start to come out more. Have to update on them later. I also get raccoons, opossum, skunk, ground hogs, and fox. After spraying they seem very interested and do a lot of sniffing around the sprayed plants, but have not eaten anything so I guess its working on them to. Nice my late season radish, lettuce, spinach, and peas are still there every morning. I do think it washed off a bit in the rain because over the last few days I noticed rabbits in the yard again. No problem as the one container is still 3/4 full. I will spray again. I like this stuff.
B000A0VOD2 I recently moved into the Texas Hill Country and have come to experience the daily devastation of plants caused by rabbits and deer. I started buying deer-resistant plants but it turns out that deer don't read the approved lists and eat most of them anyway. Then come the rabbits who arrive as packs of fluffy little plant chainsaws ready to destroy anything the deer missed. It's a monumental pain in the ass and short of building cages around the plants, solutions are hard to come by.This spray is easy to apply 
B000A0VOD2 We put this in our vegetable garden about a week ago and so far no deer or rabbits. Our poor neighbors had all of their tomatoes and spinach eaten by the Deer and the Rabbits the day after we used this, so I would say that is a pretty good indication.  My husband said applying was easy and the sprayer worked great.  So at this point, the product does what it says and so I recommend.  If anything changes and the Deer show back up, I'll post another review.*Added bonus, I LOVE that the ingredients are all very natural or I wouldn't have used.
B000A0VOD2 Deer Off is the first product that I have used that really does keep them off.  BUT, you need to reapply it on all new growth and new buds.  It does't stop them for a month or two (and it doesn't claim that it will).We finally had two growth periods before those little devils came in and clean out the next bloom crop!  But, I will still recommend it to others in my neighborhood.So, this is a good product but I'd like to see it work for at least 60 days or 2 bloom cycles.  That's why I gave it a 4 star rating.
B000A0VOD2 I live in southern Connecticut where at times it seems like the deer outnumber the people. That's fine with me since most of the time I prefer the company of animals to people (I'm a wildlife and travel photographer and writer). But that said, white-tailed deer can really do a number on expensive gardens and fencing seems pointless. I've seen huge deer clear a six-foot fence like it was a few inches tall. It's amazing how graceful and how high these deer can jump--and from a standing position. You have to admire their athletic skills. But oh, yes, there is still that matter of expensive gardens.I don't have much of a problem with deer in my own garden (but there are some raccoons I'd like to have a word with), so I got this (from the Vine program) for a friend of mine that lives in a slightly more rural area and has a two-acre garden--a mix of shrubs and a large organic vegetable garden. Since this product is labeled as \"all natural and organic\" he was willing to try it. Unfortunately we hit a cold spell just as the product arrived and you're supposed to use this when the temps are stable at 40-degrees F and above. So, we had to wait (in the meantime, the deer did a number on a lot of his shrubs). But in the past week the temps have begun to stabilize at around 40F and the rains and snow have relented a bit. (You obviously should not use this during a wet spell since the rain will wash it away.) So this week we sprayed.I have to say that the sprayer works very well (it takes a bit longer to prime than they suggest, no problem) and has a sufficient force to cover even tall shrubs and some apple trees (have you ever seen a deer on its hind legs? Almost nothing is out of reach). The sprayer uses 4 AA batteries and that seems reasonable and they don't weigh much.How is it working? It's only been a few days, so not enough time to really judge--but yes, the deer do seem to be avoiding the area that we sprayed--amazing. And theoretically, at least, the spray will deter them for up to three months. If this is true (time will tell), then it's worth the price a few times over. If you save one $100 shrub, well, there you go.I will report back in a few weeks. We're keeping a close eye on this garden and even shot some \"before\" video (right after the spraying) to try and keep the whole project honest. More to follow in a few weeks. By the way, I've been using Havahart traps since I was a kid and they are the best thing going for live-catching animals. Part of the reason that I became a wildlife photographer was that my parents gave me a trap when I was a kid and I became fascinated with the backyard animals.Update: 5/28/13: Seems to be working, there is considerably less deer traffic in the area where we sprayed it (twice). We got some rain after the first spraying, so that might have diminished its effectiveness, but had five days of nice weather after the second spraying and we have noticed that the shrubs seem to be enduring fewer attacks.
B000A0VOD2 I remember an old joke about someone who \"kept a diary\" about their move to Minnesota (though you could insert any northern state here, sorry Minnesota!).  When they first saw the beautiful landscape and snow during their first winter, they wondered how anyone can tire of such scenic wonder.  By the end of the winter, enduring freezing temperatures, endless snow shoveling, and hitting a deer with their car, the person was wondering who in their right mind would want to live in such a place.When I transitioned into adulthood and bought my own place, I went through such a phase.  However, my nemesis is the rabbit!  I moved to the suburban Midwest to an area where coyotes and hawks were not found amongst our manicured lawns and cedar fenced properties.  The result is a rabbit population like I have never seen in my years of growing up in rural America where predators roam and hunting is a way of life.While trying to make my property beautiful, being the scientific mind I am, I began to develop a theory that there is a direct relationship to how much a single landscaping plant cost and how tasty the local rabbit population finds it.  My \"non-indigenous\" $20 Home Depot potted flowers were a hit with the rabbit population while the local plant species that grow wild (aka weeds) were free to grow as high as the Willis Tower.I hate killing things for the sake of killing something and I really hate killing something that is just looking for a meal, so I began investigating non-lethal alternatives that did not involve live trapping and putting the pest in some poor farmer's field.  After failed attempts with moth balls, different repellent sprays, Milorganite, and other similar products and wives tales, my flower garden was still a high priced salad bar for the long eared minions.I had the opportunity to try Deer Off spray, which claims to ward off deer, rabbits, and squirrels.I first tried the product on some plants around my mailbox and waited a week.  The plants failed to survive, but not because of a poor product or determined bunnies.  An out of control car plowed through my planter and mailbox.  Hmmm...Deer Off does not deter out of control minivans.  Check!I moved to some other plants and I have to say I was quite pleased with the results.  My problem is with rabbits only, so I cannot speak as to the effectiveness of the product on deer and squirrels.Testing the product over the summer, I found out the following:1.  I tried applying directly to the plant as directed as well as tried applying to the soil around the plant but not on the plant itself.  Using the product on the plant itself had far better results.  If you are averse to applying this directly to your plants, applying it to the soil did help a little, but the results of doing so lasted a week at most before the rabbits began munching my tender pea plants.2.  The product does not last 3 months on fast growing plants.  After trying various times between applications on different plants, I would personally recommend applying to fast growing flower and vegetable plants every two weeks.I did not find the smell of the product that terrible at all.  Despite the active ingredient being putrescent egg solids, the smell of the solution reminded me of wet paint.  After the product dried, I did not notice the smell at all.I thought the battery powered sprayer was quite awesome.  While it is not difficult to use a classic trigger sprayer you have to constantly pump, the \"full auto\" batter powered sprayer made application very easy and quick.There were a few things I did not like about the product, but none of them were what I would deem deal breakers.  While the product did not require much \"assembly\", you did have to break the seal on the bottle and drop a flexible tube into the bottle.  I found this part a bit messy.  Second, a set of 4 AA batteries in the sprayer did not last me the entire summer.Overall, I was happy with this product for deterring rabbits.  An application of the repellent was good for about two weeks when I used it on faster growing annual plants.  I did not see the effectiveness of the product wane at all with time as long as I kept reapplying it.  If you have a rabbit issue, I would definitely say this product is worth a try.
B000A0VOD2 WOW... the smell... will deter most critters straight away.... do NOT open this inside without expecting to fumigate yourself and do NOT apply before a rain to be effective.The active ingredients are Putrescent Whole Egg Solids (fermented rotten egg smell!), Capsaicin (hot peppers to deter nibbling), and Garlic (provides odor & nibbling deterrent) so think of highly rotten eggs with hot sauce and vampire deterrent LOL  Yes, it'll work for it's intended purposes.  There may be better and cheaper homemade treatments, but the battery powered trigger is really awesome and worth the price of the product if you spray many things and don't have/want to use a pressure/pump sprayer.
B000A0VOD2 This works well but effectiveness drops off after a good rain. The smell also doesn't make it a great candidate for use near entertaining areas. While fresh it is effective, but the need to reapply coupled with the smell makes it less useful to me. The sprayer itself was useful and made the application pretty easy.
B000A0VOD2 I used this along a tree line by my house. I constantly have skunks and deer coming out of the woods and tearing up the yard so I was looking for something I could apply. I got this and the granules by Havahart and put the granules around my patio and sprayed this around the treeline. So far I haven't seen any critters so I assume it works!I like the battery sprayer, no more pumping.
B000A0VOD2 I have only recently started using this product. I didn't want to build a fence to keep rabbits out of my flower beds, so I decided to try this product. So far we are seeing good results. This seems to be a good inexpensive alternative to pricey unattractive fencing. This product is very easy to use, I really like the battery powered sprayer. No pumping or mixing, just squeeze the trigger, walk and let the spay do its job. Try this product before purchasing a fence for your gardens.
B000A0VOD2 I can not say how this works for deer but did cut down on the rabbits. I have a lot less in the yard now. Easy to apply..
B000A0VOD2 I have used the previous version of Deer Off so knew what to expect.  I loved the battery powered sprayer.  It is much easier than the old sprayer.  The Deer Off itself worked well.  We are in a drought and the deer are very hungry.  After I sprayed they left my flowers alone.  The only down side is the fact that after watering or rain (which we have not had) you have to re-spray.  I am having to water once a week just to keep things alive and that means that I have to re-spray.  I have quite a few flower beds so the Deer Off will only do a couple of spraying.
B000A0VOD2 I hastily ordered the Havahart DO64MS Deer Off II Deer, Rabbit, and Squirrel Ready-to-Use Repellent with Battery Powered Sprayer thinking that since it's for organic gardening, I would be able to spray this on my vegetable garden.  Being that there are warnings on the packaging, I contacted Havahart and received the following reply:\"Thank you for contacting Havahart regarding Deer Off and I apologize for the confusion.  The new labeling does state not to place it directly on the edible plant.  The following statement is the one reason that we state not to use it when it will be consumed by humans:This product contains egg solids which may cause allergic reactions in some individuals. Do not allow spray to drift onto plants intended for human consumption.This is why we do not suggest using it on edible plants is there are a quite a few people out there with egg allergies and that can cause issues.We suggest putting a barrier around the garden area or the area you want to protect.  All-natural DeerOff II is the only deer, rabbit and squirrel repellent that is OMRI Listed and compliant for use in organic gardening. Most importantly, it's specifically designed for safe use around children and pets.\"Since the concern is the egg content and I have no allergies to eggs, I sprayed the product around but not directly onto the plants in my garden.  I also sprayed the wire fence that the deer jump over in order to gain access into my community garden plot.The scent of deer scat was more offensive to me than the Havahart Deer Off II.  Although I wish the deer, rabbits and whatever four legged creatures that invade my space would eat the weeds and not everything I like to eat, I've seen no evidence that they were enjoying my buffet after the application.  In all honesty, I'm not sure if other gardeners are now providing them with more desirable morsels than my meager garden offers.  Since many deer have been displaced in my northern Virginia community by the Beltway expansion, they have been devouring the landscaping in my community.  I've also sprayed a bit around some severely affected areas and this stuff appears to work.I've noticed that the price has been reduced in the past couple days and I'm not surprised since it's also on sale at the Havahart website.  At the current price, I can recommend the repellant and might add that the battery operated spray sure makes the application easy.  I haven't had to change the enclosed batteries and expect that they will last through this jug.  If you're allergic to eggs, be especially careful when handling the liquid, but otherwise, I think we are safe.
B000A0VOD2 We don't get too many deer, so my testing can't confirm if this will help with deer issues or not, but I've used it to keep rabbits away from bushes in the winter and spring in Wisconsin.  We feed Squirrels and Rabbits and Raccoon, Opossums, and other small critters using feeders, mostly sunflower seeds, bird seed, and corn on the cob, so we get a lot of critters in the yard.  I like to feed them food, but not my bushes or young plants in the spring, so I've tried spraying this on the lower branches and they seam to stay away from those parts that have been sprayed - burning bushes especially.
B000A0VOD2 When first opening the package and putting it together I noticed how impatient I am.  The included batteries chose not to work as quickly as I expected; however, after changing them for fresh ones and after a little more patience the sprayer for the Havahart Critter Repellent worked with ease and the test began.  Deer Off II is of little value if there are few or no critters who roam the lands.  We have several \"gangs\" of deer, about 2 or 3 families of skunks, several raccoons and squirrels plus a whole hooting nanny of turkeys of different sizes.  Due to the nature of the land layout the deer have established a path from the hill across the street, across the creek and then through the front yard, up the back hill and into the woods.  I put down a blockade of Deer Off II to see if it had any impact.  It worked and after several days of rain and heat it still works.  Yesterday I was watching out for a delivery and I noticed a herd of deer crossing the creek about 100 yards away instead of using their normal path through our yard.  They are so pretty especially now when their antlers are beginning to lose the felt covering but they can eat an azalea plant in a short time.  I cannot tell about the other critters yet.  They mostly travel at night and I do not.  I put down a circle around the garbage can and as of now there have been no signs of critters other than a lizard leaving droppings most would not believe in terms of size for its size.  Nature is wonderful as long as it recognizes an old curmudgeon such as I.  Great product and works better than I expected.
B000A0VOD2 I had picked this from the Vine selection because I have a few areas in my back yard with sand.  One for temporary pools I set up in the summer for my young son, and the other area for the play set / swing set.  I get a lot of small animals back there, rabbits, squirrels, etc, and got tired of animal droppings and such.  So I figured this was worth a shot.We had a few days without rain in the forecast, so I applied it one afternoon when I got home from work.  The motorized pump is a fantastic answer - I don't know how many times I've gone around my yard with standard spray bottles even for things as random as weeds, and the fingers and forearm feel the burn after a bit.  And that's just for spots here and there.  Doing a larger area would not be something I'd look forward to.  So this worked great, once you got past the initial priming.I sprayed just the areas I wanted them kept out of, and surprisingly over the next couple days they really did avoid those areas in the back yard.  So I decided to spray again after a rain storm we had, and this time I extended it to more areas, including around the front yard perimeter.  I have some careless cat owner living in the area whose cat must spend more time around my yard than it does at home.  And we have a lot of people walking dogs in our neighborhood, some of whom aren't as careful about where their pets do their business as I'd like them to be.  And this has also helped some with those as well.  I haven't seen the cat even once after spraying around.  Dogs tend to stay on the sidewalk.I don't have any deer in this area to keep away, so I can't attest to the effectiveness against them, but it really does seem to work well for other animals, even ones I hadn't anticipated.  And the power sprayer makes this just a breeze to apply - just make sure you're pointing it WITH the wind when you apply it, don't want to be getting it on yourself...
B000A0VOD2 I got this product specifically for humanely deterring squirrels.  For some reason, this season I have had a major issue with squirrels destroying plants in my vegetable and flower gardens - they were eating the flower heads off my sunflowers, chewing my corn plants, stealing my tomatoes and digging annoying little holes everywhere in the garden.After one liberal application of \"Deer Off\", the squirrels have not been back.  I don't even see them coming near my plants anymore.  I am also pleased so far with how long a single application has lasted.  It has been over a week and I have even had one tropical storm/depression roll through without any loss of effectiveness.  When I start seeing the squirrels come back I will simply reapply the product.  The power sprayer makes it easy to spray and the large, ready to use sized bottle provides enough for 3-4 repeated applications in my small sized gardens.The sprayer seems a little inconsistent, but it sure beats spraying by hand.  It helps if you adjust the nozzle to the desired spray pattern.I have to say that I was skeptical of this product but I have become a believer.  I will continue to use this product to rid my garden areas of those pesky, destructive squirrels. By the way, I also sprayed an \"invisible border\" around my bird feeder and this has effectively kept the squirrels out of my bird seeds (the birds don't seem to mind).
B000A0VOD2 This product is easy to use, and effectively repels vermin from my plants.The battery-powered sprayer includes four AA batteries required for operation. It has a three foot tube that extends from the lid, and I am able to hold the jug comfortably during application. The instructions mention a fine mist wand, but I didn't see one, but the main, twisting nozzle adjusts from stream to spray.The \"natural\" ingredients are clearly listed; however, these only make up 4.632% of the total solution. There are 95.368% of other undisclosed ingredients.
B000A0VOD2 I've got some big redwood trees in my backyard and every year my squirrel population seems to grow.  They run around my yard eating flowers, digging up my grass (I used to think it was gophers), fighting with each other and creating a racket.Anyway, I figured I'd give this Havahart repellent a try.  I sprayed it around my yard.  It works, less squirrel activity around my yard.  They're either sticking to the redwood trees or moved on to my neighbor's house.So it was worth it for me, 5-stars.
B000A0VOD2 I've been using this for years. It is a great product for deer. Just remember to respray after a lot of rain. That seems to be the fatal flaw in all of these products. The battery sprayer sure beats pumping too!
B000A0VOD2 The bane of my garden is deer. I usually have a problem with them nibbling the blooms on my tomato plants, then they return and eat a few leaves each day until there is not much left of the plants. I have no idea why they feel tomato foliage is so tasty, it stinks. Apparently adding this product with it's \"putrescent egg product\" makes the foliage reach the bad smell tipping point until it's no longe palatable. Or maybe the capsaicin does the trick... I just know that we're midway thru June, in the midst of a 4-week drought, and I've had no deer damage on plants set out in mid-April. I sprayed them with this product weekly beginning in early May. I've seen deer around, but they are leaving the tomatoes alone so far. I usually set out extra plants so I can maybe have a fruit or 2 for myself through the season, this year I might have enough to give away.I don't have a problem with rabbits or squirrels, so I can't attest to the performance of this product on them.The included battery-powered sprayer is great. They thoughtfully included the batteries too. I think I'll repurpose the sprayer for fungicide/insecticide when the DeerOff is all gone.I'd buy this product.
B000A0VOD2 It doesn't mention this in the product description (but does on the bottle), but this product is not supposed to be used on edible plants. Well, I'm a vegetable gardener with a rabbit problem, and if I can't spray it on things I'm going to eat, it's useless to me. This, despite saying it's safe for use around kids. Had I known this from the description, I never would have ordered it.It does get one star because my mom uses a product with the same active ingredient on her roses, and it does keep the deer away (although it stiiiiiinks).If I get brave enough to ignore the warning labels and spray it on the kale, I'll update.
B000A0VOD2 The sprayer system here is great.  It uses a battery pump to spray out the product.  If you have ever walked around your property squeezing a sprayer hundreds of times, you know what a (literal) pain that can be.The sprayer takes a bit of time to get primed initially.  Just hold the trigger for a minute or so and it will start working.The batteries are already in place - just flip the \"safety\" switch and pull the trigger.The product itself seems to work.  I have deer, squirrels, groundhogs, and chipmunks.  All had been eating a small garden I have on the side of my house.  I sprayed this stuff on the garden and - after just a few days - I can see the garden starting to come back to life.  The creatures are leaving it alone.  I can also smell the product is still working.  It leaves quite a scent!I like this product a lot and will probably buy more when this runs out - which says something.I knocked off one star because I thought the directions were lacking.  They print the directions in so many languages it is tough to find english and I never could find a definitive list of plants that this was approved for or creatures it blocks.It seems to be safe for my flower/herb garden.
B000A0VOD2 My parents have a strawberry patch out back and use this to protect it from deer and rabbits.  It did the trick and allowed them to walk out there and spray the surrounding area without too much effort.  We hadn't seen any bites in the patch after having used this stuff - so it must work!  And we have some AGRESSIVE rabbits, too!!
B000A0VOD2 I ordered this product in desperation.  The rabbits and squirrels ate most of my garden.  I got this product and applied it around the perimeter of my garden area as the label says not to apply directly to plants you plan to eat.  1 day things were good then my peas disappeared.  I am very disappointed.
B000A0VOD2 I use this at my cabin which is in the woods with lots of deer & rabbits.  My hydrangeas have never gotten beyond 3 feet tall because the deer keep them \"pruned\".  The deer always browse the new growth so the plants looked healthy but no flowers.  Since this is a vacation house, I'm not there to chase off the deer.  We have security cameras so since I started using this product, I've seen footage of the deer going to the bushes, nibble & walking away.  Yea!  I used to have footage of the deer enjoying my bushes.It is rain \"resistant\" & it did last through several significant rain storms in the two weeks after I applied it.  I could still see the milky residue on the leaves although it had definitely washed off some of it.  I reapplied it just to be sure.  The 90-day claim is perhaps a bit optimistic unless there has been very little or no rain.The milky residue is not terrible looking but it is visible up close;  I think it looks better than putting up fence around all the bushes.  It does have a noticeable odor for a couple hours after application.  You may want to consider that if you're spraying near your patio & planning on having dinner there.  But it's not very offensive; just kind of sour smelling.This is an expensive option for deer repellant.  I really don't think it should cost this much considering the ingredients are not unusual.  The battery sprayer is a nice option if you have any weakness or arthritis in your hands or arms (the 4 AA batteries are included).  Just make sure to rinse off the end of the nozzle when you're done spraying or it will probably be clogged next time you use it.  I just turn off the power to the sprayer (lock position), open the little spray nozzle all the way & put it under running water.  I've had no clogs so far.UPDATE 8/2012:  This is working really well.  My plants have grown more than any other year & the deer/rabbits are staying away.  This is the only thing I've tried (other than fencing) that keeps them from nibbling.  I reapply the repellant every 2-3 weeks if there has been any significant rain.
B000A0VOD2 Havahart DO64MS Deer Off II Deer, Rabbit, and Squirrel Ready-to-Use Repellent with Battery Powered SprayerThere seems to be an endless parade of some cute little squirrel or bunny rabbit wandering around my yard (especially in the late evening and at night) looking for something to chow-down on -- vegetable gardens, flower beds, newly planted bulbs and roses -- especially in Spring and Summer!  *looks around* I don't have a deer problem, yet, but have heard of deer moving into the city, because of the extreme drought conditions, looking for food.Being an avid organic gardener, I am always on the lookout for some, non-chemical, deterrent, or another, that will not harm critters, humans or the environment -- but will keep All, not invited, out of my gardens, off my newly planted shrubs, trees and flower beds.The Havahart DO64MS Deer Off II Deer, Rabbit, and Squirrel Ready-to-Use Repellent with Battery Powered Sprayer comes in an easy to carry container with a nifty side holster for storing the Sprayer after use. Both are made of a sturdy plastic.  The container is not heavy ( a \"plus\" for carrying all over the yard ) and the handle is easy to grip and hold on to.Getting the The Havahart DO64MS Deer Off II Deer, Rabbit, and Squirrel Ready-to-Use Repellent with Battery Powered Sprayer up and running is a breeze, as they say.First:  Go Outside! :)Just unscrew the container lid, peel off the foil covering, insert the \"dip tube\", screw on the lid that comes with the sprayer, shake well, turn to \"ON\", adjust the little nozzle at the tip of the sprayer for whatever type of spray you are in the mood for and squeeze the trigger a few times.At first, I couldn't get the sprayer to spray -- so, I unscrewed the lid, lifted the \"dip tube\" out of the container -- checking to see if something might have come loose while shaking -- (looked okay), put it back in, screwed the lid back down and squeezed the trigger again. Bingo!  Worked just fine.I then proceeded to spray all my zinnias -- cuz zinnias are butterfly magnets and this is the first plant the rabbits eat -- on their way to the sunflowers.  The Havahart DO64MS Deer Off II Deer, Rabbit, and Squirrel label states that the product will last 2 to 3 months.  Sprayer worked just fine and covered all the plant leaves with fine mist. Love that battery operated sprayer with it's awesome pistol-like grip!  That was a few weeks ago.  Zinnias are doing fine (loaded with butterflies) and the leaves have no munch marks -- and, blooming like crazy.  My sunflowers are untouched because I sprayed them, as well. *pats self on back*The sprayer is easy to clean and store in the side holster.  Do not throw away the original lid, as it will come in handy when storing left over product. :)I found the battery compartment easy to open and the batteries easy to change out, or remove when storing.Does the Havahart DO64MS Deer Off II Deer, Rabbit, and Squirrel Ready-to-Use Repellent with Battery Powered Sprayer sound like what you may be looking for? :)  Highly Recommended!  --Katharena Eiermann, 2012
B000A0VOD2 Havahart Deer Off is easy to apply and seems to be keeping the critters from nibbling on all my flowering shrubs and plants in the yard.  I wouldn't suggest using this on anything I would consume, but all the ornamental plants that the animals seem to like I would spray this on.  We sprayed the Deer Off on some flowering and soon to be flowering plants, and I noticed that many of the blooms haven't been chomped off.  This is a huge feat, considering how every few days our plants would be nibbled on.  It's seems to be effective, and we'll be using this more in the spring when everyone seems to be eating stuff from our garden!  This stuff does stink a little, so wear clothes you don't care about when applying.  Recommended.
B000A0VOD2 On July 4, I went out my front door to find a deer sitting in my beautiful pink lantana bush, which they are not supposed to eat.  Nevertheless, the deer have been mercilessly eating the flowers off this bush for the past several months.  As a test, I sprayed the Havahart on the lantana, a rose bush, and a cypress tree (deer rub antlers on these), these three plants being holdovers from my re-landscaping last September.  No smell...wonderful.  I decided to give everything a second spray the next day, just because.  On July 14, I checked the plants for additional deer damage and found none, despite the fact there are new blooms on everything.  So far, so good, and I will update this review for product effectiveness as time passes.Here are my comments about using the product.  Havahart really is odorless.  If you have ever used Liquid Fence, you will never forget what that product smells like; I gave LF up because I tired of my yard smelling like a sewer or something rotting, not to mention myself.  It is very difficult to get LF off your hands and clothing.  Havahart comes with explicit, and detailed, instructions, including to never put the sprayer in your mouth (lawyers).  Two things should have been included.  One, never mind the directions, the nozzle on the sprayer, as it comes, fully screwed in, will give a spray once the priming occurs.  If you want a stream, then you have to turn the nozzle a quarter turn.  This information will prevent you from getting the liquid all over yourself (which I did).  Second, for best results, you want to coat plants on a dead calm day, versus windy.  After each use, I would also recommend taking off the nozzle and rinsing both it and the other side it connects to with water to prevent clogging.For over 20 years I have been gardening in a deer infested area.  In my experience, the main deterrent that works, and is most cost effective, is fencing, at least six feet high.  After that, for open areas and if you want flowers, you have to do your homework and cultivate strictly proven deer resistant growth, such as oleander, daisies, lantana (usually), iris, and possibly azaleas (at least in California).  I had to completely redo my front yard in order to mostly persuade the deer to stop the munching.  The reason why deer resistant plants are so important is because Havahart, like all commercial deer repelling products, is expensive (not to mention the batteries), especially so if it comes ready to use and because it must be consistently, and perpetually, reapplied.  It is also costly to continually replant the items that the deer destroy.  If you persist in keeping plants that deer eat, in harm's way, then you are forced to continue paying for products such as Havahart.  Also, sooner or later, you are going to forget to reapply, or it rains, and the deer will prevail anyway.August 7 update:  Regarding the effectiveness of this product, it has been over a month since I applied Deer Off on two consecutive days to four plants in my front yard.  Everything is untouched.  I am really impressed, considering the activity these plants endured for the preceding six months.  However, I stand by my recommendations for fencing and hard line deer resistant landscape as the best defense against deer.  If you do not mind the endless expense and continuous hassle of spraying, then I certainly recommend this product.
B000A0VOD2 When I saw this offered, I jumped on it.  So far the deer had eaten all my lily's, including my day lily's and were beginning to start on my tiger lily's.  Add in the echinacea and my beautiful garden was almost gone.  As soon as this arrived, I began spraying.Assembly of the unit was easy.  Batteries were already installed, so it was simply a matter of unscrewing the cap and placing the siphon hose in the canister and tightening the lid.  Unfortunately, the batteries were dead.  So a run to the store for new batteries.  Try again.  The sprayer began spraying when depressing the trigger button.  (Batteries should be packaged separately so they don't run down, me thinks)Sprayed the flowers and the area around them.  Given the smell of this stuff, I was sure it would work.  (Yes you can smell it and it is vile).  One caution, don't spray on a windy day if you have to stand downwind of the sprayer.  I could feel the hot pepper working in my nose and mouth.Went inside and waited to see what would happen over night - would the deer be back?In a word, yes.  From the amount of deer dung (copious amounts) on the ground around my flower beds, it was more like a herd instead of one or two.  As I walked closer, two rabbits jumped from the  echinacea and hopped across the yard.  All the day lily blossoms were gone, as were the heads of my tiger lily's.Does this stuff work?  In a word, no.  Maybe it's just the wild game around my place, but it seemed to me that Deer Off was more like a salad dressing attracting the animals instead of deterring them.
B000A0VOD2 We live in the woods, deep in the woods and the deer like to play in our yard and snack on our shrubs and plants. So every year, my holly bushes get eaten back to nothing and the rhododendron get chewed to bits, even though they are right at the front door. I've often looked out my window to see the deer right below it snacking away and staring at me. Needless to say, our landscaping is rather scrubby.Deer Off has worked so far. I applied a good coating to the most nibbled plants and so far no one has snacked. The container comes with a battery powered pump. The batteries are included but I had to replace mine to get it to work. The spray nozzle is slow and doesn't put out a lot of solution so it takes awhile to get it to cover the leaves well. But eventually it all worked.So I give the solution 5 stars and 3 stars for the dispenser. The solution is more important so I think buying it wins out.
B000A0VOD2 We have quite a few squirrels that love the pecans in our pecan tree.  That is why I wanted to try this product.  We also have deer that come into the garden and partake of the bounty.  I don't begrudge the deer a meal but not all of their meals have to be from our little garden :)My husband took the product and sprayed around the perimeter of the yard where the squirrels play, around the pecan tree and around the garden.  We were not distressed by the smell at all.  It was hardly noticable to us.The battery powered sprayer worked like a dream.  Wonderful tool for the task!As to how it works....I believe it really does help to keep the critters away.  We waited several days to see results.  In the garden there were no new deer tracks, so I believe that helped a lot.  As for the squirrels, I haven't seen any in the pecan tree where we sprayed right around the base.  It is separate from the other trees in our yard.  However, I have seen squirrels up in the other trees on the higher limbs.  I think it keeps them out of the yard but I think it does not keep them from jumping from tree to tree on the higher branches.  Luckily the pecan tree is far enough away from other trees so they cannot jump to its branches, steal the nuts and jump back.I think the product itself is good.  You have to consider the environment you are using it in and the habits of the creatures...such as jumping squirrels.  We have not had a problem with rabbits so I do not know how it works with them.Overall I think the product does what it says it will do...I also think the squirrels can adapt if you have a lot of trees together.
B000A0VOD2 I sprayed this all around my house to deter ground squirrels.  Well first of all, it took a couple of minutes for the pump to prime instead of a couple of seconds.  Then, when I was about 3/4 of the way around my foundation the sprayer started to sputter and refused to spray any more even though there was still about 1/4 of a bottle left.And last but not least, the squirrels don't seem to be the least bit bothered by the smell.  Even my dogs don't seem to be bothered by the smell.  In fact, they like to lay down with their noses stuck under the door right where I sprayed the stuff hoping to keep the baby squirrels from squeezing under the door and eating all my dog kibble.Since I live in the burbs, I can't judge how effective it is against deer and rabbits but don't waste your money if you have squirrels.  This has absolutely NO effect on the little critters.
B000A0VOD2 I live in the country- Rabbits come on to my property to get in my garden and my dogs will kill them.. Makes me sad- Since I have been spraying my fence lines ( sprayer works great ) haven't had any rabbits show up.. Also strangely enough I think its keeping the skunks away..Something that is a true nuisance- Very happy with this product~
B000A0VOD2 This stuff stinks.  It smells like sulfur.  If you read the ingredients, one of the active ingredients IS rotten eggs.  Not sure how I feel about spraying rotten eggs directly on my plants, but I know it's not harmful or toxic, it just...stinks.But it is keeping the deer away, and we have a lot of them.  I was having some nightly nibbles and so far since we applied it, I have not had any more plant damage, although I have still had deer get in my yard right past it.  One deer went right past the garden spot with the sprayed plants and got behind my chicken coop and was grazing on the grass there.  I'm not sure who was scared the most, my husband or the deer when my husband went to gather the eggs.  SO, it seems to make the deer not want to eat the plants that the DEER OFF is sprayed on, but they don't really seem to avoid or mind going past them.My concern is that it will require repeated applications after rainstorms or with time, which could get expensive.  It also makes the garden a bit less pleasant to work in.
B000A0VOD2 I have used many different brands of deer and rodent repellent over the years and they all work relatively well.  From coyote urine to rotten egg solution to chemicals, they all provide short-term solutions to pests such as deer, rabbits, squirrels, etc.When I lived in an area that we did not landscape due to the mountain-nature of the property, it was pretty easy to spray this stuff on, and be done with it until the rains came.  Summers were the worst, and an application each month covered it for the most part.But now, I live in a more suburban community, bordering an off-road park.  We have a TON of rabbits eating the grass, and it drives my boyfriend nuts.  So, we tried this.  And yes, it works--until the sprinklers wash it away.  It seems to wash away quickly (like, every couple of days we have to reapply it).Springtime, when the sprinklers aren't used as often, might be a better time of year to use this product.  But for summers--especially this summer in California--nothing seems to help in any real way.
B000A0VOD2 We have no deer problem, but squirrels drive our dog nuts and steal bird food from our feeders. I put this around the area and voila, no squirrels. Then it rained and they were back. So, spray after each rain.As for the battery-powered sprayer, what's the point, other than using more liquid than needed and thus perhaps making you buy more? Oh, cynical thought. What company would promote something that made you use more of their product than needed? A simple manual sprayer is fine here, unless you plan on spraying a huge area. Plus you really don't need much of this for it to work. A few ounces in a thin stream covered the perimeter of a couple hundred square feet for us.So yes, the stuff works, and no, you don't need the power sprayer version. Just buy it in bulk and put it in your own dollar store spray bottle with the nozzle set to long thin stream.
B000A0VOD2 We feed birds, so the yard is loaded with impy squirrels who get into everything.  Every year I plant gazanias--carefree colorful flowers--and every year squirrels decimate them.  Nothing is actually eaten; plants are simply left in tatters.  You'd think after all these years I'd give up trying to plant them, but fools never learn.We've tried other deterrents without success.  Squirrel Stopper is totally ineffective.  This year I opted to try Havahart Deer Off II and guess what?  The gazanias live and thrive (not one nibble).  It's been weeks and still no sign of squirrel damage anywhere in the garden where this has been sprayed.  The same can't be said about areas sprayed near bird feeders, but that's okay because I have other squirrel deterrent methods at work there.  My primary goal was to stop garden destruction.  The gazania test is definitive proof this product really works.I can tell when neighbors are using deer/animal repellents because the odor is so pungent.  Not so with Havahart Deer Off.  Its smell isn't noticeable, and the battery powered sprayer sure is easy to use.  That may not suit everyone's needs, but Deer Off comes in a variety of concentrates and sprays.  Overall, I am very happy with results, and it's so nice to see gazanias blooming again.
B000A0VOD2 We were eager to try this product because we have a problem with squirrels coming onto the screened-in porch to snack and hide their nuts in the flower pots. Unfortunately the sprayer took a very long time to prime before it started spraying liquid. We actually thought the sprayer was defective because we heard the batteries whirring but no liquid was dispensed for five minutes or so. Once it got started it was great (though I'm not sure that anyone really needs a battery-powered sprayer because when the batteries die you're stuck with a non-functioning product).Anyway, we have now sprayed and will report back with an update on whether it keeps the critters away. One other note, we have used deer-repellant in the past. Normally the stuff smells horrendous. This one does not, so that's several points in its favor.
B000A0VOD2 The Havahart Deer Off II Repellant is a good solution to keep the critters away from your gardens. I have used this with success to keep rabbits and squirrels and deer away from my garden. The sprayer bottle is easy to use with a battery powered spray wand. Keeps the fatigue away. You can use this around your flowers, plants and vegetables. Spray a perimeter and keep applying it after heavy rain. You should see good results!
B000A0VOD2 I have serious difficulty using most spray products due to serious arthritic hands, wrists, and fingers.  Normally, sprayer products are impossible or difficult for me to use.  This one is unique in that it is battery powered, and the sprayer doesn't cause me any pain during use.  That in itself was a huge plus, and the fact that it is working super well is just icing on the cake for me.  We have had a slight bit of rainfall, but the product is still working, and it's been several weeks.  Also, I have not noticed an overwhelming chemical smell, and that is a definite plus for me.
B000A0VOD2 I had to wait quite awhile after receiving this product, because it wouldn't stop raining here. But we did finally get a couple of dry days, and we got to try the product. I was actually quite happy with it!The electric pump system works great. It primed quickly, and has a very nice, even spray pattern that makes it easy to get full, even coverage on the plants. It's easy to use and lightweight to carry around. The holster, while not perfect, keeps the spray head corralled when the product is on the shelf or when you're carrying it, rather than having it dangling down in the way.The spray itself is not as rank smelling as Deer Skid or other rotten egg preparations, even though the label says it has more of the active ingredients than other sprays. Because it started raining again three days after spraying, I can't attest to how long an application lasts or how effective it is, although I can say that there was no new deer chomping on my plants during that three day window.The good points: The premix formula is great for small applications. It's there, ready, when you need it and it doesn't go bad sitting on the shelf, so you don't have to use it all up in one application. The sprayer means that people with limited physical ability can use it easily, rather than having to pump up a tank sprayer or kill their hands squeezing a small sprayer a million times. It think it'll be especially nice for when a person puts a new plant into the garden and it needs a quick spray to protect it.The bad? Cost. Premix solutions are always a more expensive option than concentrates- you're paying for water. But the jug is easily refillable with Deer Off made from concentrate, and I suspect the spray head will last through a good many applications. I think this is a good new tool for gardening.
B000A0VOD2 I live in the middle of the woods and have a lot of deer, never too much of a rabbit problem.  When I received my Deer Off I went outside and sprayed away, I didn't notice any bad odors that are so many times associated with repellents, which was a huge plus for me.The hand held sprayer is convenient and the off/on switch is rather nice as well.  I'm not sure if I sprayed too much but I did notice white splotches after the product dried on some of my plants.The deer have definitely stayed away, the down side is that we've had a LOT of rain here and I've had to spray too often for my taste, but that of course is not the products fault.  The only downfall is the price, but I guess it's worth it when you're able to keep your plants looking nice instead of feeding them all to the deer.Too bad it doesn't work on the chickens, they love my hostas.
B000A0VOD2 Deer Off by Havahart is a great product for protecting your garden from animal pests.  We used it this year for the first time, and it has kept all of the rabbits and deer away from our vegetable garden.  It is very easy to use.
B000A0VOD2 I have my garden behind an six foot wire fence.  Unfortunately, one side of the fence is only 4 feet tall due to damage last winter.  I used this product as well as an electronic aid to keep the deer away.  The result was $60 in plantings and 40 hours of labor down the drain.  It didn't my local animals one bit!  Next year I will raise the fence and perhaps install a moat!  Actually, I have a neighbor who had good results with just playing a radio in the garden.  Guess deer do not appreciate good gospel music!
B000A0VOD2 I was excited to try this product out to protect my roses from hungry deer - but I could not get the battery operated sprayer to prime.  It seems an overly complicated design for a simple product.  Now I will have to pour it into a traditional sprayer to see if it works.
B000A0VOD2 I have a lot of rabbits in my yard. When they find a plant in my garden that they like they will devourer it to the ground. The only thing that stops them is a fence, which is fine for my vegetables but not for the flowers. There is no way to keep them out and they are treating the garden like a buffet! Since Deer Off advertises that it works on rabbits too, it was worth a try.I sprayed the hosta, daisies, and liatris (which they love) with Deer Off last week. Several of the hosta had been nibbled down to stems. The hosta are starting to grow back and the other plants haven't been touched. The rabbits are now leaving them alone. I know the rabbits are still in the yard, I watched one nibble on some parsley this morning and they are still grazing on the lawn.The product was easy to use, just turn it on and spray. I was expecting a nasty smell and was pleasantly surprised to find it very mild, almost odorless. The spray dulled the hosta a little bit and I could see some water spots, but there is no damage to the plants and they are showing new growth.The only problem I had using the sprayer was difficulty getting it to spray in a fine mist. According the the instructions, the bottle was supposed to come with a wand attachment for misting, but my package did not have the wand. Therefore I had to use the adjustment on the nozzle which caused it to come out in a stream. A minor problem for a product that works.Update: August 6, 2012I have more bunnies than ever this year and they are staying away from the plants that I sprayed with Deer Off. Unfortunatly they started munching on a few other plants. I sprayed the remainder of my perennial garden a few weeks ago and they are now leaving all the plants alone and the munched on plants are growing back. The bunnies have taken to eating weeds and apples that the squirrels knock down from my tree. At the moment we are living in harmony! And yes, I will be buying Deer Off next gardening season.
B000A0VOD2 We have had issues with all kinds of crittersrabbits..deer..squirrelsthe deer come right up to the front door where there is a huge pine bushwe have been spraying it now for a month and have not caught them there oncewe do reapply after rain because i do not want them startling the kids againwhen they go out to play only to find deer in the walkway inches from the front doorand now we tried this on the one bird feeder basewe have tried so many other things for these squirrelsthen i thought maybe this would workand yes it hasagain i do reapply it after the rainslike so many have said it does have an odor but it does go awayit was easy to use right out of the boxthankfully no issues with the sprayersprayed it around the rhubarb to keep critters out of thatnow guess not sure if rabbits were the ones at it last weekbut no one has been bothering it this week with the spray on itso happy to have something to keep the critters at bay around herewe have a couple acres of woods so there are plenty of critters running aroundnow they are not such a pain as before
B000A0VOD2 We've used Deer Off for a couple of years and I was happy to get this bottle from the Amazon Vine program.We have a young orchard (apple, peach and cherry)and the deer love to rub their antlers on the trunks, meanwhile breaking off branches and even killing the trees.  They also love eating the fruit.  Deer Off keeps them away, although we have to spray after every rain.I have several birdfeeders, and the squirrels tear them up over and over.  Deer Off keeps them away without keeping the birds away.  It's so nice to have birdfeeders last more than one season!This product doesn't work against raccoons - evidently they love the nasty smell because they continue to get in the garden tear up the corn.  We haven't had any rabbit damage so I can't say if it works against them.I like the handle in the bottle, and the spray hose, but I wish it were a manual pump.  I didn't find the battery power necessary to spraying.Overall this is a great product that humanely repels deer and squirrels.
B000A0VOD2 This product is fantastic! I've tried a variety of methods of keep the deer and rabbits from eating everything in my yard with various and inconsistent results. However, after using this product, nothing in my yard has been nibbled by the wildlife, and the  bonus is that it claims to be organic and it smells like pretty mild. It seemed to last about a week the first time before needing to be re-applied, and then after a rain shower, I re-applied...so far....and the motorized sprayer is a great addition!
B000A0VOD2 Well, I am once again reminded that there are no miracles cures to keep animals from eating (hold your breath) ANIMAL FOOD--otherwise known as my landscaping!I try to have a sense of humor about the constant tug and pull of loving wildlife AND my beautiful flowers and shrubs.After spending a lot of time and money trying all manner of products and techniques to have both wildlife AND said greenery, I am finally yielding to the wildlife.This product will likely be my last attempt to keep the critters away.  The Havahart worked okay for a few days on a few areas of the yard.  The cost and time it would take to consistently protect all of your landscaping would be insane.  You would have to spray A LOT and repeatedly and this is just not cost effective.  In addition, I'm not sure the results are any better than a home-brewed garlic/red pepper spray you could create for pennies.I will say that I was surprised that a rogue gang of armadillos that had created severe damage in my lawn were evidentally extremely turned off by the Havahart.  We had trapped one and evidently the others were savvy to the trap.  We put this all around the areas they were burrowing and haven't seen the remainder of the gang since.The time-honored technique of enjoying venison stew and smothered rabbit isn't an option in my suburban neighborhood, but it is most definitely the ONLY technique I know of that allows absolute perfection in your garden and landscaping.  The second best is to do some type of repellant (I'll stick to garlic/red pepper brew) and hope your neighbors leave their yards unprotected and full of more delicious plantings than yours.
B000A0VOD2 I had high hopes for this product, as deer and squirrels tear my flower and vegetable gardens to shreds.  This product works as advertised, flawlessly - BUT it does not repel so-called wild critters.  Deer and squirrels initially were frightened by the sprayer action.  However, the repellant odor did not deter animals from eventually taking over my entire garden.I talked to a county fish and game official; he opined that urban animals are too accustomed to man and his many exotic sounds and smells  After three days or so, the deer simply ignored the spray of repellant.  They are persistent pests that won't hide in terror on seeing me.  Believe me I am quite scary.  I am proceeding to evaluate other tactics.Bambi and his kin are safe for the moment.
B000A0VOD2 My backyard abuts a forest with a beautifully cleared walking trail that runs along my property line.  This makes it very easy for the deer to walk down the trail and into my yard.  Because of the topography of my yard, a fence will not work.  So I battle the deer every year.  After years of studying and testing different brands, I believe I am quite the expert when it comes to deer repellants!  This repellant is designed to work on rabbits, squirrels, and deer.  Regarding rabbits, this does not work as well as Bobbex spray.  This does work very well on deer.  I still have my oak leafs and annabelle hydrangeas and my hostas still have leaves. As a deer repellant, this does a fine job, as good as my old stand-by Bobbex spray.No major complaints with this product.  One quibble, it took at least a couple of minutes for the sprayer to prime.  Just expect to wait a few minutes.  Once the sprayer started working, it did a fine job.  Much easier than spraying by hand.  The sprayer also lessens the likelihood of getting the nasty smelling repellant on your hands.
B000A0VOD2 Havahart DO64MS Deer Off II Deer, Rabbit, and Squirrel Ready-to-Use Repellent with Battery Powered Sprayer. This product is easy to attach the sprayer nozzle on to the container. The sprayer reached a good distance and got into small places that other containers are not able to reach. We have noticed a decrease in the squirrels around our wood piles and bird feeders. There are still several chipmucks. I applied this around our pool deck to deter the deer from eating my plantings. My flowers seem to be lasting longer now. There is no strong order or unpleasant smell.
B000A0VOD2 We just bought a house, a relatively newly built house, way out in a new development.  There's only several dozen houses out that way, and surrounded by nothing but big, open fields, and LOTS and LOTS of little rabbits.  And apparently, in the process of buying our house, a rabbit was burrowing under the house, so as a contingency, we asked the seller to fill it, and he did.  And what does the clever little rabbit do?  Burrow under the house, a foot or two away from where he filled the last one!Well, my husband was like \"I'll get my gun and take care of those little jerk rabbits, I don't want them to ruin the foundation of my house!\"  And I said \"hey now, wait a minute.  You can't just kill them!  They're cute and they're fluffy, and technically, they were living there first before us and a bunch of other people bought/built homes on top of their homes.\"  So I ordered some of this spray, in order to avoid those little bunnies from meeting their grisly doom.And so far, it's worked really well!  Those fluffy little buggers are no longer invading the area under our house.  The husband is happy, and I'm happy the bunny rabbits didn't have to die.I also recommended this product to a good buddy.  His friend recently bought a new truck.  And apparently, to be more \"environmentally friendly,\" some auto manufacturers have started encasing some of the wires in the engine with vegetable oil, among other things.  Well, guess what?  Rabbits now climb up into his engine, and chew the crap out of his wires, thinking they're for eating!  And unjustly enough, that sort of damage isn't covered under his warranty, as it's an \"act of god.\"  That doesn't seem to make sense, because really, that should be considered an \"act of stupidity\" on the part of the manufacturer.  So now, my good buddy keeps this stuff in his car, and sprays around his car any time he parks some place new to keep the rabbits away from his engine wires.  And it's worked well for him, too!So whatever your \"rabbit-off\" needs are, this product will work for you!
B000A0VOD2 When you get critter repellant, you expect it to repel critters.  After the mixed reviews, I was unsure of what to expect, but I decided to give it a shot.The sprayer needed some minor assembly when I received it.  The batteries were already in mine, so all I had to do is stick the hose into the bottle and start spraying.  The only problem I had is that it took longer to prime than I was expecting.  I tried keeping the bottle high and adjusting the nozzle.  Nothing seemed to work.  I opened the bottle to be sure the end of the hose was in the liquid, and it was.  With the top unscrewed, I tried the sprayer again and suddenly fluid was spraying copiously.Because the sprayer is motorized, and sprays quickly, the next part was easy.  Having had experience with insect sprays, which recommend a two foot width to serve as an insect blocker, I sprayed about a two foot width around our cucumbers right after Peter Cottontail had sampled many of our ripe cucumbers.I was annoyed that Peter seemed undeterred by the spray.  He came back to visit the very next day.  However, to my surprise Peter seemed to be much less interested in our cucumbers after his return visit.  Indeed, after his one return visit, he and his relatives seem to be avoiding our cucumbers.Now, the bunny brigade seemed quite enamored of our cucumbers prior to spraying this critter repellant, and suddenly their interest has dropped off to near zero.  Either the bunnies decided the succulent cucumbers were not as yummy as they had previously thought, or this stuff works.  My assumption is that after waltzing through the repellent the bunnies realized that the welcome mat had been removed.Now it is time to focus on our lettuce, which is disappearing about as fast as it grows.Enjoy!
B000A0VOD2 Well, I've tried everything I know to do, and so has my husband, to get the sprayer to spray.  The batteries are good and properly inserted, the motor is functioning but nothing will come out.  We've carefully followed the directions on priming, checked for kinks in the hose, turned the blue nozzle to to the \"on\" position and made sure the inlet was deeply immersed in the liquid.  Yet, it simply won't spray.Since the sprayer won't work, my next step is to pour the liquid into a hand sprayer and use the product as directed.  So, at this point I don't know how well the actual repellent repels unwanted animal critters, but the sprayer definitely doesn't function as it should.  Just thought the potential buyer should be aware of this before purchasing.  I will report back on the efficacy of the repellent after I finally get it applied.
B000A0VOD2 This product is simple and easy to use, not incredibly smelly (nor does it smell good), and kept our deer neighbors out of the garden.  Enough product for several uses.  See instructions, don't apply at rainfall.
B000A0VOD2 We live on a street with a LOT Of deer and they love to eat my husband's flowers, especially this time of year.  This is why I ordered this product from the Vine program.  It was frustrating at first because the sprayer just wouldn't work.  It seemed that it would take a rocket scientist...  Then, we realized that the batteries needed to be changed and things improved. It seems to work pretty well at repelling the deer from the flowers - which is really nice.
B000A0VOD2 Deer Off and I are not doing as well as I hoped due to the smell, drought, batteries, ingredients.The drought and water restrictions have all the varmints in survival mode seeking food, water and shelter.  More regularly seen squirrels and rabbits plus formerly unseen creatures (bobcats, coyotes) have arrived en masse. So taking a chance on Deer Off was a no brainer to get them to move along. I don't have a DEER problem so I cannot indicate if this works on them.However, it FAILED to repel the squirrels and rabbits and was an unpleasant HUMAN experience due to:- non-working batteries I had to replace,- pungent smelly concoction had me gagging,- ingredients can cause allergic reactions ... READ detailed ingredients BEFORE purchase.Although an application of this deterrent can last up to 3 months, heavy rain and your lawn sprinkler can rinse it away requiring another application of Deer Off. The battery powered sprayer makes for easier application without your trigger finger falling off and their customer service is pleasant and helpful.All in all, I wouldn't buy this product.
B000A0VOD2 I can't rate it for deer or rabbits. But we get squirrels in our attic, especially as Fall & Winter approach.I've patched the roof (twice now) where they chewed into the crawl space. I don't know if my roof work was the solution, or if the spray works, or both. I tend to think the spray helps because squirrels can actually chew through a 2x4 if they really want in. So I think the smell (or however it works) helps repel them.It's also super easy to apply, with the powerful battery powered sprayer. I can actually get the spray onto the 2nd story of my house from a little step ladder. The bottle comes with batteries, and the sprayer works great. And I really love that it's non-toxic, so if some of it drifts into the yard, it's no big deal.
B000A0VOD2 This does a good job of keeping the deer and rabbits away from my currant bush and ornamental plants.  However, I have to spray more frequently than suggested.  One treatment is supposed to last three months.  I'm lucky if it lasts one month (which is why I knocked off two stars).
B000A0VOD2 Last year, the deer ate the blossoms and new fruits on all our plum, crabapple and cherry trees that they could reach stripping the young branches until they looked dead.  This spring I've started using the Deer Off and it really seems to be working so far. I still have lots and lots of blossoms and I know that the deer are still coming around because some buck decided to rub his antlers on our magnolia...I hope it still deters them when we finally start to get fruit!
B000A0VOD2 We decided to try this to keep mice out of our camper van while in storage.  The product doesn't advertise that it repels mice, but it does seem to we effective, as the little critters have not returned.  I will continue to update this review to ensure that it is indeed working.  So far, so good!
B000A0VOD2 We live in a wooded area and squirrels are frequent, and in some cases even deer. We have used the product, and at first it did not look as if it were working, but then used a higher quantity and it did.
B000A0VOD2 I was ready to protect some plants that have become deer favorites on our yard.I unpacked the deer off, started reading the description, and found the warning that left me puzzled:I am paraphrasing but it goes something like:\"Apply to just a portion of your plants first and wait a few days. Product may kill some plants\"This stopped me from applying the product, since I wanted to do a little more research before applying it after reading such warning. Unfortunately the deers came the very next morning and ate most of what I wanted to protect. Obviously it was bad timing, but I wanted to let others be aware that the product warns us that it might kill the plants.It did not seem to damage the plants when I did apply it, but the warning itself leaves me wondering if it's something I want in my plants.As for the product itself, the jury is still out and I will update it later this summer after more plants bloom.
B000A0VOD2 I had high hopes for Deer Off repellent, especially since it is also supposed to keep away other animals such as rabbits and squirrels.  It did seem to keep the rabbit away from my flowers and plants.  However, the deer that come into my yard are either smarter than I am (very likely) or they are just not bothered by the smell.  It didn't seem to keep the deer away at all.  On a high note, I did notice less \"activity\" in my flower beds from the neighborhood cats that people refuse to keep inside their homes.  That was defnitely an added bonus that I was not expecting.The smell is definitely not pleasant, but I don't think there is an animal deterrent spray that does smell good.  I would like to rate this product better than 3 stars because it did help with the local rabbits and cats, but it didn't seem to do anything for the deer -- at least from what I can tell by the types/locations of flowers and plant that are still being used as midnight snacks.
B000A0VOD2 The battery operated sprayer is excellent! Saves a lot of pumping work (compared to a jug of the ant barrier spray that needs a lot of work to get the house perimeter done). The spray is labeled for deer, rabbits, and squirrels and does keep rabbits off of the plants we applied the spray to. Not cheap for the jug, but does work well.
B000A0VOD2 If you live in a rural area, you know how much damage deer can do to a garden. Havahart repellents are the best on the market and this one is no different. One of the best features of this repellent is the built in sprayer. This allows you to use it the moment you notice damage and without having to mix up anything.Another great feature is that there are no harsh chemicals involved. Just garlic, eggs and hot pepper capsaicin. This repels both by scent and taste. It is safe around children and pets and long lasting, good for up to 3 months.
B000A0VOD2 Just like other animal repellants (and I've tried many), the Havahart repellant (Havahart also make traps) fails to deliver.The battery operated sprayer is a toy, so good luck getting it to work reliably.The odor is similar to other products. In fact, you can make your own with rotten egg and hot pepper.But to focus on the core objective: repelling critters -- I did not see any noticeable drop in the amount my flowers and vegetables. Deer, squirrels and rabbits seem minimally discouraged.
B000A0VOD2 I did the perimeter of my home garden which in previous year had been a feeding ground for the small deer in my area.  So far, I haven't had any problems with deer. The two rabbits in the are stay away too.  I don't really care about squirrels.The battery powered sprayer is a nice feature.  It's much better than having to pump it by hand or use a trigger.The scent isn't too bad and the product lasts at least 6-8 weeks.Keep in mind that a little goes a long way.
B000A0VOD2 This is really a nice container to use easily.  Battery powered and consistent spray.  Beats pumping or pouring into another container.It seems to have kept the critters at bay, which is what this is supposed to do.  Hard to know if it's the product or they have wandered into another yard, but I have no doubt this has helped.The smell isn't bad and it's outside.Can't go wrong with this product.
B000A0VOD2 I have a lot of rabbits that pass through my yard, nibbling on clover, which I don't mind, and my ornamentals, which I do. My solution has been a combination of fencing off some bushes and spraying others with my home made hot pepper spray: I gallon of water, one tablespoon of liquid soap (Ivory works well enough) and a tablespoon of the hottest Chinese hot pepper oil I can find. It works, sort of, but requires constant reapplication, especially when it rains. This product seemed like it might be a more effective solution.But for a real test, I decided to take it over to the home of a friend of mine who has a problem with deer that nibble at her ornamental bushes and chew her hostas right down to the ground. I phoned her up and proposed a test, and she quickly agreed. We met in her back yard, where I assembled the spray pump. Hose reaches to the bottom of the gallon jug? Check. Safety switch off? Check. Vent clear? Check. Nozzle opened? Checked. I pulled the trigger, and the pump whirred to life, making a satisfying sound. I waited for the liquid to appear. Nothing. I kept waiting. Still nothing. I removed the pump from the jug and checked to make sure the feeder tube wasn't blocked. I unscrewed the nozzle to make sure it wasn't plugged. I fiddled with that thing for ten minutes, and never got anything to come out.I note that other reviewers have run up against this very same problem, which suggests to me that a lot of these units are defective. That's a pity, as I had high hopes for this product. I thought about transferring the liquid to one of my pump-up sprayers so I could at least test the liquid and see how well it works, and I may yet do that, but as a ready-to-spray repellent system, this products gets a failing grade.
B000A0VOD2 I was about to give up on this, until the sprayer inexplicably decided to work... no worries then.  So I didn't use Deer Off over every garden on my priority, I thought we'd get a better sense of its effectiveness if I left some areas untouched.  The result, I've been watching a mother doe and her fawn visit my yard now for the past two weeks, however any \"munch damage\" has been confined to the control group beds that are in the back of the property.  The more ornamental flower beds in the front have survived unscathed.  And to underscore that effectiveness, those protected flower beds are heavily populated with hosta... a whitetail deer's most delightful treat in this neck of the woods.It would appear that this works so well that I can forgive the recalcitrant sprayer.
B000A0VOD2 I bought this to rid my yard of squirrels and it works great!  I applied a liberal amount around the trunk of each tree and on the toos of branches where they like to sit. The very next day - no more squirrels. It lasted about two weeks before I had to reapply and the second application worked just as well.
B000A0VOD2 I mostly wanted this for a house in PA that has rabbits eating the gardens and flowers every day, they are everywhere.  We have tried other sprays that have not really worked, or worked for a day or two and then the animals were back eating the leaves.  What I really liked about this Havahart repellant is that it works for deer, rabbits and squirrels, I don't need 3 different things.  It is very convenient with its own spray hose thing attached to it.  Very easy and convenient.
B000A0VOD2 With so many products, I have to ask my husband to mix it up and put it in a sprayer for me. Or, I have to hand spray with a bottle and just can't effectively apply enough. This product solves both of those problems.It came premixed, so I didn't have to worry about that. And the sprayer is a really nice feature. It came with batteries already installed, which is rare in a product. I'm not sure they were all that powerful, but I'm thankful they were included.The instructions weren't super detailed, but I figured it out. You have to remove the safety cap (press down and turn like a pill bottle) and insert the sprayer hose into the jug. The cap that screws on as part of the sprayer assembly does not have a childproof lock. The switch on the sprayer has a safety switch. It isn't as if it's greatly child-proof as you just slide the switch up and spray, but it deters a little.It took a long time to prime the sprayer the first time. I headed in the house to get different batteries because they seemed weak, but when I came out, my husband had it working. He said he just held the sprayer handle in (as I had been doing) and it eventually started. You can adjust the spray pattern by turning the end of the nozzle, but I did get product on my fingers when I did that, so I don't recommend adjusting much once you get going.I sprayed all around the perimeter of my garden since we have trouble with rabbits. So far, it seems to be working. We haven't had a heavy rain yet to really test it out, but the lettuce and spinach are intact.I love the battery operated sprayer and convenience of application. The sprayer has a removable holster that hangs on the jug for convenience in between spraying and for storage.
B000A0VOD2 I live in a townhouse community and have been unable to grow much of anything except herbs in planters over the past few years because of the local squirrel population. I tried again this year wrapping my tomato planters in tin foil and booby-trapping it with small items which I figured would drop and scare the critters away if they approached them. Needless to say, they ate up almost the entire group of plants from fruit to stems. Fortunately, a small piece remained in one planter that looked like it was attempting to continue to grow. So, I got this Havahart repellent and again circled the planter with tin foil and sprayed the foil and planter with the liquid. So far, so good. This plant is flourishing now (about 1.5 feet high) and I haven't seen a squirrel in site (yet). So, the product seems to do the trick. Only difficulty I had was in the set up (thought the instructions were a little difficult to follow). But, after trial and error, I got the automated spray to work and it apprears to do well.
B000A0VOD2 I love the \"fuzzy tailed tree rats\" that live in my neighborhood and want them to survive nicely but once in a while they go too far.  Last year they decided my seat cushions were good nesting material.  In the fall it was my hammock that took care of their needs to chew.  They are constantly digging up this potted plant or another to hide their treasures.  I ordered Deer Off hoping it would help.  Then I got scared of it - what if it really, really smelled bad?  I didn't want a bad odor coming from my flower beds and from under the hammock.  Finally, the last straw was drawn when I saw these critters running around under my solar panels.  These panels are expensive, with lots of wires that squirrels don't need to chew on so I climbed my ladder and started spraying.  The battery powered sprayer is a great feature.  I'm not too steady on a ladder and it's a two story house so I don't want to be pumping like crazy to get this stuff out.  The odor wasn't too bad and dissipated quickly.  Best of all, I didn't hear the pitter patter of little feet on my roof after spraying.  It's been a few days and still no squirrels. Next I think will be my flowerbeds.  They love to bury things in them.  Perhaps I'll spray where the neighborhood rabbit likes to nibble and see if it chases him away too.
B000A0VOD2 I wanted to try this product to see if it would help me in my quest to get the squirrels out of my attic. Each year I get a new batch as they return to the same spots to nest. My eaves have now rotted out as they have urinated in their nests and relocated a lot of the fiberglass insulation. This created a moist environment and wood rot. Not to mention the sound of little feet scurrying around in the morning on the ceilings.I have tried strobe lights, ultrasonic emitters, automatic arousal air freshener sprays, metal critter traps, and even shot a few with a pellet gun. Nothing has worked and new ones come back. I am going to be redoing the eaves with concrete hardie board to try to keep them from being able to enter in the first place. They have chewed holes in the ends of the eaves and made their own holes in the past.I tried this as one last ditch effort to stop them before the renovation begins. I was hoping to find something that would repel them and hopefully also deter them from trying to come back again next winter as they must be leaving some kind of scent markings to know to return to the same place each year. Alas it seems that those two young squirrels and their mother are rather unfazed by this repellent.I do like the electric spray wand. It worked well to spray this thick soupy yellow tinted slightly odorous liquid into the tight, hard to reach, shrinking triangular eave area of my attic. But alas they seemed to like it too as they are still there! Not even noisy grunt, chirp or call from one of them. I wouldn't have known that I did anything except for the fact that I did spray putrified egg as an ingredient all over my attic and their nesting areas. I wished it had worked. Maybe I am being a little overzealous with its intended use, but still, I saw no repelling feature about it with these squirrels.Have to give it 3 stars. I do like the spray wand.
B000A0VOD2 I was offered the Deer Off through Amazon's Vine program and figured why not try it.  Our house is surrounded by woods and therefore surrounded by deer, rabbits and squirrels (the animals deer off claims to deter)  I had just put in my vege garden and do not have a fence around it yet.  The label says it is safe to use on vegetable plants - however it also does state that you will need to reapply with growth and although it is working on the small leaves now, I wonder what will happen once my plants start blossoming.  I also applied it to the blackberry bushes along the wood line and nothing has touched them yet!  I might be able to get some jam and pies this year!!I will update this review once the plants start blossoming and my veges start appearing.Edited to add:Well, after the berries have come and went they were not bothered very much at all by any wild animals!  My garden is still being left alone as well, even with a bunny nest right in the middle of it.  I think Deer Off might actually be working!
B000A0VOD2 I read a few reviews before using this. I, too, had hoped I could spray it around my yard..as in..around the whole perimeter of the yard..to keep critters OUT completely! Instead, I sprayed it on plants directly.I have lived in this house for nearly 20 years and we did not have a deer or squirrel (or rabbit) problem until two years ago. Now, it's like someone is flying them in!! Now boarding, all critters, on route to Sheri's for the summer!  So, I used this Havahart on my pretty shrubs etc and it's working perfectly! They approach, taste..yuck yuck, and scamper off to my neighbor's pretty shrubs and trees! Yeah! I would tell my neighbors about this, but I don't want to mess with a good thing. ;0)
B000A0VOD2 I have used this trying to rid my property of the cute, but pesky rabbits and squirrels. I have sprayed heavily and find that it does keep the rabbits away but it does NOTHING for the squirrels!!! I really was hoping it would do something to keep the squirrels away. We also saw a racoon walking through an area that I sprayed heavily. I don't know how it works for deer as it is very rare we see a deer around our property these days.  If your problem is with rabbits, then this is probably going to help, but if you have a squirrel problem, I hope you have better results than me.
B000A0VOD2 I have to say I finally got this little critters from running anywhere but in the tree.I was tired of them in my gardens and running all night on my roof. When you set up a perimeter of where you do not want the Deer, Raccoons or Squirrels to go. Spray and they will not come in that area. I sprayed and it worked just great. after thirty days I sprayed again, you do not have to use a lot.If you do not have a lot of rain it will last long
B000A0VOD2 I live in a rural area and there is no short supply of rabbits and deer. The deer mainly eat the flowers my wife is trying to grow in the front of the house - the rabbits prefer my garden.In past years I've had some success with fencing off the garden but nothing we tried ever protected the flowers. So far this year my wife has lost several flowers to deer.I wasn't very optimistic that a spray of any sort would protect them both when so many other sprays (and gadgets) failed to do so consistently.The first thing I liked that surprised me was the battery-powered sprayer. I was thinking that it had to be a gimmick, but it really comes in handy. I know when I have to apply a lot of weed-killer that my fingers get cramped up after awhile using the spray-pump.Because it's non-toxic and USDA approved for organic gardening, I dosed the garden with a generous spraying of Havahart 3 weeks ago. Same with my wife's flowers around the driveway and front of the house.So far, so good. None of the flowers have been eaten; and the same goes for my garden (lettuce, corn, tomatoes, eggplant, peas, beans). And I'm particularly pleased that ALL of my lettuce is coming up perfectly - no nibbles at all.Two (green) thumbs way up for Havahart!
B000A0VOD2 I have tried lots of different types of animal repellents, but to no avail! This one works pretty well! I did notice, however, even in dry weather, that it didn't last quite as long as I would have liked (only about 4-5 days) before I had to reapply.The sprayer takes a little getting used to since it's a powered sprayer, but once you figure out what direction to aim it and how long/hard to squeeze the trigger, it is a breeze and beats the hand cramp you get from normal self-squeeze sprays!Overall, it works a little better than the other products out there, but it still is not the \"magic potion\" we've all been hoping for!
B000A0VOD2 I'm not sure if it's supposed to be this way, but the Deer Off product I received was the consistency of buttermilk. The package was marked \"ready to use,\" so I know it's not meant to be diluted. I don't know what happened, but I do know sometimes stuff like this gets frozen in storage or sitting on a loading dock and changes consistency. Since I received it, it's been in my garage where the cold-hating cacti spent the winter.The sprayer was firing, but the repellent was too thick to make it through the gun and out. The sprayer seemed to have a lot of power when I sent water through it.If the sprayer worked with the Deer Off, this would be a great product. I ended up \"painting\" some of the leaves of my squash where I noticed the rodent damage yesterday. I'll report back if they quit nibbling. If it works, I have ornamental plants that the jackrabbits won't leave alone that I'll try it with.The dogs enjoyed the smell of the Deer Off. I really didn't detect any obnoxious odor.
B000A0VOD2 During the fall, the squirrels dig up all the plants in my small backyard, and sit on my fence and throw black walnut shells against the white paint on my garage, staining it deeply.  I ignored this product for a long time assuming it was toxic and because I did not want to get rid of the squirrels completely.  Once I realized it really was a safe mix that wouldn't kill everything, I thought it would be nice to try.  And it is.  I can put a very small amount on boxed plants and on my fence without scaring the squirrels out of the yard completely; the power of the black walnut tree overcomes all.
B000A0VOD2 I have tried pretty much every kind of deer management products on the market, and these repellents are marginally useful at best.Most repellents smell strongly and wash away after even a light drizzle. This product tries to correct these shortcomings. It does stay on much longer and the smell is much fainter, but herein lies the problem: it does not deter deer very well. Eventually, only the corner of my garden protected by theBird-X YG Yard Gard Ultrasonic Animal Repellerremains completely unmolested.I do like the battery-powered sprayer and plan to keep it for the regular repellents after this bottle is used up.
B000A0VOD2 This product was applied 3 weeks ago to my hanging and standing flower pots. Since then, I have not had squirrels sitting in my pots grazing away on  my flowers. What a relief that has been to say the least!
B000A0VOD2 I was very interested in the Deer Off product because we live in a very rural area and have deer ground hogs, chipmunks, and squirrels, both gray and red, around the house all the time. This isn't necessarily bad, unless they decide to get into the cellar or attic, or eat our plants.I ordered Deer Off to see what it would do. I was also interested in the battery powered sprayer. My first problem was that the Post Office failed to deliver the package. They thought it was leaking. (As far as I can tell, it wasn't. However, that made me wary.)  I followed the directions, shook up the container, inserted the hose for the sprayer, turned it on and nothing happened. I tried several times, still nothing. I cleaned the nozzle and the ball that's inserted in the container. Still nothing. Finally, I got a piece of wire to try to clear the blockage, still nothing. Then I noticed that there was no hole in the plastic plate that covered the hole where the liquid should come out. I punctured it and the sprayer started to work.On the positive side, the spray worked extremely well after I opened the hole. I was able to spray all around the house. Obviously, I will have to wait to determine whether it deters the critters.If the critters are discouraged by the product. I'll be thrilled. I am glad that I was able to make the sprayer work - makes you feel powerful!
B000A0VOD2 We do have a community garden at my apartment complex and squirrels are a bit of a problem.  So far, this is more effective than other brands and the sprayer definitely is a plus.
B000A0VOD2 My house is on a golf course in a rural area of the Pacific Northwest.  Since my yard borders the fairway, I have no way to fence out either the marauding deer nor the equally obnoxious golfers.  This year I'm using Deer Off in hopes of warding off at least one of my problem pests.  The deer seem especially fond of Crocosmia.  They always wait until the night before the flowers are going to bloom, and then strip off the top 25% of each and every plant. I have yet to see a flower on these plants, so I gave the whole area a liberal treatment. I appreciate the built in, battery operated sprayer (batteries included, even!)since a pump spray can give you hand cramps in no time.The smell was strong while I was applying it but seemed to go away once it settled and dried on the leaves.  The product description says it is rain resistant but the label says that rain, mist, fog, damp, or cold conditions during or right after spraying can reduce product effectiveness.  Those things are \"par for the course\" around here so it is a challenge to find just the right window of opportunity to apply.It is early spring here so neither the deer nor the tender new leaves are out in force yet so I can't say with certainty how effective it will b., So far, at least they seem to be choosing less stinky yards to ravage.  The product has a 100% satisfaction guarantee there's nothing to lose, right?Having read the other reviews, I will be tempted to refill this container with homemade solution when its empty and compare the two...
B000A0VOD2 I was surprised at how much I liked the convenience of the power sprayer.  It seemed gimmicky at first, because how hard is it really to use a manual spray trigger, right?  However, the more I used it, the more I appreciated it.  We have a lot of hostas that the deer love to eat, and some vines that climb on a trellis, and...well, it's so easy to use that it made light of an often tedious job.  I like that Havahart has refill sprays available, otherwise, it would seem kind of wasteful to throw away the battery-powered sprayer once it's empty.  (Alternatively, I see no reason why you couldn't use this sprayer for other kinds of liquids.)Unlike some repellent sprays I've used, the smell of this one is quite tolerable.  Some are offensive for hours after spraying.  This spray, on the other hand, is formulated to dry so that it can't be smelled by humans.  Before it dries?  Even then, the smell was barely noticeable.I do have one big concern, however...and this might matter a lot if you plan to spray this on a vegetable garden:  The photo on Amazon's product page shows a rabbit and a squirrel running near what seems to be a vegetable garden.  This seems to suggest that this would be a good spray to use around your vegetables, right?  The warning on the product label, however, states: \"Do not allow spray to drift onto plants intended for human consumption.\"  There are deer repellents out there that are safe to spray on vegetable gardens.  Apparently, this is not such a spray.  I think this is something that needs to be clarified on the product page.
B000A0VOD2 Havahart Deer Off works OK. I do love the way it sprays with its battery operated sprayer, as your hand doesn't get tired like it does with hand operated ones. NOTE: I don't have deer, so I cannot comment on the effectiveness of this product on them. However, I do have rabbits and this repellent seemed to work against them. Also, the product didn't smell bad, which is nice when applying.
B000A0VOD2 Every winter when the greenery turns brown the rabbits decide that my new lilac bushes and new grape vines are quite the tasty alternative.  So when I tried Deer Off I was thrilled to find that they stopped the nibbling.  The sprayer is easy to use and I love that I don't have to purchase a sprayer separately... that's a huge plus.  Note that you can't use this on plants you are going to eat; so while it should be okay to spray the base of my vineyard; eventually I am not going to be able to use it on the upper portions for deer, etc...
B000A0VOD2 I'm a city girl, so when we first saw deer in the garden, my reaction was to say \"ooooh,\" not \"shoo.\" But then I saw how destructive they were, I changed my tune. They trampled the tomatoes and just dragged the peas and eggplants out to the driveway.  If the deer were starving or even just a little hungry, I wouldn't mind. But mostly they are just stepping on things, knocking them down and tearing them up. I think they may be deer vandals.  We tried to be nice and bought them hay and a barrel of apples to bribe them away from the garden, not to mention that this is summertime. Hello, deer, the forest? There is an entire mountain of edible greenery just inches away and they can eat the whole damn thing, but no, it's my zinnias and swiss chard they're after.  I worked hard on the garden, blistered my hands and put them into duck poop for it. I never worked harder on anything in my life.  And then there's the expense.  Nobody tells you that you have to take all your money and credit cards to Sears and exchange them for planting stakes and tomato cages, lattices, a compost box, shears and secaters (same thing if you ask me), hoes, rakes, shovels, pointy things you poke into the ground, little versions of the hoes, rakes, shovels and pointy thing, garden gloves, soil enhancer, plant food, watering systems, watering cans, hoses and nozzles, plus cute sun hats and decorative baskets to hold your harvest except that there is no harvest because bambi stomped on it. Anyway, after you add it all up, it works out to about 8 bucks a carrot.I asked the deer nicely to go away, hung soap on string to scare them (the guy at the nursery recommended this, I think he was pranking the city slickers because it turns out, deer enjoy the brisk, manly scent of Irish Spring), and pinwheels, which only made the deer snort in derision. The Havahart Repellent is the first thing that worked. The deer ate all the flowers in the bed on the far side of the house, which did not get spritzed. This is because Havahart Repellent stinks like a son of a gun. Two sons of a gun.  The active ingrediet is rotten egg stink.  If we put it on the flower bed near where we sit, we would be dead now. The formula also contains garlic and capsicum (hot pepper)because deer don't like the taste. But it's the stink that does it. This stuff would repel the living dead. The deer won't come near the stuff, which is good, because the caterpillers don't like sharing.The sprayer works very well, and it's easy to get it pumping. Just for pete's sake, don't hold the sprayer up and look at it to see if it's jammed. Get that stuff on you and invitations to dinner just dry up.  The directions are explicit and easy to follow.  You pour in the Deer Off solution, press the trigger (pointing away from you)once or twice, and there you go.  Of course every dog in a 500 mile radius will want to roll in it. I got some on my shoes and it took two days to peel the beagle next door off of me.This is a very simple, humane and effective way to shoo varmints. You might also consider using it to repel in-laws and prevent adult children from moving back home.
B000A0VOD2 I have a squirrel problem 3 seasons out of the year because they try to build nests under my awning and continually pick at my gutters and tear up the flowers. I found this to be pretty effective in getting rid of them..but only for a few days before I have to spray again, so the company claim that it can last for months at a time is bogus. Unfortunately the ingredients aren't strong enough to get rid of them for longer. I didn't notice any smell from the product either which is nice, as is the battery operated sprayer so your hand doesn't get tired. This product is not weather resistant either as it claims - the effectiveness of the ingredients wears off even quicker after a rainstorm. Also at 30 some dollars a bottle, I can't say I'd buy it again for such a short window of squirrel relief since I have to apply it every few days. Overall, I wasn't that impressed with it.
B000A0VOD2 We live next to a National Park and often get deer in the area.  The major perk of this product is the sprayer, it is convenient to use.  I did notice less deer after using the product, but it did not deter all of them...so it's hard to judge whether it was just a time where we had less deer coming or the product actually worked. Because I live in an area that sees rain often, it is not cost-effective for me to use the product long term unless there is a future drop in price.
B000A0VOD2 This works as well for me as other deer sprays and was much easier to use.  I know from my own and other research that you have to change the deer sprays every few weeks. Throwing the deer off balance by introducing strange new smells is important.  I have some issues with my hand and it was great to not have to squeeze the trigger to cover my extensive gardens.  I will continue to use this, will buy more, and will refill the first bottle with another brand.The label says it can last for three months, which sounds great.  However, in smaller print it says to reapply after a heavy rain.  Maybe some of you live in an area where it does not rain or you don't use a watering hose for three months, but I don't.  It also says it is made ineffective by freezing.  It doesn't say if it is referring to the bottle of solution or after it is applied to the plant (maybe both).Again, it works as well as other sprays, but the other sprays don't make such claims.
B000A0VOD2 We have wood siding on our house and the woodpeckers love it.  A friend of mine suggested trying deer repellent as it had worked for them.  I sprayed the areas the woodpeckers seemed to favor and haven't seen them on the house since.  I'm not entirely sure this stuff did the job all by itself and it wasn't also simply a change in the season, but they're gone and I will use this again in the spring.
B000A0VOD2 If you have unwanted guests munching on your garden. The does a great job at keeping away the unwanted guests. Also it is nice that I don't have to go trigger happy and drench the entire garden. It works good, and I would recommend it.
B000A0VOD2 This product has a nice twist - You don't have to pump to dispense the fluid.  The sprayer is battery powered and emptied the whole gallon jug without any trouble.  That made it very easy to just walk around the spray the fluid where I wanted it.The sprayer has an adjustable nozzle that provides a fine mist to a direct stream.  You can control how you want to direct the fluid.When I first connected the sprayer to the bottle it took a few minutes to prime the sprayer.  Additionally, you have to work the rubber tube to get it straight so that it reaches to the bottom of the gallon jug.  Since its sent coiled, it tends to want to coil back up again.  But for the most part I had no trouble dispensing the fluid - just a couple times I had to correct the tube so it reached the bottom.The fluid is not like other Deer Repellant.  I have used some products that smell so bad that its unpleasant to dispense and unpleasant to walk around the yard after the repellant has been dispensed.  This fluid had a very slight smell of acetic acid, but by no means was it overpowering, in fact for the most part it was not unpleasant at all.  If it works, this could be the solution I have been looking for.I've told you about the dispenser, the fluid, and I will wait to see if the squirrels and deer show up tonight and what areas they avoid.  So really this review so far is about the product and the delivery mechanism.  We'll see what happens with the varmints later tonight when they usually come...
B000A0VOD2 We have a lot of rabbits around our house. Sometimes we don't mind them, but sometimes they're a bit of a nuisance, eating our vegetables, pooping on our grass and (more recently) burrowing under our house.I got this because I heard good things about Deer Off in general and  love the battery-powered delivery system (as opposed to the pump I'm used to with other products).I also have 5 young kids, and I appreciated that this product is supposed to be safe around them!Good prod
B000A0VOD2 The DEER OFF is relatively easy to use.  I do wear gloves though because absorption of the chemicals isn't a good idea, and occasionally there is drippage in addition to just wind dispersal.I used this product on my front garden, and honestly the results weren't conclusive.  Some plants seemed to benefit.  Others did not.I will give it another season to see if I can narrow in on effectiveness.  BUT I will note that while I saw bunny droppings in the yard, I have not seen them nibbling in the garden proper.
B000A0VOD2 I sprayed Havahart Deer Off II around the foundation and on the porch of an empty house I own.  I had seen them on the house looking for a way in, and didn't want them moving in for the winter.  The squirrels have not been back.  I do respray after a heavy rain.  This is a great, humane way to keep them at bay.
B000A0VOD2 We don't have a deer problem but this product seems to work for squirrel and raccoon problems. We've also had problems with our cat scratching the paint off of our back door when he is anticipating his meal. I sprayed some of this on the back door and he has not touched it! I thought the battery powered pump was a little ridiculous but realize that some people may actually need that if they have problems with their hands. It seems to work just fine although you have to hold the trigger in for a while before it starts to spray.
B000A0VOD2 As a landscape architect, I'm always looking for a kind yet effective way to keep bunnies and squirrels from destroying my client's gardens. I've gone the utterly \"Old School\" route, using dog fur, dried blood meal and Tabasco sauce, with very limited results. The rabbits in particular were destroying customer's perennial beds, mowing them down to nothing. I ordered this product, based on reviews and the fact that it had a battery powered sprayer...woo-hoo! I then sprayed what was remaining in the gardens and the hydrangeas, which seem to be a bunny food. Voila! Like magic, the remaining bits of the garden were saved and my clients were thrilled! I also have tried this on emerging tulips (just as they show their bud poking up) and that also saves them from the bunnies and the squirrels. LOVE the motorized sprayer! When you have a large area to cover, it sure saves the pain of application.
B000A0VOD2 I tried this product and it does appear to be somewhat effective at deterring critters from bothering garden and flower areas for a while. It turns out to not be practical for my needs because of the relatively limited working time, and the relatively large expense of the product. I can not afford to continue to apply this product to garden and flower beds. The area I live in is experiencing a drought so a garden is a particularly attractive feeding ground for animals, so the product might work better in areas where animals are not so stressed to find food.
B000A0VOD2 We live in a very residential looking neighborhood of homes on 10,000 square foot lots. That is, these are not zero lot line homes, but they aren't \"estates\" either. The \"forest\" where the deer are supposed to live is a good mile away. They still come trotting down the paved roads to gnaw at our garden. They eat our fruit off the trees, buds off the agapanthas, and destroy the vegetable garden if they can get to it. So, when I got a chance to review this product, I was happy to give it a go.The experience so far has been mixed. I read all the instructions, which are clear and concise. I then assembled the battery powered spray unit with the bottle of repellent. The sprayer comes with batteries already inside. At this point, you shake the bottle to mix the repellent, turn the trigger safety off and go to work; or at least that is what the instructions lead me to believe. In actuality, I had to spend time messing with the nozzle and the sprayer hose in order to get it to suck up some product and start spraying. Once this was done, it would reliably spray, but the mist was more like a splatter. Hopefully, this will not leave funny markings on the plants. I really played with the nozzle to get to a finer spray, but the unit always had a larger degree of splatter than I was happy with. It seems this would be due to the thickness of the repellent fluid, but that is just a guess.I sprayed our agapanthas and left the fruit and vegetables alone, relying on fencing for protection, because Deer Off works by leaving a coating on the plants you want to protect. The instructions, and common sense, advise against spraying Deer Off directly on your food. So far, so good, the agapantha buds (a particular delicacy to our deer), have not been harmed.Conclusion: I knocked off two stars because of the start up problems and the splattering. It is easy to use once set up and, like I said, no deer so far.
B000A0VOD2 I was so excited to see this offered through Amazon Vine! The deer are making their way around our yard and gardens this summer. They tend to come (and go) in cycles so this was a perfect opportunity to try this product. Or so I thought.Assembly was a cinch. Batteries included (and installed). All I had to do was take off the cap, put the hose in and tighten the cap. Another reviewer hit the nail on the head when they said you have to hold the trigger/hose down low (in order for the liquid to reach the nozzle)...that's how siphoning tends to work:) ~ After just about draining the batteries, the liquid *finally* started coming out. Of course, I had to replace the batteries after I'd been spraying for about three minutes. Not sure if the batteries are cheap, old, or should just come packaged separately with the spray.Within two days, the deer were back and were snacking on my plants. I had tried spraying it at the base of a shepherd's hook as well to deter squirrels from getting at the bird feeder. Well that worked like a charm. Not! This concoction smells quite a bit like vinegar and that's about all I could smell. If you want something that will work and I mean REALLY, REALLY work, try Liquid Fence. I've been using this product effectively for about ten years. You can get it in mixed form (a bit cheaper), or in concentrated form (which is what I buy). That is more expensive, initially, but it is well worth the cost. Here's the link, I hope it works:http://www.amazon.com/Liquid-Fence-113-Repellent-Concentrate/dp/B000NW777E/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid;=1341177361&sr;=8-1&keywords;=liquid+fenceThis stuff stinks to the ends of the Earth and beyond! Rotten eggs, vinegar, garlic and tons of other great, stinky stuff to keep the deer away. It doesn't work on squirrels though (I haven't found anything that does). And you have to reapply as new growth appears (deer loooove the tender greens!) and/or if it rains or you top-water your plants. Re-applying due to water and growth is essential for this product to work. You WILL smell this when you spray! Don't be downwind of it:) ~ it dries odorless in several hours.I would not recommend Havahart Deer Off. HIGHLY recommend Liquid Fence:)
B000A0VOD2 SEE UPDATE at end for the rating change from 3 star to 2 star.I obtained this item through the Amazon Prime Program.  I have a large yard with bird feeders  and that attracts a lot of squirrels and rabbits.  I have tried chasing them off, but that is almost like swatting at a fly with a tissue.  A lot of exercise on your part, entertainment on the critters part, and nothing changes.I thought that since this product is safe to use around animals and did not appear to be a bio hazard that I would give it a try.  Here are my thoughts on the product:First, the Sprayer:1.  While the unit comes with batteries (4 AA batteries), they did not last more than a few minutes.  I had to install new batteries to get anything out of the sprayer.2.  The sprayer is supposed to put out a stream and a wide spray.  While it will put out a stream, it does not go very far.  As for a wide spray, I guess wide is in the eye of the beholder.  It is not very wide and it only travels about 3 feet from the sprayer.  I good hand pump sprayer that you can re-use for other sprays would work much better!  I have a 1.5 gallon sprayer that is pumped up by hand and it sprays this material 4 times farther and gives a nice fan spray!  I would have to rate the electric sprayer a 0 Star product as it is just not worth using and it comsumes batteries quickly.Second, the Deer Off Product:1.  The product seems to work as the rabbits and squirrels have not been back at the feeders since I used the spray.  Of course, it has only been on for two weeks and it has not rained, so I do not know how long it will last.  Still, it is working and that is saving my plants and the seed for the birds.2.  Having a premix product is fine, but it is a very expensive way to do anything, especially if you have a large area or if you need to reapply the product after a few weeks.Overall, I would rat the Deer Off product well, but the packaging and the battery powered pump I would not recommend.  If you can buy the product as a concentrate, I would recommend it.  I gave the product a 3 star rating due to the battery powered pump and the fact that it is a premix.UPDATE:Well, I guess two weeks is about the limit.  Just a couple of days after writing the review the rabbits were back.  I put the rest of the concentrate I had into a hand sprayer and then sprayed the plants again.  That worked until we had a small rain shower pass through and then the rabbits were back.So, I now have to say that for the price this is definately NOT a good solution!!
B000A0VOD2 The actual fluid may very well be working - it's hard to tell.  My problem is with the motorized sprayer - it's more trouble than it's worth.  The alkaline AA batteries that came with it weren't producing any spray, so I replaced 'em with rechargeables.  This produced a sputtering short-range squirting.I may try John Casey's fix but honestly, I'd prefer to just pour the contents into an old squeeze-sprayer and try it that way.As to the fluid's effectiveness - well, *I* can't smell anything, but the DOG can, so he has added his own ingredients to the mix.  We'll see how THAT works out!.
B000A0VOD2 The all natural active abundant ingredient of putrescent egg solids did not smell very bad or repulsive to me. It also has GARLIC and CAPSAICIN (Capsicum chili peppers) in less quantity. I have smelled worse pesticide contraption cocktails before but this was not that bad. It did smell like rotten eggs a bit as I sprayed the product but as it was outdoors who cares? as long as the repellents worked to get rid of the Squirrel problem we have in our backyard.According to the manufacturer The strong, unpleasant smell of rotten eggs \"mimics the smell of rotting animals, tricking the deer, rabbit or squirrel into thinking there is a nearby predator\". Basically we are playing \"mind tricks\" here with the product with the pesky smart animals.Those pesky little brats have this crazy ways to chew the fence and I got tired of it. Applied some to the shrubs and the edges of the fence as well and observed for couple of days. I cannot be very sure if the product really worked but I am seeing less of them in my backyard. I did not see further new damage done by chewing since I applied so I can say it somewhat works.If this was really repulsive to the Squirrels then I would have expected them to not even show up in my backyard and make noises and chasing each other around. But they DID show up on couple of occasions in this last couple of days since I applied the product. Based on my observations I think it is not 100% effective for those pesky squirrels but just 'okay' product hence my honest 3 star rating.Application of the product was easy thanks to the Battery Powered sprayer(the reason for my interest in this product) The Battery Powered Sprayer can be used with other liquids as well like liquid Miracle grow plant food or that pesticide for killing weeds. So all-in-all it does have some re-use after-all! (Just make sure that you have enough source of batteries)Good to see it is Made in U.S.A - Bringing jobs to America. Kudos to that. We need more businesses like these. For that reason alone we must make best effort to try this product once! - Hey it might work like a miracle to you!Good Luck!
B000A0VOD2 Dead batteries, hard to push the safety switch to the safe position while keeping the sprayer pointed away from yourself.Fine print on the bottle says do not use on food plants, even though the Amazon page said that the product is recommended for organic gardening. Being OMRI listed and USDA approved for use in organic gardening is in direct contradiction to the instructions on the bottle.I had planned on using this for my cherry tomato plants, but the instructions on the package clearly say do not use on food plants.I did sacrifice one of my tomato plants, since I felt that a test of the spray wouldn't be complete without a plant that I know the deer love to eat.It was difficult using the sprayer, first was discovering that it had dead batteries, then of course I had to find replacement batteries. Then it took quite a while for the pump to prime. The safety switch is very difficult for me to place in the safe position while pointing the sprayer away from me, it might be easier for other people, as I have some limitations to hand strength.The spray went on ok once I had gotten all the bugs out of the system. It appears to work, but we have had quite a bit of rain, and it is very possible that the deer found somewhere else to munch on plants.Overall a two star item, since I grow mostly food plants, and I think the directions on the package over-ride what it says on the Amazon page
B000A0VOD2 For small areas, this battery-powered sprayer is a great, lightweight improvement over the pump sprayers . After spraying our pergola, all squirrels abandoned it - overnight!  We do have a metal squirrel proof feeder which effectively keeps away all squirrels.  We know this because we saw dozens of squirrels try to feed from it, crash to the ground, and then give up trying.  This spray will be very useful when we start feeding the birds again next Fall.  I plan to spray the plastic finch feeder to keep squirrels from chewing on it.  They are welcome to enjoy the seeds we leave on the ground for large birds.This easy-to-carry and use sprayer is also perfect for spraying small areas of flowers or a vegetable garden against deer. I will test it on rabbits as soon as they appear in our vegetable garden.
B000A0VOD2 I'm using this for small critters - rabbits and squirrels. We have a large back yard - it's fenced in, but rabbits ignore large fences, and squirrels just look and laugh. Or chitter. When our garden is in full bloom these critters must see an invisible \"salad bar\" sign. So I sprayed the plants with Deer Off. There was a definite drop off in plant damage.I can take or leave the battery powered sprayer. It works well, but it's another set of batteries to die over the Winter (Batteries are included.) I prefer the containers with the pump that pressurizes the chamber and lets you spray for almost a minute.One thing I am going to try - Squirrels destroy our Halloween pumpkins, carved or not (the pumpkins, not the squirrels.) They love the taste of that Golden Squash. I'm going to spray the pumpkins with Deer Off and see what happens. I'll update this once I try that.
B000A0VOD2 I didn't get the Havahart DO64MS Deer Off product to repel deer.  I wanted it to keep squirrels away from our bird feeder and out of my wife's flower beds.  Those pesky squirrels have been eating bird seed out of our feeder and digging around looking for dinner in among the flowers.  We were about out of ideas to keep them at bay until I found the `Deer Off' stuff.The Ready-to-Use Repellent came with a Battery Powered Sprayer that works a whole lot better than those trigger squeezing applicators most garden products utilize. The product does not stink and it is applied easily.Well, now about the effectiveness of the Havahart DO64MS repellent.  After we squirted almost everything we wanted to protect with the product there has not been a squirrel around doing mischief to anything.  Maybe the squirrels have gone north for the summer or maybe they are working at night or just maybe the Havahart repellent is working. We have our fingers crossed.I prefer to think the squirrel problem is under control and the repellent is doing what it is supposed to do.  So far the flower beds have not been disturbed and the bird feeder remains off limits to the squirrels.  It has been about two weeks since the repellent went on.If the Havahart DO64MS Deer Off II Deer, Rabbit, and Squirrel Ready-to-Use Repellent  along with the Battery Powered Sprayer fails in the future I will update this review, but things look good so far.
B000A0VOD2 The battery powered sprayer is a neat little bonus with this repellent and very welcome to these arthritic hands.It does make application much easier.  Here in Colorado this year we've had feast and famine when it comes to rain.  We're faring better than the middle of the country certainly and my garden has been pretty productive.  But the squirrels and rabbits have wreaked their havoc so I decided to use some of this stuff and it works.  I've had to make three applications because of heavy sporadic downpours, but it does deter the little pests and they stay clear.  I would recommend it and the powered sprayer (just be sure to do your maintenance so the sprayer doesn't become clogged) really is much simpler to use than pump...pump...pump....I would say buy it to any gardener who asked.
B000A0VOD2 Living out here in rural Missouri we perpetually have problem with squirrels, deer, rabbits, etc. constantly wanting to trample through our garden and eat everything before we have a chance to harvest it ourselves.  While we appreciate the beauty of nature and the wildlife, sometimes you just would like some fresh lettuce for yourself!  I decided to give this spray a try and see how effective it was at keeping deer and rabbits out of our garden area.  I applied it, following the directions, along the perimeter of the garden and fence.  After 2 weeks we noticed that while it had improved the number of rabbits and deer coming into the garden, it quickly lost its effectiveness.  After 2 weeks, and only modest rain, I re-applied, and again it lasted for about 2 weeks.So while it works, it is not as long-term effective as they claim - at least in my situation.  It does it's job, but can get costly in the long run if you are constantly re-applying all season long.On a side note, I did enjoy the fact it is battery operated!  Saved my hand big time!
B000A0VOD2 We like this product as it seems to be keeping away the squirrels from the garden and it's keeping the bird feeder safe for the birds!We really love the sprayer in this repellent.  It does make a bit of an irritating noise while it's working, but that's not a big deal.  It sprays out a couple feet.  The battery powered sprayer made using this really easy.  It came with batteries, but the batteries were dead.We don't get deer or rabbits in our yard so I don't know how this works on them.  Overall, this is a good product to keep the squirrels away from our yard!
B000A0VOD2 I took 16 raw, unshelled peanuts, and marked each with a number.  Then I treated 8 with \"Havahart DO64MS Deer Off II Deer, Rabbit, and Squirrel Ready-to-Use Repellent\" and kept 8 as a control.  I placed all 16 on the deck where red squirrels forage when they are not eating sunflower seeds from my bird feeders.An hour later, I looked outside and they were all there.  Thirty minutes after that, I looked outside, and all were gone, both the treated and the untreated peanuts.The active ingredient for this product has a scientific literature that supports its repellency for true herbivores.  Squirrels are not true herbivores, so I wouldn't expect it to be particularly effective, but I did expect my treated peanuts to last a little longer.  Red squirrels are known to eat eggs, the active ingredient in this product!  I'm going to try it out on some plants browsed by deer, and see whether there is an effect.Of course, the effectiveness of any repellent is influenced by the available and palatability of alternative foods.  My suggestion?  Make sure you use this product on plants in a location where an animal doesn't have to choose between starvation and this repellent.Need more information on the science behind repellents?  Search \"Hydrolyzed casein reduces browsing of trees and shrubs by white-tailed deer.\"
B000A0VOD2 I'm unable to write a review for this item as it arrived damaged. As in, the box was soaking wet as the product itself had exploded inside of the box. Proper packaging would have remedied this problem. I just hope there are no side effects to it as we handled it before knowing the box was wet. It got on a hassock and on our skin and clothing.
B000A0VOD2 Arrived in record time with easy to follow instructions and sprayer - even had batteries included that still had a charge.  I've used mixes in the past so this was not messy as well as easy and quick to spray on those new sprouts coming up.Sprayed two days ago and haven't seen any damage from rabbits or deer yet.  Time will tell though - I'll see how long the new plants go untouched, how often I have to spray and how long it lasts.  The 'mix' that I use has an AWFUL smell -- I didn't notice that with this so time will tell how well it works and I have my doubts.One thing about it - it's a pleasure not having to pump air into the sprayer.  This is going to be a reusable, lightweight container for me.
B000A0VOD2 I used this after using the Critter Ridder 3146 Animal Repellent, 5-Pounds Granular Shaker.  Both work well alone, but I think they work better together.The advantage of this product is the spray seems to last longer than the granular shaker and I was able to spray this on plants as well as on garbage cans, to keep away the squirrels.  rather than shaking a product onto the ground.I don't have much of a problem with deer but squirrels and rabbits and chipmunks and raccoons are in abundance.  This works best on deer, squirrels and rabbits while the shaker works well on raccoons and chipmunks as well. This product has more of a rotten egg odor while the shaker has more of a burning pepper odor.I sprayed  this around where I keep my garbage cans as well as on plants around my house.  It kept the squirrels and rabbits away but seemed less effective on chipmunks and raccoons which really seemed to respond to the the shaker.I like the idea that this product, as well as the shaker,  is natural and will not poison or kill anything.  The smell alone is enough to make me take notice but is not overpowering.I now use the spray on my plants and garbage cans but I also pour the shaker product on the ground around my garbage cans and plants. Combined these two are very effective.
B000A0VOD2 It's absolutely amazing!  I am an animal whisperer.  All I have to do is spray the Deer Off around my landscaping and the critters they come a running.  Not only is the salad bar open, but I'm obviously using a peppery salad dressing that the critters love. Whooo hooo!  Isn't that how it's supposed to work?
B000A0VOD2 Upon getting the spray, I had a hard time getting the sprayer to prime up. It took about 5 minutes or so of opening and closing the nozzle and holding my finger on it blocking the spray hole to get it started. Once i did, it was very good. It has an easy adjustable spray tip that goes from an almost mist to stream. There's just a slight smell from it but its nothing offensive at all, reminded me of yogurt. It has a slight milky color to it which is nice because you can see where you've sprayed. The main ingredients are egg, capsacian and garlic. Pretty simple ingredients and the label says its harmless to animals and humans. I believe its USDA approved for organic gardens which means it should be safe but one never really knows.I've only had this a few days and will update in a few weeks but so far, the squirrels aren't attacking by bird feeders. They can't resist sunflower seeds which are for the birds not them and climb right up the thin wrought iron plant hangers. I wanted to give this a try because I can't spend all day chasing them away. They keep the birds from coming and can go thru the entire feeder in no time flat. You'll get a batch of squirrels that are very bold so I hope this stuff continues to keep they off the feeders. I don't care about the grounds but not on the feeders. I sprayed the polls and the feeders, without getting the openings for the seeds. I also sprayed the surrounding grass and plants under and around the feeders.The birds don't seem effected at all. They eat from the feeders and the grounds under them with no apparent issues. There were a few squirrels but they didn't stick around long. Not sure if it was the spray or that they saw me watching them...lol.  Again, I'll update this in a few short weeks and give my final thoughts. Keep your fingers crossed!UPDATE 6-14-12:No Good, it seemed to work for a few days but now the squirrels are back and climbing up the plant hooks again. I sprayed the hooks and the bird feeders till they were dripping with the spray and it didn't stop them. Oh well! on to other inventions.
B000A0VOD2 Living in a rural area, I have an ongoing fight with trying to keep deer, rabbits, and a few other critters out of my garden areas. I've tried everything from human hair to mothballs, and none seem very effective for long, if at all. Havahard Deer Off seems to reduce the problem better than so-called home remedies, though even this isn't perfect. It washes off easily and needs to be reapplied frequently. Not really a good solution if you water the area daily, have a few nights of heavy dew, or live where it rains frequently. Of course this is going to be the case with anything that is topically aplied, and isn't really a fault of this or any other product like it, it's just the way things work. Still, it is a great aid for \"training\" the critters to stay away from those areas.
B000A0VOD2 I have used the Havahart products before and have always found them to be very effective in keeping the plant eaters at bay in my yard.Really the biggest hassle was that I had to spray so many things that my hand would get sore and stiff and I usually had to turn the job over to hubby about 1/2 way through.That's why I was so eager to try the power sprayer. With the battery charged sprayer using it on all the areas that my yard needs it has been so easy! The great repellant keeps the critters away and the great spray system means that my hands don't get sore and I don't have to look for help or talk my self out of doing the applications! Thanks Havahart for being so ingenious!
B000A0VOD2 This works great keeping the deer and especially the rabbits out of our garden. It has also kept the rabbits from chewing on the new trees I planted in the late summer. The sprayer works great and it is battery powered. It makes it so easy to get this exactly where you want it without waste. I'd highly recommend for keeping deer and especially rabbits from the garden.
B000A0VOD2 The mixture works, and it's nothing too scary, but it has it's limits.First, it's not really for vegetables, due to its' smell/composition.  That being said, it totally worked on decorative plants.  Deer came and left without a nibble.  For some, this is a great scenario.  For others, well the nearby but unsprayed veggies, not so much.  There was
B000A0VOD2 But I HATE the way they all flock to the oak trees on our property, and dig up the lawn trying to save the acorn bounty. I've used other Havahart products with a good level of success, so was hoping this one would be the same.It is! The sprayer worked great to cover a lot of area, and I've noticed a better lawn. While I still see the critters, especially after a good rain, my lawn is the proof of fewer varmints. While it is not 'odorless' as it claims, there is very little scent.Thanks, Havahart!
B000A0VOD2 We moved to a rural property last year. We have deer, jack rabbits, wild turkeys and more.  It's been a challenge to keep them away from the roses and other flowers around the house. We also have a garden, but we have a 'deer fence' around it.I've used Deer Off on the rose and other flowers, and around the garden fence, to discourage the rabbits and squirrels from going under. I don't have a lot growing yet, it's still early, but it does seem to be helping. I'm so glad I have this for when the veggie garden gets going!  I do like the battery powered sprayer as well.It's very strong smelling when you first spray it, it uses garlic, hot pepper and rotten egg scents to keep the animals away. And I like that as we have dry summers, I won't have to reapply that often. Recommended.
B000A0VOD2 The repellent works, at least short term. I used it on tomato plants because the ground squirrels were getting all the ripe tomatoes. After I used it, I got some tomatoes too. But the product wears off quickly (at least off tomato plants even though I never intentionally wet the leaves of the plant).The main problems I had -- and thus the 3-star rating -- were the difficulty of using the battery powered spray handle, the tendency of the tube to clog, and the frequency with which the plastic bottle itself fell over whenever I set it down on the uneven ground in the field. As I said, the liquid repellent itself is fairly effective in the short run. But the delivery system makes the whole thing unworkable for me.  A wider bottom on the plastic container would help.  An option to use manual effort to activate the sprayer would help.  I went through 2 sets of batteries in short order which added to the cost of using the repellent.It's just all too complicated and imperfect as is.  A simpler spray bottle would be better and likely cheaper.
B000A0VOD2 The battery-operated pump is worth the price! No more hand cramps!pre-mixed solution means no messy measuring and mixing. Easy!Will it keep deer away?  This year has been pretty harsh in my area on deer, and they are eating everything, even the plants that deer are supposed to not like (hostas etc.)  I live in a rather rural area with three acres, so deer frequent my back yard. They hop right over the fence.  They have still nibbled a bit on what plants were left, but this stuff definitely steered them to other un-sprayed plants.Be sure you are up-wind when you spray. The stuff smells nasty (like rotten eggs.)
B000A0VOD2 We have a severe problem with deer at our house, which is in a heavily wooded area. Deer would come in and chew on many of the plants, even those that deer are not supposed to like.  We have tried many kinds of deer repellent, with poor results so far.  The Havahart Deer Off, applied to some plants that the deer seemed particularly attracted to, did reduce grazing.  I see that some people complain of the smell, but I didn't really notice anything.  The primary ingredient is eggs.The battery-powered sprayer worked well, though the assembly instructions were not as clear as I would have liked.
B000A0VOD2 Initially I was going to give this product a 1 or 2 star review, but after observing a little more closely, clarity came. See below...I sprayed half of the container along a 50 ft backyard area which is only open on one side, the other two sides being neighbors privacy fences, and around some flower beds. The result 2 days later (and reason for threat of 1 star) was finding glistening deer droppings in my yard and a favorite plant on my deck eaten down to the nub. This was the first time I'd found deer droppings in my yard. My very first thought.... \"I've been trolled by a fricking deer!!\". Soon as I spray this stuff, they defecate in my yard and eat plants on my deck.After breathing a little (and resisting the urge to get a gun), I looked closer and realized that the deer (other than crossing over a barrier of spray to keep them out of my yard) had not eaten any plants near where I sprayed this product. In fact,  for the first time they went to my front yard and ate all my plants there.The obvious lesson learned here for me, spray everywhere I don't want them to eat and the spray does not act like a fence, keeping them out of areas.Still, I'm convinced I was trolled by a deer.
B000A0VOD2 I have a problem with squirrels jumping on my bird feeder and knocking all of the bird seed all over my deck. I sprayed this solution on the outside of the feeder and the deck railing and it seems to have no effect on the squirrels.
B000A0VOD2 In most years all of my daylilies have been eaten by mid June. Tulips are gone far earlier, of course, and hostas sometimes last into July. So far my army of Mr. Potato Heads and regular spraying with Havahart Deer Off have been keeping those pesky deer away. I'm even confident that they'll stay away this year as long as I remember to respray after heavy rains and to shake the Deer Off solution before spraying.Since I have quite a few patches of daylilies scattered all over Spud Acrres, spraying them by hand can tire these fingers quickly. I am crazy about the battery powered sprayer on the Deer Off. It took a few seconds to prime the sprayer and to adjust the spray to my preference, but now it comes out perfectly. Another convenient feature is that the batteries are not only included but also installed.After using up all of this batch of Deer Off , I'll definitely buy more to replace that which was used. Even those who become disenchanted with the Havahart deer/squirrel deterrent will still have a handy sprayer to use in another capacity.
B000A0VOD2 I have used other deer repellent products and found most to be messy to apply and the most effective one I have ever used leaves a whitish coating on the leaves of the flowers, detracting from their appearance. This one is clear and the battery operated sprayer made application a breeze! So far it seems to be working but because my deer graze in different areas every day/night I can't be sure until I actually see them reacting to this product. That could be quite some time before I can testify to their reaction to it but when and if it happens I will add to this review.
B000A0VOD2 Where I live, in a town house and a neighborhood, with a fence behind us with a shooting range beyond that. Deer... don't really exist in the area to any great extent.What we do have, however, is squirrels. My fiance likes to feed the birds. It took about 3 months, but sure enough, the squirrels found the feeder. We suffered through this humiliation as nothing seemed to work.Amazon Vine offered this to me to try out, so I did. And we are fairly happy with it.The battery powered sprayer means no more cramped hands... which is really nice.I personally don't love the way it smells when it is applied, but the results speak for themselves and after it dries, I smell nothing.And the best part? After spraying the area around the feeder, the squirrels came around a little, but they really don't seem to like to hang out anymore. They sometimes brave the odor, but usually they just pass on by. It helps that the neighbors have feeders as well... so they have somewhere else to check for food. I would tell them about this stuff, but hey, all's fair in love, war and squirrels!Worth it for me.
B000A0VOD2 There are two issues here.  The efficacy of the repellent itself and the efficacy of the sprayer.  I have used Deer Off for several years and it seems to work well when applied frequently.  I found that again.  I actually got to see my  lillies bloom this year.I was initially skeptical about the electric sprayer.  I couldn't understand how it would do any better than my hand pump sprayer.  I mean really...how hard is it to squeeze the trigger repeatedly.  Well... actually, I love this sprayer.  It allows me to spray a very even application.  I think I am using less and covering more..  I don't have the irregular large bursts of material that I have when I hand pump. I also haven't gotten it on my hands as much.So far this hasn't clogged...but I am guessing it will eventually.  This is the downfall of the product usually.  I go through sprayer after sprayer (I end up using extra windex or fantastic sprayers.  I am hoping it doesn't ruin this one.  You are supposed to rinse it out but that is very messy and cumbersome.....  doubt many people do it...anyway... I love this sprayer!!
B000A0VOD2 I have a bird feeder on top of a 10' pole, which I thoroughly soaked the Havahard Deer Off.  5 minutes later a squirrel climbed up the pole through the Deer Off.  I chased the squirrel away, and he was back in another 5 minutes.  The Deer Off did not even slow him down.What DOES work for me is greasing the pole with automotive grease weekly.  I had hoped that I could apply the Deer Off less frequently.  I also worry about poisoning the squirrels, since they obviously remove the grease from the pole physically, on their underbellies, and then lick it off.
B000A0VOD2 I was only able to \"spray\" with this for a minute or so. Then the spray turned to a stream which dripped off of everything. I changed the batteries thinking that maybe the batteries that came with it were old, but that didn't help at all, so it's a mechanical fail.I'm a person who cares about the environment, and the packaging disturbs me. The holster is plastic and doesn't have a recycle number on it, so that will end up in the landfill. The battery powered sprayer doesn't either, so the outside of that will end up in the landfill. Even though I'll see what I can do about recycling the insides, I'm sure many people won't and that will also end up in the landfill. To save the earth I'd rather buy this in a gallon jug and use my own pressurized tank sprayer than fuss with a battery operated sprayer. Environmental fail.I put this in my own tank sprayer.  Even after three applications on my purple coneflowers, the squirrels are still eating the flowerheads. Product fail.
B000A0VOD2 The offer of this product via the Vine Program could not have been better.  We recently removed some trees and to replace them we are building a new garden around around our house.  For the first time in my life I had a rose bush.  It was lovely, it has almost a dozen big red flowers on it one day... then the deer came.  Over night they ate not just the flowers but the tops of each branch.Our gardener suggested a chemical product but she wasn't sure what would work.  Deer normally didn't eat roses, maybe it is because of the drought and the hot temperatures.  Then I was offered this product and thought \"what can it hurt?\"The directions on this are easy to understand and it came with four batteries so I could use it right away.  The power spray makes this very easy to use and if you remove the batteries they should last a long time.  The biggest issue is to remember that the spray needs to dry on the plant for at least a good half an hour and if you get a heavy downpour of rain, respray.  Otherwise it lasts for weeks.It works!  I now have new flowers on the rose bush and it is healing from the damage.  Granted it doesn't smell so great at first but hey I want the flowers to look pretty even if I can't be there sniffing at them.Interestingly the neighborhood feral cat now loves the rose bush but is not damaging it in any way. Between cat and spray I feel like my rose bush can recover.  Next year when the lilies bloom again, I'll try this on them as well.
B000A0VOD2 I had something eating my sunflowers that are starting to pop up, so I sprayed this stuff around.  I have deer, possum, rabbits, raccoons and even coyotes lurking around the area, so I have no idea which was the culprit.  Since I sprayed, my sunflowers have been left alone, but whether or not that was because of the \"Deer Off\" stuff or not is hard to tell.  But I will give the stuff the benefit of the doubt and say it works and give it a four star rating.  However, more testing will be necessary to be sure.The battery powered squinter is pretty cool, but I'd rather just have a squeeze handle if that would save me money.
B000A0VOD2 This product is very easy to use and it works in a most excellent way! I used this around our bird feeder where squirrels were eating all our bird food. After spraying the Deer Off on the bird feeder pole and around the base, the squirrels stopped coming near it, and it did not bother the birds at all.Deer Off comes in a container all ready to use - no mixing or putting anything together. The spray attachment is a very lightweight squeeze-type gun with an adjustable twist nozzle to change the spray from narrow to broad. The power that runs this spray is battery, and the battery is included. So everything is ready for you to use right out of the box.The instructions are simple, always shake before use, and try it on a small patch of plants before wide use to be sure it won't hurt the plants. Keep it away from children, and be careful of using on a windy day because you don't want to get this on your or on your face. The main ingredients are rotten eggs solids (sulfur smell), capsaicin (hot pepper oil),and garlic. The product says it is a taste and smell deterrent - and with those ingredients, you can believe that.The product covers 1,000 square feet, it is weather resistant, and promises to protect flowers and shrubs, and you only need to reapply every 2-3 months. It is not suggested for use on food items, but you can spray it on the outside perimeter around the garden to keep animals out of your garden. If you do get exposed, all you need to do is wash hands, face, eyes etc. with water.
B000A0VOD2 This is a pricey solution - literally and figuratively - for people looking to rid their lawns and gardens of deer, rabbits, and other pesky critters. Part of the reason for that cost, however, is the inclusion of a surprisingly handy battery powered sprayer. Potential buyers might wonder if something like that is worth the extra cost, and I would say that for anybody with severe arthritis or other issues that make spraying or sprinkling this kind of product a painful exercise, the expense is worth it. The sprayer works very well, and it not only reduces the effort involved in spraying the repellent, it makes the job go a lot faster. Just be prepared to spend a little extra money on batteries - this thing will use a lot of them over the course of an outdoor season.
B000A0VOD2 So far so good. I had no problems assembling and using the sprayer and I haven't noticed any animal issues since the application. My only concern is that we haven't hit the rainy season yet. I'm not sure how the product will fare through our heavy rainfall but at least the summer foliage has been saved.
B000A0VOD2 We did a pretty nice sized garden this year after picking up some old abandoned city lots last year. We prepped the lots over the fall and took advantage of this year's unusual growing season by planting and trying our hand at a wide variety of vegetables and fruits.In our mid-sized rural town, we have a ferrel cat problem that like to use the gardens as their litter box and we also have squirels and huge jack rabbits that like to plunder the goods as well, and the occassional possums, but no deer.Although we didn't even consider or start using the Deer Off until late in the growing season, I really didn't notice any real control of the local critters, to give a fair assessment. We still have rabbits, but I haven't noticed as many squirels, except for the Black Walnut and Apricot trees.I still catch lots of cats using our garden as a litter box, which really bothers me. I did pick up a fewlive traps, which has really helped in catching some of them. We have caught quite a few, but they breed just a fast and this has been an unchecked problem for decades out here.To give a better assessment of the Deer Off, I plan on using this next year, early on, so that I can see if it really does work. As of now, if it has helped with just the squirels, then I am willing to give it another shot. I will post an update when that time comes around.
B000A0VOD2 I have eight prized potted urns inside of our swimming pool fence.  Deer are not a problem, but rabbits wreck havoc on my plants.  The urns are a mixture of spikes, dahlia, snow princess, and fiber optic grass.  The fiber optic grass is unusual and gets so many compliments, but seems to be \"filet mignon\" to the hundreds of bunnies in our area.  I have purchased container after container of cayenne pepper to keep them away, but (1) the bright orange detracts from the beauty of the plants, (2) the pepper hasn't seemed to completely deter the rabbits, (3) it needs reapplied DAILY since I water daily, and (4) daily application has gotten EXPENSIVE.  So, I finally decided to order this Deer Off as a deterrent.  I was so worried about applying it to my beautiful urns.  I was concerned it might harm one or more of the delicate flowers.  I finally decided to apply it to one urn as a \"test.\"  None of the plants or flowers seem to mind the product one bit!  The next day they were still as healthy, happy and beautiful as they were before the application.  The directions say the Deer Off is resistant to water and only needs reapplied every two to three months.  So far so good.  I have not seen the bunnies \"feasting\" since I applied the product.  I have since applied it to all of my urns and then applied it to all of my hostas, which also seem to be a wildlife \"treat.\"  I am very pleased with the product thus far.  The battery operated sprayer is a nice feature so you don't have to continually pump.  The only MINOR negative I have about the sprayer application is that I wish it could have been adjusted for more of a \"mist.\"  The nozzle seemed to adjust from a heavy stream to a fine stream.  Because I was so apprehensive before using the product for the first time, I only wanted to apply a fine mist.  Now that I have found the product to be harmless to my plants, I will not be as concerned about the application.
B000A0VOD2 For several months a year we have a rabbits come and go throughout our yard during the night.  Although they don't seem to be doing any damage, they leave behind \"Beans\" (poop) that my dog always seems to think she needs to eat.  Of course we pull her back from the piles of beans but every now and then she'll get one.  It absolutely disgusts us.  We decided to give this repellent a try and haven't seen any new piles of \"beans\" since then.  Yay!I can't say for certain that this works for all the other animals listed but it certainly seems to have repelled the rabbits.Our only problem with this product was when we went to use it for the first time.  Nothing came out.  We kept trying and re-reading the directions but nothing seemed to work.  Eventually we took the item to our sink and took the hose out and squeezed the entire length of the hose.  There was a clot in the hose that once we got past that section it worked perfectly.  No problems since then.  It's very easy to use.If you have a rabbit problem, I would certainly recommend this product.
B000A0VOD2 I have given this product just a preliminary test and so far so good. The sprayer works very well and is very easy to spray in a jet or mist. I have used this brand of product for deer previously and it seems to work. What I have tried this time is spraying around the pine tree trunk about 5 feet up and down all the way around and then sprayed where the bird feeder is hung from a tree branch by a chain. I could shoot the sprayer up to the branch without a ladder. It has been about a week and so far no squirrels in the feeder. I have a few apple trees that need winter protection but it will be months before results will be known for the apple trees. So far the Havahart DO64MS seems to work as advertized.
B000A0VOD2 Havahart's Deer Off Repellent is an excellent choice for those looking for a kid and pet-safe deterrent for unwanted deer, rabbits, and squirrels. Deer Off features a battery-powered sprayer, making it simple and easy to use.The product features a dual-action all-natural deterrent, largely made of garlic, that rebels pests with both scent and taste. The 64 oz. bottle will protect up to 1,000 square feet. The manufacturer claims that the repellent will last up to three months with a single application. Both the Organic Materials Review Institute and the USDA have approved the product for organic gardening.While three months haven't gone by, I can say that the product has seemed to have kept the deer away from some of our garden's prized possessions. The battery-powered sprayer is simple to use - there's no need to mix or pump.
B000A0VOD2 I live in a pretty suburban area yet we are frequented by rabbits, raccoons, squirrels, possums, and even deer.  My backyard is surrounded by a 6'6\" wooden fence so we only get the smaller animals back there where I have my vegetable garden.  However, the front yard is open to larger creatures (including the deer) that like to munch on my flowers and bushes.  My garden is protected by theHavahart Motion Detector Sprinklerand a few other deterrents but my front yard was undefended until now.When I got a chance to try the Havahart Deer Off II I hoped that it would cut down on the bigger critters eating my landscaping.  I am an animal lover so I don't want to hurt them, I just wanted them to go back to more wooded areas.  I sprayed my ground-cover, the flowers and the shrubs that could be reached by deer.  The spray was fairly stinky when it was being applied, but not overly so.  The battery power was nice but I would rather have a pump version so I could increase the pressure of the spray to suit my pace of spraying.Once applied I kept checking to see if I had new growth on previously chewed-up plants.  The result was mixed.  The taller greenery seemed have been protected but something is still eating my flowers.  We are experiencing a drought here in San Antonio and it just could be that the animals will ignore the bad taste when they are starving.  Still, it is an improvement.  I like that the mix is all natural and it seems to be reasonably priced.  I will be buying more of this in the future.
B000A0VOD2 We live in the woods and have all kinds of wild critters around. I've had my roses and other plants eaten to the nubs by deer, rabbits, squirrels, chipmunks - and skunks have dug up the roots as well.I make a lot of my own tonics for flowers and veggies, so I'm familiar with the ingredients in most liquid deterrents. The main one is ROTTEN EGGS, and \"Deer Off\" is no different. It also has garlic and ingredients from hot peppers. (This product is much like \"Liquid Fence,\" which sells for a hefty price).Those are normal ingredients in these type of products - and the good news is, they are all-natural (if stinky). I do make my own version of this, and it works well. But my way does smell like death warmed over! I take eggs and shells, put them in a plastic container (Folgers' coffee jars work great), add a little water, and let the mess brew (outside). BUT then I have to strain the goop out, which is gawdawful, add the hot sauce etc., the liquid soap to make it all stick, dump it in a sprayer with water, and apply. Within a day or two, humans can't smell it, but the animals do - for about a month.You can go through all that - or you can just get Deer Off - and done! Right out of the bottle, it doesn't smell bad, so that's a major point (far less than my brew, and less than Liquid Fence). Also, it's premixed - ready to shoot. My favorite part was the handy, comes-with-it electric sprayer - batteries included! I opened the jug, broke the seal, and inserted the sprayer's tube. Turned it on, adjusted the nozzle to get the spray I wanted, and that was it. Make sure you pick a non-windy day and you'll find it easy to apply an even coat to your plants (like my climbing roses that go up to 7 feet). I got my whole garden and flower pots done, front and back of the house, in about 20 minutes, with lots of \"juice\" left over for other applications.Best of all, I've had it on a few weeks now, and not a nibbler, big or small, has shown a desire to eat the \"rotten\" result.$33 for this item is considerable, but it's not that much when you remember the cost of your plants, and the loving care you give them.By the way, the spray is likely to leave a whitish residue on some of the leaves - not the best, but better than having NO leaves at all. And the overspray permanently spotted one or two of my plastic containers (not all the pots).Parting shot - when you're done, pull the sprayer tube out of the jug, put it in a cup of water, and let it blow for a minute to ensure it will be clean and clog-free for your next use.5 stars - recommended!
B000A0VOD2 I used this Havahart Deer Off at a family cemetery plot location in a remoted wooded area at the edge of town.  We have several family members buried there.  It's a beautiful spot, but one cannot put out fresh flowers, as the deer will eat them all, completely, each night.Application process was straightforward, wetting down the flowers per directions.  The powered sprayer provided a nice adjustable stream/mist.  This powered pump is of course much easier to use than a typical squeeze handle sprayer bottle.  However, I'm not sure it's that much more convenient than a pump up pressure sprayer (which don't need batteries and provide higher capacities . . . in the multi-gallons).  But for wetting down a few plants or flowers, this was easy, quick, and convenient.Results:  I definitely got results, as (checking back after 2 nights) not all of the flowers had gotten eaten.  But, SOME flowers (both blooms and greenery) were munched and gone - maybe about half.Maybe another application will help.  I'll do that and re-edit this review if and when my results improve. At this point, I can't really recommend this repellent on the hope that half of your plants will survive.
B000A0VOD2 Easy to use and apply, this is a great way to keep deer and other woodland pests away from your prized garden items.Setup is a snap, simply connect the trigger to the bottle, and begin applying. It is batter operated so simply pulling the trigger sends a steady stream of the product, an adjustable nozzle allows you to apply anything from a light mist to sharp stream. It goes on easily, though after several days, especially after rain, you would have to reapply it. It contains hot pepper extracts so there is a bit of a smell associated with it, it is tolerable, especially since you know that smell means the sweet smell of deterred deer.
B000A0VOD2 I've been having a horrible problem with squirrels lately.  They dig up the garden, chew up my iris bulbs, and have been systematically gnawing away at my attic vents.I sprayed the garden with the Deer Off II  repellent and it seems to keep the little fiends away from the plants, but no such luck with the house.  I sprayed the wooden attic vents but they still keep chewing away at them.  I also sprayed it on the wooden fence (which they use to hop onto the roof of the house), but they still scamper across it without noticing the spray.Oh well, at least the repellent is keeping them out of the garden.  My roses and irises are safe.
B000A0VOD2 We had rabbits eating lots of hay from our stack of bales and thought we'd give this a try.The battery powered sprayer didn't work so we used another spray bottle instead.We sprayed around the bales but we still see them hanging around near the hay.  There does seem to be a reduction in how much they are eating, though that could be because of all the new spring growth in the yard.We will try this in the garden after planting this Spring and update the review.
B000A0VOD2 i picked this up because we have had an epidemic of rabbits lately. They seem to just appear in droves, eating anything they find including gardens. so, I took this and sprayed it, trying to see if it helped. It did. Where I had armies of irritating rabbits wandering around there seemed to be a barrier, and they didn't want anything to do with it. I liked that and I liked the ease of use, which came from having a spray bottle. honestly, i never pictured myself wanting more of this but I found another little bonus and it is almost as good as the rabbits being buffered from my stuff.When I park my vehicle, we have a lot of open areas and fields filled with grass. This means you get a lot of field mice and they like to climb into vehicles and nest. This year alone, I have had six do that in my Jeep and that is not only annoying but awful. anyhow, I sprayed this around, avoiding the areas when my cats are, thinking it might help. I also knew there was a mouse attempting to build a nest again and I wanted to try him out. Well, he did not return at first. There is something in this that told him to go away and I liked that. Maybe its a scent thing, I'm no mouse expert, but it saved me another dead one in a trap so far. So, that's two.I didn't try this on deer, so I cannot profess to that. Just wanted to note that as well, although there haven't been any deer here. Maybe they psychically knew and just avoided it beforehand. So much smarter than rabbits.
B000A0VOD2 My flowers have lasted a lot longer so far this year. I never catch the animals in the act of eating them so I can never be too sure what's getting them (assuming deer). This year my flowers have stayed around. The season is not over yet so Im not sure if I will need to reapply but for now I am happy.The battery powered applicator is a nice change - no hand pumps and no rinsing reusable containers.
B000A0VOD2 I tried another product by Havahart called Critter Ridder which was totally ineffective in repelling rabbits and squirrels from my rose bushes.This product faired better.  I applied it to two rose bushes that had been chewed on by rabbits and squirrels.  These rose bushes were unmolested for two weeks and had a chance to put out more leaves.  Then it rained hard (really hard) and the next morning the animals were back at the salad bar.  After re-applying they were once again repelled.  Ok, I thought that was really heavy rain.  But a week later, a mild rain shower also reduced its effectiveness.It does smell a bit, but not intolerable.  The sprayer works well if you prime it.If you are willing to be diligent about applying after rain (or if you water from above, this does work).  The 90 day claim, I suppose, is for if it never rains.These tips were provided by the company:\"IMPORTANT: Shake product well before using.TIPS:1. To prevent future clogging, be sure to rinse the sprayer after use with water - this ensures no dry pieces can form clogs. Always shake vigorously before spraying. Shaking the product ensures that the active repellent ingredients, which may settle to the bottom, are mixed together before the sprayer is activated.2. Always apply the product before temperatures drop below 40 degrees. As with all liquid repellent, they can freeze and cause damage to the plant if sprayed when temperatures are below 40 degrees.3. Always reapply repellent after days of heavy rain or if heavy rain occurs within 24 hours of spraying.4. Do not spray liquid repellents in wet conditions or in damp, cold, foggy or misty, weather, or if precipitation occurs before spray can dry. Protection may be partially or completely lost if it does not fully dry before rain. Note: Dries quickly within the hour\"
B000A0VOD2 I am not sure this product is any more effective then pouring urine near plants but I suppose it may be easier to apply depending on where one is located. I do like that aside from eye contanimation it does not come with other serious health warnings. It does require reapplication after heavy rain and needs protection from freezing. Depending on where one lives, storage and frequency of application may be an issue for some. It does state the product is odorless to humans, one thing urine can't promise.
B000A0VOD2 I find a lot of these products work if you keep reapplying. I have deer and rabbits - squirrels, too, but they don't eat my plants. This is for ornamental plants, only, or you will have a tough time scrubbing it off your lettuce! I don't really find the battery sprayer to be better than a hand sprayer, but no doubt if you are spraying a large area, you'll appreciate the battery power.
B000A0VOD2 I really liked using this one..with the powered sprayer it made a huge difference in getting all my bushes, garden fencing, hanging plants, etc, sprayed without getting a sore, worn out hand!  Usually I also get the stinky spray all over my hand too from pumping the nozzle head..not this time!  I also like the fact that I don't have to mix anything.  This product says water repellent so we will see as I don't get rain all that frequently.  I do know that I haven't had anymore nibbling from deer for a week and whatever was trying to tunnel into my garden seems to have given up, we will see!  I really like the battery powered sprayer :)
B000A0VOD2 We have rabbits that love to hide under our garden shed. Even worse our dogs go crazy trying to get at them so we not only have food from our garden chomped on at night but also have to listen to three dogs baying at the shed for hours as they're taunted from the lapin-coated meaty goodness within.The Deer Off II seemed like a good solution, and with the motorized pump application was expected to be easy.Set up was simple. First thing you do is shake the bottle and that's it for mixing; no adding ingredients or worrying about stirring in poisonous compounds etc. You then open the bottle up, remove the usual protective tin foil and drop in the line that's attached to the fairly small blue motorized pump handle.There's a lock on the pump to prevent accidental spray and also a trigger. I was aware based on the instructions that the pump takes a few moments to charge but upon first pull nothing happened. I checked that it had batteries in it (it does and it comes with four AAs) and took them out and ensured the polarity was correct. After replacing them I immediately heard a whir of the motor so they simply must have jigged loose in shipping. A few seconds later the Deer Off II was spurting out repellent at quite a surprising distance - I'd say around three feet.So I went around the offending shed area getting the boundary completely saturated and then getting some underneath for good luck too. I didn't see any varmints scurrying out but they're usually out and about on adventures until dusk.Next day came and there wasn't a squeak out of our dogs. Not once did they pay attention to the shed and that's unusual. It worked! The application is supposed to last ninety days or so but I can't comment on that yet but the speed of delivery and easy of use, plus the apparent working effect has me sold.The price is fair, there's no manually pumping or fiddling with ingredients, the product is safe for children and pets and really helped with my rabbit problem. I can't say how it acts on the other rodents listed but for me I'm a fan.
B000A0VOD2 A few years ago our neighborhood was inveded bu bunnies.  At first it was cute to see them on our lawn; the kids loved them.  But after seeing the dead patches they left, the bunnies had to go.  We have tried many different solutions with varying degrees of effectiveness.  This spray works well and is easy to apply.  We have tried some liquids that reeked, but this one is not bad.  Simple to apply and lasts a decent amount of time.  Since our Labrador thinks the bunnies are cuddle toys, and our Bassett Hound isn't fast enough to catch them; I think we will be sticking to Deer Off (or a pellet gun).
B000A0VOD2 This review reminds me of the old joke about the box of baking soda in the fridge put their to keep away elephants.  The rationale is that if there are no elephants in the fridge, it must be working.  I like the delivery system on this, it beats the heck out of the squeeze pump.  I only saw deer once in my yard and after I sprayed I haven't seen them since.  The big \"but\" is that I don't have empirical evidence that the reason I haven't seen them again is the spray.  It is easy to use and I guess it is working but I am hard pressed to offer any proof.addendum  6/8/13  I went to use this again and the battery spray no longer works.  I ran it in warm water thinking it may have gotten gummed up but to no avail.  So one use it worked, the second use the battery spray failed.  I did replace the batteries although it was making noises with the old batteries, I gave that a shot anyway.  Still didn't work. Since my primary reason for liking this was the delivery system I have downgraded my review rating.
B000A0VOD2 I have moved into a neighborhood teeming with wildlife: deer, raccoons, rabbits... As much as I enjoy it, I'd also like to have some landscaping. After carefully researching deer-resistant plants, I re-landscaped the whole yard with those choices. For additional insurance, I followed all of my neighbors' advice & bought deer repellent. I chose this one as it specifically includes rabbits in the description of animals repelled by this product whereas the local nurseries could only steer me in the direction of deer resistant plants.  I recognize that when animals are hungry they will eat anything but I used this product exactly as directed, we have not had a great deal of rain, & the rabbits & deer have eaten everything in my yard.  According to the directions, it still should be working for at least another 6 wks. My neighbor uses a product called Plantskydd, also non-toxic & it really seems to work. It has an odor that would gag a sewer tank repair person but it does air out & still seems to keep the animals away.  I would recommend that over Deer Off.
B000A0VOD2 What these products are is a deterrent. That means it hopefully keeps many of your local population at bay to protect your trees, plants, veggies, etc. These sprays are best used with other methods like chicken wire, etc. You also have to realize that you will still lose some stuff to these little critters but the idea is to limit that loss.In that case, I think Deer Off II works as well as any other critter off spray I have tried. These are best reapplied every 45-60 days (regardless of what they advertise since that is a \"up to\" day count). The spray didn't seem any better than past products but I did appreciate the fact that you don't have to mix it or hurt your thumb spraying due to the battery powered sprayer.I would recommend this product.
B000A0VOD2 This sprayer required no real assembly, batteries are included.I went out in the back yard to spray these huge hostas that the deer have been feasting on.The spray was easy and smooth and even after a week with a light rain 2 days after I sprayed there are no new chomp marks.  So other than it would be nice to have a refill to use in the sprayer, since it continues to work, since it seems a waste to keep buying a sprayer I'm very happy with this product.
B000A0VOD2 I love the deer that come around and I find their hoof prints in my garden I feel one with nature, BUT, they do ruin my flowers and shrubs.I was trained as a Master Gardener and I know what plants they eat and what they should not.  Should is the word, when they are hungry that will eat just about anything that grows.It is easier to find flowers and or shrubs that they tend to stay away from, even though they may nibble them anyway.  They may eat my roses and leave the neighbors alone so it is hard to tell.So the best way is go buy a deterrent such as this product.  They all basically work the same way, one may be a little better than the other, and there are gadgets to stop them, they also work.  The best thing to do is buy them all and try which one works best.  Thanks to Amazon sending me an assortment of product so I could do just that.This product works quit well, but what I really like is the sprayer, it is automatic, too bad mine did not work for me, I pumped and pumped and nothing came out, but this was a gift from Amazon for my reveiw so with that said and out of the way. The rest of my review is as stands, just had to use a regular sprayer and that was not a problem for me, I did not know the sprayer was automatice before I ordered it.I found that it did not have to be sprayed every time it rained and it rained here a lot this past month.  I only sprayed it once.  I even noticed that the rabbits stopped chewing on my cactus plant.Remember that animals are similar to humans in some ways, one is that they will eat something that is not so wonderful if they are hungry.  I remember the first time I had coffee, I thought I was going to be sick, then after a few more tries, especially when I was hunger I grew to love it.  You might want to change products from time to time to confuse them. So even if you spray and it chases them away, after awhile, and if they are hungry enough, they will e. So sometimes it may not be the spray.I find this worked as well as you could expect from spray like this, just remember to spray the entire plant to be sure it is completely covered.I am sure you will be happy with this and it is worth the cost to keep those rascally deer from chewing on your prized flowers.
B000A0VOD2 Squirrels can be as destructive as their smooth tailed rodent cousins the rat. I never believed this til they took up resident above my bedroom, in the attic. They have chewed holes RIGHT THRU MY SHEET ROCK CEILING, with one hole directly over my pillow, about 2 inches in diameter. So the SQUIRRELS MUST GO. Sorry Rocky. After spending a lot of money on pest control, having them trapped and removed from the attic, they returned. According to the trapper, THE SCENT OF SQUIRREL BRINGS THEM BACK. So, what do you do to get that scent removed from the attic? Actually, I dont know, but I tried HAVAHART DEER OFF repellent. It seems to work, but in the summer, the attic is too hot for squirrels, so I'm not sure. I did, however, test the product in other ways.REPELLENT EFFECT---The squirrels also go after the bird feeder. So, I tired spraying a lot of HAVAHART REPELLENT on some bird food. The squirrel came up to the bird food, SNIFFED IT, and turned around and left the food alone. Later, several squirrls came back and ate it anyway. This concoction will REPELL the squirrels, but not REPULSE them. If the squirrels, or any other animal, is starving, it WILL eat whatever this is sprayed on. This isnt a poison; its just made from garlic, hot sauce, and rotten eggs. If you were starving, and I sprayed \"DEER OFF\" on some potato chips, you'd eat the chips too. However if you were only hungry, with alternate available sources of food, you'd be repelled by the smell, and search out other food. I also sprayed some rain gutter pipes, which the squirrels like to climb. I havent seen them on the pipes since.HAVAHART CUSTOMER SERVICE HOT LINE--- I called up the Havahart customer service hotline number on the bottle. I talked to a nice woman who knew all about the product and its uses. So, dont be afraid to buy this, and be left out in the cold for specific help. They know HOW to spray this, where to spray it, etc. When I told her I had squirrels in the attic, she advised I spray the product OUTSIDE THE HOUSE, around where they go in. The repellent functions like locked door, that repell the squirrels from entering. After they come in, the repellent will only keep the squirrels from AREAs of the attic, where you sprayed. You need to keep them from the ENTRY POINT. She also suggested I wear goggles to keep the spray out of my eyes, cover my nose and mouth, and be sure to spray on a windless day. To keep from washing away, the product needs to dry completely BEFORE it rains.PRODUCT USE--- When customer service advised I spray this product around my roof's eves, I wondered \"How can I reach them?\" My roof is 20-25 feet off the ground. I'm not climbing up and down a latter all day to spray squirrel repellent. This is where the BATTERY POWERED SPRAYER comes in handy. This spray attachment is unlike ANYTHING i've ever seen.  IT shoots a continuous, narrow spray of repellent at least 15 feet DIRECTLY up in the air. So, I was able to shoot the spray almost everywhere I wanted it. (Remember, you can hold the spray attachment over your head, placing the spray gun about 10 feet off the ground for most adults.) The height you achieve with this electic sprayer is also useful, if you have fruit or nuts on a tree, that you dont want squirrels to ruin. Best of all, after the repellent is depleted you'll own a SPRAY GUN, for spraying insectide, fertilizer, etc. Its an obvious godsend if you have tendinitis, arthitis, etc in your hands.ASSESSMENT--Ok, the product doesnt repulse the animals. I doubt any product will, without repulsing you as well. (Or perhaps poisoning you or your pets.) If you are desperate to try ANYTHING, to prevent squirrels, rabbits, deer, or other critters from destroying your plants and property, this is certainly worth trying. It's best to use multiple tactics, ie spray the product AND use a deer fense on gardens that border the woods, or trap the squirrels in the attic, then nail closed the openings in the eves where the squirrels entered. I've even seen people experiment with those supersonic whistles, or hang up plastic owls to scare rabbits from the garden. I'd rather chose a product that isnt TOO strong, than use a harse inorganic chemical, and harm the wildlife. (Poisoning wildlife is illegal anyway.)Dont let these animal's attempts at \"cuteness\" weigh against your determination to save your property. Those pesty critters are freeloaders that need to go get a job in a pet food factory as ingredients.
B000A0VOD2 It's hard to do a review by what you DON'T see so you could tell me this is an elephant repellent and I would believe it based on no elephants in my yard.All joking aside, I really don't have a big deer problem because I have a 40 acre farm and they stay in the pastures and hay fields ,for the most part, and the rabbits keep a low profile. My biggest aggravation is the bird-feeders on the deck. I have a regular feeder, a sunflower seed feeder and hummingbird feeders.  The squirrels make themselves at home in the sunflower seeds but they split their time between there and the chestnut and oak trees so I can deal with that. However SOMETHING climbs the dogwood tree to the deck every night and sucks the hummingbird feeders dry. No damage but sometimes they take the feeders down and leave them on the railing for refills. I was hoping there might be a chance this might work. Miracle!! It did ,for THREE nights. Or was it just coincidence? Since they don't say this will work for raccoon (or whatever) maybe it's not fair to judge by that.As for the battery operated sprayer, in my opinion, it's just a marketing gimmick.  It took me at least twenty minutes to get it working. I took the hose off and soaked it in warm water, finally got it primed.  There was no \"spray or stream\" choice on mine. Just squirt. If it's supposed to last 90 days do you go back to find a dead battery? Frankly, the battery powered sprayer alone would deter me from buying the repellent. Give me something I can depend on when I want to use it.
B000A0VOD2 We back up to woods so I was not sure if it was deer, ground hogs or rabbits, but our squash plants were getting decimated.  After spraying this on the leaves (but not the squash) the damage stopped.  Although I consider the ingredients organic, I can't imagine the residue would taste good on your squash.One complaint - common with other reviewers - is that the sprayer gives a weak stream.  For my targeted purposes (Squash leaves but not the blossom or squash) it worked out OK, but I could see this being a major pain if you were, for example, spraying down a hydrangea bush or other large plant.
B000A0VOD2 Lots of times I have a hard time using garden sprays and pumps because of arthritic hands. This battery powered sprayer is really easy to use. The packaging, as a whole is wonderful. I like the plastic holder that hangs from the cap and makes it easy to store the sprayer. Be sure to lock it before storing. There was no wand with our bottle of repellant so it was impossible to apply a fine mist/spray. The main repellant ingredient are egg, pepper and garlic. I was disappointed that this could not be used on food product plants. We have a major problem with squirrels eating the fruit trees, veggies and herbs in the garden. I sprayed all of the trails that they usually use to get to our plants, the gutters, railing on the deck, stone wall ledges. So far, so good, but I will edit this review after a few days and update the progress.The blurb on this site says safe for humans and domestic animals, however, there is a little fine print on the bottle that says it can be hazardous to both.The produce is odorless to me, I just hope the squirrels hate it. My well meaning neighbor saved a nest full of the creatures a few years ago by bottle feeding them, now for the first time in over 40 years in this house, we are overrun. At least we don't have a deer problem.
B000A0YHHM I use those for the second season now for my potted lime and blood orange trees.be aware that one hole spuke is to much for most potted citrus fruits, so I broke them in half at the beginning of the season and used them 3 months apart. When i used a whole spike the first year I had heavy but thin growth and some discolored leaves. I made some pictures and send them to a forum and got told of because I overfed the poor buggers. So, break them into pieces if your pots arent that big.....Aside of that a very convenient way of fertilizing.ANother small tip,http://www.amazon.com/Bayer-701285B-Disease-Concentrate-32-Ounce/dp/B000VZQ3FU/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid;=1404267488&sr;=8-2&keywords;=bayer+mite+controlkeeps the ugly buggers and sicknesses away!Hope your trees grow as beautiful as mine!
B000A0YHHM Our trees have been growing at a much quicker rate since using these food spikes. They arrived in tact and not broken. Easy to pound into the ground.
B000A0YHHM unlike the granular citrus fertilizer of the same brand, this one does not appear (at least from the labelled ingredients?) to contain any animal matter.so as other reviews have recommended, slice off a bit and put it in your indoor or outdoor houseplant.
B000A0YHHM I do know Jobe's fertillizer goes on sale at local hardware store every year and it is half price.  I like the spike idea
B000A0YHHM I have my fruit trees in pots, so I take each fruit spike and break it in 3 pieces and just lay one piece on top of the soil.  I water over the spike to distribute the nutrients once a week.  My trees really perked up!  Outstanding value and free shipping!
B000A0YHHM I saw these in an ad for the local ace hardware for $3 after instant rebate. Figured I had nothing to lose with the price being so low.The basic idea is to drive the fertilizer spike into the ground near your fruit and citrus trees. The product recommends about 30 inches away from the trunk. Take one of the plastic caps, place it over one of the fertilizer spikes, and hammer it into the ground. When the plastic cap is about flush with ground level, remove it and continue beating the spike into the ground.I had the same issue as others that mine came with the spikes but no caps. Let me tell you, it doesn't work as well without the caps. Hammering the spikes causes them to break apart before entering the ground completely. I only did it three times without the cap, but each time I basically had to beat extra chunks into the ground.I wrote the company and received a response back saying they would send the caps right away and had a malfunction with their machine. Three days later and a small package arrived full of caps. I was a little disappointed they didn't replace the spikes I destroyed without the caps, but then again I only paid $3 for them.I would consider buying this product if the price dropped under $10, but $15 seems steep for my purposes. If you have several fruit and citrus trees, this might be a better/ easier alternative to other fertilizers.
B000A1E690 Winter is coming full-force in Upstate NY and I was happy to find such a great, sturdy and ergonomic shovel on Amazon.This shovel is strong and easy to use.  The handle is wide enough to accommodate a thick ragg wool glove with ease.  The wear strip is a nice extra when shoveling ice and hitting blacktop or concrete.  I have a much cheaper shovel and don't trust it half as much as this one.  The ergo design does help your back when lifting and pushing.If you need a shovel and are thinking about it, buy this one -- it's great for fluffy and slushy snow.  The capacity is pretty large -- so be mindful of your back.
B000A1E690 I like the look, feel and weight of this shovel. Due to climate changes I have had very little experience using this shovel in the snow but it works good during fall leaf clean ups.
B000A1E690 I bought this shovel from Amazon in December to be prepared for when the snowfall comes this season. My neighbor had one of these and loved the way it worked and how it made the job easier. I had to have it so I actually bought two. Little did I know that while I was Christmas shopping at Target I noticed them hanging there. Color is different but it's the same one. Same manufacturer and same model number. They have it for $20 bucks. I bought mine for $27 and change for each here and noticed they have increased in price since then. Sometimes its better to get out of the house and shop around. You might get luckier than the deals you find from behind that monitor.
B000A1E690 This shovel most definitely makes it easier to shovel snow.  Its bent handle saves you the effort of bending over so much which is a blessing to many like myself I am sure.  I have used it in the aftermath of a couple of storms here in New England and my back felt much better when it was all said and done... That being said, this shovel is not flawless.  It works much better on lighter snow since when its a heavy amount the handle bends too much requiring a little extra effort tossing the load.  Multiply that times many scoops and you will realize that the bending handle comes to bring its own sort of pain.  Not as bad as bending over with a regular shovel, but still as aggravating in its own way.  Also, although this shovel has an ice scraper edge on it, it is not very good at scraping the surface.  The shape of the handle makes it necessary to bend the shovel more awkwardly forward, almost vertically for scraping and its not as easy to accomplish as you would guess, or comfortable.  I keep another straight handle shovel handy just to scrape the last inch or so off any surface...In conclusion, although this shovel is much easier on the back than a cheaper straight barreled one, I would suggest this not be the only shovel in your winter arsenal.  An old fashioned straight edge is still needed for really heavy snow in my opinion, and for scraping ice and sticky parts on the driveway.  Overall however its a well made shovel that may be a little more expensive than you are used too, but worth it for your average snowfall amounts...: )
B000A1E690 I have used this snow shovel once since I purchased  it on Nov. 2013. I have  the old fashion kind for about 10 years so as I grow older mid 50' this shovel has served it purpose well for me.
B000A1E690 We had a couple of inches of snow here in New England and this shovel is a back saver,the shovel actually made removing snow enjoyable!
B000A1E690 I've had two of these shovels so far because I wear them out.  To make them easier to use, I drill the rivets holding the metal blade on so that I can remove the blade all together.  Plastic on concrete or brick is MUCH easier to push, and slide and it doesn't grab, which IMO causes more muscle strain than anything.  Sure, they wear out faster, but I still get 5-6 good seasons out of them.If you have issues pushing it, do as I stated above.  It makes a good shovel great!
B000A1EJT2 This is a nice garden accessory, raising a sprinkler at edging, around flowers, or just in taller grass for better coverage.  It's powder-coated metal with a brass hose fitting, pretty heavy duty but still light enough to me easily moveable, even in annoying, rocky soil--you just step on the crossbar and he two angled spikes push right in.The one thing I didn't realize about it (it's in the description, but not the title) is that while the input is for a standard 3/4-inch male garden hose connection, the fitting for the sprinkler (a threaded hole at the top, cast into the metal) is female and only 1/2-inch, the wrong type and size for anything in my garden. You'll either need a 1/2-inch male connector sprinkler fitting or an adapter to use an average garden sprinkler. (I bought this one: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000JQG338).I wanted this mainly to stand out in tall grass so my sprinkler or hose end wouldn't get mowed or driven over, and it's perfect for that. Raising it up gives it better coverage.I'd give it 5 stars if it included an adapter--or if the title made its limitations clearer. It's a nice product, but incomplete for your average gardener as it is.
B000A1EJT2 I already had some sprinkler stands...which I thought were good, but after I received this Yard Butler sprinkler stand, I realize that they're kind of junky.First, this Yard Butler has the hose nut tightener built in, meaning that when hooking up the hose, you spin the connector, and it screws to connect to the hose.  My other stand makes you spin the entire stand to connect to hose, which I now realize is ridiculous.Also, this stand, as you can see in the picture, has two connections with the dirt you're putting it in...if you have somewhat soft soil and/or incredible water pressure, this is also handy.  (Again, with my other stand, it's a single stake that you press into the dirt, and when turning on the water, the initial burst often makes the entire stand jerk to an undesired angle.)So all in all, this Yard Butler is better than my other stands, is quite high quality, and does a great job.  Would recommend!
B000A1EJT2 I've been using this stand along with a plastic sprinkler in an area of the lawn that my in ground sprinklers don't reach.  I haven't had any issues with leakage and no problem threading the sprinkler.  It's a convenient alternative to putting in a new sprinkler or standing there with the hose.  I only wish I was able to adjust the height, but that's a minor inconvenience.
B000A1EJT2 We have very hard clay soil with rocks, so can't use this everywhere. I like it a lot to water new grass, etc, in bare patches because it keeps the sprinkler cleaner.  I'm not sure why you would want it for an established lawn.  It just seems like an extra step.
B000A1EJT2 As a landscape architect, finding the right devices to use at job sites and client homes to water their garden is always a high priority. I was excited to try this spike sprinkler stand at a couple of new sites we were developing.1) The threads on my stand were also roughly finished and shredded the plastic sprinkler head we tried to screw into it. So, we attempted to use one of our metal ones but the burrs on the inside threads kept catching on the head, so we couldn't get a solid seal to prevent water from shooting out all over the place.Fortunately, one of the guys had a file on hand and was able to remove enough of the burrs so that we could try to use this.2) Ten inches??? Really!??? I'm not sure just what the 10\" is supposed to clear, but once you press the stand into the soil and clear the sod (2.5\"), that leaves barely 7\" of clearance to avoid \"whatever\". Perhaps other owners have a less intensely planted garden area but 7\" just ISN'T ENOUGH clearance to avoid bulbs, perennials or even the common geranium! With the amount of water pressure that shoots out of a sprinkler head, the 7\" height will place the water jet at the EXACT HEIGHT of the blossoms!3) Woulda/Coulda/Shoulda: Where this company 'should' have gone is a telescoping stand, that raises up to at least 2-3 feet and collapses down to the 12\" height. That would make it far more useful in a heavily planted garden.Although this product is inexpensive, I'll stick with what we currently do: prop the hose on the back of any garden chair and have the sprinkler head irrigate the garden that way. :D
B000A1EJT2 Not much to say about this - but it is well built, solid construction.  I like that when it is pushed in the ground that the sprinkler is above ground quite a bit (maybe 6 inch).  Gives the sprinkler a little more coverage capability.
B000A1EJT2 I received this Yard Butler Sprinkler Stand as part of Vine product reviewing. I had read a review of the unit before I ordered it about the threads in the stand being a problem. Yes they are a problem.  As I tried to put in the sprinkler that I had just purchased, I was very careful, I found that the sprinkler would not go in straight and the sprinkler end thread was being ruined. I looked at the threads in the Yard Butler and they were  clearly not tapped properly. If I would have continued it would have ruined my sprinkler head. It was not a question of lining them up, the Yard butler threads were bad.Since I have the tools and knowledge of threading  and tapping pipe, I re-did the Yard butler threads and it accepted the sprinkler and works fine. The problem is that most people who would buy this expect it to work without having to machine the unit to make it right.
B000A7SPR8 If I had my druthers the cover would be a bit more robust but since it only costs $11 I don't have a lot to complain about. It will do the job of protecting my grill and thats what it is supposed to do.
B000A7SPR8 This is a nice cover to protect my Q-220 when transporting it or storing it.  Wraps around tight and also helps keep the lid from bouncing around.
B000A7SPR8 If you have a q you need a cover to protect it and this gets the job done. Very easy to put on and it's held up for a couple of years.
B000A7SPR8 This covers the grill nicely as one would expect as it is made specifically for the grill.  I hope it holds up to wear and tear over time.
B000A7SPR8 I leave my Q220 outside all year with this cover on. It works great! I also use this when camping. A small investment for a great product.
B000AMCAVK I owned an older model of this feeder that lacked the roof, and I was eager to try this version; it seemed like a perfect upgrade.  Unfortunately, I'm very disappointed in it.First of all, one of the welds on the roof where the posts are inserted is crooked.  It was possible to insert the post and use the feeder, but it looks a bit cockeyed.  NOT the quality I expect from the Duncraft name (and price).Next, I discovered how inconvenient it is to fill this feeder, not a small consideration for a feeder that holds so little.  With the roofless version, I could simply turn it over, shake out the hulls, add fresh seed, and shake it until all the seed was under the grid.  That can't be done with this one because of the way the roof is attached.The posts are not fastened to the feeder; the feeder and roof have round holes where the posts just sit.  The roof is only balanced on the posts, not fastened, so if you turn over the feeder, posts go flying.  The washer that holds down the grid is attached to the hanger, which goes through the roof, so the screw and washer can't be removed to lift the grids for filling unless the roof is moved up out of the way.  Bottom line:  The feeder needs to be partially disassembled and reassembled to refill it.  Bare-handed most of the time, as it's a fiddly process to get it all back together.  In the cold and snow.  Every couple days.The quality and filling hassles didn't stop my trying to use it, though.  What ultimately retired this feeder was that \"Squirrel Blocker\" turned out to be merely a naming convention, not a description of the feeder's performance.  The squirrels quickly figured out that launching themselves onto the feeder from a nearby tree would shake the feeder enough to spill seed handily onto the ground.  Soon they observed that this also caused seed to shuffle to one side, piling it high enough to reach into the grid and grab it.  Hot on the heels of that breakthrough was the realization that simply sitting on one edge of the feeder tipped it enough to keep the seed piled up for easy access.This could be avoided by placing the feeder where squirrels can't jump onto it and using a pole baffle so they can't climb up.  If you have such a location, would like to add a platform feeder, and have a setup (e.g., handy picnic table) that makes it easy to work with the feeder when filling it, this feeder might fill the bill for you.  It's attractive and sturdy despite its manufacturing defects, and I think it would last a long time.However, any feeder can be pretty well squirrel-proofed by locating it where squirrels can neither jump nor climb onto it.  If I had such a location, I would surely use it.  Meanwhile, I can only chalk up another victory for the squirrels.
B000AMCAVK One of these days I'll find the perfect feeder.  This one is not it.  Having many type feeders in the yard, I thought I'd add one more platform style to appease cardinals.  Almost two months later and still not one cardinal has used it.  Mind you, I have a yard full of cardinals, but they don't go near that feeder.  Squirrels can and do, although there is a limit as to just how much seed they can extract.  Little birds use it too, but they use every other type feeder in the yard as well, and they weren't the reason I bought another feeder in the first place.  So, both my reasons, to satisfy cardinals and keep out squirrels, failed.  I wish I had never bought this expensive and hard to clean feeder. Update:  I've now had this feeder almost eight months and still no cardinal usage.  As a matter of fact, this feeder is used the least (by any birds) of the seven hanging around the yard.
B000AMCAVK I bought this feeder for the cardinals; they prefer platform feeders to perches. I would have given this feeder a 5-star rating IF the roof were closer to the platform. The roof is so high that pigeons and squirrels can EASILY get in. (Yes, I put a baffle on the pole, but the squirrels still manage to get in the feeder.) The cardinals don't use it very often because of the pigeons and squirrels. Also, it's very awkward getting the roof back on after cleaning (you have to dismantle the feeder in order to clean it.) What I do like is that the squirrels have not tried to chew it yet because the feeder is metal.
B000AMCAVK I've been feeding birds for almost the last twenty years, and I've continued to look for the perfect feeder during that whole time.  This sturdy all-metal feeder is close though not perfect.  Most notably it doesn't actually deter squirrels entirely as advertised, but it DOES discourage them.The feeder is very solidly constructed, very heavy, all-metal, and the hanging loop is just the right size to fit on the hook of my bird-feeding post, with the loop snug enough so local racoons can't pull it off.  The design does not allow for a post-mount.The design works by placing a metal grid over the sunflower seed (about an inch deep).  You pour seed into the feeder, shift the grid around so it's sitting on top of the seed, and voila!  The birds on top of the grid can put their beaks through to get seeds from the bottom of the feeder but squirrels can't quite reach the bottom with their little arms.  Unless you overfill the feeder, in which case the squirrels can reach from the sides of the grid.The problem that makes this feeder not truly squirrel-proof is that if a squirrel sits on one edge, the feeder tilts, the seed slides to that side, and the squirrel can now reach the heaped seed.  My squirrels discovered this technique within just a few days.Even so, the squirrels aren't able to get to ALL of the seed...just much of it.  So it slows down your seed disappearing, and it is extra work for the squirrels, so they don't park on the feeder quite the way they would with an unprotected one.  So squirrel-discouragement rather than squirrel-deterrence.Note you can't put mixed seed in this feeder, it is designed for sunflower ONLY.  Mixed seed quickly clogs the mesh bottom.I give this 5 stars because it's a great feeder for sunflower, but solely as a squirrel-proof feeder, I'd give it only 3.5 stars.  Recommended, but don't expect to defeat the squirrels; at best you'll slow them down.UPDATE FEB 2014: More than 6 years later, this feeder is still going strong despite having been outside near continuously through harsh winters, hot summers, thunderstorms, nor'easters and occasional hurricanes, and having harbored lots of birds, a number of squirrels, and even some racoons. The grate is still solid and intact, the metal shows some weathering but is still in good shape (no damage).I've pressure-washed it a couple of times and had to retighten the nut that holds the whole thing together every 2 years.  That bolt/nut connects the bottom of the feeder to the hook in the top, and slowly works loose over time. When it has worked loose enough, it has come apart under a racoon's weight 2-3x-- but no damage from falling to the ground, and the nut/bolt didn't even strip from that rough treatment. Definitely a good, solid feeder worth its premium price.  Highly recommended, I'd buy another.
B000AMCAVK I occasionally get a bird using it to hop to another feeder but I haven't seen any stop to eat. A cardinal sized bird shy away from it. Squirrels, on the other hand, have no problem at all jumping on to it. I believe it was able to eat from it as well. I'm not sure what to do with it now.
B000AORCSE Great pruner for all types of plants, the rolling action and padded grip do not cause wrist pain. the only con is that the blades seem to dull quickly. Would repurchase-highly recommend for anyone even if you don't have any hand issues.
B000AORCSE We prune spring growth to produce lovely summer foliage as well as use pruners to deadhead summer flowers.  This prunter cuts precisely and the handle is ergonomically friendly for hands that have arthritis.  I noticed the Arthritis Foundation logo on the package when I purchased and that was another plus for me.  I particularly like the lock on the handle that retains the blades in a closed, safe position.  For what I use the pruner for, I wouldn't want any larger size.
B000AORCSE I have about an acre of land and it feels like I am pruning much of the time.  It was a strenuous and disheartening process as my hand always hurt badly afterwards, and the process of pruning was such a slow one, as it was hard to close the shears.Enter the Fiskars power gear soft grip pruner...wow!This little guy makes pruning so easy, with the new mechanism they have put in it.  I can now do my entire garden in a day and I have no pain in my hand!  To me, this is one of the best tools I have ever found as it allows me to be in my garden and do what I love.If you have any hand, back or strength issue, these are for you.  Even if you do not, these are excellent clippers!There are a couple videos in the reviews that really show you what they do.  Do not hesitate if you are looking for a pruner.  Have fun!
B000AORCSE I needed a better pair of pruners. I had a pair that the handles had to open further than my hands could open just to get the blades to open up enough for pruning. These are way better and easier to manage. They are also light weight and have a more comfortable grip. I have to agree with another reviewer in that they don't work the same for left handed people. I thin it has something to do with the bottom handle that twists slightly when you squeeze the handles together.These are super sharp and one thing I like about them is that when your cutting a branch they don't jam up and you get the branch wedged sideways in-between the blades. Fiskars make great scissors and now i can say great pruners too.
B000AORCSE Bypass are being used to cut anything \" green\" within it's cutting capability, and because when you squeeze and cut, the handle you pull up also rotates to reduce figer fatigue, you might lose grip when wearing gloves, so remember to use this line of pruner bare handed, cuts great under normal posture, also with palm down position, not so when palm facing up, so you switching hands to do the job, and that's when you will find out the power gear handle only rotates clockwise, and the design is not useful in your left hand, so left hand user beware.
B000AORCSE It's a bit small for my hand, but it works great and I love the way you just have to curl your fingers to work it.
B000AQNQ4Q If you need to spray under the leaf (which is where most critters hide) the design of this unit is great.  Easy to load and use.  Has a lot of parts so don't lose the parts list.  Hand for that evening walk in the garden also as it is easy to carry and use.  Does not replace the tank sprayer for major tasks but handy for spot treatments etc.  Very handy to have.
B000AQNQ4Q I used this to apply water repellant (303 Products 30674 High Tech Fabric Guard with Water Repellant - 1 Gallon) on our outdoor furniture.  Doesn't clog, goes on very easy with a few pumps.  I like the adjustable spray option and direction.  Very helpful for hard to reach areas.  Great product!
B000AQNQ4Q Have to say i have not used this yet.But taking itout of te boxi wa like wow frigen awesome! Totally is better than describedand pictured.....Cant wait to use it.Ivehad spider mites and the plants need t be sprayed with killig agents yes purchased thru amazon......And to nevr hav bugsagain i plan on spraying them a couiple times to prevent any invading my crop again.......But when i used acnventinal sprayer gt itall over myself gtting undeneath leaves which is a must......Soooooo i love this prouduct and cat wait to use it!
B000AQNQ4Q This is a well made sprayer with a comfortable balanced feel when spraying. Some smaller sprayer are awkward to use, but this makes spraying a breeze. The spray is fine and even, it delivers a nice constant spray. It is possible to lock the spray trigger in an open position, I'm not sure how useful this is given the need to pump the handle every 10 seconds, but some may find it useful.The user pump the handle on the top and once pressure is obtained you press the trigger located above the handle with your thumb; spray time is about 10 seconds between pumping.One reviewer commented on the opening being too small, but I do not find this is the case. It was more than adequate to fill the 1 gallon tank without spilling anything.
B000AQNQ4Q The great reviews swayed me and I got this.  I find this no better than a $5 or $10 sprayer from my local shop.  Coupled with the $15 delivery charge from Amazon on this, $35 is a bit of a joke.  The other thing that bothers me about the sprayer is that the spray is not \"instant\".  I press on the button and it takes a half second to actually come out...also, more annoyingly, when I release the button it takes a good 2 or 3 seconds to stop spraying.  This is seriously a pain when trying to do some precision spraying of fertiliser or medication.  I'm also not too impressed that there is no way to spray off the body of the sprayer.  It wouldn't have taken a lot for the designers to allow the spray nozzle to connect to the first connector on the actual body of the sprayer.  All-in-all, I feel really ripped-off by this.  I only wish I could return it but Amazon will not allow it unless I pay to ship it back, which, at the lowest rate, would be about $30. C'est la vie.
B000ARMH4A Upside-down is the way to go. The house finches are completely baffled by this feeder while the goldfinches happily flop over to get their seed.As another reviewer said, squirrels won't touch thistle, but they do like the seed mixes. This feeder is all plastic, including the perches, unlike more expensive feeders that have metal perches. The squirrels will chew the plastic perches right off. Also, the plastic bottom of the feeder is held in only by a tiny tab and notch, so there's a good chance of its falling out.In short, if this feeder lasts a couple of months that's about all one can expect. If you want a more durable feeder, pay more for a better built model!
B000ARMH4A I have one hanging outside my office window, and all days I get to watch beautiful goldfinches eating upside down.  It is magnificent sight when you get  8 or more on there at a time.What really is fun to watch are many other small birds trying desperately to learn to eat upside down.  It really is a hoot!A great part about this feeder is the bigger birds cannot bully the finches around.On the downside, the unit is made of very cheap plastic.  The bottom, that hold the seeds in, is A kind of a \"V\" shaped (cone) piece of plastic that is not at all sturdy. Some reviewers mentioned adding a rod under the bottom to prevent it rom falling out.  That is a good idea, but I am thinking glue might work also.Another downside is if you live in a very warm climate like I do, is the top might crack from the sun.  That said, this is one of but a few feeders like this, ans since it prevents my goldfinches from being bothered I gave it a high rating.  It lost a point on quality.Luckily, for $10, I am not out a lot of money when it eventually breaks (it will).  So, if you want to enjoy upside down finches, and are willing to recognize the downside of this feeder and can deal with them, (I buy two at a time), enjoy!However, if these things will make you crazy, find another feeder.  There is a cool triple tube finch feeder I bought on here also.  It works very well, but you go through thistle very fast.  Also, it's caps crack after a summer in the sun also, and it is much more expensive.  Have fun!!If my review helped you, please click on \"Helpful\" (or \"yes\") below. Thank you! :)
B000ARMH4A I really like this one because it frustrates all the other birds and drives the squirrels nuts.  My wife hates the squirrels, so she really likes this one.  We finally got several goldies to show, so we are very pleased.
B000ARMH4A I sold these for years. I also keep one in my back yard all the time. Recently I could not get them so I checked out amazon and there these were. These seem to be fairly priced so I went for it. Finch Birds prefer these feeders over any other finch feeders because finch like to eat upside down. Plus other birds don't like this feeder.
B000ARMH4A I was not too pleased when I took it out of the box  because it had gotten bent and dented.  But not enough to send back. I am just concerned about how it will hold up when I do use it . I do not have my finches back for the fall & winter yet so I have not been able to use it .
B000ARMH4A This gold finch feeder is a blast!  These little cuties do hang upside down to feed and I find it very entertaining to watch.  There is an extra benefit to this feeder...the little holes make it just about impossible for the large birds to steal the food.  Oh yea, the feeder is made out of plastic as well as the perches, but I have absolutely no complaints in regards to the quality of the feeder for the money.  Just use common sense for leaving it out under certain weather circumstances...it cannot tolerate below freezing temperatures.
B000ARMH4A This is my 3rd one of these.  I like the way it attracts ONLY Gold finches.  Normal finch feeders attract too many house finches for my taste.  These things last about 3-4 years, then the plastic gets a bit brittle.  Wish they were a tad more durable.  But, it is inexpesive and it WORKS.  Thistle is getting a bit expensive.  I have found that I can make it last longer by sliding the perches over to one side or the other and metering how many birds I get at a time, especially limiting the feeding on the backside facing away from me.  I still get plenty of goldfinch entertainment.  It is kind of like your own private Parakeet aviary.
B000ARMH4A We have plenty of goldfinches visiting our thistle feeder (s), but we also had/have plenty of the house finches visiting too. Sometimes we had nothing but housefinches on the feeder. Mrs. Spudman wanted to look at goldfinches, so she bought this feeder to discourage the hoggish house finches and attract mosty, if not only, goldfinches.This is our second upside down thistle feeder, and we got the same results. The house finches ignored the upside down feeder, but so did the goldfinches. After two or three weeks, Mrs. Spudman finally gave up the effort and put the original thistle feeder back. Within a few days the goldfinches returned.Looking at the photos on this page, it is evident that goldfinches or at least some goldfinches like this style of feeder. We just didn't have good luck with it. I can't say that there is anything wrong with the style or materials of the feeder. Our Perky Pet Feeder model 399 with hibernate for the winter with the other upside down feeder. We'll probably give it another shot in the spring with hopefully better results.
B000B6Q6BA A shovel is a shovel is a shovel, right? Yeah, I thought so too until I ordered and tried this one.Our yard is mostly a thin layer of topsoil over hard clay with some flint gravel mixed in, plus lots of thick, tough roots. Digging is such a chore that over the years I've done very little of it.When I broke the wooden handle on our heirloom shovel, I read the reviews and decided to order this one. At least, I thought, since it's all steel I won't be breaking another handle.It arrived and I immediately grumbled about the weight. This is a heavy shovel.  I wondered how am I supposed to do anything with this? It'll tire me out before I even get started.But then I tried it. I set the point in some hard ground, put my foot on the step and pushed, and \"shhck,\" the blade plunged down into the earth.I was mildly stunned, and delighted. I had never had that experience with a shovel before. The heavy weight of the shovel was actually working for me, not against me.As I said in the heading, I love tools that work, and this one worked. Over the last few months I've done more digging and have moved more plants and shrubs than I have in, well, as long as I can remember. Digging holes is such a pleasure now--if you can believe that--that I forget about the weight. And even with the extra weight, after digging a hole I'm actually less tired than I would be if I were hacking with the old, lighter shovel. It goes that much easier.The shovel's steel handle has already proved its worth in the number of roots and large rocks I've pried out of the ground. Another reviewer remarked that the egg-shaped profile of the handle increases its strength, and I can believe it. I've put an enormous amount of stress on it and it hasn't bent even slightly.Because of its weight, this shovel isn't for everyone. But if you can manage a regular shovel okay, and don't think you'd have a problem with a shovel that weighed a few extra pounds, then this is the one to try.Incidentally, there are a few hard clay spots in the yard that even this shovel can't cut. For those spots I use a clay pick (similar to theCOLLINS CLAY PICK 6 lb.) to break up the soil before shoveling.But the bottom line is this is a great product, and I'm giving this shovel a five star rating.Enthusiastic over a shovel. Who'da thunk?
B000B6Q6BA this thing is one piece of steel, wide stomps with diamond pattern for boot grip when you dig in. It's a little heavy, but if you want something that will dig in hard dirt, this is it. Consider it a back-hoe for your feet.
B000B6Q6BA This is a good Tool, I use it on a job and it worked just great.  The steel handle is much better that wood.
B000B6Q6BA The steel handle is welded to the blade.  It is oval shaped with the long axis is the direction of greatest force to allow a comfortable grip at the same time that you can pry it hard without damage.  The handle, instead of just being attached at the top of the blade, is welded both to the top and to the middle of the blade, distributing the force evenly.  The metal handle makes it heavier than an ordinary shovel but my wife says that the extra weight helps it penetrate the soil better so she likes it.  The top of the blade is wide so it is easy to stand on it to force it into the soil.  It is made in China.
B000B6Q6BA This shovel is incredible!  I recently broke my shovel digging up a shrub for relocation - the metal neck of the shovel snapped in half.  I started shopping for a new shovel and found this Fiskars beast of a tool.  I never dreamed anyone ever manufactured such a heavy duty shovel.  So far I love it.  It's great at cutting through roots or dense heavy soil.  This thing is steel from tip to tip.  Beautiful black protective finish on the steel.  Handle is not round but &#34;teardrop&#34; shape for a comfortable grip.  The wide platform step for your foot is great.  Nice thick 14 gauge steel blade begs for hard use.  Warning:  this thing is heavy and not for the faint of heart and probably not the right tool for the elderly or less vigorous user (I'm 61 myself).  I don't mind the weight of it, in fact the weight  facilitates the efficiency of the tool and helps drive the shovel into the ground and helps with prying and leverage.  It appears pricey for a home use shovel, but when you look at it, hold it, and use it, it becomes obvious that it is a great value.  Built to last.  Hooray for Fiskars!
B000B6Q6BA This is one well built product that I gladly added to my Fiskars collection. I don't do a whole lot of digging but when I do it is mostly sand and soil. The wide foot rest makes digging a lesser chore than my previous shovels with the thin foot rests that were not as comfortable. Any projects that I take on which require a shovel are handled ably by this sturdy tool. The shovel is a winner and the price is right.
B000B6Q6BA This entire Fiskars binge began with a hoe [incredible product] and then a rake [excllent] and eventually have replaced nearly entire outdoor garden tool set with Fiskars.My husband said we didn't need another shovel but I was so happy with the other garden tools that I bought this for myself...I've not been able to use it once because he immediately adopted it. According to him it 'digs itself\". I'm not exactly sure what that means but he brags about the weight and balance - says it makes it so much easier. The same applies for the square shovel. Super nice weight, well balanced, Comfortable.While it might initially seem counter-intuitive to buy a heavy shovel...it actually is much easier to work with than a light weight shovel. The weight allows maximum efficiency so you don't need to strain and struggle to break the earth - it does the work for you. He has a tendency to have lower back pain when working (age related) and within an hour this became his new favorite shovel....he quickly insisted on buying the square head equivalent (every bit as good).The other major difference is the long handle. It seems more and more tools are trying to scrimp by on less material - this is a very solid, very heavy item with an extra nice long handle that is perfect for those who are a bit on the tall side. It also has the rolled edge to keep the foot from slipping...lots of nice little extra's that set this apart from the rest.Very pleased with the Fiskars line of garden tools - either buy two or  don't let your husband borrow it...you won't get it back
B000B6Q6BA The image seems to show a black rubberized grip further down on the handle, mine doesn't have that.  It is however very very strong, as an example we used it to lever up a rather large cement fountain base full of water so we could level it out, and the shovel was a champ(maybe not smart but it was the only tool for the job).  I will say that this shovel is heavy, heavier than the standard wood handled ones.  For light gardening I will still need to order one not quite so serious.
B000B6Q6BA I am impressed with this shovel.  I just dug a couple large tree planting holes in our backyard with it and it worked great.  I like the all steel handle - don't have to worry about breaking like a wood one.  The step edges on the top of the shovel are large and really let you sink your weight onto it.  The shovel blade is large and sharp (I know since I just nicked a service cable in our backyard and severed it before I knew what had happened).  Being all steel, it is a bit on the heavy side but I'd prefer to have a bit more weight and an indestructible shovel than a cheap lightweight one that is going to break in a year or two.
B000B6Q6BA This is a great product and very solid, holds up to hours of work and stays nice and sharp. and has a easy design to hold on too. All steel and lifetime warranty.
B000B6Q6BA I bought this shovel to work rough building mountain bike trails and work around the house. I get tired of breaking shovels so far this one is shining bright.
B000B6Q6BA 1- it is slightly heavier than most shovels.  it has an stainless handle which is resilient, and slightly heavier than most.2- the \"step\", which is a horizontal plane about an inch wide, makes it very comfortable to step on even when wearing flimsy sneakers instead of work boots.  This comes in handy for the quick task when you're not really \"gearing up\" for a full day's worth of yard work.3- it is sharp, and remains sharp.  I've been using mine for a year, and it hasn't dulled.  We have very rocky and very clay ground and this drives right through the toughest of ground4- the all stainless construction makes it tough and resilient to bending when I pry big rocks out of the ground.  no worries about snapping a handle like with wood ones.
B000B6Q6BA Have used this shovel on several projects and it's held up pretty well.  Lightweight but sturdy and can handle lots of weight and digging.  Very well made from a great company - Fiskars does not disappoint!
B000B6Q6BA Okay - how can someone rave about a shovel?I dont know but all I can say is that this is a BEAUTIFUL design and a BEAUTIFUL shovel. Good weight, shape and feel.WORRY FREE BUY - just get it.
B000B6Q6BA Was so excited to get this as I have a lot of volunteer oaks to dig up and a pine I want to move so when it arrived today I pounced on the box and went to town on the pine. My well pump has a problem so I wasn't able to soften up the very hard and dry ground but was still able to dig down pretty deep in stages and the ledge is awesome. My weight wasn't much help with the very dry dirt but it helped a bit and was pretty easy to find my balance on the ledge. The shovel has a great weight, it is a little heavy but imo that's a good thing. I'm not that strong and was able to handle this shovel very easily and although it is long it is also pretty easy to maneuver. Seems built to last, a huge upgrade to the standard.
B000B6Q6BA As with the transplanting spade that I just reviewed, this shovel is excellent. It's built so strong, I can't imagine it wearing out or damaging it in any way.If I have any complaint, it's that the shovel is heavy. That heft makes it possible to use it for leveraging anything out of the ground without worry of damage, but it also means that simple tasks like moving gravel or digging plants in soft soil will be more strenuous than it would be with a lighter shovel that would be just as good at such light tasks.That's a minor issue with an excellent hand tool. After my good experience, I bought one for my dad as a gift, which is high praise in my book.
B000B6Q6BA I think I said it in my title, but I don't believe you will be disappointed in the shovel. Just realize if you don't really dig, you don't really need to pay for a shovel this nice. I picked this one up for $29 and couldn't be happier.
B000B6Q6BA My yard is full of hard clay and lots of rocks.  For simple gardening, I can usually get by with a wood- or fiberglass-handle shovel.  But if I need to dig down a ways, or pry out a rotted fence pole, or dig out one of the many stumps we have in the mulched area, ordinary shovels break.  I went through 2 or 3 a year, even trying to go easy on them.  Then I saw this all-steel shovel, for the same price as the others, and tried it.  Here's what I found after a couple good work-outs:- It's not unbreakable, but it will take a lot of hard use.  I tried to lever out a medium-sized stump, and could feel the handle start to give as I put my full weight (250 lbs) on it.  So it won't replace a 6' steel bar for the big jobs.  But it easily dug out many rocks, and a couple of smaller stumps, without a problem.- It's heavy.  No, really, it's heavy!  Spend a couple of hours digging with this puppy, and your shoulders will ache like never before.  You'll get a lot more done than you could have with other shovels, but you sure are going to feel it.Bottom line:  If you have an ordinary shovel now, and have never broken it, you probably don't need this one.  And if you are only going to buy one shovel, don't get this.  But if you already have a regular shovel for the day-to-day chores, and need a \"nuclear option\" for the really ugly jobs, do yourself a favour and buy one of these, before you break any more handles.  Very highly recommended.
B000B6Q6BA I'm new to the shovel game, but having been through a couple cheap ones thus far I can tell you that this shovel don't play. Sold steel makes it heavy but VERY strong, I stuck it under some roots and was able to sit on the other end of the shovel (160lbs) and it didn't bend or show any signs of weakness.
B000B9SFP2 Although I think this pen is great...I didn't receive the entire roll of polytape..even after calling customer service...and I think the height of the posts is misleading..hence the 3 stars.  If I wanted to buy a new energizer and more polytape then it would be great to own, as my review below states:Easy one-page instructions and everything fits nicely back inside the bag, without struggling...I needed this portable paddock for my goats because I have a lot of unfenced acreage beyond the barn area.  I was worried about the fence being suitable for goats so I called Customer Service...The rep went to a lot of trouble and checked this for me and said it would work fine for goats as well.  However, several days later, I called back and spoke to another rep and he said that goats needed much higher voltage.  This particular energizer is 3,000 volts and that goats needed 5,000 to 8,000 volts. But he said I could just buy another pulse type energizer and it would work with the tape that I have.  I have older, very mellow goats so the 3,000 volts are working so far.I have different breeds and therefore different heights of goats and one concern was that the clips on the post wouldn't be low enough to the ground for my mixed breed goats but on the post, it has clips all the way down so that the tape can be hung at various heights.  However, even though the post is listed as 4ft high, I measured and they are actually 47 1/8  inches tall and after you push the metal tip into the ground, you are left with a height of 38 inches.  The tape rests at the bottom of the top clip which holds the tape at 35 inches off the ground.  Seems awfully short for horses but I don't know anything about horses either.The instructions are clear and has helpful diagrams, making it all very easy to put together.  I did have problems at the end tying it to the last post.  I had to call Customer Service, and the rep said that you CANNOT unroll the whole spool of polytape if you are hanging it to the last post via the spool, which is per the instructions.  Since I had already unrolled it to the end, I had to tie the end of the polytape to the post or to the empty spool container, which he said was okay, but then it's not easy to untie that knot.In lieu of posts, you can hang the guy wire around trees and then slide the electric tape through the loop.  Guy wires, which are similar to tent stakes give the posts extra stability, but I saw no need for them at all since the clay soil held the posts very well.My ground is hard clay but the fence posts sunk in easily, despite that.  It had rained within the last week though so it may be different depending on the dryness of the soil.  The posts are sturdy, and strong enough to not break with normal use.  I did have gravel in some spots which made me have to relocate a few posts, since the tips would not go past them.There is no mention of the tape being allowed to touch weeds and grass, so I called Customer Service back to find that out. He said that that only a low impedance energizer can be used near grass and this energizer is NOT low impedance.  So, I had to mow where I wanted to put the fence to avoid any problems with grounding.  Not very practical when out on the road.Planning the fence was harder than I imagined because I couldn't make a perfect square and I thought I had measured correctly but still fell short of where I wanted the fence to end.  I then discovered that I was only given 126 feet of polytape rather than the 200 feet.  Doing a trial run of setting the fence up is recommended.I wanted something that was easy.  I'm a small middle-aged female and needed something that wasn't too much trouble so I could move it around without a lot of sweat and tears.  This is perfect for my goat situation if they had just sent me the correct length tape.  It seems too short for horses but I posted the measurements in case it helped someone who has horses.
B000B9SFP2 I haven't owned a portable fence for horses until now, but I am impressed and liking this product very much. Upon opening the package I was happy with the portability of the carrying bag, and shocked at how lightweight and compact this system is. It's a great accessory to throw in the trailer when taking the horses out, or just to have around in the event that we need a temporary corral for a couple horses. Once set up, it won't hold more than two of our horses comfortably. I don't think we'd ever try and manage to get 4 inside like the product advertises!The instructions were surprisingly simple and it set up easily between myself and my husband working on it. I can see how this would be great to have for other animals as well (such as alpacas), but we only have need for it with the horses and have had success in containing them.  The step in posts are fantastically designed, 
B000B9SFP2 I am always impressed when someone tries to solve an old problem in a new way. And I have never been happy hobbling my horse - I'd rather she could escape from a dangerous situation, and something unpredictable is far more likely to happen on the trail than at home. Sooo - here we have this device that is compact and weighs only 15 pounds, thus is easy to pack for trail rides. And since it operates on easily-obtainable D cells, no problem being \"off the grid\".The Fi-Shock HC-100 Portable Paddock showed up in a nice durable red Cordura nylon case. The long part contains eight molded, reinforced plastic stakes with foot push tabs to make it easy to get the metal spikes at the bottom, into the ground. Their working height seems to be just about 3 feet. Multiple slots allow a variety of configurations in set-up.A smaller bag attaches to the pole bag with snaps. It contains 100' of conductive tape on a reel (no, I don't know why the product description says 200'), the transformer of nicely molded, durable-looking green plastic, a transformer stand to be tamped into the ground, a shoulder strap, and two D cell batteries which I promptly put in a safer place so they couldn't accidentally contact conductive material and discharge.This proved easy enough to set up in an area that is clear of tall brush that could cause trouble when contacting the live tape. Properly set up, the paddock's batteries did not drain. Of course I carried extras. I also chose to guy the corners which I am used to with tents. Of course I had to bring extra rope and tent stakes for that purpose. No problem.This worked... for ONE not-huge horse who is trained to electric fences, so she doesn't challenge them. Sure, any beast of her size could easily break out, but I'd want her to if in danger. No, I can't see how the stated 4 or 5 horses could be contained in this enclosure. But this a viable solution on the trail, for my mare.
B000B9SFP2 It may be an odd way to start a review, but since it's the first impression (and it was a good one), I'll say that the carrying case on this unit is brilliant.  The shoulder strap, well-placed handle, and easy functioning zipper are all sturdy make transporting this portable paddock a snap.  Total weight is amazingly less than your standard camping tent.Set-up is also remarkably easy, even to the unitiated.  First timers might want to budget 30-45 minutes but after a time or two you should be able to secure the structure within 10-15 minutes (depending on your terrain).The fact that this operates on 2 \"D\" cell batteries is remarkable, making this kit truly portable.  The product description states it will operate for 30 days on those 2 \"D\"s (amazing!).  I have not tested mine for nearly that long, but bringing a spare pair of batteries wouldn't be a hardship, I'm sure.I'd have some concerns about the integrity of this kit if you're trying to pen a \"spirited\" animal.  Make no mistake: this is no fence.  A more docile horse (or other animal) with electric fence training/experience will be safe and secure with this well-designed gear.
B000B9SFP2 This product is both effective and convenient. We were able to assemble it and have it working within 30 minutes. It worked great as a \"maternity ward\" for our alpaca millay and her new cria. We were able to give them some private time while not feeling as though they were separated from the herd. I highly recommend this product and will have many uses for it in the future! Please view our pictures we have provided in the customer photo section!!
B000BANMUY Finally had an occasion to bring out my Loppers after some heavy wind knocked down a big limb. I am a 66 year old female and admit I was a little afraid but using the Loppers was as easy as advertised. What really impressed me was how little noise was produced. I was expecting the usual loud chainsaw racket. If I needed to use them for an extending period of time I would need a rest because of the weight, but for ten or fifteen minutes my arms held up  just fine and the limb was cut in short order. Trimmed a dead limb on a holly tree while I was at it. This is a great addition to my yard equipment arsenal.
B000BANMUY I have been using this for over a year and it has cut through all my branches and small shrubs without any issues. It makes very quick work of anything.  Anyone can use it, my wife cut many branches and I pulled on them.  Not always a clean cut when stressing the branch by pulling down, but 95% of the time I have clean cuts.One issue is just the cord like all plug-in electric tools, just put it over your shoulder to keep it away from being cut.Don't forget chain oil, don't let it get dried out.I let my father borrow mine and was lucky to get it back so I had to buy him one.  He took an all day job removing dead lilac bushes and turned it into an hour job cutting it down with this.
B000BANMUY Used it to cut up downed trees for firewood. I had read the overwelmingly positive reviews before ordering but was still wondering if it would perform well when cutting anything over the size of a small branch. I used it on branches and tree tops up up to 5-7 inches in diameter and it went through them wonderfully. On some of the bigger logs, the length of the blade became a limitation, in that it wouldn't cut all the way through the log, but it still went through those without a problem and left just a little bit for me to hand saw through. Adjusting the chain was easy after it beegan loosening up (as it should according to the manual during break-in), and oiling it was easy as well. With the blade guards I was never worried about kick back, although after a hundred or so cuts through various woods nothing ever even slowed it down. It was also light weight and easy to handle.Edit: Oct 2009. Still use these. Other then adding oil and checking the chain they have held up well. Cut out a tree this spring and these make the job so easy and simple. I have an electric chain saw, but I reach for this over that one everytime.
B000BANMUY I returned this product before I used it.  I have chain saws but thought this would be an easy grab-and-go item for smaller jobs.  But the thing requires oil every ten minutes of use.....and it takes a little doing to uncover the oil hole and do the job.It just seemed like an expensive toy that would be more trouble than cranking up the chain saw.
B000BANMUY OK, I am a sucker for gadgets and this one intrigued me.  I had read about it in a gardening publication.  The alligator lopper by Black and Decker is much, much better than I ever imagined.  It cuts through a 3 inch branch like a hot knife through butter.  Wow, this thing is great!  I would say the only potential downside it the instructions recommend oiling it very frequently and I nearly threw the tiny white oil bottle that it comes with.  The oil bottle is inserted in the cardboard packaging and I didn't see it when I took the lopper out of the packaging.  If you want to make cutting stuff up fast and, yes, even fun buy this thing!  I am so pleased!!
B000BANMUY I've had this a couple of years now and it works great for my needs.  I used it again this weekend to clean up from a big snowstorm we had a couple of weeks ago.  It chewed up branches up to 5\" thick easily. Ironically, it's the little twig pieces that occasionally will cause the chain to dismount.  This has only happened to me twice and was easily fixed with a 1/2\" socket wrench and a little common sense.  I have a full size B&D chainsaw I no longer use because this is so much easier and frankly less intimidating.  If you're a logger or frequently cutting firewood maybe you more, otherwise it's really handy to have around.  I can't recall the last time I added a=oil by the way, of course that's probably not something you want to emulate.
B000BANMUY Loved it! Easy to use and a whole lot safer! Sometimes you just need a smaller saw but this one is no push over , it cut through everything I threw at it and was hungry for more. Good buy for sure.
B000BANMUY Men love gadgets, and merchants continue to come up with fancy but useless gadgets to sell them. This, however, is an exception that is a truly useful innovation.Technically, the Alligator Lopper is a mini-chain-saw with metal guards on both sides, one of which doubles as a clamping jaw. Functionally, it acts as a super-sized and super-powered lopper. It can easily cut through branches up to 5-6\" in diameter in one pass.A recent storm brought down a sizable dead branch from one of the oak trees in my yard. This Alligator Lopper took care of it easily. I actually spent more time with the extension power cable than the actual cutting. Without it, I would have had to get a chain saw, which would be a lot more difficult and dangerous.
B000BANMUY I bought the Alligator Lopper because I need to cut larger branches than my pruner could handle, but I was afraid of the regular chain saws.There were several concerns I had when I ordered the Alligator Lopper.  First, the weight.  I am a woman with weaker than average arms and I was afraid I'd have trouble handling this lopper.  No problem there.  It turns out to be much lighter than I expected.Second, the mechanics.  I wasn't sure if a lot of tinkering would be necessary.  Basically, all I need to do before operating it is tighten the chain with the included wrench (loosen some bolts, it tightens automatically, tighten the bolts) and then add some bar and chain oil (not included).My last concern was whether the cutting action would be too powerful for my arms to handle.  Well, so far, so good.  I can do it!  I cut a bin full of branches this morning and am just waiting for it to be emptied so I can cut some more.  My forearms and hands are a little tired from working muscles I have not worked much before.  Other than that, it was quite easy.I like the safety features.  The chain is covered and I need both hands on separate triggers to turn on the lopper.  An accident from dropping the lopper onto a body part would seem less likely to happen than with a standard chain saw.This was a good investment for me.  My trees are going to look a lot nicer when I'm done with them.
B000BANMUY This was one of the best yard products I have ever purchased.  It is good quality -- I personally like Black & Decker -- not too heavy, easy to use and boy does it cut!  My neighbors have asked to borrow this after seeing me use it.  Great investment for small overgrown yard usage.
B000BANMUY Excellent electric chain saw.  This thing mows through just about everything.  Very safe design. Still going strong after tons of use.
B000BANMUY Another update:  July 6.  Well my almost 2 month old lopper continues to get heavy use.  Very different from a chainsaw.  Cuts smaller stumps right to ground level-read my full review.  My neighbor, who never takes care of his property, has a poorly maintained pine.  I recently had a tree trimmer slice the branches on my side.  Now the best part.  I used a pressure washer to expose the large roots on my side.  I then used the lopper to cut out 6 inch sections from all those roots.  The main artery on my side-gone. You can do this becuse the non-cutting side of the lopper allows you to get under the root, and the chain side then slices it apart.  Not a possible task with any other tool.  My axe bounced off the large roots.  I cleaned and oiled the chain well after doing this task.  Love my lopper.  Original review below.The kit is a much better value.  Get it instead while it's available. I posted this review on the kit page. Just type lopper kit, on the Amazon search page.What's in the kit?, May 16, 2008By  P. Stein \"Bengals Fan\" (Beavercreek, OH) - See all my reviewsI just received my lopper today. I was very surprised and pleased with the kit. It contains: Black and Decker workgloves, safety glasses, a long outdoor extension cord, and a very high quality bag. I was expecting a cheap cloth bag. This looks like a high quality canvas or nylon denier bag with the Black and Decker name. Bag is worth $20-25. 50 ft 16 Gauge extension-$8, glasses and gloves - $5.00. Why would anyone buy the Lopper itself, instead of the kit? Go to the Lopper kit-sold on Amazon. Must be an item specially made for Amazon. Doesn't exist elsewhere. Kit is not well described in description. One extra point on the bag. It is so useful for organizing tools and keeping them clean, I wanted to buy more and googled it. Apparently it's not available separately. It is on EBAY, but bags are smaller and shipping is high. Makes this kit an especially good value.I have quite a few low growing shrubs I needed to remove. They are very mature and thick. The woody thick stems are too low and bunched for a chain saw, and my hand lopper wore me out. This is a perfect tool for this use. As others have commented, lube system is stupid. It is gravity fed, so you need to hold the jaws toward the ground and slowly add oil. I did that, but also generously hand (paper towel) oiled the chain and bar before each use, as you do for manual oiled chainsaws. Buy a quart of chainsaw bar oil. Lopper works great for intended purpose. Doesn't replace a hedge cutter. Works best for thicker (1/2 - 4 inch wood).  I just used it to remove 6 large mature shrubs.  They were 6 inches thick at the base, and I cut them going around in a circle.  Worked great. The very thin woody stems kept catching in the Lopper, but I could keep cutting, and removed them after the cutting. Use a Hedge trimmer on the thin stems, before you get to the lopper sized stems. You really need separate tools for each task. I have this lopper, a hedge trimmer, an electric chain saw, a gas chain saw, and a Fiskar pruner. Stay away from tools that claim to do it all. My preferred order of use is: 1. Hedge trimmer when possible-for speed and safety. 2. Lopper (for safety). 3. Electric chainsaw (for safety. 4. Gas chain saw (when all else fails).This is one of the most useful items I have ever purchased. I have been using it constantly since receiving it. I love the way you can cut small stumps right at ground level.  Just go around in a circle. I gave up on the oiler.  I heavily coat the chain with a paper towel soaked in bar oil. Stupid oiling system.  Otherwise-love it.
B000BANMUY I purchased this for use in my basement, cutting wood for the fireplace. I liked the lower jaw idea to avoid digging the chainsaw into the floor.  Unfortunately, the design is extremely poor.  The upper \"jaw\" kickback cover actually hits the chain when closed.One of the illustrations in the manual shows this upper jaw open perpendicular - when opened this far, the rear of the jaw actually impacts the chain. The chain cuts a large oval from the rear of the cover.  When the jaw closes, it often does so at an off angle, actually hitting the chain, chewing up the upper jaw and dulling the chain.  The lower jaw also closes crooked about 50% of the time, causing the chain to cut into the lower jaw!A photo on the box shows a person obviously cutting above shoulder height - yet one of the first warnings in the manual is to never cut above shoulder height!  This is common sense, but who approves the marketing and packaging?!?The upper jaw has no \"stop\" except a small plastic flap. This broke off the third time I used the saw.If you run the saw with no wood in the \"jaws,\" the jaws snap open and closed as the chain randomly impacts them!  NOT SAFE!When it cuts, it jams easily. Pieces of \"thready\" wood that a normal saw would kick out, get jammed up in the small gear that drives the chain. This has happened several times.  Cutting dry wood - no problem.  Cutting green wood, the \"thready\" pieces are a constant problem, necessitating the removal of the chain cover.The automatic oiler seldom works.  I have to manually oil the chain.  I have tried calling B&D;'s toll free customer support number. I can never get a hold of anyone.  I am regretful I purchased this shoddily designed item.  I will add some photos showing the problems.
B000BANMUY Item arrived promptly from Amazon. All items in the box. Followed instructions.  Cut 3 branches and the chain fell off. Installing the chain in a 5 hand job.  Got the chain back on, and cut 2 more branches before the chain fell off.  Took the whole thing to a local hardware store, where the staff uninstalled and reinstalled the chain.  They said the original chain was beyond dull. Spent $17.95 for a replacement chain. Went home and had the same problems.  Tried the new chain, and again was able to cut two branches before the chain fell off.  Sending this back to Amazon.  I don't know if I got a completely defective device or what, but a saw that doesn't cut is worthlessUpdate:After a visit to the local Black & Decker store (10 miles away and gas isn't cheap)it turns out the chain has two sides.  No where in the instructions does it say the chain has 2 sides or explain how to look at the chain and see which side goes in and which side goes out. Since the folks at the local hardware store didn't realize this was the problem, I don't feel so stupid. It turns out my replacement chain was packaged backwards, and the packaging didn't mention the 2 side issue either. For the 99% of the US population that doesn't use a chain saw on a daily basis, clear instructions on chains would be helpful.Update Two:Chain still won't stay on. I'm on chain 3. When it works, it works great. I get about 3 cuts, and the chain comes lose. My next door neighbor has tried it out (he has chainsaw experience) and it did the same thing to him. He says my unit is defective. I took the unit back to the local Black and Decker service center, and the nice kid at the front desk had never seen one. Boy, that leaves a customer with confidence. I'm going back to the service center with chunks of tree limbs and let a service tech try making more than 3 cuts.  It's always more helpful with something fails for the repair tech.Update Three--One year later:Now have owned for 1 year.  I had a gardener who was a logger in a different life use this product.  At first, he had the same problems as I did. After much tweaking and bolt adjustment, it worked fine.  He loved it.  I think there is a very fine line from great to terrible on this product, and if there is the slightest manufacturing irregularity, this tool requires someone with a lot of chainsaw experience to make it work properly. If someone gets a unit that just doesn't work as advertised, I'd strongly advise they have someone who works with chainsaws on a regular basis look at the unit before it is returned.I have still downgraded to 4 stars because I had to have someone else make this work.
B000BANMUY Great idea, great product.  Does what it's supposed to do without problems.  Highly recommended.
B000BANMUY I have a relative who owns this tool and it is great, so I picked one up. It cuts through everything it is advertised for and makes yard pruning a lot easier and manageable than if it was done manual with shears or by hand. Some of the negative reviews are correct in saying that the chain does fall off occasionally, but not enough to the point where I will bash the items design (once very 100 uses or so, didn't really keep count). Some of the wood chips do get stuck in the crevices of the mouth, but hey every tool needs its maintenance. As far as the bad reviews about the oil being a mess and nuisance, a little goes a long way.For me the PROS definitely weigh out the CONS in this product. If you are on the fence about getting this or a small chainsaw I would say go with the chainsaw because you will not like this product. Me, I have both so I use which ever the job at hand requires.
B000BNKWZY These  products work 100% and easy to adjust your balance up or down if needed, comes with basic PH tester but best to buy meter. Great product !!!
B000BNKWZY Nothing fancy but it does everything I need it to with little mess or fuss.I'll be using it as a staple in my plant care.
B000BNKWZY I have a hydroponics setup, and I needed something to control my PH level for my tomatoes and peppers. I decided to try this since GH seems to be the best in stuff.It worked well, took 4oz of PH down to get it from 8 to 6 in 55 gallons (I have hard well water). Just do not get it on your hand, I got a drop on my hand and it burned, there is now a red mark and it bled a little. Next time I will wear gloves.It may take a few times for your PH level to stable out when you change water, add stuff, etc, so check it every few hours until it's stable.
B000BNKWZY I use this in combination with the General Hydroponics Flora Series and I love them all. My water is highly chlorinated and pH very alkaline (7.8) The buffers in the Flora Series nutrients will drop the pH to around a 6.5 on their own. It takes about 4ml to bring 5gal of my water from 6.5 to 6.0If you've seen the larger GH bottles these will shock you at first. They are smaller than the picture lead me to believe but like the title says, it doesn't take much.
B000BNKWZY this product lasts forever! it is great for hydroponic systems as well as treating regular water. one drop treats a large amount of water!
B000BNKWZY For Hydro systems as well as straight nutrient solutions with low,or high PH can be easily adjusted with this General Hydroponics Ph Kit.to get it truly right you'll have to test several times with solution your planning on using,yet once your amount is adjusted it is a breeze to use and work SOOO well.Thank you General Hydroponics and Amazon.Excellent price for an even better product.
B000BNKWZY A friend recommended I get this as I was having water problems. This helped me until I got the sand filter for my water;)
B000BNKWZY I used this on a plant that very much required that the Ph be balanced, and it worked out very well.  I would definitely recommend this product.  I don't see myself having to use any other Ph Control Kit besides GH's.
B000BOC300 This looks real cute hanging outside. I have seen birds eating from it.Both the seed and suet.The hanging rope could be longer, better. So far it is holding the feeder up.
B000BOC300 The birds love it and it will really last. Holds a great amount of food. It's close to spring and we have hundreds of different birds eating from our amazon purchased feeders
B000BOC300 My only complaint is that it is sometimes hard to get the top off and to stay open while trying to refill the feeder. We also had some animal bend and break off one of our suet holders. Since they are only attached at the top it was easy for the animal (we suspect a racoon) to bend the suet holder up and run off with the suet cake. Eventually the holder snapped off. Minimal complaint thou
B000BOC300 This is one of the best feeders I've got.  It's made well, holds a lot of seed and has 2 places for suet.  The birds really like this feeder.
B000BOC300 This is a pretty basic cedar bird feeder. So far it's lasted 6 months and hasn't broke, although I haven't had any issues with larger animals trying to get at it. Holds a fair amount of feed (enough to last weeks), and it looks better then a lot of the cheaper or overly unnatural looking feeders that are common. My only real complaint is the short/cheap rope it came with. Replaced that with a longer/more durable nylon rope I had and it's held up great!
B000BOC300 I got an s-hook to put on the branch, and this slides right on the end of that for perfect height, so I can watch them from the living room.  The suet cakes slide in easily, and the top slides up the rope for easy filling.  I added red pepper flakes to keep squirrels away, and so far that has done the trick :)  I'm pleased.
B000BOC300 This feeder works well for the birds as you can attract all typed by putting the sweet cakes and the seed into it.  The downside is squirrels will have access to this unless you hang it on a pole and put a round shield underneath to keep them out but if you do this, you should have no issues with squirrels getting in.  The wood fades it color a little as well in the weather, so I would suggest putting some wood protecting stain/sealer to keep it looking nice all year round.
B000BOC300 Birds love this as they are always at this feeder.  Space for lots of birds to get food.  Have made my own suet and birds come.
B000BOC300 This is the best feeder Ive ever used. I have so many different birds and they love the fact they can get seed and suet in one setting. The cedar is an added bonus! :-)
B000BOC300 The birds and I love this feeder. Fairly easy to fill if you use a cup or a scoop. You will need an extra hand if you just want to pour directly from the bag.My dog's behavioural improvement from singing birds is absolutely amazing and the feeling of a nature preserve for me.This is my first bird feeder, so, for people who are wondering....the bird waste hasn't been that big of issue. There seems to be more urine where they eat, but not waste all over the roof or anything like that. Seed scattering happens, but they usually pick that up eventually. The sunflower shells are leftover, but will generally fall down within the grass or if you have it over concrete, you can sweep it up and hose down any bird waste.
B000BOC300 I like the looks of this feeder, I have it hung from a tree limb. I have tried mixed seed for two weeks and sunflower seed for two weeks, all ten other feeders are buzy but this one is unused. I am going to replace it this week. It looks good and is well built
B000BPAVBW This product is a great supplement to the physical weeding you have to do with a weedeater or other device.  What you have to do is to spray the plant on Monday to let the toxin be carried to the root center.  Then, on Wednesday, if you insist on whacking the weed and not just spraying, you can go and tear it down.  It's crucial that the intact plant have 1 or 2 days to take in this product.  If you cut if down and then spray it, you may well be spraying to no effect.  It must be absorbed by a functioning leaf to really take effect.  It does work, but you must take care.  It's impossible to have a spray just for weeds; plants are plants, so if you misfire onto your prized shrub, you'd better spray water promptly to ensure its viability.
B000BPAVBW First off this works as well as anything I have found. Cheaper than my local HD or L and for some reason it works better than out of these stores. Sprayed the area where I needed and the next day they ready to be pulled unlike out of the stores. I could not believe how well it worked with one spraying.
B000BPAVBW I have always used Roundup \"extended control\" but I saw this on sale.  I don't like it.  This does not come close to Roundup's extended control product.  This is just like any other cheap weed killer.
B000BPAVBW I've been using Roundup Ready-to-use Spray for several years to kill weeds growing in sidewalk and driveway cracks and in areas where I have spread mulch (such as around trees and along our fence). Roundup is effective on most weeds and grass and completely kills vegetation within a few days. (It usually takes a week or so maximum to have its effect.) It is important to make sure that you hold the sprayer close to what you intend to kill, for Roundup will kill everything it touches. I'd suggest getting to within a foot or so of what you want to kill, particularly if there is vegetation nearby that you don't want to hurt. While this pre-mixed spray is perfect for spot killing of vegetation, for wider areas use Roundup concentrate with a sprayer that mixes it with the right amount of water.
B000BPAVBW This product does what it claims it would. I had grass growing in the expansion joints in my driveway and it was easy to apply and it did kill the grass.
B000BPAVBW For the past several years I've been using Roundup on the weeds and grass growing in the gravel driveway because there are just too many of them to pull. Recently a garden center manager on a local news segment pointed out that Round Up is one of the safest herbicides to use because it doesn't linger perpetually in the soil.I've since learned that Round Up is the chemical \"glyphosate\" and is widely used because it breaks down in the environment and is one of the least toxic applications to animals.For me Round Up is not the speediest of herbicides, but it does eventually kill unwanted growth. It's even successfully killed some thick and persistent poison ivy patches on Spud Acres.
B000BPAVCG Well, I liked this trap when I opened it. I loved the idea of catching the chipmunk in my basement and then sending him onto freedom far away. I felt a little like Davy Crotchet or something. Unfortunately, I have not been able to trap anything with this trap.It may not be the trap's fault. The chipmunk may have only been visiting or perhaps he made it up to the attic and is busily chewing electrical wires, or whatever they do for fun. I still like the trap, but I would have liked it more if I'd been able to catch something with it.I do know that the deer mice (that I didn't know I also had) were not heavy enough to trip this trap and were eating the bait for a few days before I started trapping them using mouse cubes. The trigger of this trap and setting it just right seems like ti could be tricky.
B000BPAVCG I had a problem with ground squirrels. This trap worked perfect, caught 4 of them in one week. Easy to set and easy to release. Haven't had any issues with rusting in 2 years.
B000BPAVCG Chipmunks are cute, but not when they're digging up your plants and undermining your sidewalks.  We bought the Havahart trap a few weeks ago and after experimenting with the bait, we've been catching around one a day. Pecan butter works best.  Just put some pecans in your food processor, and add a little olive or vegetable oil.  They seem to like it more than peanut butter.  Be sure to drop your chipmunks off far, far away (like 4 or 5 miles) or they'll be back!
B000BPAVCG I have used other box traps for smaller animals and I feel this is the most sensitive, plate trigger I have used.  I will be trapping night rats in the back yark.  Smaller mice, that I have seen from my bedroom window, also feed on the droppings from the bird feeders.  Squirrels may find their way in to my traps and be located to another area of the farm.  I tolerate squirrels and will see that they live somewhere else. This will need to be seasoned a day or two out in the yard to allow the oils and smells to wear off, then, with some success in trapping, I'll report back the results.
B000BPAVCG I have trapped 37 chipmunks over the last 5 years using this trap.  #1, it works!  I use sunflower seeds suitable for a bird feeder.  Not the kind of sunflower seeds you buy at a ballgame.  #2, it lasts!  It is a little beat up.  Some of the bigger chippys are pssd off when they get caught and really rattle the cage, so to speak.  But the trap is still working.  Just caught another one today.  What you do with the little buggers once they're in there is your business.  I know some who then tie a rope around the trap and throw it in a lake for 5 minutes.  Personally, I just take them with me when I am running an errand or taking a kid to soccer practice and release them.  Whatever works for you.If you have Chipmunks in your yard you need a plan to regulate their population or they'll get out of hand and ruin your plantings, tunnel under your sidewalks and driveways, eat your air conditioning wiring, etc.
B000BPAVCG very easy to use and set up and EXTREMELY well constructed. We had two rats running around our garage. Caught both of them, one after another, using peanut butter as bait. This trap will last for years to come if we ever need it again. Great deal, would order it again in a heartbeat.
B000BPAVCG I was surprised as I set this trap to catch a rat and it caught a fairly small mouse. Much to my surprise it wasn't able to get out. I have caught from squirrels down to mice with this trap. I really like it versus the stand snap/kill traps becuase they are dual size. You need a big trap for a rat and that rat trap isn't heavy enough to trigger when a mouse steals the bait. If the rat hits the mouse trap they usually don't even slow down. With this live trap you catch whatever enters to steal the bait.I dispatch the caught animal buy placing the trap under water. After 30-45 seconds the critter is dead and the trap is ready to be reset. While many people might use this trap to prevent killing a pest, I use it simply because it catches multiple size rodents.
B000BPAVCG It works great. I would recommend getting squirrel out ASAP if you plan to turn them loose. Also be sure and drive at least ten miles away. They are like homing pigeons and come back home
B000BPAVCG This little trap is so light and flimsy feeling that I was sure I'd made a mistake in purchasing it.  But so far, I'm pleased. It is very easy to set. The first time I tried to set it, I thought parts were missing. I re-read the instructions and was incredulous by the way the trap door is held open. I thought it could not work. I thought that it would not hold and the door would drop down as the slightest vibration or wind. So far, that has not happened. I've caught at least one critter (squirrels, chipmunks) each day. For irresistible bait, I mix cheap peanut butter with oatmeal, form into a thin pancake, freeze then crumble. I put some crumbs inside at the back of the trap and some in front of and just inside the entrance. Works every time. If you catch squirrels, you need to transport them at least 12 miles from your yard or they will find their way back. This is what I was told by the cooperative extension office.
B000BPAVCG The squirrels were eating my wooden fence. This works. I have thinned out the local squirrel population and moved them to a park across a river.
B000BPAVCG I got this to catch squirrels that were getting into my attic.  Took it out of the box, baited it with peanut butter placed in a bottle cap (to keep the trap clean) and caught a huge rat that night.  The result was no more noise in the attic.  I shot the squirrel later.I know that some people will object to shooting varmints.  Well, to each his own.  But one thing I like about this trap is that you can shoot whatever you capture with a .22 and you don't have to worry about damaging the trap.  A little rinse from the garden hose and all the evidence is gone. The galvanized metal construction means you don't have to worry about rust.  Get a bigger one for cats.  Shoot, shovel, and shut up.
B000BPAVCG I wish the larger traps had this design. I have two of these and over the five years or so I've been retired I might have trapped and relocated 150, maybe more chipmunks, and quite a few red and gray squirrels. I use sunflower seeds right ON the trip plate. Rarely has it failed, and then its probably racoons, who don't fit in trap but they roll it over and get the seeds. No candy, don't need peanut butter or the mess. Just the seeds! Make sure to relocate the little chewers at least two miles away. Gray squirrels have a 50% return rate at ten miles relocation (per Cornell Univ), and reds a little less, but you need to get the reds covered fast, they'll kill themselves pretty quick trying to escape.I even trapped a small skunk last summer (not recommended) but it ended well for both me and the silly stinker.Highly recommended!
B000BPAVCG I have an epidemic of chipmunks in my yard, causing no end of problems.  I had a \"Havahart 1025 Two-Door Cage Trap\" which works great, but wanted a couple more traps to cut down the population.  I've used the two side-by-side, and can tell you, that chipmunks prefer the 1025 by at least 5-1.  They like the 1025 so much, I've left it out overnight without bait, and found a chippie inside in the morning.The 0745 is nice, but if you're trapping chippies, get the 1025 instead.
B000BQ81A4 This product is a great deterrent to keep biting, eating, pesty predators away from my veggie garden and fruit trees. I also have lots of CD discs hung on the fence and a metal cat on the backyard fence.  I use tea bags filled with Cayenne pepper to keep the squirrel away from my persimmon trees and other fruit trees.
B000BQ81A4 Works probably too well.  It kept the birds off my plants but I wasn't sure how to get the tangled bird out of the netting.  Plus his bird buddy kept trying to kill me to protect his friend.  The bird finally worked itself free so it ended OK I think.  Just know you might need a rescue plan if you use this in a high bird flying zone.
B000BQ81A4 First the good news:  I salvaged the rest of my peaches from the birds using this netting.  Then the bad news:  even getting it out of the packaging tends to tangle it.  The stuff kind of sticks together, and you have to be very careful unfolding or folding it up.  It's 14 feet by 14 feet, so for a small dwarf tree (like peach) it will easily cover the whole tree.  If you are not good at untangling things, don't buy this as you will never even get it on the tree (or if you do, maybe never get it off without a good pair of scissors).  It does cut fairly easily, so if you need to, you can cut it up in places (but, of course, that defeats the purpose of the item).  I would suspect, as other reviewers have commented, this would not work for squirrels as they would eat right through the thin netting to get to the fruit, but birds cannot (at least  don't think they can) break or eat through the netting. So, you need to determine what is eating your fruit before you purchase this material.  (Birds, buy it; squirrels, try something else.)
B000BQ81A4 About ten years ago a friend pointed out to me that my Amalanchier Lavis bushes were also known as Serviceberry, and that the berries were both edible and delicious. A few years later the long birds got the message as well, as started eating the berries before they were ripe.I draped this net over the bushes, and even though it didn't completely cover the bushes, it did a very good job of discouraging the typical songbird. They'd try to land, get tangled in the net, and fly away frustrated. After a while, none of the birds even tried. (One robin did get tangled to the point of needing human intervention to cut him loose- so if that troubles you, you want to consider a different approach.)I notice there's a 45 foot version of his net for only twice the price, so if you have a large area to protect, that's the way to go.
B000BQ81A4 This seems to be good netting.  I've seen others who said the birds could still get through.  I see the holes are 1/2 wide so they could but if you overlap it then it is much better and would provide a good barrier.  I like it.Worth a try.
B000BQLWCS After many failures at trying to kill my moles (I'm glad I don't have gophers), I bought this product.  I have to say that I purchased this based on the reviews especially the one review by \"K. Chan\".  Follow his/her instructions and you will have success.It has been 4 days since I 'gassed' their tunnels and I have not seen any evidence of more tunneling. That means I won't twist my ankle again.  (That was painful).  I still have 6 or 8 solar stakes and I plan on moving them from place to place throughout the summer.  I doubt that I will purchase any more of them when they quit working.Besides, even though I'm female, I enjoyed the strategic planning and execution.  I am very pleased with the performance of this product and the success.  I will keep a few of these just in case the moles return.GOPHERS - the tunnel and eat plant roots, sometimes they pull the entire plant underground.MOLES - they tunnel and eat worms and grubs, but not the plants.If I have to use these again I will make sure to have a bucket of loose dirt with me.  As the gas (smoke) moves through the tunnel it can escape through cracks in the surface.  I will put scoops of dirt, lightly, on those openings (instead of stomping on them as I did... which crushed the tunnel).Great product, great price, success rate 100%
B000BQLWCS Who would have ever thought that catching or killing a ground hog would be so much trouble?  My wife insisted that I trap him and take him somewhere else way out in the country.  I purchased a cage and the first night I trapped our pet squirrel who will no longer let us feed him.  The next two nights I trapped the ground hog and he was literally so strong that he bent the metal of the trap door and the wire cage and squeezed out of the trap.  Twice!OK, I purchased a bigger and better trap.  Now the groundhog walks all around it and refuses to eat the gourmet meals I have put into the cage for him.  Not only is he big and strong but he is also smart, wonderful!  Now I feel like Bill Murray in Caddy Shack and the groundhog is winning.  By this time he has eaten all of my wife's flowers, tulip bulbs and potted plants.  Now it is time for war!I can only find one entry hole in the front of our home in the shrubs so I find a large landscaping stone, then I tape two of the smoke bombs onto  a stick and light the fuses and quickly jam them into the hole.  Top it off with the large stone and cover it with some dirt and voila, no groundhog!  Now I am making sure we don't have more of the dirt devils in our yard!I used two of the smoke bombs as the hole was more than 8 inches in diameter and I wanted to make sure that the large volume quickly filled up with smoke.
B000BQLWCS I had a problem with some critter digging a fresh hole in my backyard at least every other day.  I tryed many methods, but this is the only one that worked.  I would suggest finding some type of tube (pvc pipe) and drop the bomb directly down \"deep\" into the hole,  and covering it up quickly.  Then place something flat and heavy on the hole to keep the smoke in.  You will need to dig around the hole and open it up a little to make sure the stick gets in there as deep as possible.  Bomb every morning for at least two-three days to make sure you get um!!  Great product that WORKS and is kind of fun to use.  Fire in the hole!!
B000BQLWCS We have several acres in walnuts on our property and fight an endless battle with the ground squirrels which are very plentiful in our area. Used aggressively and diligently these gassers work pretty well. There are other ones sold which have less than half as much material in them, and those ones don't work worth a darn.The hard part is making sure the squirrel is home when you do the job. The best way is to gas the hole right after you see a squirrel go in it. Follow the directions.
B000BQLWCS I&#699;ll revise this someday after I use it. We don&#699;t have the problem in the winter time that we have in the summer, but neighbors don&#699;t mind the mounds in their yards and lawns so the battle will continue. I will use them soon...
B000BQLWCS I think this may have run the gopher away, temporarily.  It's hard to tell since I have/had so many.  I don't want to run them away, I want to kill them.  The gopher bait I used did the job.
B000BQLWCS You had better follow the directions and REALLY cover the hole you place it in, I thought I had, but it leaked through the ground all around it. Have no idea if it worked or not. Never saw any gas come out of exit holes and I still have moles. Won't use it again. Traps work better.
B000BQLWCS I purchased these and then decided to run to Home Depot and see if they had them so I could use them sooner until my package arrived from Amazon. Home Depot had another brand called Revenge. I used the 4 from Revenge, each one smoked like they are supposed to. a few days later when the Giant Destroyers came, I needed to use those too and unfortunately, they didn't smoke, they shot a bright angry orange flame as if it was a blow torch. The GD's you have to thread the fuse into the bomb which I thought was dumb. I also found that the GD's smelled with stronger sulfur and couldn't wash off the smell from my hands. I don't know if they work or not as again they were blow torches and not smokers. Won't buy these again. Maybe i got a bad batch? won't take the chance again though.
B000BQLWCS Had my yard full of gofers and purchased a couple of them. Busted them all of them out of the garden/yard. These creatures are nasty and keep digging and making new burroughs each day. The key is to close all old mounds and place this gas bomb in the newly created mound. I am glad that this product worked.
B000BQPGQQ This trap takes lots of abuse and just keeps working. Does better than others and doesn't need fancy bait. Our mild weather has brought out huge numbers of squirrels who are attacking my birdfeeders, chewing things in my potting shed and being very destructive. Because they have learned to jump onto the feeders from the deck railing it doesn't matter that I have a big raccoon baffle, in fact that seems to give the squirrels a nice place to stand while they dismantle the suet holder.  My feeders are squirrel proof but for one tray that encourages some bird types I like to watch but now I seem to be feeding more squirrels than birds.  This spring we've just been overrun and I knew I had to do something.I put the trap along the deck railing.  It is relatively narrow, although long, and fits on the railing with only about an inch of overhang.  I set it and then drop some birdseed in through the top beyond the trigger panel.  This is super easy bait and lasts even through rain storms.When a squirrel is trapped, the trap usually falls off the railing onto the ground below.  It stays shut and the squirrel can't get out.  Even after having this happen multiple times, the trap can still be reset and remains effective.  It is getting a little bent, but still works.I was given another (and more expensive) trap that was easier to set, but the mechanism rusted and it wouldn't spring shut.  This one sat out in the weather for a year before I started using it and it is still fully functional.
B000BQPGQQ I bought a smaller one last year... garbage. Caught about 18 birds and half dozen chipmunks, not ONE squirrel. In fact they reached in and grabbed food without tripping it.  This year got the bigger one and in 2 mos I have caught 21 squirrels and relocated. I went from them emptying my bird feeders every couple of days to no problems ... btw the feeders can't be jumped on and I smear the poles with vasoline but they run, HIT them and swing til they get the food out. A great success. Went from up to 9 squirrels in yard at one time to rarely even one.
B000BQPGQQ I have only had this trap for two and a half days, but I feel safe in giving this trap five stars because I have already caught six squirrels and one chipmunk.  I will say that it is hard to set the sensitivity high enough to catch the chipmunks and chipmunks can steal the bait.  Still, this works because I have caught two squirrels when there was no bait at all.  I have yet to leave this for more than two hours and not find a squirrel.Some other reviews have mentioned modifying this to make it sensitive enough.  For squirrels I have not needed to modify mine, but I do try to leave the set switch on as lightly as I can.  At first I tried to put the trigger just barely on, but now I put it on all of the way, and then back it down until it is barely engaged.  That seems to work well for me.
B000BQPGQQ Well we bought this to catch rabbits that have been living under our house and all we caught was a mouse cause he got stuck in the bait.
B000BQPGQQ This is a good trap, sensitive pedal when set correctly.  Peanut butter for bait and caught a huge squirrel who had been raiding my bird feeders. This squirrel was very large.  Caught the critter in a matter of 2 days, think part of the success of this trap is the length which allows the entire animal to be well within the trap when the door shuts.  Only complaint from me is that when the trap is set, the trap door extends downward so much that it restricts the opening of the trap somewhat(perhaps an inch), making it smaller than the advertised size of the trap.  Good humane trap.
B000BQPW6A I have never had a trowel this big. I just received it but being in Texas it has already seen a lot of use. I just planted 40 plants today and this thing is simply the best trowel I have ever used.It gets enough soil to easily plant small flowers and 4 inch plants in one scoop, yet is light-weight. It is like a mini-hand shovel. Then I just keep the displaced soil in the trowel reach for it after inserting the plant and place the soil around the new transplant.Now the handle is pretty big around. It was very comfortable for me. Not sure it would be super comfortable for ladies but because it is very cushy and soft it should be ok even though it is big. I do not work for Fiskars but they have become my go-to garden gear choice this past year. Have yet to be disappointed. Have your eye on that 6-pack of petunias? Or severl 6-packs? Get this bad boy then go to town.
B000BQPW6A I second what reviewer Robert Murphy described so well. I have a collection of Fiskars products including several trowels of various sizes. When I need a large trowel then this one fills the need. When I need a smaller trowel then I use one of my smaller ones depending on the need. The handle is comfortable, the appearance is pleasant and the usage is satisfactory. What more can be said about a trowel?If you need a large trowel then get one of these. Recommended.
B000BQPW6A I've had my share of trowels over the years, and my main complaint was that they were basically all too small.  Sometimes you just need a bigger shovel, to either dig wider or deeper, and the 'regular' ones just don't cut it.  Enter Fiskars Big Grip.  I saw this in Target and grabbed it immediately; I knew it was simply something I had to have, being a hard core gardener.  I haven't had a job that this has been too small for yet, always planting and moving plants.  It wouldn't be too handy if needing to move or plant something large, when a full size shovel is necessary, but every gardening tool set needs this trowel.  Well made & sturdy, definitely one of my best gardening supply purchases...
B000BQPW6A This shovel is the best I have ever used. It has a soft grip handle, which fits perfectly in your hand. The oversize shovel head is great for moving extra amounts of dirt for transplanting plants. The shovel is very heavy duty and I would highly recommend  this product to anyone looking for a great quality hand shovel!
B000BQPW6A This trowel is BIG!  The point is sharp.  My garden soil is heavy clay, and this trowel is the bomb for planting and loosening soil.  I love the grip--it's soft, but big enough to get some powerful digging leverage.  Very pleased!
B000BQPW6A I have never seen one of these in a store!  I just used it today for the first time and I just love the size which is really large for a trowel.  Yet it is really not that heavy!  I am very happy with it!!!!
B000BQPW6A I love this trowel & use it every time I tend to my flowerbeds.It's got a great, sturdy, rubber handle for good grip & it does its job very well.
B000BQPW6A This trowel is great and has become my &#34;go-to&#34; tool. The construction is solid. The handle fits comfortably in my small hand. I highly recommend.
B000BQPW6A I have just used it for the first time and found it very comfortable, much easier to use than the ones with the curved handle that make it difficult for me to hold.  It is strong and larger than I expected from the pictures, very satisfied!
B000BQPW6A This item will come in handy if you are a home owner with a yard or garden. The standard trowel does work but has its limitations. If used properly and not pushed to handle too much it will not break or crack.Also as far as the California warning on this thing, you would be surprised as to how many items have this warning on them that you are not aware of. As long as you don't go and chew on this thing you should be fine.Fiskars has a lifetime warranty on their items so I have no concerns if this items defects in any way.I also bought their 3 piece garden set and with this addition to that set you should have no problems with light/small gardening.
B000BQPZLC ...from our front outside bib to the inlet of a faucet extender about 8 feet away.This 10' hose does exactly what it's supposed to do; what's not to like?Select with confidence.
B000BQPZLC Very well made leader hose that offers a little more length to hook your hose reel up to the faucet.
B000BQPZLC This connector hose came in and I installed it on my Craftsman hose reel. It works and fits perfectly and is doing a great job so far. The shiny brass connectors are a big improvement over the original connector hose that had grown old and leaky over the years.It also served as an occasion to service the Craftsman reel which I had been intending to do but had successfully put off for several years. The o-ring should be lubricated to keep it from drying out and starting to leak. In light of the occasion I also put a new hose on the reel and now it looks and works as good as new.The hose was shipped in very adequate boxing and arrived in perfect condition. If you're using a hose reel this connector hose is a good catalyst for updating and maintaining your reel.I'm very pleased with it.
B000BQPZLC This house may (or may not) leak, but it has a much more serious problem.  My new hose reel requires female fittings on both ends of the leader hose and this 10 foot leader has a male fitting on one end and a female on the other, so it's useless.  My new reel requires a female fitting for attachment to the reel and it of course requires a female fitting at the faucet end (as do all faucets).  Also, the product smells really bad, so I'm returning it to Amazon.
B000BQPZLC I needed a leader hose that would reach to the hose reel at the end of my garden but the faucet is in the middle of it.  None of the local stores carried anything longer than 6 feet so I turned to my favorite store, and it's Amazon to the rescue!  The hose is sturdy and it connected to both ends without leaking.  I'm so happy I could cry, sniff, sob!
B000BQPZLC I went out looking for ten feet of leader hose and the longest i could find was six feet so i bought this hose and the quality is good and it makes it a lot easier to move it away form the house and whined it up on the reel.
B000BQPZLC serves its purpose, but is pretty cheap.if i had to do over, i'd spend an extra $10 and get a heavy duty one.  that way, i could at least have another 10 foot hose that i could use in another application.i put a rubber washer in the female end (all hoses need them, with the more 'heavy duty' ones having them built-in), and that fixed any leaking (cost an extra 30 cents or so).not the best hose in the world, but for $10, it's hard to get pissy about it.
B000BQPZLC This leader hose is long and connects nicely.  I like the fact that it is a 10ft hose which means I get a little more with my hose in general.
B000BQQMJQ After trying several other traps, sprays, etc., this finally worked on our squirrel problem. Traps them alive after they go after a little nut we've put as bait; then we just drive them to a new location (granted it has to be rather far) but better than other options.
B000BQQMJQ I watch the squirrels partially enter while eating, the trap on their back but not closed and out they go. It does catch birds and chipmunks. Waste of money, now have to order larger size.
B000BQQMJQ I have had this product for about a month now and so far, I've caught 3 chipmunks. However, it's worth noting that more often than not (until my modification), the trap was closed, treat was gone and no chipmunks were inside. Though the bait tray is sensitive, a chipmunk can easily get a treat off it and walk out of the trap without it being deployed. Happened to me several times. One time I set the trap on some mulch and the chipmunk dug at the treat from below, again evading the trap.The tip someone posted about smearing peanut butter on the bait tray itself is a good one. However, it's messy and if left out too long, will attract ants. What I did was take a clamp I used for my pet birds and secure it to the inside of the trap near the bait tray. I clip a little graham cracker with some peanut butter on it - that way, the chipmunk almost has to step on the bait tray and/or struggle a little to get the treat, therefor triggering the trap. He can't just grab the treat and go, he has to either sit there for awhile eating it, or pull it off the clamp, either way increasing the likelihood that the trap will deploy.For the price, I feel this is a good product, though I really wish there was a way to secure the treat to the bait tray. It would definitely increase the chances of catching a chipmunk. Setting it up is fairly easy, though not totally intuitive in setting the trap itself. Nice thing is reusable, portable and not messy.Oh, and I doubt a squirrel could fit into this thing! It does seem big enough to catch a squirrel.Overall, a good value for those of us who don't yet have the nerve to kill the little buggers. ;)
B000BQQMJQ I have been hearing some critters in my attic lately and thought I had squirrels. I have the Havahart 1030 (little bigger) and put it in the attic. It caught something, but what it caught was able to get out through the holes so I knew I had something smaller than a squirrel. I purchased this 1025 and put it in the attic. The first night I caught a flying squirrel and it could not escape. Worked very well at holding him for a few hours till I could relocate it. The next night, I caught another flying squirrels. Two nights, two flying squirrels. While I love this trap, I really hope I'm done with it for a while.The mechanisms on the trap can be a little touchy and you have to play with it to get it to stay just right, but is easy to do after a little practice.
B000BQQMJQ My yard is like a menagerie of wild animals.  So many birds we can't feed them all, squirrels, ducks, snapping turtles, humming birds but the ones I trap and get rid of are the chipmunks.  They dig everyplace and can do substantial damage if they get out of control.I trap them with this Havahart cage and take them to a very large park about 10 miles away.  I see this as the humane way of taking care of these critters.  I use a slice of apple tied to the trip plate and it works fine and last for several days if they don't come around.  Every once in a while I would catch a baby squirrel and let it go or maybe even a bird.I have used two of these cages and the first one worked flawlessly.  On the second one the trip setting lever was not bent properly out of the box and I had to re-align it to get it to trip easily and not jam partially open.  The second one is definitely more difficult to set.Last spring I caught 6 chipmunks in one day!  This cage is much too small to catch full size squirrels as the door only closes on their tail and will not lock and the squirrels are very strong and able to escape.Funny story, we went to the park to drop off a chipmunk and we always park in the same spot.  Three chipmunks ran up to the truck like they wanted to get in and my wife said that they just wanted a ride home.  Too bad fellows!
B000BQQMJQ Trap rats near chicken feed and cat feed. Also was surprised that it caught several smaller mice. would have thought that they could have gotten out but they said put.
B000BQQMJQ Got it with the door clashing against the cage so needed to bend the cage/door to provide enough clearance to open/close.  I setup in the attic space to catch critters crawling but didn't catch squat!  An animal once set the trap doors but some how escaped.  Only used few times so I guess time will tell..
B000BQQMJQ Don't waste your money on this piece of junk. The manor in which it stays open does not function properly at all. Real bad design!! There is no making this junk work. STAY AWAY. USE SOME OTHER TRAP!
B000BQQMJQ I thought I just had a ground squirrel or two eating my plants...I received this trap on Monday. Caught one squirrel Monday night, two squirrels Tuesday, four on Wednesday. Today I am told there was one squirrel in the trap and eight more trying to spring their comrade (trying to dig him out). Apparently my property is paradise on Earth for the Antelope Ground Squirrel.I won't be buying any more of these traps (I don't have the time to move 10,000 ground squirrels), but it is very effective. While it looks awful, I think we'll be putting a layer of chicken wire or hardware netting on the bottom half of our 4-foot wire fence. Then we'll use this trap on a case-by-case basis.By the way, Antelope Ground Squirrels like peanut butter, green and red grapes, corn and Ritz crackers.
B000BQQMJQ We caught our vole the first night we put this out, and caught a youngster the second night.  I used a little peanut butter on a small cracker, and it worked.  The trap was a little tricky to get set, it took several tries, but I finally got the hang of it.  Glad I was able to re-home my pests, rather than kill them.
B000BQQMJQ The quality and function of this trap are all great.  I learned from my professional exterminator that a larger trap is more effective, especially for squirrels, which was my problem.  I never caught any of them.  If I had to do it over again, I would purchase a larger version of this.
B000BQQMJQ I have an epidemic of chipmunks in my yard, causing me no end of problems.  I've had a one of the 1025s for a while, and it works great, but wanted a couple more traps to cut down the population.  So, I bought another 1025 and also a \"Havahart 0745 Live Animal Professional Style Trap\".  Since it's advertised as a chipmunk trap, whereas the 1025 is advertised as a squirrel trap, I wanted to compare them.  I've used the two side-by-side, and can tell you, that chipmunks prefer the 1025 by at least 5-1.  They like the 1025 so much, I've occasionally left it out overnight without bait, and found a chippie inside in the morning.I've caught squirrels in this too, they apparently like peanut butter as much as the chippies do.  But usually the chippies get to the bait first.  If you have chipmunks, this is hands-down the best trap I've found.
B000BQRF60 We decided to use this deer repellent to try to keep the deer away from our ancient pear tree. We installed the system about a month ago and of course, it's a bit hard to tell if it's actually working. I can tell you, though, that there have been no deer tracks within the area that we placed the stakes. A good sign!The only reason I gave this product three stars instead of five is because there is little to no information that comes with the system. A comprehensive set of directions would have been wonderful. Also, you have to really keep an eye on it so that you will know when you have to change the battery. Other than that, it seems to be working just fine.
B000BQRF60 As any suburban home owner who is incapable of growing hostas, azaleas or strawberries, due to their consumption by the bottomless pit stomachs of deer, I am always looking and testing for new tools.  The only guaranteed method is a high fence, but that is not always practical, economic or even aesthetic.  Therefore, we resort to chemical repellants, automated sprinklers and the like.  I am battling a herd of deer who live in the woods near my neighborhood whose gardens they use as a personal smorgasbord.  Because their direction of attack is varied, and there is no one specific deer path, it is difficult to use this Electronic Repellent to block all entries.  The set-up is very easy.  One does need to remember to periodically check the batteries, renew the scent, move the stakes if the location is not right.  And you can block certain avenues of attack.  However, this works better if there is a single main deer path, and your plant predation is relatively low.  Otherwise, be prepared to combine this with other weapons in your arsenal.
B000BQRF60 The Havahart 5250 Electronic Deer Repellent appears to work. I have about 800 tulips blooming in my unfenced, suburban front yard. Well, not really. Deer ate about 150 of the tulips shortly after they opened.  Then, I covered the entirety with bird netting to save the rest.Although bird netting is effective against deer and nearly invisible, it isn't invisible. It's also frustrating.  You have to continually raise it to avoid trapping the buds.  Also, it just isn't the ideal setting for a beautiful garden. So, I jumped at the chance to test the Havahart 5250 Electronic Deer Repellent.It's not too difficult to set up. The Electronic Repellent comes with 3 \"units.\" I installed them among the tulips, trying to cover the deer's path. A week later, the tulips still bloom beautifully, without bird netting.  I reapplied the acorn scent to the cotton in each unit after a heavy rain, about a two-minute chore.Beware, the Electronic Deer Repellent could constitute an \"attractive nuisance.\" It is critical to warn small children not to touch the unit. Our neighbor's three-year-old nearly grabbed the attractive red plastic tip, right below the shocking wires, before we warned her away. My husband then tested it as we watched. He felt a very unpleasant jolt, which would really upset a small child.Verdict: the deer are not eating the flowers in the garden. Also, there are no elephants in the yard. It's worth a try to save valuable plants.
B000BQRF60 This product supposedly works by attracting the deer using an acorn scent (a saturated cotton ball that you put in the top of the plastic scent stick) & then shocking the deer's nose when the deer leans in to eat the stick.I can't tell if the product works.  The deer in our yard seem to love our nut trees & have almost destroyed a couple of them.  We put the scent stakes out about 3 weeks ago & we still see 3-4 deer lounging in our yard (a typical number).  I haven't caught them near the trees, so don't know if the scent stick works or if the deer just aren't interested in our trees at the moment.So, the jury is still out.  I'm skeptical about luring animals to where you don't want them & then shocking them to keep them away.  We'll keep using the scent sticks & I'll post as we watch the deer hang out (yes, one will even stand in the yard & watch my car drive down the driveway - not 20 feet away).
B000BQRF60 So far so good with the hosta and knock out roses.  I don't use these stakes quite per the directions but they seem to be working.  The stakes are rather larger than I expected and have a bright red top so they are not exactly blending in with the landscaping, but if they attract the deer to touch them instead of the plants, I'm grateful.  One shock is all it would take to discourage them from returning to that plant.We've had regular rain and replacing the lure after each deluge isn't practical, plus with about a trillion acorns on the ground, I'm not sure that the deer would bother checking out a lure with that same scent.  I hope they are just likely to bump into the thing while trying to dine on my plantings.  The stake does give a good wallop when the top wires are touched--the same or better than my electric fence around the paddock.  I found this out by accident. Will be more careful in the future.I like that the stake's footrest helps  you plant the stack into the ground because you can't touch the top of it to push it in without getting shocked.  It's also important to put the bottom two sections together first when assembling the stake as they fit very tight and once the top is loaded for action, you don't want to be touching it.I haven't seen any deer being shocked by the stakes, but I also haven't lost any of the new plants to their foraging.  I see the deer close by, just not in my yard.  I'd like to think they find it off limits, but that's probably wishful thinking.  Bottom line, I still have my new hosta plants, the roses and phlox, which have been a regular deer treat in the past.  I put a stake by each plant.  I don't know that you could convince a deer to avoid your property by stakes around the perimeter, but they seem to be working at specific locations.  They are certainly worth a try in your deer deterrent offensive.Update 7/1/11: While two plantings near the stakes are still untouched by the deer, the leaves on the far side of the third plant have been eaten.  It tells me they can still eat near the stake with impunity.  I'm hoping that at some point in this meal, the stake was touched with unpleasant results and there will not be a repeat visit.  Time will tell and I'll update.
B000BQRF60 We live in the Blue Ridge Mountains and have an abundance of deer. My husband planted several fruit trees, and as soon as buds appeared, the deer ate them off. Several trees were so chewed up we were afraid we'd lose them, not to mention other plants that were attempting to grow. We'd tried motion detector lights and scented deterrents such as ivory soap, chimes, etc. and the deer always ignored them after a few days. It took about a week, but we've noticed the buds on our fruit trees and other plants have been untouched. We've also noticed the deer are now crossing much farther down the hill, far away from the plants. I'm sure we'll have to move the devices around, check batteries, etc., but it's worth it to protect our fruit new fruit trees and garden.
B000BQRF60 A few short years ago I was happily ensconced in the Midwest. Trips between towns would afford the occasional glimpse of deer; sometimes we would be lucky enough to catch sight of a bambi or a stag. Imagine our joy when, upon moving to the northeast, we were visited by a herd of deer the first night in our new home. The deer were daily visitors all through the long winter. How lucky for us! Of course we knew that come spring and summer our deer friends would retreat into the deeper forest and, naturally, we would be bereft.Well, spring came, and with it a pestilence of deer. Large deer, small deer, rutting bucks chasing females in heat - a cornucopia of strong footed, long limbed voraciously hungry vermin! Nothing would deter them from feasting on my flowerbeds. Deer repellant sprays would work until the first gentle rain fell in the night. Come morning my hostas were reduced to stubble. Pepper solutions were apparently considered seasoning. Coyote urine? You think they fell for that? Nothing worked.We finally installed a fence and, to the kids delight, got a dog. Both have helped considerably. (Yes, some of them do jump over the fence and would probably eat the pup if they could open their jaws wide enough.) That said, the front yard is still open for grazing. I was pretty sure these deer repellant sticks would prove themselves unattractive yard ornamentation. The only action I foresaw was some high hilarity when I managed to back into them weeding. I have to admit these ugly sticks admirably impress me. We have a Japanese maple tree out front that has long been considered delectable deer cuisine by the marauding herds. We placed one pole to the front of it and then positioned the other two poles along the path leading to the front area. (Yes, our house is situated smack dab in the middle of what appears to be a long-standing deer path.) To date, the maple tree has remained unmolested. Now, full disclosure, I am still using the deer repellant spray. That said, we have had some terrific rains for days on end and I did not reapply the spray, so it would seem that the poles are helping.If the poles cease to be effective or if I am fortunate enough to actually see a deer get zapped I will update this review.
B000BQRF60 The Havahart 5250 Electronic Deer Repellent is like a mini-shocker to train the deer that this area is painful to come in. A cottonball saturated in deer lure (in this case, the scent of acorns) is directly under the criss-cross of wire. The idea is that the deer are drawn to the acorny smell and then, buzz, their nose gets zapped. The message is sent that this is a dangerous place to hang-out. Go elsewhere!We live on acreage that houses all sorts of wildlife, deer being among them in large quantities. I have a garden and a plum tree that in particular, I wanted to protect. I see deer outside daily, and I have not yet seen them approach the acorny scented lure. I have had these out for months and have re-applied the scent.I know they work, because we tested them. They require batteries and the scent to lure the deer. They are easy to move around. The product \"works\", but I'm not sure it is a sure-fire way to repel the deer. Perhaps this would work a little better in a closer proximity?
B000BQRF60 I am very torn about reviewing this product.  I wanted to give it more stars, but I have not seen a difference.  I don't want to give it a lot of stars if it shows later on that it is not working.  I don't want to give it too few stars in case I realize that it is indeed working once the usual time periods of deer damage prove to be far less than usual.I have had this unit for some time now, and was waiting for the opportunity to see a big change in the deer damage at our place.So far, I don't see anything different, but then again, we are not having trouble in the places where we DON'T have the deer repellant installed this year at this period of time.Usually late fall is when the real problems get worse- and early spring, and by then it will be much later.  I wanted to give some kind of detailed feedback on this product, but It really is not that remarkable.  The lure is something that will have to be replaced pretty often if you have a lot of rain going on, and as for the cotton balls, we tore them in pieces - one solid ball was a bit big- we cut them in half and distributed more evenly on the unit.The batteries have not run down yet, but I can not tell if you it is doing much as we are just not having the traffic we usually have around here as far as deer go.I will continue to test out the Havahart 5250 Electronic Deer Repellent and update if we see any significant changes, but for now, there is just not anything happening for the last few months.I would like to note that the instructions say that this will not be effective used alone if there are a lot of deer in the area- more might be necessary.  It also says that you have to re-train the young deer to new trails in the later part of the year.Perhaps that will make a difference then.The good news is that there is not any damage happening at this point.  The bad news is that there wasn't for a few weeks before I put up the repellent so I don't know if it is working!  They already did a lot of damage in early spring in the same spot- they are probably waiting until later.  Who knows?
B000BQRF60 We spray our vegetables with deer repellent.  Effective but expensive and washes off.We tried motion detection lights.  Worked for a weekWe tried motion detection sprinklers.  Worked but overwatered the garden.We have a five foot high electric fence around our garden.  The deer jump it.We tried the Havahart 5250 Electronic Deer Repellent.  Worked for a small area but we have a 1/4 acre garden.  We'd need hundreds of dollars worth of these things and the deer could still jump over them.
B000BQRF60 I was skeptical, but I admit that I have seen no deer since I put them out 5 weeks ago.  What an improvement that is to my big garden.  These seem to work and work well.  I may buy more if I don't see deer within the next couple of weeks.  They seem to cover a wide area for me, 180 feet X 425 feet.  I am amazed.
B000BQRF60 This electronic deer repellent is interesting, but I'm afraid that there's little way to know if it works.  The idea is to entice deer with a scent so that they touch a set of wires looped at the top of the device, which sends an electrical shock to the deer.  The instructions indicate that it is not intended for an area with a high concentration of deer and that you need to rotate through different scents to keep them from associating the shock with the scent item.  The units came with an acorn scent and I can imagine teaching the deer to avoid acorns while they continue to eat your fruit trees or scrape their horns on our aspen trees.  I'm not sure whether they have reduced the damage that the deer have done in my yard, but my dog avoids acorns with a passion now.  I guess that's good though ... right?  I would say nice try, but maybe a bit off the mark.
B000BQRF60 My landlord's house is between two rental houses, one of which we are in. The land is beautiful sweeping mountain land they have planted with apple trees, grapes, and a variety of flowers and bushes. We have a communal garden plot as well as a communal chicken coop. My landlord loves the deer that come and has planted an area just for them to browse. But their well-worn path into the area goes right through the apple trees and too close to the tempting garden plot.We are under no illusions that the deer will go away, nor would we really want them to. We enjoy sharing the land with all the critters that come here and, rather than trying to eliminate nuisances, we prefer to seek balance in the ecosystem using permaculture principles and simple deterrents that help the critters make choices that just happen to work out better for us as well.What we are experimenting with now with these deer-repellent stakes is diverting the path of the deer so they skirt the apple trees and garden and head, instead, for the browsing area that ought to give them plenty to eat. I have yet to catch the deer in their act so I can't report yet on how effectively the stakes work for our purposes, but the fact that I haven't seen them at all is saying something. When the apple trees start to flower, that's when we'll have a better sense of how well the stakes are working at refocusing the deer. When I have something more to report, I will update this review.
B000BQRF60 Well, for starters I live in Wyoming where deer in the yard is a menace, and if you are trying to start a yard with deer around forget about it. For three years now we have tried to re-landscape and resurrect our yard. Our high desert location is a major hurdle, but as our neighbors lawns prove it can be done the greatest enemy is actually the deer.These rods were just one more thing we tried and failed with. To be fair the scent that they are treated with is acorn which would be a completely alien scent to the deer in this area although I was hoping that it might lure them anyway. The rods were ignored. Also, I believe that the rainstorm that has hit us in the last three days might have shorted out the rods some how, as birds are roosting on them.This was an interesting idea and I was looking forward to seeing how it would pan out. So far the only thing we've tried that has actually had any degree of success with has been straw. We covered the entire yard with straw to try and protect it for the winter and the deer actually seem to hate that. They won't even walk on it. Unfortunately when we raked it up for spring they're baaaack!
B000BQRF60 When human beings displaced deer from their natural habitat, we did something very disruptive - we replaced it with a much better habitat. Rather than pick among the sparse native shrubs, the deer now have a huge selection of succulent new food, imported into their environment at enormous expense. Not only that, but the suburbs discourage the predators which might have kept their numbers down: the many traffic accidents don't compensate for this.Better habitat - fewer predators = uncontrolled population growth.Result? Waking up in the morning, to find that all the tulips have vanished. Or worse, waking up in ER to find that you've just collided with a deer.In the suburbs, the deer population has grown out of all proportion. We'll welcome anything to keep the damned things out of our gardens. Unfortunately, killing them outright is illegal.The concept of the product is fairly simple. It's basically a low-powered cattle prod, with a deer attractant. The idea is that the deer is attracted by the smell, licks the device, gets a mild shock, doesn't like the experience. If they do it often enough, they get conditioned to stay away. Deer are not particularly intelligent, so the process takes a while. I've been using devices like this for a few years. It works, a bit, but not well enough to replace deer repellent chemicals. The most effective repellent(apart from a fence) is spraying, but it has to be repeated. (Even repellents don't work for the young deer, who are unbelievably stupid, and will eat anything, including poisonous plants.)This particular product is a tad clumsy. Others use a scent-impregnated piece of plastic, which needs to be replaced once a month; this one has a ball of cotton wool, plus a bottle of attractant. I suspect any decent rain storm will wash it away. The instructions confirm this. Apparently I'm supposed to add new attractant every week, and after rain. Not good.The instructions also recommend changing the attractant every so often, 'because the deer get used to it'. This approach works for repellents, but is completely wrong for something designed to condition deer to stay away. I rather thought that the whole point is for the deer to associate the smell of the attractant with a shock!Now that I've installed these things in my garden, I realize that the people who design them didn't realize that they are supposed to blend into the environment. What possessed the manufacturer to give them red tops!I'll continue to use it throughout the season. If it seems more effective than its predecessors, I'll let you know, but initial impressions are not favorable.Good luck in the Fight.
B000BQRF60 These take almost no time to put together but you must read the instructions carefully.  You put cotton balls in the top and put a few drops of lure on them.  Acorn lure is supplied and it doesn't smell bad so if you get it on your hands, you aren't a pariah for a day.  There are loops of wire that mustn't touch or it wears out the battery so you have to be careful to set them correctly before you put the batteries in.  Two AA batteries are required for each post and it takes 45 minutes to charge the first time.  This is an important thing to know because you might figure it doesn't work, like my brother did when he put it together without the instructions!  You can test them with a screwdriver and you get a spark.  After discharge it takes only 15 minutes to recharge.  I can't tell you how the deer like them because I haven't seen the deer, but my plants are left alone!  Since they run on batteries, you don't have to have them at any set distance apart, just stick them wherever your precious plants are being attacked.  Evidently the deer become complacent with the same lure scent so you get info on where to order other scents to rotate.
B000BQRF60 This is a set of three posts that gives a gentle shock to animals.  Setup took about 20 minutes and the weekly deer lure is easy to replace.We have roses in the flower beds in Northeast Florida.  Unfortunately, deer love to eat the roses.  After a total of 10 weeks, this product is still staying strong.  Our roses are unfettered by the deer.  Our neighbors down the street don't have as much luck, and they've tried everything.  Now, they want to buy this product, also.If you have a problem with wildlife, give this product a try.  It works with the deer who, before, raided our flower beds.Highly recommended.
B000BQRF60 The theory here is that you can prevent deer from coming around by luring them in to these stakes as the most attractive place to go, and then when they come in closer it zaps them.Unfortunately this means that these stakes have to have the scent added to them over and over, and have to be placed in a way that it's more inciting than your trees or flowers.  If setup right, they seem to keep the deer away, but for easy of use I prefer a bar of soap with a hole drilled in it (like ivory spring), or use milorganite on the ground.  Both which also use the deer's heightened sense of smell, but to keep them away instead of luring them in and zapping them.
B000BQRF60 I was holding off for a review of this product until I was able to see it in action.  Waiting for deer can be a test of patience.  But it finally happened.  We live in a semi rural area and grow our own garden.  I put these out close to the garden and wham o the deer walks up sniffs and zap no more deer. Havahart does it again.  Recommended
B000BQRF60 I have to admit, these are kind-of a hassle. Setup is pretty easy, but they aren't as effective as I'd like. I've seen deer walk right up to them, get shocked and carry on about their merry, veggie-eating ways. I really think the key to keeping up with deer is switching up your routine. Keep trying new things to keep them away from your plants. When they are hungry, they really don't care what stands in their path.I'm not real keen on using 6 AA batteries to keep these going, but they do seem to last an entire season, at least. I can't say they were worth the effort - the deer have to get pretty close to the item itself to get shocked and the scent is what draws them in. So they are drawn in, and shocked. I'd rather nothing draw them in!Make sure to know what you're buying before you buy it. Per the manufacturer, these are for mild, infrequent and intermittent deer damage - which is exactly what I have. The best way for all of us to buy products that fit our needs is to read the box. Sadly, many people don't do that!
B000BQRF60 This is a set of 3 battery-operated devices that are supposed to deter deer from eating your plantings.  The devices consist of a plastic stake, about 18\" high that you stick into the ground with a handy foot tab.  On the top of each stake are two metal wires connected to a battery-operated charger, surrounding a casement that is to be filled with acorn-scented cotton balls (cotton-balls and acorn scent included in the package).  The intention is for the deer to be attracted by the acorn scent, sniff the top of the stake, get a mild shock from the wires, and then high-tail it out of your yard.The stakes were rather simple to assembly and load with AA batteries (2 needed for each stake).  Instructions said to insert an entire cotton ball into each casement, but it was rather difficult to get an entire cotton ball in place.  According to instructions, several drops of acorn scent should be distributed on the cotton balls after every rain, or at least once a week.  I found it a little difficult to re-apply the scent drops with the sticks in the ground--it's much easier if you take the stakes out of the ground so you can apply the drops at an angle.The stakes are green plastic with red tips, and would probably be child-magnets for small children, so they aren't recommended for use around children.  My hunch is that 1-3 year olds would learn to avoid the stakes even faster than deer, but I still wouldn't want to use them around young children.  Older children might be tempted to pull up the stakes and use them for sword fighting, so they probably wouldn't be good to have in yards with older kids either.On the package, the manufacturer notes that the stakes are \"very effective\" in suburban areas where deer density is low and damage is mild, infrequent, and unpredictable.  And \"not effective\" in rural areas where deer density is high, and damage is extreme and frequent.  In other words, they're most \"effective\" if you don't have a real problem with deer.  I wasn't aware of these limitations when I ordered the product, but tried them out anyway in my blueberry plantings in front of my house, which is in a rural area with plenty of deer.  I aimed my game camera at the stakes to see whether I could catch deer being deterred.  My camera showed dozens of regular visits by deer to the blueberry plantings, in which the deer looked happy, content, and well fed, but not very deterred.
B000BQRF60 I put the deer repellent in my backyard, and it seems like it might be working. I put it close to my berry bushes since deer really like to eat those and they eat up all the new grows every year, and I was really tired of it. I still see some deer in the area from time to time, but my bushes look fine. I try not to forget to add the oil to the stakes every now and then, especially after rain. Once I didn't, and I was able to make a nice picture of baby deer standing next to the repellent. So, yes, it will only work if you keep it charged because there is always new deer that haven't been at your yard before and does not know it is not welcomed.There was a lot of information on the package on how and where to install the stakes so they will work the best. It was a bit tricky to assemble the parts, I had to ask my husband for help.
B000BQRF60 This review is based upon my own experience - which is rather limited as the product was defective out of the box. Only one of the stakes (out of three that came with the set) worked whatsoever. The other two were dead on arrival. Based upon the quality concerns, I would rate this as a \"warning\" to others. The one stake that did work is quite safe, the description is accurate, it is a low level shock and nothing like an electric fence. Gentle but annoying. Overall, there seems to be a quality concern with this product. Since this was reviewed via the Vine program it isn't worth the time/effort to pursue but suffice to say, if I had purchased the product, it would be returned immediately. Overall, I would hesitate to suggest this to others based upon the erratic quality of the items. On the other hand, it is a safe and very easy to use product at a fraction of the time, effort and cost associated with other options which is why I gave it 3 out of 5 stars for a review.
B000BQRF60 As most serious gardeners know, finding the right tool to defend your garden against nature's creatures can sometimes feel like a losing battle. I'm always open to new ideas. When the Havahart Electronic Deer Repellent system arrived, I immediately put it to the test. After five weeks use, these are my thoughts.Out of the box, buyers get (3) electronic posts, (1) container of acorn scented lure, cotton balls and an instruction manual. Each post is powered by two AA batteries which are not included in the kit. Two out of three of the posts were relatively easy to set up. The last one put up a fight. Mission accomplished.After baiting the posts, I staked the units at about 100 feet apart. I like the fact that this product is wireless and can be repositioned without any real fuss. Supposedly this system works by taking advantage of the animal's heightened sensitivity to smell. When the deer makes contact it receives a mild 400 volts shock. Its a lower burst then what I would get with static electricity from a carpet.Now the test. At first the deer seemed to get the message. After about two weeks, the animals found a way to avoid the posts. I've had to move the posts on several occasions. Same story. Its like a game of chess. The system works until the animals become aware of it again. Even though this product is designed for deer, I knew that it was only a matter of time before the squirrels came around. Oddly the squirrels don't seem to get the same message. They're repeatedly getting zapped.As far as the acorn scent goes, I replace it weekly. Obviously when a good rain comes, the units need to be replenished with the scent too. The acorn scent can be purchased via the company's website or through a couple of online vendors I found. I failed to find it at local stores. Product refills range greatly in price from one location to another. Battery life looks good. The battery compartment is somewhat watertight so I don't see myself replacing batteries until at least the eight month mark.The company's website offers a wealth of great information. Their toll free number is another story. Wait times can be anywhere from 15 minutes to a half hour. As far as product guarantees, the manufacturer offers a complete refund if customers are not totally satisfied.Overall, the Havahart Electronic Deer Repellent system has its pluses. As long as you're willing to constantly monitor your garden it does work. The key is to reposition the individual units on a regular basis. With the exception of the neighborhood squirrels, its give or take with the deer. They do catch on fast. For me personally, I find this system to be a pricey investment for what you get. However, if you're into gadgets this one may be for you.
B000BQRF60 I have to say that I am at fault for this one. I must have taken my stupid pills the day I requested these. For some reason I was thinking that \"electronic\" meant that there would be a sound deterrent or a light or something besides a shock. I should have read further before ordering.These were easy to assemble and install the batteries which were provided. My happiness ends there.The first thing that makes no sense is the \"lure\" that is applied to the tops of these. As a long time landscaper I learned eons ago that you never intentionally \"lure\" whatever you are trying to avoid (i.e. japansese beetle traps). Only frustration and madness lie that way. So in order for these to work, you have to lure the deer to your yard so they can essentially stick their noses in the scent and therefore get this mild shock. It is all about training the animal as you would a dog with invisible fence.As someone who lives in a heavily wooded area I can tell you from nearly 30 years of experience that if a critter wants it, they will get it. Short of a physical barrier they will find a way around.These may be OK for someone in a suburban area, but if you have kids that are touching things these would be a no go.I'll keep spraying repellent and letting \"nature take it's course\".
B000BQRF60 We live in suburbia - 1/2 acre to 1 acre plots - in Westchester County New York.  Lots of deer.  These have an odd way of working.  They actually use a scent to ATTRACT deer, then they use a shock to repel them.  It's a bit odd.  Unless the deer actually touch the wires, they are never repelled - only attracted.I haven't done a statistical study, but I would say that the deer are MORE active on our property than they used to be.  Previously, they would wander through.  Now, they are curious and stick around because of the scent.  I have only seen one deer (a huge buck) touch the wires.  It only seemed mildly phased - and didn't run away or anything.These are also very dangerous if you have kids around.  There are package warnings, but the wires give off a pretty good shock to humans - probably not enough to do any damage, but pretty unpleasant.
B000BQRF60 I have horses but no place to store my hay so it often gets stored in the back of my pick up. No matter how well tarped it is the deer would get into it and ruin a good amount.  Even parking next to the house and having a big dog here do not disuad them. I have been using these stakes for a couple of nights so far one on each side of the hay in the truck bed and have had no damage.  I will update my review as time progresses.Well I moved some of my potted plants away from the porch and didn't use this product.  2 nights later they were all eaten off so now I know it wasn't the dogs keeping the deer away from the hay.  The only drawback I have found it that someone took 2 of these and laid them in a pile of hay and by the time I found out the batteries had discharged.  The instructions tell you they will if they are in constant contact with anything.  It would be nice if the manufacturer could somehow build in a cut off to prevent this from happening.  Batteries aren't cheap.
B000BQRF60 I got three of these last summer and had my doubts that they would work, because my deer are so stubborn here that no scent-based repellent can keep them at bay - in fact if you want to chase them off yourself, you practically have to walk right up to them and punch them in the nose (and even that scares me sometimes because I get so close, I'm afraid I might actually make contact one day and get myself trampled!)Anyway I put them in some roses and hydrangeas that had never got a chance to bloom due to being browsed constantly, and this  year I have lush roses blooming everywhere!  The original batteries are still working, too (I discovered this accidentally by grabbing one by the red end, certain that the batteries must be dead by now.  OW!  These do not burn, but the ache in my hand and wrist bones lasted until the next day.  Needless to say: Keep the grandkids away from these!)I'm back this year to order more to protect some blueberry bushes that are being decimated just as the berries are getting ripe.
B000BQRF60 When I requested this, a key bit of information was not listed on the Amazon product page.  This info. is printed on the outside of the box & it says:Very Effective - Suburban Area.  Deer density is low.  Damage is mild, infrequent, unpredictable.Effective - Suburban Area.  Deer density is medium.  Damage is moderate, frequent, predictable.Effective (if repellent is moved as deer travel pattern changes) - Rural Residential Area.  Deer density is medium to high.  Damage is extensive, frequent, predictable.Not Effective (A fence is the best option) - Rural, Non-residential, Agricultural Areas.  Deer density is high.  Damages is extreme, frequent, unpredictable.I see this & say oh no!  I am in the \"Not Effective\" category aka \"do not buy this item - go get a fence\"  I go on line & view the page thinking it must be here & I missed it.  Nope.  The above info. is not provided.  Now you have it so you don't unknowingly make the same mistake I did.Because I already committed to the product I gave it a go following the instructions.  I chose a path the deer take past our young fruit trees.  I put the lures along the path.  They did nothing.  I moved them in a tighter range after seeing the deer eating the tops of our young trees.  Added more scent (you do this once a week) & the deer are out there everyday.  No matter how tightly I have placed these together to protect even a tiny area as if I was not in the country or putting them along the path of the deer as directed it just doesn't work. I did not place them far apart from each other even though we have a lot of land.  I still followed the directions by choosing small areas to cover.  I want that to be very clear.As far as the assembly goes, they were not as easy to put together as I thought.  Before you snicker, read.  Everything was very easy except trying to fit the middle pole into the bottom pole.  On all 3 poles I had extreme difficulty.  I thought I would end up breaking the little hard plastic tabs.  I followed the assembly directions exactly & because of this the ends were charged & scented - all 3.  I'm at my garden bench with charged polls rolling around while I battle it out trying to get a seemingly simple task accomplished.  I grabbed a slender metal garden stake tried to keep the poll from rolling & discharging on the other polls or by the back of my arm hitting it while I tried to do 3 things with 2 hands, push in the tab, push the poll into the bottom & hold it still on the bench while not hurting myself.  I know it probably sounds pathetic but I really did have a heck of a time with the bottoms.  I would recommend putting on the bottoms first so you don't have to worry about the charged tops & then assemble the rest per the directions.  I think I would have had a much easier time if I did it that way.  For once, it would have been better NOT to follow the directions!At this point after weeks of using these I'm not even sure what to do with them.  I guess I could move them yet again, but I just don't see the point. They are still out with the few fruit trees & they are scented with lure, but why?  They just don't do a thing.
B000BQRF60 When we first got the unit, we had to replace the batteries - the ones that it came with must have been old and they were not delivering a shock strong enough to do anything.  It includes 3 units which says it covers 1200 square feet, but I think that's stretching it.  A lot depends on the landscaping of your yard and how the deer approach.  We've got woods close to ours and put 3 where the deer paths entered the yard.  We did NOT have any problems with deer in the garden there, but they seemed to go around to the side of the yard and come in from that direction.  It is rather expensive to line the periphery of a large, unfenced yard with multiple ways that deer can approach.Would probably be best used in conjunction with fencing to narrow wildlife approach.  Check batteries often - every couple of weeks at least - with fresh strong batteries the shock is like a good electrostatic shock -it won't hurt the deer as much as startle them (which is good and makes them run) - but when the batteries get used up a bit, it doesn't feel like much at all.
B000BQRF60 I put these up in my yard around the fence line. The deer still came into my yard. Didn't seem to make any mind of these stakes. The instructions say to place them at the areas away from what you want protected.  I followed the directions and the deer still enters the yard and eats the plants.Maybe if you combine these with other deterrents they may work better. I don't know. These don't seem to work.
B000BQRF60 I was very excited to receive my Havahart 5250 Electronic Deer Repellent to use around my garden.  This device uses an acorn scented extract to lure in the deer, then when they sniff the device they receive a shock.  I know some people may be opposed to 'hurting' a deer, but really, we use barbed wire fences on cows and electric fences for other livestock and the Havahart is no worse than any of these other fences!My garden isn't in or growing yet, but I do have hundreds of perennials that the deer love to nibble on, the Havahart has made a big difference in my plant life already and I have great hopes for actually having a garden for myself this year instead of one for the deer.I love the fact that you can move the stakes around as you 'train' the deer to stay away.  The difficulty I had with this product was in the assemble, it was a bit difficult to snap the lower 2 pieces of the stake together, and the directions state that the product may be ruined if you put the batteries in the wrong way so you do need to be aware of that.All in all I think this is a great product, especially for someone like me who lives in the woods and has a lot of deer roaming around looking for a handout!
B000BQRF60 This seemed to work OK, but it didn't protect my garden.  Guess there are other creatures of the night interested in my water melons, beans and tomatoes.The thing that I don't understand is why you would attract the deer with some sort of good smelling stuff to the deer, and then shock them to get them to stay away.  Now it the smell was water mellon or bean=based, I might understand the logic.
B000BQRF60 Like many of the reviewers I am still in the \"wait and see\" phase with this product.  I have a terrible problem with deer eating my roses and small fruit trees.  I've tried sprays with some success, and the most effective device I have found is the motion-activated sprinkler - but both come with certain limitations so I am hopeful this works.A few observations at this point.  You put together these three piece \"poles\" that you stick in areas deer  frequent.  The poles are very cheaply constructed - and I worry how long they will last in the great outdoors. The idea here is that you coat cotton balls with a deer attractant - and when they stick their nose towards the balls they will get zapped by a slight electrical charge put out by two AA batteries.Interesting idea - and it makes some sense.  My concerns are that it is impossible to tell if it is working without getting a \"zap\" - and I assume I will have to continually put more attractant out.  So by the time I replace batteries and attractant I might be as well off to just use spray - but time will tell.
B000BQRF60 Herds of deer patrol our yard and shrubs and they've done serious damage.  We've fenced our vegetable garden and put netting over other shrubs that we don't want the deer to eat, but such solutions are not always convenient.  This is a clever solution that doesn't take a lot of space or skill to implement but isn't cheap either.  So far the deer have kept their noses and mouths off of our unfenced tomato plants protected by one of these.  Some otherwise vulnerable flowers appear to be receiving protection from the others.  Testing to make sure that they're working involves a mild shock.  Oh deer.
B000BQRF60 I agree with the one-star review titled \"Pointless\" written by \"Kitten Kisser\".  I live in an area that falls between the last two categories \"Rural residential\" and \"Rural non-residential agricultural\" - I have high deer density, damage is frequent but unpredictable.  Since I installed them, I haven't seen any deer in my yard, but my schedule has been erratic, so it's not unusual.  I've seen deer damage on plants near one of the three repellent stakes, but not near the other two.  But then, I don't know if I would have seen damage on those plants if the stakes were not there.I will continue to re-scent the stakes, at least as long as the supply lasts.  And I'll move the stakes, as the instructions say.  But since my walnut tree got partly eaten, I don't have high hopes for these stakes doing the job.
B000BQRF60 I was hoping to use this in the non-fenced part of our yard, since that is where the deer shred our flowers.Be warned, if a bird alights on this, they will get a shock. If a fox or dog sniffs it, they too will get a shock.Not to mention children, and since we don't have a fence in the front, children do cut through out yard.So, maybe if you live out in the country this would be useful.  But if you live in the city and you don't have a fence and there are children around...
B000BQRF60 It will take time for me to be sure, but one week into my use of this method for keeping deer away from my gardens, but there are fewer signs of recent deer presence.  So from the perspective of \"driving away the critters\", I'm inclined to recommend it.It's easy enough to use. One stake should cover atoub 1200 square feet of ground.  Add a few drops of the scented lure onto the unit, put the batteries in and place the stakes according to the illustrations provided.  The lure draws the deer in and once they're  close enough, they'll receive 400 volts that \"should\" scare the deer away and imprint the fear deep enough to keep them away.The problem that I have is that in order for the repellent to work, it has to lure the deer close.  That could bring additional deer into the area, which could defeat 
B000BQRF60 There are 3 poles that one sticks in the ground; there's a deer attractant to draw them near, and it uses AA batteries to give the critters a mild shock.  Simple idea.The instructions tell you the limitations: one, it depends on the deer concentration; works best in the town where there are fewer; works least in a rural, non-residential setting.  We live rural-residential, and have lots of deer.  Secondly, it states it covers 1200 sq. ft.- that's like a 30' X 40' area.  Finally, it's affected by climate, i.e., moisture.We, in general, like having deer around; however, we want to keep them away from our flowers, trees, and garden.  I just bought some baby fruit trees, and it seems to work.  How long I don't know?You'll have to consider the cost and what you want to protect.  I think it's probably easier and more secure to use fencing, dogs, and chose plants deer don't eat.
B000BQRF60 I have been using this product for awhile to see if it made a big difference. It works in a small area, I tried it on a large area and the Deer still came. I tried it around my backyard about 50 feet and it actually worked better. I think the deer get smart after awhile and go around it. The babies run one to three but the parents will try try again. Overall for a small area this will work great for you. A large area you need to adjust all to see how much you can get covered
B000BQRF60 Deers are the worse pest in New England. Not only do they destroy our gardens, they also spread Lime disease, a serious deer-tick born ailment that is named after a Connecticut town. For some unfathomable reason, the local politicians decide that, ours being a proudly liberal town, any hunting or trapping of deers is strictly forbidden all year round anywhere within the town border, making this town uniquely pro-deer in the state of Connecticut.Poor home owners who cannot put up six-foot tall fences all around the properties are pretty much defenseless against these nasty invaders. Last year, my entire crop of okra as well as my wife's prized lilies were gone in a single evening. It was not that we chose to do nothing, but the deer-repellant spray was washed away in a drizzle and the deers were free to munch on the tenderest new shoots. This year, we feel we have no choice but to pay up for the somewhat rain-resistant but much more expensiveDeer Scram 25# Deer & Rabbit Repellent Granular White Pail. This blood/garlic mixture has worked for us so far, but I am constantly worried that the smell is fading fast with each rainy day.When I saw the phrase \"electronic deer repellent\" on Amazon, my heart skipped a beat in joy and wonder. Could this be the silver bullet to our deer problem? I made the big mistake of not reading the detailed descriptions and the reviews until the item arrived. This \"repellent\" uses acorn scented oil to ATTRACT deers to one's lawn only to gently send them away with a mild electric shock. Question 1: what if the deers choose not to touch the metal part with their noses? Question 2: What about the deer ticks they carry? Question 3: Why would I want to attract all the deers in the neighborhood to my small property in the first place? Do I really want to remind them how many tender and juicy flowers and vegetables I have just planted?There is just no way I am going to put this boondoggle in my lawn. The only legitimate purpose of this thing I can think of is to use it as a bait while waiting around with a bow or a rifle, assuming that the acorn oil actually works. Maybe someone should market a similar product under the brand \"Havabrain\"?
B000BQRF60 I set these up a few weeks ago.  It is difficult to know just how successful they have been as I don't know how much additional damage I would have gotten without them and I have never seen a deer touching a unit.  I have had plants less than 10 feet away eaten, so these will be added to my normal arsenal of spraying and fencing but not counted on as the only solution.  They would work best in a situation where the deer enter in one small area, like a driveway or gate.  Unfortunately, my local deer have numerous paths and seem to be passing these by. I did touch the units to make sure they are working and to see how bad the shock is (I have a puppy that I did not want harmed) and the it is very mild -  enough to scare, but not enough to cause any harm.  I am glad these weren't around when I was a child or my big brother would have somehow gotten me to put my tongue on them, so watch out that your kids or neighbor kids don't get that idea.
B000BQRF60 **** Revised Review as of 6/16/11 ****I originally gave this product two stars and said it was \"ineffective\". I am revising this to, \"causes more deer damage\". It actually increased the number of deer visits to our yard, which is NOT a cottage in the forest (suburbia as noted below). After giving it two weeks, my family begged me to please remove the \"repellents\" because they were bringing too many deer into the yard. My son erected a more effective measure (metal wire fence) and this seemed to do the job for about the same amount of money. Bottom line, I tossed these worthless (actually, harmful) units into the garbage can after removing the batteries. Avoid them unless you want more deer. If you do want more deer, it's cheaper to go to the hunting supply store and buy the acorn scented deer attracter, soak a piece of cotton with it and leave it on a stick or something. It works about the same as these things, and it will be much less expensive.**** End of Revision ****We live in a suburban area  in California's \"Silicon Valley\" with paved streets, curbs, lawns, gardens and ... deer!!! Out plants are eaten year-round by deer. They come down out of the hills where they live and trot down the paved roads a mile or so down to our home. We've tried a lot of methods to either protect the plants (fences, wires, predator scent, etc.) with mixed results. So, when I had a chance to try out this new \"Electronic Deer Repellent\" my hopes were up for a while.The term \"repellent\" is somewhat misleading. these stakes are supposed to work (they did NOT work for me) by using a deer attracting scent (acorn is the one that comes with the set) to bring deer in contact with the wires on the top of the stake. The wires are charged up by two AA batteries much as an electric fly swatter, if you have seen or used one of those. The deer are supposed to be shocked when they put their nose on the wires as they attempt to get to the source of the acorn smell. So, the deer can't be \"repelled\" until they are \"attracted\". The theory is understandable, but our results show it is seriously flawed in practice.In order to save your reading of the rest of this review, let me say this product had no positive effect at all on our deer issues. In fact, it may have worked to attract more deer!Details:1. Packaging: the product comes in a compact cardboard container that has three of the units. They require a modest amount of assembly. My set came with the requisite two AA batteries for each stake, but then this was a set for review. I don't know if the commercial product has the same. The box is about 19\" x 4\" x 4\", which means it is easy to ship. The packaging seemed adequate to protect the goods, but not frustrating to open.2. Assembly: I asked my 14 year old daughter to assemble the units. She did so with relative ease. The instructions and tasks to be done are simple. The units come in three main pieces (spike, lower shaft, upper shaft with the power head), plus the two batteries. She had a minor struggle getting some of the plastic lock buttons to engage with the holes in the metal shaft, but it was not epic. Overall, it took less than ten minutes for her to finish. We will upload the video later this week.3. Activation: The most difficult part of the use of these \"repellent\" stakes is to add the bait. You must stuff some loose cotton into holes in the top of the stakes and then add some drops of deer-attracting scent (the kit comes with acorn scent). Inserting the cotton requires you to have a small stick, flat blade screwdriver, or similar to poke the cotton into its place. Then, you add drops of scent. The scent must be re-applied every few days.4. Quick test: since our family has used electronic fly swatters for a few years, we thought this product may have some possibility of success. So, after putting it all together we tried to shock ourselves with the wires - which is against all the instructions and warnings provided by Havahart - and felt very little shock. Very, very little. As in, not enough to bother us at all - less than you'd get from the door knob in your home after walking across the wool carpet. In our opinion, probably not enough to worry Mr. Deer.5. Testing: the instructions claim 1100 sq ft coverage and we followed them to the letter.  Our results were that MORE deer seemed to visit that part of the garden and that more deer returned later. We are giving it a few days just in case.Bottom line: it's a crock!
B000BQRF60 The concept sounds good, but one has to wait and see how this works in each individual case. You coat cotton balls with a deer attractant - and when a deer sticks its nose towards the balls they will get zapped by an electrical charge from two AA batteries. The negative side of this is that acorn scent has to be applied often; if it rains then the scent is washed out. I put this in my back yard about a week ago, but I have not seen any deer passing nearby, I will wait longer to see its effect.1.Bird-X DG Deer Gard Ultrasonic Deer Repeller2.Havahart Deer Off DO32RTU Deer Rabbit and Squirrel Repellent 32 Ounce Ready-to-Use Spray
B000BQRF60 I got these to use around my garden, as I live in the country and we have frequent deer guests who love to munch on our corn seedlings, flowers and other garden plants. I placed the spikes as directed and put the lure liquid in as directed- the set up was easy. Just about anyone could set this up. After around 3 weeks, my plants are untouched by the deer. I saw one deer come up and then suddenly jump and take off, so I'm sure that it was the shock from the Havahart that sent him packing. Hopefully, it will keep working.One big warning with this (as stated on the packaging) is that if a small child happens upon these spikes they will get a shock as well. My niece, when we weren't watching got a bit too close and got a shock that upset her. So, if you have small children that like to wander or play out in your garden, I might advise against putting this anywhere they could wander into it.
B000BQRF60 At first glance, the Havahart 5250 Electronic Deer Repellent seems like it might work.  It supposedly attracts deer with a scented lure (a cotton ball at the top to which you apply the supplied scent drops) and the deer, if they nudge it with their nose, get a shock from the wires that run down the post.Unfortunately, this underestimates the deers' ability to bypass the post and munch your garden - as most deer would do.  The package notes that it is designed for \"light deer pressure\" installations, such as urban back yards, and not for more rural or even suburban situations.  My house is decidedly rural with high deer pressure, and the Havahart made zero difference in deer foraging in the garden.  As you get only three in the package, you might need many more to protect even a small garden to any significant degree.And even in the urban setting, where this might work better, anything that attracts deer probably makes things worse rather than better.  In this way it is a lot like the Japanese Beetle traps with their pheromone lures - while the traps may catch a lot of beetles, they also attract more beetles to the area.Sadly, the only thing that seems to really work on deer is a physical barrier, perhaps reinforced with a continuous electric fence.
B000BQRF60 I once read a story about a South African farmer whose crops were regularly devoured by a mother hippo and her calf. He'd run outside red-faced with bluster, shake his fists, and threaten to fix those hippos once and for all. The hippos occasionally glanced at him like one might look at an ant on a tree, while continuing to gorge themselves. The farmer never did frighten away the hippos but his show of theatrics was a calming face saving device for him.I've had the Havahart Electronic Deer Repellent stakes posted in the front yard for a few weeks now. The hostas still live, the day lilies still bloom, and the hydrangea are still upright and untouched. Is my good fortune due to the Havahart electronic devices, to blind luck, or to other factors? I'm thinking that the Havahart Electronic Deer Repellent stakes are just decorative happenstance, but I can't be sure. If the yard escapes unscathed this season, then I may become a believer.The unimposing Chinese manufactured units are made of plastic and metal and must be assembled. An easy task except to the stakes which clip onto the stem. After some frustrating attempts to connect, I got a flat head screwdriver to push in the plastic clips and thankfully completed the assembly.Call me a skeptic, but I do have reservations about this deterrent despite the current survival of hosta and day lilies. Only three stakes come in the kit. We have two acres with desirable plants widely scattered. Where does one put the stakes? I put them where I most wanted protection and continue to spray the rest of the yard with liquid deterrents. Last year sprinkling cayenne pepper or garlic powder on my plants regularly seemed to help. But, as I do every year, I got complacent neglected the sprinkling, and my plants one morning were mere nubs.The user is advised to add drops of deer attractant to the cotton balls inserted in the tops of each unit. This must be done every week and more often if it rains. Moving the units occasionally is advised as is changing the scent of the attractant. A new supply is 13 dollars plus $4.60 postage. And , yes, I did say attractant. The strategy is to attract the deer with a strong scent in the hopes that the deer will touch the unit and get a mild shock. In the meantime the unit will take at least 15 minutes to recharge, leaving your foliage unprotected. Rain discharging the units also renders them useless.The shock sensation to this human is like a jolt of static electricity, attention getting but not frightening.Havahart tells the user at the end of its instruction sheet &#34;For EXTRA protection in your garden or flower bed you may add other repellent products such as HAVAHART liquid Deer and Rabbit Repellent.&#34;Probably the best approach is a multi-weapon approach, electrical, barrier, and chemical. I know that the four foot fence around our back yard doesn't do much to deter the deer.Update: June 15/11. Deer feasted on my daylilies last night despite the presence of the Electronic Deer Stakes and additional repellent.
B000BQRF60 Although I have been unable to see the deer getting shocked by this device it does appear to be working. I have a severe deer problem with them nibbling on just about everything I plant. I placed these by the plants that they seemed to like the most and it appears to be keeping them away from those plants. I only wish there was some king of a \"counter\" on these stakes to register how many \"hits\" there might have been. Without any way of knowing for sure I am only speculating on whether they are working or possibly the deer just moved on of their own accord. The stakes were easy to assemble and although the instructions were very brief I think they were sufficient for such a simple device. Only a review by a deer could be more objective.
B000BQRF60 I live in a rural area and have lots of deer but so far I have not been able to catch the deer messing with my \"Havahart Electronic Deer Repellent.\" I wanted to take a video but so far nothing. So I can't comment if it works but I can give a preliminary review.There are four catagories listed by the manufacturer.1. Very Effective: Suburban area. Deer density is low. Damage is mild, infrequent, unpredictable.2. Effective: Suburban area. Deer density is medium. Damage is moderate, frequent, predictable.3. Effective (if you move the unit around to the deer's pattern): Rural residential area. Deer density is medium to high. Damage is extensive, frequent, predictable.4. Not Effective: Rural. Agriculture area. Deer density is high. Damage is extreme, frequent, unpredictable.Three posts come in the box. The ground spikes are plastic as is the battery compartment on top. Everything snaps together well and seems to be well-made. However I'm not sure plastic spikes are going to hold up for very long. There are small wires on top that are battery charged to shock the deer. The cotton ball with the acorn scent goes inside a plastic \"tube\" under the metal wires. Is it enough of a jolt to keep the deer away? I don't know because I'm stupid enough to try it.If I can capture some video of the deer investigating the deer repellent unit I will post it but until then only time will tell if this works.
B000BQRF60 When I ordered this product I did not realize that it was a zapper sort of product and also did not realize I needed to be able to determine wind direction or deer migration patterns across my property. I also did not realize I would need to continually add more deer bait liquid after every rain storm or at least weekly and replace cotton balls every three weeks while moving the units every so often to prevent the deer from getting used to the product placement. I also did not realize they recommend purchasing another product in addition to this one, deer repellent for the actual gardens. I had not considered that children would need supervision while near the units to prevent shocking them and I honestly am not sure how interesting the item would be for a dog but am glad mine is a chihuahua. The poles are very short so if I had a larger dog I would be concerned, as it is I am not sure my neighbors will be pleased as they do have larger dogs that roam off leash. Perhaps a similar product could keep neighborhood dogs from using my mail box area as a waste disposal area. I think the stakes could have been taller considering the height of deer. My daughter is worried about the deer being injured, my son is threatening to taser his brother, and I am not looking forward to another item on the to do list. I am thinking we likely will not be using the product long enough to find out if it is effective at keeping the deer from eating the hosta and lilies. Was hoping this item used ultrasound but it uses a liquid deer bait that needs continual maintenance to attract the deer and a electrical shock that only works once every 15 minutes. Considering we often get deer and does at the same time and it can only shock once per 15 minutes I am not sure how effective this item will be, hopefully when one leaves the area they all follow.
B000BQRF60 Directions say limited success in rural areas with bigger deer populations..I agree.  Actually had deer walk right by the stakes when they had only been out 1 day and the \"acorn scented\" lure did nothing in attracting them.  Trying to insert cotton balls into the very small holes on the stakes were nearly impossible. What does work well is the little shock that you do get if you touch the top of stake.  Of course, then you would have to wait awile for it to repower to shock again.  On that point alone it would work on the deer. What we are going to try next is just putting all the stakes in a line to try to keep the deer from entering the area we're trying to protect.  If you have any experience at all w/deer, you know there's practically nothing they won't try to eat so you need to always think ahead when you want to plant all those pretty flowers and bushes!
B000BQRF60 I set this up near my barn,and alas the deer seemed to ignore it's effect.They still frequent the proximity of these stakes. I have tried everything,now I will feed the deer,and give up on the garden!
B000BQRF60 I've been using Havahart products for many years, mostly theircage traps for small animals. They are the leader in humane animal control. Nonetheless, it is unrealistic to expect any such product to be 100% effective, since we are dealing with a human-animal interface that involves an infinite number of possible behaviors and, therefore, outcomes. Havahart provides the most effective tools for those who do not wish to permanently harm the environment and wildlife. I have found this product to be just as effective as the cage traps I've used in the past. In other words, if all goes well, the animal responds as hoped and the problem is eliminated. However, like people, animals (especially wild animals) are capable of learning quickly if they are hungry enough. I move these stakes fairly often to keep the deer on their toes, but now and then one figures it out and enjoys a meal. C'est la vie. Keep in mind that a combination of strategies might be in order. Perhaps a partial fence or panther urine. In any case, the Havahart Electronic Deer Repellent has greatly improved my odds of harvesting food from the garden. Along with common sense, this product is highly recommended.
B000BQWP0Q Nozzle is very well made and has plenty of spray pattern options. Love the color choices!  Will be buying more.
B000BQWP0Q This is a decent, cheap nozzle. It doesn't leak and does not break easily. I bought the yellow so I could spot it in my yard easily. I did break the first one I had, but that was my fault. I was reeling it back in and the handle caught on a rock out of my line of sight. I kept reeling it in anyway, and yanking on the hose until the handle broke. I would say that under normal conditions, and even somewhat rough conditions this nozzle holds up well.
B000BQWP0Q We have gone through several products similar to this and always ended up with something that broke, leaked or otherwise didn't function very well.  We purchased several of these and put them on hoses throughout the yard.  All of them have been working great.  We have found needs for all 9 spray patterns.
B000BQWP0Q I've been frustrated with the hose nozzles I've bought because they all seem to leak.  This Dramm does NOT leak, so that makes it a five-star item in my book.  Now we'll see if it has the endurance to last an entire summer.
B000BQWP0Q I think I ended up purchasing this due to the wonderful color choices.  I chose Yellow, its super easy to see in the grass.  That's where my positive review of this product ends.  It never worked correctly from the start.  All functions worked great, except the soaker.  It sort of just squishes water out of a little bit of all of the other functions and around the edge... Comparing it to any hose nozzle I've used in the past this isn't how the soaker function is designed to work.  It wasn't hardly worth my effort to send it back.  The other (and more important to me) functions worked so I just dealt with it.  I have now had it for right about two months and I realized the little metal piece that holds the on/off grab bar on the \"on\" position is missing.  Now THAT was a function I deem essential.  I used it all the time.  I think two months is a little bit short to fall apart!  Its possible that I got a bad apple, but I wouldn't buy the identical model to replace it.  I'll try something else.
B000BQWP0Q This is replacing an all-plastic multi-spray nozzle for me, and this product seems very solid. I like the many spray patterns.
B000BQWP0Q This nozzle seemed to be well made and it worked great for a few weeks.After about 2 months of occasional use (maybe used it 4-5 times during that time), the whole nozzle started to leak water everywhere. Another reviewer mentioned that the internal components of this nozzle are made from cheap plastic and will break easily from regular use, and it seems they were right. No pressure at all on the trigger and there is water going everywhere. I just turn on the hose and immediately this nozzle starts leaking water.Don't waste your money, get something better.
B000BQWP0Q I'm very pleased with this nozzle.  It has a wide variety of patterns to choose from, but more importantly it doesn't leak.  I can't stand it when nozzles leak.  I liked this one so much I ordered another one for a different hose.
B000BQWP0Q This is a good quality nozzle. I don't use nearly all the spraying functions, but all 9 are unique so it's not like you have only 2-3 real variations.
B000BQWP0Q Great garden sprayer! It features many spray patterns and has an extremely comfortable grip, the only fault I can find with it is that it feels as if its made out of a fairly cheap plastic. That really wasnt worth dinging it a star because it comes at such a low price and despite this, it works perfectly every time.
B000BQWP0Q Where I live, the water is soft and the problems started happening shortly after I purchased this product.  No matter how I attempted to adjust the spray pattern, it started to drip from the nozzle.This disappointed me greatly because the sprayer appeared to be well constructed, with heavy materials.  I also must admit I was a sucker for the great color.
B000BQWP0Q So many different patterns I have a tough time deciding what I want to use when I water my garden.  I have had it for a few months now and nothing has gone wrong quite yet.  I do disconnect it from the hose after each use.  Great product I would definately get another down the road for a spare of if it breaks.
B000BQWP0Q When I turn the water on, the nozzle starts spraying water, without me touching it or pushing the handle. Today I wanted to wash my yard, I left the hose with the nozzle on the floor until I turned the water on. By the time I got to the hose, the water coming out from the nozzle soaked my coffee table in the living room through the screen door that was closed. The water on the nozzle is always on until I turn off the water supply. This is totally unacceptable.
B000BQWP0Q I'll admit it. I was a sucker for the cool display and for those wild colors. And the truth is I really didn't need another hose nozzle because there are plenty of them lying around the house. After looking at these nozzles for weeks I finally scratched the itch, using an Ace discount coupon as my excuse.We've only been together a few weeks, my nozzle and I, but the honeymoon is far from over. I like the looks of the DRAMM, the feel, and the performance. All of the spray patterns work well, and so far there has been none of the inevitable leaking from this fancy nozzle. The DRAMM replaces a recently bought Nelson; I like the DRAMM more because of the additional spray patterns and the distance and spread achieved with the DRAMM.Even Mrs. Spudman, who could only roll her eyes when I came home with yet another nose nozzle, is smitten with the DRAMM also. She even gave me an unsolicited endorsement of my new garden toy, an unusual occurence for her. In fact, we both like our boldly colored DRAMM so much, I see a new DRAMM for us in the near future for our other hose.BUT - This beauty does have one flaw though. It can be tiresome to squeeze the handle for an extended period of time. This is why many nozzles have the little mechanism in the rear that keeps the handle from springing back to the closed position. On this nozzle the mechanism doesn't work smoothly and for this user is more trouble than it's worth. Thus four stars.
B000BQWP0Q This nozzle is just great! I have paired it with the &#34;Pocket Hose&#34;. (You know, the one that expands...). It works great! I especially love the multiple settings like &#34;Jet&#34; (shoots a hard solid stream - ideal for washing cars), &#34;Shower&#34; (seems just right for watering plants) and &#34;Mist&#34; (perfect for delicate plants). It's plastic but seems pretty durable so far.
B000BQWP0Q About the only complaint I have with this nozzle is that the &#34;shower&#34; setting is not as good as the &#34;shower&#34; setting on my other nozzle. It is simply too spread out to use on specific small plants, even when I reduce the water flow using the handle.
B000BQY7XO For the price this spreader works fine for yards. It is a little small and requires frequent fillings though. Good pricing.
B000BQY7XO I needed a way to spread grass seed and living in a town home, have a small area that is available to grow grass .  This spreader did the trick, it's hand held and easy to use.  My grass looks great.
B000BQY7XO I live in a town home with a very small grassy area.  I'm not supposed to have to maintain my lawn, but the landscapers don't seem to care if they're mowing crab grass or regular grass.  I do, so I pulled out the crab grass and used this to spread the seed for new grass.  I didn't have any problems with it jamming, and the seed spread evenly.
B000BQY7XO OI prefer to have control over where my fertilizer goes - so I like the hand spreader.  My yard is about 10,000 sq feet - so not too difficult to fertilize by hand.  Love Scott's products!
B000BQY7XO This spreader is a great deal, much much cheaper than in the brick and mortar stores. It looses one star because from time to time it jams. But for the price I can forgive that and only deduct one star.
B000BQY7XO I bought this and a bag of Scotts grass seed to cover an area of my back yard that was recently regraded after construction.  The spreader worked OK for the first few minutes, then became harder and harder to crank. Too much friction for the plastic parts maybe. I'm glad the space I had to cover wasn't any larger. What a pain. I could have done just about as well  pitching handfuls from the bag. I think I wasted my money.
B000BQY7XO Works well I used it last Friday to put down some new lawn seed.. Then some simple old 10-10-10 fertilizer
B000BQY7XO This is so helpful with fertilizers in small spaces and Preen for flowerbeds. Easy to use, easy to figure out.
B000BQYB0S This is my twelfth season for using this tiller.  To prepare my garden I use an ancient Troy built that has been going strong for about 18 years now (I bought it used) and it looks as if this Mantis two stroke is going to last just as long.  To be honest, I am a rather lazy gardener and the job of all jobs I hate most is cultivating and weeding.  This little machine has taken away almost all of the excuses I have for not having a neat, well tended garden.  There are a couple of things you should know though before purchasing this little gem:First, this is not a machine that is suitable for breaking up new ground or ground that has not been tilled for several years.  It simply is not built for that.Secondly, you should not let your mind wonder when using this cultivator.  It can take out a garden plant in a flash if you loose control over it and indeed, if you are extremely inattentive, it certainly has the capability of taking off a toe or two.Thirdly:  I would strongly recommend you use gloves when using this for any extended period of time.  They give you protection of course, but they also allow for a better grip, ergo, more control.Forth:  Try to avoid running in through bailing twine, wire or even vines if possible.  Getting the stuff untangled is truly a odious task.Fifth:  Perform the preventive maintenance on it as recommended and then double the timing on it.  Keep the tines sharp and keep them replaced as needed. (Yes, the tines are guaranteed against breakage, but I promise you that they will bend if bounced off enough rocks...hey, I live in the Ozarks, rocks I know!)Sixth:  Watch out for larger rocks.  Not only can the bend tines, but they can cause the machine to go out of control.Seventh:  Watch and take great care with your gas/oil mix and at the end of the season follow the directions as to winter storage.Now that being said, this thing is a snap to use.  As a matter of fact it can easily be handled by a knowledgably and trained child with very little supervision.  It can go into places a larger tiller cannot possibly go.  It is light and is very easy to maneuver once you get the hang of it.  Now I admit that I am a complete and absolute klutz when it comes to fixing anything mechanical (well, truth be told, non-mechanical things too), but I have had to take this into the shop only once in the years I have owned and used it.  Everything else I was able to fix myself using only the manual provided, and over the past couple of years a few sites on my computer.  No fancy tools are needed; only the ability to read and a smudge of common sense. Hey, trust me, if I can do it, then just about anyone can.  I mean we are talking here about someone so inept that my wife use to have to put the children's Christmas toys together as I could not manage it.I am like another reviewer here.  I doubt if I would still be gardening, vegetable and flowers, if I did not have this cultivator.  If and when it finally goes belly up (which will probably be long after I go first), I plan to purchase another.  I do wish I could give this one more than five stars.Don BlankenshipThe Ozarks
B000BQYB0S I have owned my Mantis tiller for nearly 8 years now.  I chose Mantis because I wanted a smaller tiller that did not require a lot of storage space.  I also liked what I saw on tv commercials about the Mantis.  My father had a much larger tiller of another brand that took up a lot of space and was incredibly heavy (but quite sturdy).  He was going to give me his tiller when he stopped gardening, but after thinking long and hard about it, I decided to get the Mantis instead. Here is what I have learned about the Mantis in that time:1.  Mechanical:  The tiller works great, starts in 2-3 pulls right out of the box.  It takes mixed gas at a 50/1 ratio.  Never use \"old\" gas or gas that is not the proper ratio.  Over the years I have had some minor problems with it, mostly related to starting and idling.  My recommendation is to clean or change the air filter regularly.  The filter is easy to get at and oftentimes clogs with dirt and dust.  Change spark plug every couple years.  When putting the tiller \"to sleep\" for the winter, take out the spark plug and pour in a teaspoon of motor oil.  Pull the start recoil and distribute the oil in the cylinder.  I have not had any major problems with the tiller.  I just finished an hour of tilling today and it ran great.  Final tip: clean the accumulated weeds off the tiller tines when they begin to accumulate.  This reduces the stress on the motor.  The blades are faily easy to remove, clan, and return to place - it will prolong the life of the tiller.  Since the Mantis has a smaller engine, it cannot be overstressed.  To compensaate for the smaller engine size, the tiller has extremely sharp blades and they spin very fast.  The engine does not have much torque however, and the engine will bog down in heavy jobs.  The engine will stop if rocks lodge in the tines. If your garden space has a lot of rocks, this is probably not the tiller for you.2.  Functional:  The tiller is lightweight and works best in smaller gardens, although it will work in a large garden too if the soil is lighter.  I like how it can be manipulated with ease around plants and through smaller narrow rows (which a larger tiller cannot do).  I am able to plant rows of vegetables closer together with the Mantis and till around them with ease.  Perhaps most importantly, the Mantis tiller will not work well in heavy soils (with lots of clay).  I experienced this firsthand.  In heavy soils, the tiller cannot penetrate the compacted hard soil and just skims the surface.  I found I had to spade up the heavy soil with a shovel and then till the clumps.  A heavier tiller would have handled the clay soil, so if your soil is compacted and full of clay, this is not the tiller for those conditions.  On the other hand, in lighter soils, the tiller goes through the soil just as depicted on tv.  Excellent tiller for sandy loose soils. The tiller is only about 20 pounds.  It stores easily in most sheds and doe not require a dedicated shed as a large tiller.  Very portable!3.  Overall:  Overall performance is in the 3-star range, mostly because of the limitations of use in clay/havy soils.I do recommend this tiller for the gardener who has a smaller garden, wants to set plantings closer together, and has lighter soil.  I'd recommend a larger heavier tiller for larger gardens or gardens with heavy soil.  As Clint Eastwood said in \"Magnum Force\": \"A man's got to know his limitations\".  Same case with this tiller.  If you don't try to do too much with it, and know what it can handle (and can't), I think you will be pleased with the Mantis tiller.konedog
B000BQYB0S I'm pleased with the performance of the Mantis 7225, however it doesn't have the power to start a garden from scratch -- for example, if you had a patch of lawn you wanted to turn into a garden. The blades get clogged with grass very fast and you have to remove them and clean them off. You can do it, it just takes a very long time. It also doesn't do well in wet or damp soil.However, it is excellent for existing gardens, to either weed in-between rows or re-till for replanting. I use it to mix in fresh garden soil and to get rid of weeds mainly.Not a ton of power but it is light-weight (20 pounds) and easy to use, though you have to walk backward to use it best. Also, because it is a two-stroke engine, you need to mix the gas with 2-stroke oil which can be a pain.
B000BQYB0S I purchased this tiller from Amazon a few days ago. I watched the instruction DVD that came with the package. Starting the tiller for the first time seems so easy according to the DVD. Today I tried that. It wasn't easy!Here is my story starting it for the first time.(1) Use gloves. Your finger may get some blisters without it.(2) Go to hardware store and buy spark plug wrench. The spark plug was overly tightened at the factory. I used a rubber hammer to open it.(3) The problem that the engine did not start was because of wet spark plug. I had to clean it with a rag several times.(4) It did start for 3 seconds then stopped. Try again.(5) Then it started to 10 seconds then stopped. Pull it again.(6) It started for 1 minute then stopped. Keep trying.(7) Then it started for 2 minutes. I finally run the tines. Wow! it was a powerful little machine.It may take a while on a hard or heavy soil like mine but it is capable to till such soil. It was doing a fine job on my garden.I have a cover crop planted on two 4 x 10 feet raised bed. I was thinking to rototill the cover crop. It didn't work. The plant was very long and stuck on the tine causing it not spinning. I have to take the tines apart to be able to reach the tangled plants in the middle.I gave it 4 starts because it was doing good job but difficult to start for the first time.Update 9/23/2012I used it to rototill 8x14 area yesterday. I was so surprised. It ran with 2 or 3 pull. It was doing a great job yesterday.
B000BQYB0S I have had a Mantis tiller since1990 and it was time to get a new one.  The old one did not have a way to pump the fuel into the carborator and this one does.  The main problem with this tiller is keeping the dirt out of the carborator.  Every time you use this tiller I would remove the air filter and clean it and around the carborator.  I use it in rocky soil and rocks do bind up the blades but you can easily remove the rocks.  It will dig right through weeds and will dig deep to make a garden.
B000BQYB0S I had a Bolens that cost 200.00&lasted; one season,no fault of my own.MTD(Bolens)explained various reasons,but read the reviews(Lowes)and you will find 271 reviews citing the same stuttering pull cord starter and/or inoperable next season(new carb kit is the 45.00fix) but hard to pull(recoils)anyway.Got an electric Toro ,like a blender in a sandbox!Cord is a nusance.Took it back the next day. Finally decided to pony up my ante & choose between the Stihl Yard Boss&Mantis;, plain old 2cyle tiller/cultivator.I chose the Mantis because my mother- in- law had one 30 years ago&I; thought it worked fine,but too expensive.Turns out the Mantis can convert to a hedge trimmer!And all the stuff the Stihl can convert to for about 100.00 less.(I owm a Stihl weedeater & chain saw and they are great,probably the best (all the previous,albeit cheaper tools are in-op or a back-up)But the Mantis is everything.I live on a farm,put in raised beds,tried it out in the wetlands(after weedwacking the ground to the bone)it worked great! Next & final test was to till hard ground that was barren weeds,to put in ground cover landscaping. THIS MANTIS TORE UP THE CLAY AND WEEDS LIKE IT WAS A REAR TILLER MACHINE)Tines have a LIFETIME guarantee&the; Mantis itself has a great warranty.It is so easy to pull start,tines convert from tiller to cultivator by reversing them ,so you can go 3 inches or 8 inches deep in a minute!(pull the carter pin)I am one happy gardener&landscaper.There; really is nothing to compare for 300.00!
B000BQYB0S This is really a rather odd little machine.  I have had one for three years now and have had very few problems with mine.  I grant you that it is a bit difficult to get started now and then but we usually get things worked out.  If I keep it turned-up and keep fresh gas available and not let gas set in the tank too long or put old gas in, then I find I have fewer problems.This tiller does what I pay it to do which is cultivate between the rows of both vegetable and flowers.  It is NOT built to completely till a garden.  I am pretty happy with mine.I have a close friend who also has one of these. He likes his too.On the other hand, I have a friend who considers her Mantis be biggest hunk of junk she was ever talked into buying (She is still a bit peeved at me I fear), and uses terrible language when talking about it.  I have tried working with her particular machine...I treat it like I treat mine but I have to tell you and tell you truthfully...the one she has is indeed a \"bad egg.\"  I am not sure if the people who make these things have quality control issues or what but there does seem to be a big lack of consistency here.  I note, after reading all of the reviews here, there this is likely truer than I though.  Some folks here are having a wretched time; others love theirs.  I can well believe both sides of the issue because I have observed this in real life when it comes to using this machine.Go figure.....
B000BWFESU This rat zapper works good by killing small or larger mice and rats. Only thing is that you cannot depend on the blinking light to let you know if there is a kill in it or not. First kill i got, no light was blinking. Then one night i go to check it and the light was blinking but nothing inside. So it's best to pick it up and look inside, that way you know for sure if you got a kill or not.
B000BWFESU This would maybe be 3 stars if it worked outdoors, but I would not chance it!  It has a very cheap build for the cost and has the electric switch and electronics on top, exposed to weather, so I would not want to use it outdoors (as I had intended).  I bought a simple Haveaheart trap and sent this back.  If you intend it for indoors, it would work probably fine, but it still looks cheap for the price.  I just was unimpressed.
B000BWFESU Shortly after moving into our farm house in the woods,  I noticed a lot of  mouse in the house. I placed this in a corner  with a piece of bread and cheese in it and within a few minutes, I had a dead mouse inside. A year later it still works great. During the fall season, they come running into my house looking for a warm place. This zipper kills them daily. I am very pleased.
B000BWFESU Worth noting: I have the \"older\" model - the silver one.I initially tried to use this when temps were 30 degrees and below and it just doesn't work. I have changed the batteries this spring and have already caught two pests in one week - a mouse and a chipmunk. We have chipmunks and I'm starting to see new holes in the yard. I initially struggled using this product since I am an animal lover, but my yard is getting wrecked and I'm tired of having all my hard work get destroyed. I also also tired of large amounts of poop in my garage, all over my shelving.This unit is very easy to use - though I really wish the back had an opening. I'm always so paranoid to stick my hand in there to load the bait, even with the item turned off. I take out a battery when I load the bait, just to be sure I don't get zapped. LOL A \"back door\" that opened for easy bait loading would be much appreciated! I'm using peanut butter as bait.I do like that this kills the pest quickly, humanely and cleanly. There's no blood, etc. Just tip the device into a yard waste bag and load bat again. I was doing the catch and release method with Havahart, but got tired of giving chipmunks a ride to the local park, wasting gas and time.For the money, I'm happy! Easy to use, easy to set and works well. Love the blinking red light telling you you've got a catch!Update 06/19/2011: we're catching one chipmunk a day now! I can't believe how well this works. Current chippy count: 5.
B000BWFESU Oy Vey... I wish I were able to write a great review of this item!I purchased two of these units and was excited that they will exterminate both mice and rats based on manufacturer description.Well, the mice run in and out, leaving a trail of dog food... then chicken feed and whatever else I baited it with.  The unit turns on, the green light blinks... it's \"ready\"One of the units was placed in a high traffic mouse area, near where I keep chicken feed.  Until I actually watched a mouse run out of it when I came in this afternoon, I was wondering if they truly were entering the unit and apparently, yes, they are indeed.These are meadow mice and they seem to scamper in without landing on both plates at once, thus escaping the \"zapper\".  The units are expensive, so this was more than annoying... you know, being foiled by a bunch of feed snatching mice =';'=We have rats that will surface as spring comes along in full force, so I am hoping they will live up to their rat-zapping reputation.  I am running a completely organic operation here, so poisons are out of the question.  Mice have visited both traps for months now and with no harm coming to a single one of them.Used brand new batteries, units were new out of the box, clean and properly installed, on each unit, the green light comes on when switched on appearing ready to do business...  then, the mice come and help themselves to the free, expensive, new kitchen I've put out...Sorry... just not living up to the write up here.  Maybe a regular house mouse will stand on both plates for you?I hope someone else has better luck, I'm going back to old fashioned wood mouse traps for the little critters...
B000BWFESU We get citrus rats on occasion.  They come because some neighbors refuse to clean up their fallen fruit.  I can honestly say, there a couple less happy rats in our area.  This unit needs to be checked often for batteries, but, other than that, it works.  Ask any dead rats you may know.
B000BWFESU This rat zapper is awesome! I live in the city so of course there are going to be rats! They are so big the damn cats in the neighborhood won't do anything about it. I noticed a rat in my trash can, so that is when I bought the ultra rat zapper. I have probably killed 15 rats. I use dry dog food and sometimes I will put a little bit of peanut butter on a small piece of paper towel and put it inside the trap.
B000BWFESU For two days, I've giggled with glee upon seeing the unit's flashing red light of SUCCESS. That was until I kept coming up EMPTY and disappointed the bugger got a free meal. I've reset and refilled with a few dog kibble about 10 times and zapped NOTHING! I've been dry toweling the plates after every 3 entry and departures to avoid dirty build up that could impede the powerful, much desired RAT DEATH RAY.After attempting to access the Ratzpper.com website which is UNAVAILABLE, I called the 1888-DEAD-RAT several hours ago without a callback. Now those furry critters are catching a break until I get sturdy traps and toxic waste disposal gloves. I HATE mice, rats & most icky rodents and have no plans to continue running a fine dining establishment for them.This contraption is too blankity-blank expensive to be a bust. In case you haven't guessed it, I DO NOT RECOMMEND this thing!PS CALL Amazon Customer Service if purchased through them for a refund.UPDATE 1/22/2013A smart and pleasant Technical Support person from Raticator called with helpful hints. Having a moist cloth/paper towel leading to the front of the Ratzapper acts as a WELCOME MAT to a \"shocking experience\" when the critter makes contact with the metal plates inside. The Raticator company provides support temporarily for Ratzapper which is no longer produced. With that in mind, you need to consider that when getting a Ratzapper. Getting a refund and finding a consistently working pest eliminator is my goal.
B000BWFESU I had a rat in my basement which was chewing up wiring, tear out insulation, and leaving large droppings around. We had been storing food stuff like extra ketchup bottles and boxes of cereal on a shelf in the basement when we found them chewed into and ruined by a rat several months ago. I tried several different types of rat traps at first with no luck. It would eat the bait off the trip lever or ignore the trap altogether. I put a piece of dog food in the rat zapper and a couple of pieces on the outside of it and placed it in an area I though the rat frequented because of the insulation and droppings in that area. It sat there for a couple of weeks with nothing happening. Then one day I saw the red eyes alternately blinking on the optional tale tell remote alert accessory for this trap and bingo! I looked up on the foundation wall where I had placed the rat zapper and yes, there was a very long tail hanging out of it!!! I took several pictures of it and added them to the item pictures on this product page.This trap is a lot more expensive than basic traps, but I love the fact that all I had to do was dump the dead rat out without any mess or smell what so ever. I put some new dog food in and around the trap and put it back where I had it before. It was that simple. I can see that this was indeed a large rat! I consider the money well spent. I don't have to worry about the damage to our house and wasted food anymore! I would highly recommend this product to anyone with rat problems! Thanks Rat Zapper!
B000BWFESU Be patient and try cheddar cheese.  Our story: I kinda felt bad about killing the little buggers, but they had been eating our tomatoes and pestering our pets. THEY HAD TO GO. Being the soft-hearted person I am, I felt mechanical traps had the potential of being cruel, as did rat poisons (never mind the smell of decaying rat bodies), and we don't have a pet store who would take trapped rats as snake food because they were wild. It took over a week for the first kill. We were watching and saw the rat enter the trap. He/she simply died. No death throes. No sparks. No smoke. Just sudden, instantaneous death. The rat's tail didn't even so much as twitch. If you have problems getting your rats to go inside, you must be patient. Ours went after cheddar cheese chunks--not peanut butter, not bananas, not tomatoes, not dog food, not chicken, not sunflower seeds, not even oatmeal. Try to touch the bait as little as possible. Try setting a big chunk in the very back of the chamber and a smaller one just in front of the zapper pad. Then just walk away. Just walk away. Leave it alone. Don't move it, don't touch it, don't breathe on it. The red light will flash when you need to check it. Although I still feel bad about killing the little critters, I have no doubt that they didn't even know what hit them.
B000BWFESU It took 3 weeks to catch anything. I tried different baits, etc., until one particular type of dog food worked. I'm still experimenting, and will post back when I find out what works best for me. I was all set to return this, because I thought it did not work. The green light stays lit for only a couple of seconds and then shuts off, but the unit is LIVE so be careful. I have caught three mice in my attic in the last week and I think that it is the different \"bait\" that I am placing into the unit. D batteries make this heavy, which is good. I can't tell you how nice it is to see the red blinking light! And then when you see the little vermin laying there so peacefully....well, the first time I was afraid the little critter was just sleeping. It's a big difference than using the other old-fashioned traps. It certainly seems more humane. The only problem I can see is trying to clean the inside (if you tried to use peanut butter, or something similar). This is pretty close to five stars, and as long as it has some longevity to it, I am very pleased. It is easily portable and you don't have to worry about something wacking your fingers! This should certainly not be placed where a child can get to it or throw something into it (I don't know what would happen, and will not try it, but I don't think it would be good). I would keep it away from any place that can get wet as well. Use nitrile (or latex) gloves when handling/baiting the unit to keep your scent off of it. Also, keep it away from where a pet can get to it! I suspect a ferret or cat may not do too well trying to get the bait. If you don't get something after trying different baits, try moving the unit to another location. I also rubbed the bait on the front of the unit to try to give it more \"scent.\"
B000BWFESU It was one thing when the desert rodents were eating the plants I just bought from the nursery (See my review for the Havaheart). I figured, we'll just live with it, find some plants they don't like to eat, and keep catching and releasing miles away. It was quite another thing when they moved in to the F-150 and the station wagon. Woodrats lose all vestiges of cuteness when you find a pile of twigs and poop on top of your engine. So far, luckily, no chewed up wires.This product works. For us, it doesn't even need bait. We just set it out and flip the switch. One time it only took 15 minutes to catch a ground squirrel.We freeze the bodies for my brother's boa constrictor. She's better fed now than she has been in a long time. And we also intentionally invite coyotes and bobcats to come for a free snack out in the middle of the driveway. (I'd much rather have them hunt my ground squirrel problem away.)We've caught mice, woodrats and several antelope ground squirrels. The kangaroo rats and lizards aren't interested in it. Now, if I could just get that long-tailed \"city\" squirrel that's not native -- maybe if I bait it with some KFC.
B000BWFESU **Update**  January 2011:  We've owned this Rat Zapper Ultra for 2.5 years and it still works great.  It's zapped about 3 dozen mice using 2 sets of batteries.  I've cleaned it once per the manufacturer's directions (it had dried mouse pee in it, yuck).  Thought this update would be helpful to those of you wondering about the longevity of the Zapper Ultra... we're very happy with it.**Original review**Our house was new when we moved in but it had sat on the market for a year, empty.  This apparently gave mice ample opportunity to move in and they chose the area under the jet tub in the master bathroom as their home.  We can access that area by the little cabinet doors under the tub, and that's how I discovered the rodent poo scattered all over.I didn't want my husband to have to deal with the rodents... I wanted to take care of the problem myself.  So, traditional traps were out of the question, I knew I wouldn't be able to deal with the sight of a dead mouse in a trap.  We have a dog, so poisons were out of the question, plus I didn't want a mouse crawling off to die and rot somewhere in my house.  I didn't want a cat, because with my luck it'd be the Garfield of all cats..  I think there are also sticky traps that trap the mouse and let you release it while it's alive, but I didn't think I could handle that either, a frantic mouse having to be carried outside, only to have it return later to our bathroom.I ended up buying the Rat Zapper Ultra online directly from the maker.  At the time, I didn't know what kind of rodent we had so I got the Ultra, just in case they were giant rats or squirrels.  For mice it's probably overkill, but I'm fine with that.It arrived within the week, and I didn't tell my husband how much I paid for it because if it didn't work to catch the rodents, my husband would give me the stink-eye for paying more than $5 for a mouse-trap.  I set it up that night under the tub, putting a piece of the included dog food in the trap and turning it on.  (It was safe from the dog because it was behind cabinet doors that my dog can't open.)I got the first mouse around 8pm, only a couple hours after I set up the Rat Zapper.  I turned it off, picked up the trap and carried it outside to the woods around our house, and slid the mouse (and piece of dog food.... I didn't reuse it!) out onto the ground.  I didn't have to look at the little dude, a bonus of using this trap, but I did look because I wanted to see what kind of rodent it was.  It was a little mouse.This was repeated the next two nights.  Around 8pm, I'd catch a mouse in the Rat Zapper.  A total of 3 mice, and no more.  The mice were gone, baby, gone.  I keep the Zapper in that cabinet, turned on, just in case a new mouse family moves in.So, I was very happy and far too proud of myself for dealing with the mice without my husband's help.  He was happy that the $50 mousetrap worked so well and so quickly, and that pest control was now a chore that his darling wife (me!) could handle.Highly recommend the Rat Zapper Ultra, especially if you happen to be squeamish about other rodent-trapping methods.  Even if you're not squeamish, it was a very effective way of getting rid of rodents, there was no way they were getting out of that trap with the piece of dog food.
B000BWFESU I knew I had something in my attic, but didn't know if it was a rat or a mouse, and whatever it was was very good at stealing peanut butter from the traditional spring traps I was using.  Despite the high price, I bought The Rat Zapper because it was the only product I could find here that said it worked for rats AND mice (and squirrels too).  All other traps seemed to be designed for one or the other, and I wasn't sure what I had.I read the very thorough and useful instructions that came with it, and used dry dog food for bait (it even came with a small bag of dog food). I was a bit disappointed after not catching anything for two weeks, but two weeks after setting it I caught a huge rat.  I believe it took so long because I didn't fully follow the instructions and put it in the middle of my attic instead of against a wall. Also, rats are much more clever than mice and you have to just leave the Zapper up there for awhile and not touch it so they become used to it.I have since caught 3 more rats and catch one about every two weeks.  The first catch had a very small bit of blood, but since then I just empty the Zapper into a plastic bag and reset it.  No mess and no hassle of having to drive 5 miles away and set a rat free.  I have been using it for 6 weeks and haven't had to change the batteries yet.I strongly recommend that anyone who plans to use this in an attic or out of the way area purchaseThe Rat Taleto go with it. It is a small device with a very long cord that plugs into the zapper and flashes whenever the Zapper has caught something.  I hang mine below my attic and that way I don't have to check the Zapper every day because it will let me know when I've caught something.
B000BWFESU One of our barns had become home to a rat, the evidence was in the droppings I would find. This was especially worrying as it appeared to have used the insulation I put in our well house room as its home. Droppings had fallen on top of the water softener tank. Had I not noticed them they could easily have fallen in to the brine tank when I topped up the salt pellets. That could have introduced potentially hazardous water to our family home.I set the trap about 6 weeks ago and had no success. The user manual suggested I used dried nuts as bait.Last week the wife made a delicious peach pie using fruit from this years peach harvest. I decided to take a small piece of the pie crust with a little peach filling on it and replace the nuts with it.The very next day my unwelcome guest met his demise.I had placed the trap up high in the barn, on one of the main beams that runs the length of one of the walls. I'd seen the furry squatter use this beam as a way to traverse the barn out of harms reach. Checking the trap at night with the barn lights off means the flashing \"rat zapped\" light reflects on the roof of the barn and saved me having to disturb it.It definitely does its job. The only thing I can add is to chose your bait wisely. Some items obviously work better than others.The kill is quick, clean, and humane. The rat will not die slowly from poisoning, or in agony with a limb trapped in a manual trap.The potential for introducing disease in to my families home, gnawing on electrical cables in the barn, and other acts of damage, meant we had to get rid of this little guy. Trapping and releasing him was not an option, he would just breed and add to the population. A quick kill solved the problem.The zapper is back in place right now, ready for the next unwelcome guest.
B000BWY3OQ I first discovered this product last summer when some of my plants were attacked by an unknown bug that made holes in all the foliage. So I purchased this and it did the trick, the plants it hit the worst I cut to the ground and poured this mixture diluted on the entire area. The plants re-emerged and were not bothered the rest of the season. Also kept caterpillars off my Hibiscus and my echinacea and many others. Highly recommend.
B000BWY3OQ Spinosad is really quite revolutionary (I suggest doing a wikipedia search, so you know EXACTLY what you are getting).It is completely harmless to pets, children, and plants. Unlike many pesticides you can spray this heavily on leaves and roots with zero negative effects. It works wonders on most insects.One note of caution: after being mixed with water it is only effective for 24 hours, so only mix as much as you will need per application. Anything left over will be waste. This bottle is a concentrate that will last you a very, very, very long time.Even kept in a dark, cool environment the concentrate in this bottle will only last 2 years, so you may want to get a slightly smaller quantity, but it was a perfect amount for me as I have a food forest and permaculture garden,
B000BWY3OQ When the garden shows signs of leaves being eaten, or other pest evidence, a shot of this does the job to get rid of them.
B000BWY3OQ Spinosad (pronounced spin-OH-sid) is a somewhat new organic spray out on the market, brewed from, of all things, a soil bacteria found underneath an abandoned rum distillery in the Caribbean.Spinosad is extremely effective, yet it's only mildly toxic to humans and birds. I use it to get rid of thrips primarily, but it kills leafminers and spider mites too. It also kills caterpillars for about a month after spraying, so if you're trying to attract butterflies to your garden, don't use this around any plants that caterpillars like to eat.Spray early in the morning before bees come out, as spinosad spray is toxic to honeybees while wet.
B000BWY3OQ This is fine if you don't have a major bug problem like I do on my one and one-half acres.  It is environmentally friendly, which is a plus, but it does not kill the bugs as effectively as the more poisonous sprays.
B000BWY3OQ This product just plain WORKS -- I have fought leaf miners for several years in my tomatoes, basil and some of the flowers, this year I tried this product.  My problem is down at least 90% only the petunias are not responding as well as other plants, but still problem is down at about 75%.  It also has rid me of spider mites and aphids, so i don't have to spray for them on the roses.  I even have had great luck using it on roses when mixed with Bonide FungOnil, putting recommended amount of BOTH in my sprayer and completing two tasks at same time.  I highly recommend Monterey's Sipnosad.
B000BWY3OQ Sourced from a bacterium (S. Spinosa), spinosad is a great pesticide used for a wide variety of pests. It is considered organic and approved for organic use. It is considered to be highly safe for human use. Supposedly it also shows low or no toxicity to honeybees in studies, but I won't use it on any of my plants while they are flowering, just to be safe.I generally reapply it every few weeks.
B000BWY3OQ I finally managed to get rid of the ants that were living in my garden for the past 3 yrs.  Ants kept taking residence in my garden and since I stick with organic practices, I didn't have many options.  Tried growing things that the ants didn't like and boiling water.  They just kept coming back.  This insect spray is OMRI listed, so I filled a sprayer and sprayed the ant hills and drenched the soil in that portion of the garden.  Its been several weeks now and no more ants.Just be careful how you apply this stuff.  It can be harmful to beneficial insects as well (ladybugs, bees, etc.).
B000BWY3OQ My only problem was being consistent with follow-up sprays.  This stuff really works!  I use it in my greenhouse and this container still has about a quarter of a bottle left with no more signs of thrips.  My plants recovered and started bearing again.  Good stuff!
B000BWY49A Can't beat the price and still get a decent metal rake. Tried a cheaper plastic one from the local Lowes and it was trash. This is much better and only a couple dollars more. Shipped to me in a HUGE box, but well packed in. Hopefully the person packing yours has access to a smaller box though. Seriously, two bodies would have fit in the box this thing shipped in.
B000BWY49A I won't lie, I have never used the rake, but my husband absolutely loves it and says its the best rake he's ever used. It is so easily adjustable to either have a tight small fan or wide fan area and is of sturdy good quality. Would buy again.
B000BWY49A I hide this rake in my greenhouse so no one else in my house takes it and I always know where it is. It's the only one I want to use. I love this rake. I can use it for whatever raking job I need to do because I can change the size of the rake head so quickly. Plus this isn't expensive!
B000BWY49A This thing is amazing! Made of steel, very durable and incredibly versatile. It opens as wide as 22 inches for when raking leaves on your lawn, drive-way, etc. and the best, which was freaking great, it closes to 7 inches, which helped a GREAT deal when raking leaves from the street curb.This rake is light, manageable and very easy to use. I didn't experience is strain or felt tired while using it. A great tool that I promise you won't regret buying. I loved it so much, I gave one to a co-worker and my in-laws. Trust me, you won't need another rake again.
B000BWY49A Love the collapsable feature on this rake and that you can get any size needed for the job.  Sometimes, the prongs of the rake get bent weirdly and you have to struggle a bit to close the rake, but otherwise has been great.  Even at its largest setting it isn't super big so if you have a big job on your hands you may want to get a different rake, but for most people I'm sure it'll be just fine!
B000BWY49A A few years ago I had gone to Pennsylvania for a garden show and purchased this rake.  We love it so much, my husband and I fight over it.  So, I bought another one.  You think that would have done it.  No....now my daughter-in-law wants one.  It's the best rake ever.
B000BWY49A Was a good buy.  Perfect for the use I needed it for.  Love being able to adjust it, great for using around flower beds, fences, etc.  Was stronger than I expected, which is good.  Metal tines have held up nicely, but do tend to get clogged with leaves very quickly.  It is strong enough and sharp enough it can actually do some minor dethatching.  If you have a medium to large yard with lots of leaves, get something larger.
B000BWY49A Love the adjust-ability but it was kind of stuck when I first tried it and I actually had to old the rake in my hand and use my feet to give it a push to unstick it - after that it adjusted just fine and on the fly which is very very handy. I'd never hear of an adjustable rake but when checking Amazon this came up high in the search and I chose it after a quick comparison of a few models and am glad I did, this is so much better than a regular rake, it is several rakes on one. I just wonder if the plastic lever lock will last so one star reduced for the plastic.
B000BWY8KK This year my mom had graciously planted sunflowers for me in the garden. The plan was to cut them a day after they bloomed. However, the deer were faster! They first ate the sunflowers when they were first sprouting, and then again when the flowers appeared and opened up.Although I appreciate the deers' plight and of humans destroying their habitat, I also didn't want to lose any more sunflowers. Thus, I used the Deer Off -- this product works! The curious thing about the product is the label though. The active \"natural\" red pepper ingredients that are listed only make up about 4% of the concentrate. What are the remaining 95%? The company doesn't seem to want to share that information on its labels. I will say that my dog ignores the part of the yard where the sunflowers are growing and the areas that's been sprayed. I have kind of been reluctant to take him there anyway (despite the fact that Deer Off is supposed to be safe for pets, I'd rather not risk it).As of about three weeks, I haven't seen any more deer and the sunflowers live. Instead of cutting them though, I've let them bloom. Maybe the deer will come back for them, but it seems like they are being repelled by the Deer Off.
B000BWY8KK This spray, mixed as directed, will keep squirrels away for at least 30 days even with rain (but the area dry when sprayed).  There are no deer or rabbits in my area but with neighbors feeding squirrels they are over-populating this small neighborhood.  Squirrels dig up plantings all around my home and \"plant\" their peanuts in my garden pots.  They also run along the top of the fence, teasing my dog, jump onto the roof where they shell the peanuts leaving the hulls in the gutters.  By spraying the top of my wood fences the squirrels stay off of them, and don't get to the roof.  I even spray the fence in the winter when it is fairly dry and it seems to continue working.  I want to try spraying it on landscaped areas where I would prefer my dog stay out.  If that works, I'll be back in a month with an update.  This is a product I will definitely continue using!!
B000BWY8KK Our biggest problems are a plague of rabbits, and the occasional deer.In the past, the Deer Off sprayer has worked well for me, so I was looking forward to trying out their concentrate. So far, I'm happy to note that it seems to be doing something right - our previously inflicted damage has not worsened.However, as this is a product whose effectiveness can only be gauged over an extended period of time, I'll have to watch to see how it progresses.
B000BWY8KK This review is for Deer Off 32 oz Deer-Rabbit-Squirrel Repellent Concentrate. This product worked for me. I used a quarter of the bottle, mixed with almost 56 oz of water and applied to all my shrubs. I did this four times until the bottle was done. The deer stayed away. I'll update if they stop by and start eating the shrubs again. The product is fairly easy to use. Shake well, dilute, and spray or water using a can.The bottle contains 32 oz of concentrate. The dilution ratio is 1 part concentrate to 7 parts water. So you can mix only 4 oz of concentrate with 28 oz of water if you prefer to test. The concentrate has a strong smell and contains egg solids and a mix of other ingredients. Shake well. Some sprayers may clog due to the consistency of the mix. Use a watering can as a last resort. You don't want to over-dilute to make it thinner.I want to reiterate that this is not meant for plants grown for human consumption, even though the ingredients are natural. Don't even let the spray drift near your garden.  It can be used on shrubs, small trees, and bulbs/flowering plants that are usually eaten by the animals. For me, it was the tall shrubs that the deer would eat, eating the bottom half, and the top half would remain untouched since it was too high. So the shrubs look terrible.  I applied this to my shrubs and it worked. The deer didn't touch my shrubs. It's been a rainy season and I've had to apply this nearly every two weeks. Maybe that's why it worked so well.Certain animals in certain locations have different tolerances to the scents and strengths of the product. Consider diluting less if it doesn't work the first time to see if that makes a difference.
B000BWY8KK I was a little skeptical about this product. I've used so many products to try and keep the rapacious squirrels away from my urban container garden, but nothing seems to work, at least long term. I've tried water spray motion detectors and fox urine, etc. but the squirrels continue to dig up or eat everything -- strawberries, tomatoes, flower bulbs.I followed the directions, diluting this liquid into a spray bottle with water and dowsing the plants that get attacked. The sprayer did get clogged so that eventually I was sort of plopping dribbles on the plants, and there is some discoloration on the leaves, but despite heavy rains the past couple of weeks, there still hasn't been a squirrel sighting, and I used to see them every time I looked out on the deck -- they were out there more than I was!So I have to say that so far it's going well, and I'll update this review if necessary.Oh, and there are definitely no deer showing up on our third floor balcony either ;-)
B000BWY8KK I have used Deer Off before.  Like most repellents of this sort, the product relies on rotten egg and capsaicin to deter deer.  It also has garlic in it.My experience with the product has been very good. I prefer to buy the concentrate versus ready-made as all deer repellents tend to be expensive.  It is usually cheaper to buy Deer Off concentrate than ready-to-use mixtures, but keep an eye out for sales.  On occasion it is better to buy their 64 ounce ready-made, and some containers feature a battery powered sprayer.I do switch brands from season to season.  Here's why: if everyone in your neighborhood goes to the same large store or even local hardware store, they tend to buy the same spray.  This means every shrub in every yard is treated with the same product.The deer eventually are going to eat something, and when they run out of untreated food, or are simply hungry enough, they are going to eat treated vegetation.  So if they wander into 5 yards and 4 smell identical, they tend to avoid the 5th yard a little longer.  I know this is not a scientific approach, but it is simple and has held true for me for the most part.Of course during a harsh, cold season, deer will eat even things they rarely touch, sprayed or not.So I rotate between Deer Off and another product, as well as my homemade recipe.  The homemade spray is simply a gallon of water poured into a plastic milk jug, to which I add one raw egg, some hot sauce or powder, some garlic, a teaspoon or two of cinnamon, and a couple of squirts of liquid dish detergent.  I close the gallon container and put it out in the heat/sun to rot.  It smells bad, but so do most of these products. For a fraction of what commercial sprays cost, I have an effective homemade (inexpensive) spray.  Every time I use some of the jug I read water and another egg.  Every few uses I add some more of the other ingredients.The main ingredients are similar to a commercial product.  I add cinnamon as it cloaks some of the bad odor with a sweet smell as you walk past the plants, without making them taste/smell better to deer.  The dish detergent helps the spray adhere to plants but won't hurt the plant.  Keep in mind your dog may lick some of it up because of the egg.The main difference between homemade spray (aside from cost) is you have to respray it more frequently (after any heavy rain and most showers).As far as Deer Off, I like it, it typically works for me.  I shook it up before mixing, etc. and while I did not notice any usual thickness, my sprayer also clogged (I see a few reviews about that).  I have a battery powered sprayer (originally from a Deer Off spray).  I flushed it with water and it was OK so I don't know if it was a fluke.  I have reused it since with this product and its been fine.I like this product as one of the 2 or 3 commercial brands I use, and have found it to be the most effective (and also the strongest smelling).
B000BWY8KK I live in New York City, so I don't have a deer or rabbit problem, but we do have plenty of squirrels. They love to steal from my parents' fig tree. Since they started using this, I've heard no complaints about squirrels. I like that this is made of putrescent egg yolks and not dangerous chemicals. It's humane and safer for humans and pesky animals alike.
B000BWY8KK I used Deer Off last season and it did a great job keeping the deer away from my chestnut trees.  The deer don't even hang around in the chestnut tree part of the yard anymore.  In my experience, the Deer Off  does not deter my squirrels, and, without hesitation, they scamper up the tree trunks to get the chestnuts.  Rabbits are not an issue for me, so I cannot comment on how the spray is a deterrent for rabbits.  Dogs are not affected at all.We have a regular deer herd that hangs out on our property (about 5-6 deer). They have been hard on my chestnut trees and, while, I want to be kind to nature, I really don't want them eating my trees or rubbing on the tree trunks.  I used Deer Off last year & it was a winning product.  I will continue using the product this year & expect the same results.Deer Off is advertised as safe for use with kids & pets. My dogs have been in & around the sprayed trees & have exhibited no adverse reaction at all. They can tell there is some sort of a scent, so they sniff the trees.This product is great. My previous bottle had a battery operated sprayer, which was nice.  I used this bottle as a refill for that sprayer.
B000BWY8KK I have a horrific problem with squirrels eating all my avocados so I wanted to try this product as I am desperate. I diluted the product as specified (NOTE: you need a sprayer to use this) which wasn't difficult. The spray smells like hot pepper, so it's not offensive, at least it isn't to me. Apparently, the animals can smell other ingredients which keeps them away.It's hard for me to tell how well this product is working for a few reasons: almost all my avocados are gone so it's hard to tell if the squirrels are still coming around. I don't know how long the product lasts/works as I have only had it on less than a month. I can say I haven't seen any squirrels lately, and haven't found any avocados on the ground, so it could be a couple of good signs.Here's some things I do know:-the spray leaves a milky, white residue on the leaves, so it's not very pretty to look at-there's no way I can spray every part of the tree as it's so tall and wide-due to not being able to spray all of the tree, I think the squirrels will leave the lower fruit and just go up to the top to take those-in climates with lots of rain, I think this product would be useless (I'm in California, so at least between May and November it should be okay to use)I will update this review in a few weeks if I see any other results, or lack thereof.
B000BWY8KK I have now tried several of Havahart's deer, rabbit and squirrel repellant.  Others I have tried have worked but this product is a mixed bag.  Diluting this and using the proper sprayer alone is a challenge as the nozzle does clog from the small granules.  And one has to make sure this is only used on none-edible shrubs.We live in the high desert and don't have deer come into our subdivision, but we do have rabbits in the predawn hours nibbling in gardens.  This stuff does work at repelling the rabbits, but the potency isn't very long-lasting.For the price and the work needed to apply this repellant effectively, I'm better off using dog feces around my shrubs to keep the rabbits away.
B000BWY8KK This repellent is  easy to use. It is concentrated and you just mix with water and spray onto the plants you want to protect. (The 32 ounce bottle will make 2 gallons of repellent.)I have used other animal repellents in the past that just smell awful. This one did not smell too bad. (at least not as bad as the other ones I tried).I applied it to some of my susceptible plants and so far it seems to be protecting them.I like that the formulation is safe to use around pets and children. I try to avoid anything toxic in my garden and this product is approved for organic gardening.
B000BWY8KK Deer Off is a natural repellent made from egg, cayenne pepper, and garlic. This is the concentrated version, so you need to dilute it and use a sprayer for it. I have been using an older sprayer that came with a previous Deer Off product I received:B001H1GQ8GI have a small straw garden this year, and the area where the squirrels like to play is only a few feet away. I spray around the straw bales every so often and have not had any squirrels or rabbits try to steal my tomatoes or herbs. I have left food for the squirrels in their area. They eat it there and do not bother to come near the garden. Deer have been staying far away as well. I also have two Earthboxes with vegetables, and they have not been touched at all after spaying this around them. Please note that I spray around my food plants and not directly on them. While this is a natural product, I don't think that it is necessary or a good idea to spray this directly on food producing plants. The odor from this product is meant to repel plant eating animals, but it is not really noticeable to people. I only noticed a faint pepper scent from the bottle.I really like this because it works without causing any harm to critters, lawns, or plants. It's okay for dogs to play in the yard while you spray it. It isn't messy at all, either. I have made my own natural repellent sprays before, but they were a hassle and didn't work as well as this does.
B000BWY8KK This \"Deer Off\" deer, rabbit, and squirrel repellent works well to keep squirrels away from my shed. We don't keep much of a garden and don't mind the deer that come into our yard, but have a fairly serious issue with squirrels getting into my shed and eating our plastic gas cans (seriously annoying).This is a natural and non-toxic (to the animals) way to deter the critters without hurting them. We apply this around the outside and on the roof after each rain and it has kept our squirrel damage way down.Recommended!CFH
B000BWY8KK I took this to a retirement home where a resident has had deer eat all the roses and lots of other plants including ones that normally don't attract deer.  These deer aren't shy like city deer - they come to feed at all hours.After spraying the garden with this stinky Deer Off, no more problems occurred.  The hungry deer are still around, they just don't eat the sprayed plants.  It works.
B000BWY8KK I have to say I have a bit of a like-hate relationship with this product.  I really like how it works, and put it in my sprayer that I got from them a while ago as a refill because it was empty.  It works well to keep deer and critters away from my trees and garden.I really hate how the cup on top is convenient and snaps on the bottle, yet it is made so completely thin and flimsy that when I got it in the package it was already broken in two.The cup is a fabulous idea- I love it.  But it is a tease because it is so easily broken, even if it came in one piece, I don't imagine it would be long before it broke in gentle usage.The product itself so far has not clogged my Deer Off sprayer and despite a few rains it did not seem to wear off on the places I tested it on.  The deer are still staying away.If they improved the cup design out of non-breakable material I might like this a lot more.  You don't want to use food grade measuring cups to measure this, so having a designated cup is great- if it just was not so breakable!I would say this works almost as well as Liquid Fence, although I think Liquid Fence has an edge on it in performance.  It works on deer, squirrels, rabbits, and woodchucks.  I don't think it works well with cats or dogs, however.
B000BWY8KK We are rural with quarter acres vegetable plots so deer are a big problem.  We have five feet of electical fencingParmak Super Energizer 5 Low Impedance 110/120 Volt 50 Mile Range Electric Fence Controller SE5running around our garden but our neighbor's garden doesn't have a fence and his beans were getting hit hard by the deer.Because you can't spray it on food, my brother dumped the entire container of Deer Off in a bucket (said it looks and smells like chicken wing sauce made with butter and hot sauce) added a little water, and soaked rope in it.  He then strung the rope around the garden. Voila - no more deer.He just ran the rope this week and it rains daily so I don't know how long it will last.  I'll add an addendum.Dinged the product a star because of the price but will give it back if it really does last 90 days.
B000BWY8KK Followed the simple instructions for application and applied this to my fruit bearing bushes, herb garden, vegetable garden, and flower beds. My problem is rabbits and an occassional deer. So far, i have not spotted any offenders in the treated areas.Since I only applied this a few days ago, i cannot attest to its effectiveness over a three month period. However, I am pleased with its performance and ease of application. It is doing a good job when it comes to keeping my growing rabbit population at bay.
B000BWY8KK We live in newer housing development that doesn't have fencing so the rabbits can easily so wherever they want. We have several fruit trees that seem to attract the rabbits and they leave their beans all over the place. They also like to bite at the bottom of the tree for some reason. I like rabbits but I wish they wouldn't leave their beans in the yard because one of our goofy dogs will try to eat it. That being said I like having a way to keep the rabbits away without harming them in any way. I can't say how this product works to repel deer or squirrels but it works very well at keeping the rabbits away. I have used this product before but it come in a large bottle with a battery operated spray nozzle. The nozzle was a total pain because it didn't want to start spraying and kept getting clogged because the repellent is slightly thick. This bottle is concentrated so you don't need to use very much at all. I used it to build a barrier around my fruit trees and a barrier around the outline of my yard. I just fill up the applicator cup and walk along pouring a very thin line of the repellent. It doesn't last super long but I would say it normally lasts 4 to 6 weeks with no signs of any rabbits.
B000BWY8KK I've used Deer Off before and didn't have very good results with the sprayer so I decided to try the concentrate formula.It states to NOT use on plants that are intended for human consumption so all of our garden plants that are getting eaten by the squirrels and deer have no hope at. We used it on other plants and the plants that we applied it to had burned brown areas on them in a few days.We also applied it around the bird feeder to keep the squirrels away and to some trees to keep the deer from rubbing up on them, all with no results. The best thing that we have found is to try and plant Deer-resistant plants when possible. For the garden, I have no clue how to keep those pesky squirrels out.
B000BWY8KK Deer Off makes a great product.  While using Deer Off, my garden has not been terrorized by rabbits.  This is an economical solution and all it requires is a spray pump and some water. A 32 oz bottle will yield you 2 gallons and enough to treat 4000 sq feet according to the manufacture.It dries odorless and is safe to use around pets and children.  My dog is never bothered by it, and still pees on the bushes.  But at least the flowers haven't been eaten by rabbits.It's a great product, I recommend it.
B000BWY8KK If deer are hungry, they will eat just about anything, maybe even including foliage treated with this spray; however, this product is a great way to encourage them to browse elsewhere.  I mix up a batch, spray it on and around the plants I know they like to eat, and it keeps them away.  Even better, I've found that a couple of applications will discourage them enough not to try that plant again for months, even if it rains or snows in between.  They learn their lesson fairly quickly after smelling the rotten egg and tasting the hot pepper.  Of course, new deer in the yard haven't learned that, which makes it necessary to apply Deer Off at least three or four times a year, even once the deer start to avoid a plant or area.The only disadvantage to this product is the cost.  I make up a home brew that is as effective but a lot messier and smellier, and I apply that in between Deer Off purchases (although, in this case, I got the concentrate from Amazon Vine, not a retail store.)  Even mixing this from concentrate is easier than blending a batch in my kitchen.  Still, I find it helps to mix up the distasteful smells/taste, even though the ingredients are roughly the same.Because I live in a high deer-concentration area, this product has saved a lot of my landscape.  The deer don't like it unless they are truly desperate.-- Debbie Lee Wesselmann
B000BWY8KK I do like Deer Off and have used it before.  It works very well, but the Deer off with a motorized sprayer was useless as I couldn't get it to work.  The one I had was a dud.  I'd suggest that if you do need this product (and I do) that you invest in a reliableSolo 420 2-Liter One-Hand Pressure Sprayerto have on hand when you decide to spray. A measuring cup comes with this concentrate, something that is quite handy.  I have critters galore around my property and have long since given up on having things like daffodils or tulips because \"someone\" seems to be right behind me digging them up for a snack.If you do want to plant bulbs this fall, you can simply dip them in the concentrate for five minutes and set them aside to dry.  I haven't tried this yet as I'll be planting in the fall, but am very pleased with this idea.  This is a concentrate so I'll be getting a lot of use out of it.  It will cover roughly 4,000 square feet if I so choose to spray that much.  The only cautionary note concerning the concentrate itself was that you don't over-dilute the product.  The other was to avoid spraying directly on plants for human consumption.ACTIVE INGREDIENTS:~  Putrescent Whole Egg Solids - 6.25%~  Capsaicin and related Capsaicinoids - 0.0045%~  Garlic - 0.005%The \"Deer Off\" itself does work and there are several positive things to think about.PROS:++  You can safely use it around children and pets, but take note that you will want to keep it out of reach as you would any product.  Think pepper here.++  It has USDA approval to use in organic gardens.++  I could not smell any heavy odor, but it is offensive to those critters you don't want chomping on your plants.++ Deer Off will repel deer, squirrels, and rabbits.++ This is a weather-resistant formula.  The other Havahart Deer Off in the spray bottle had to be reapplied after a heavy rain.++ You can soak your flower bulbs in this solution to prevent critters from digging them up and eating them.++ Lasts for up to three months.CONS:--  You cannot use this \"on plants intended for human consumption\" as it contains egg solids.  Care must be taken to keep the Deer Off from drifting onto these plants if you are spraying.--  The critters may head for your neighbor's gardens (this can be either a pro or a con, depending on how you perceive it).I was conflicted in applying a star rating for this product when I had the sprayer, but I have no problem giving the Deer Off concentrate five stars.  If you have critter problems in your gardens or with your trees, this is definitely a must have product.  It won't hurt them, but will simply deter them from stripping off your tree bark, pulling up your flower bulbs, eating your garden, and annoying the heck out of you.
B000BWY8KK I have 12 bird feeders hanging from poles in my front and back yard. A lot of the bird food falls to the ground. This works well in feeding large birds that are too big to perch on the feeders. It also attracts many squirrels. I have separate feeders for squirrels but they are not satisfied with just their feeders and gobble up the bird seed as well which leaves very little for the big birds. I sprayed Deer Off around the bottom areas of the bird feeder poles in the hopes that squirrels would be repelled. After the Deer Off had dried the squirrels returned in full force to their old stomping grounds. I swear I could hear them giggling at me.This product should be labeled \"Rip Off\" based on its cost and lack of performance.
B000BWY8KK I've used this product and products like this (liquid fence) before with varied results.Basically it's incredibly strong smelling stuff (and believe me you will smell this when mixing from concentrate and also when applying).  If you're spraying it, you probably want it to be on a relatively calm day, and have everyone go inside for a bit.  It's not so bad, but it is pretty smell stuff, and just not nice to smell.  The good news is that smell is also what is supposed to keep the deer and other critters away.I've found that this sometimes works, and I think it really depends on if your garden/shrubs/etc are the only choice for a meal or not.  If there are other options I think they just usually move on.  The product claims 90 days, but I've never had luck for that long, especially when it rains, which seem to reduce the effectiveness greatly.This specific product is great because it makes 2 gallons of the stuff, and to buy that directly would be a pain to store and quite a bit more expensive.  Might want to try a small spray bottle first to see if it works, and if it does go up to this.
B000BWY8KK I used to enjoy landscaping around our house, which is in an \"ex-urban\" area (not quite rural, but heavily wooded, and definitely more wild than a typical suburban setting).  As our deer population increased dramatically over the past 15 years, I gradually gave up on landscaping, because the deer ate all of my plants down to ground level.  It was really discouraging.I tried various deer repellents, with limited success.  Part of the problem is the density of our deer population.  The deer graze their way through the yard every night, and a couple of times during daylight hours.  There are usually 3-4 grazing at once, but sometimes larger groups come through (the largest was a herd of over 40 deer).Two years ago, the owner of a nearby nursery recommended Deer Off.  He uses it to protect the nursery plants, and he said it was the only thing he'd found that worked.  Although the product is pretty expensive, I decided to give it a try.  I was amazed by the results.  Plants that had previously been eaten down to nothing now look great.  The deer don't even nibble on them.Based on the suggestion of the nursery owner, I really cover the leaves when applying.  For a few days, this leaves an unattractive residue on the plant leaves, but it fades quickly even though the protection seems to endure.  I generally reapply a few times during the season, especially after very heavy, sustained rain.Not even Deer Off can protect plants during deer migration season, when the food supply is limited.  During the fall and spring migrations, I still have to cover the plants or put up the electric fence.  But from May through September, Deer Off keeps the deer away by itself.As I mentioned, the product is expensive, but it's still cheaper than replacing plants all the time.  And it's a bargain compared to products that don't work.  I really am very satisfied with this product, and grateful to the nursery owner for recommended it (and also for explaining how to apply it).
B000BWY8KK From the description it seems that this is made of a combination of garlic, pepper, and rotten egg; but whater it is, it keeps the rabbits and squirrels out of my garden.  It does stink at first, but in a day or 2 the smell starts to fade and by day 4 could not smell it.
B000BWY8KK Havahart DF32CP-4 Deer Off Repellent Concentrate is an all-natural organic formula that repels by taste and odor deer, rabbits, squirrels and possibly other nuisance animals unless they are starving or otherwise out of normal control, e.g. rabid.  This is not an industrial repellent working against anything that walks, but rather for the suburban home and garden use.  Its garlic, putrescent egg, and capsaicin are not offensive to all people and thus applicable not only in gardens, lawns, and landscaped areas, but also some basements, cellars, and storage.  However, it is ineffective against very determined animals.
B000BWY8KK I'll be honest:  I don't really like giving products 5 stars unless I really think they stand far above the competition and/or I can see that its doing a fantastic job.  The problem with this Deer Off is that I'm not completely sure if deer are avoiding some plants because they've been sprayed with it, or because...well, it's summer in the pacific northwest and everywhere you look there's plenty of OTHER green things to eat.Giving it the benefit of the doubt:  deer haven't eaten the plants sprayed with this stuff.But be weary:  the deer haven't eaten nearby plants that haven't been sprayed with this stuff, either.On the other hand:  my property has 4 deer living in the \"back 40\" that routinely like to snack on everything.  there are, without a doubt, deer nearby.At any rate, if you're buying this concentrated stuff, but sure to:1.  Buy a sprayer of some sort.  You need it to apply this stuff.2.  Plug your nose when mixing.  Rotten eggs and hot peppers are the ingredients, and it smells like it.3.  After mixing into the sprayer that you buy, shake it up well, otherwise you'll get little blobs of congealed...something...that'll clog the nozzle.So far, I'd recommend this stuff, but as fall and winter sets in (and the green goes away), we'll see if the deer will decide that they enjoy the spicy version of my plants.
B000BWY8KK When you open up the cap you can smell the hot pepper from several feet away.  It's about the same consistency as salad dressing.  Be sure to dilute it enough if you're using a sprayer.  I only diluted it 50% because I wanted it to be super strong and it was still too thick, it kept clogging the nozzle.  Note that if you have a problem with cats using the vegetable garden as a kitty litter box, this product doesn't seem to work on cats; just other critters like rabbits and squirrels.
B000BWY8KK Deer off will keep , Deer, Rabbits and Squirrels away.I used it last year after the Deer chewed up some of my plants, and it did work. Although it put a white film on my green leafs..The Deer stayed away. The other bottle came with a sprayer, this one does not!Since I grow Organic, it does say , do not spray on eatable plants. which i would not do. I cover my veggies with chicken wire.Make sure when using this, it is not Windy outside.It is a bit stinky, which the Deer do not like. It is made from sometype of Egg Solids.Mix concentrate thoroughly prior to mixing.Mix with tap water at a ratio of 1 part to 7  parts of water.Use 4 oz, of concentrate and 28oz of water to make 1 qt.32 oz of spray mixture.Contents of  1 quart bottle makes 2 gallons of spray when mixed with 7 quarts of water..Hope this helps..
B000BWY8KK i use this concentrate with the \"Havahart Deer Off II Deer, Rabbit, and Squirrel Repellent, Ready-to-Use Spray with battery powered sprayer\"Havahart DO64MS Squirrel Repellent BatteryThe small bottle of concentrate is equal to 4 bottles of the ready to use that comes with the battery powered sprayer.So it's 1/4 of the price if you mix it up yourself.
B000BWY8KK We have loved the Deer Off products. This is very easy to use and very effective. Hay has gotten crazy expensive and we needed to keep deer out of the feed. We used this around the concrete pad before our hay was stacked. We have had no problem with deer getting into it. This comes in much larger sizes and we will be using those to keep our hay safe. It works effectively in high winds  which I had concerns about.  We also used it to keep rabbits out of my herbs. I don't really care that they eat eh herbs, I care that the barn cat kills the babies horribly in front of my kids.This has helped us avoid bunny murders and save money- great product.
B000BWY8KK I was having such a problem getting the squirrels to stay out of my vegtables/corn I almost did not put a garden up this year. But I am glad I did-I sprayed this around the perimeter of my garden for two days and watched and waited. Did not see any paw prints in my garden and no little bits off the fruit either.Worked great!
B000BWY8KK While this repellent did clog our electric sprayer pretty quickly (basically nothing came out), we have been desperate to protect our vegetable garden from the hoards of rabbits living on our property so I diluted this concentrate right into a watering can and applied it that way instead.I can say, it does work. And we would know if it didn't. When our garden isn't protected, we find the evidence of the rabbits (and we see them plenty). There are burrow holes under our tomatoes, radishes half eaten, onions destroyed, spinach nibbled on. When we apply this repellent, however, the signs of rabbits all disappear for many days. We reapply more often than I'd like, but I also will say, our rabbit population is extraordinarily huge where we garden!If you're looking for a repellent that is effective with rabbits, this one does work. I would just recommend that you look into different application methods, as it clogs sprayers quite well! I do hope Deer Off addresses this issue soon, but for now, I'm just happy we're keeping the rabbits at bay.
B000BWY8KK It's easy to mix and spray, but only time will tell if it's effective, and we have our doubts. During the summer we get afternoon thunderstorms almost daily. I'm not sure if this will actually last 90 days. We do like the mostly natural ingredients.
B000BWY8KK Fortunately, we have another measuring cup that can be used for theDeer Off 32 Ounce Deer, Rabbit, and Squirrel Repellent Concentrate DF32CP-4because ours arrived in three pieces and the cap was loose on the bottle.  No leakage destroyed anything, so we immediately mixed up a batch of repellent, put it into a new spray bottle and sprayed it on the flowers, foliage, and landscaping surrounding our home.  Most of the flowers have already been consumed by the deer, but they sure do like to return and their \"deposits\" create an unsightly and hazardous reminder that they live in the woods.  Since applying the pungent spray, we have noticed a reduction, but not an elimination of deer in the area.  I won't be purchasing another bottle of this product when it's emptied, but that is just me.  It's okay, but not worth the price in my opinion, especially since a spray container isn't included and the cup was broken.  The squirrels haven't been deterred around the property and we have had no rabbits.  The aroma dissipated after a day or two and we weren't really bothered by it.  I received no phone calls or visitors at the door to complain.
B000BWY8KK My problem is rabbits, cats and squirrels.This product is more difficult to use than Havahart Critter Ridder 3146 Animal Repellent Granular Shaker. You have to dilute the concentrate, then spray it from your own sprayer. I was tempted to just pour the concentrate around, but didn't. This product sprays on the foliage, while the granules stay on the ground. This may be a better product for deers since they are not close to the ground, but deers are not my problem.The product smells horrible, but that's how it works. Don't spray it in the wind. Really. I mean it.You can still smell a faint odor when it dries.It seems to wash off after one rain.It seemed to have no effect no rabbits, squirrels and cats. For these critters, the granules seem to work better.Finally, the measuring cup that comes with the concentrate and sits on top of the cap shattered in transit. This was annoying.
B000BWY8KK I've been using deer repellant for many years. I get whatever brand is on sale. This particular stuff works as well as any of them, but it seems to be \"chunky\" and clogs up the sprayer big time. The only way I could get it to work was to strain it first and then mix it. Straining it was a truly disgusting proposition.
B000BWY8KK You need a sprayer to use this.  I recommend theSmith 190285 1-Gallon Bleach & Chemical Sprayer With Non-Corrosive 14-Inch Wand and Single Nozzle System.  This is used in a 1:7 ratio with water and comes with a measuring cup on top.  We have tons of deer on our property and this seems to be keeping them away.  It even seems to work after a decent rain storm.  I painted a 4 foot wide boarder between my manicured property and the woods where the deer inhabit.  It has worked to keep the deer on their side of my invisible fence.  I mixed it up a bit strong 2:7, not 1:7.
B000BWY8KK I've used Deer Off for the last 2 years at my cabin which is in the woods with lots of deer & rabbits.  My hydrangeas have never gotten beyond 3 feet tall until I started using this product.  The deer always browsed the new growth so the plants looked healthy but no flowers.  Since this is a vacation house, I'm not there to chase off the deer.  I think we have the same family of deer that come to our house & they have become turned off by the \"flavor\" of my bushes - at least for now.  I've watched the security camera footage of them ignoring the bushes. Yea!  I used to have footage of the deer enjoying my bushes.I already own the Deer Off battery sprayer for applying it to my plants.  I make sure to run fresh soft water through it to clean it thoroughly before refilling the sprayer.  I have not had any problems with clogging.  I also follow the instructions for mixing this concentrate version with the correct amount of water.It is rain \"resistant\" & it did last through several significant rain storms in the two weeks after I applied it.  I could still see the milky residue on the leaves although it had definitely washed off some of it.  I reapplied it just to be sure.  The 90-day claim is perhaps a bit optimistic unless there has been very little or no rain.  You do have to apply more Deer Off to new growth.The milky residue is not terrible looking but it is visible up close;  I think it looks better than putting up fence around all the bushes.  It does have a noticeable odor for a couple hours after application.  You may want to consider that if you're spraying near your patio & planning on having dinner there.  But it's not very offensive; just kind of sour smelling & only until it dries.
B000BWY8KK We live deep in the woods. A day with deer in the yard, summer, winter, spring or fall, is the norm. However, in the winter, I could spray arsenic on our shrubs and the deer would still eat it. They get hungry in the dark of winter and eat holly bushes, evergreens, rhododendrons, and anything else no matter how close it is to the house.So Deer Off helps to deter them. For awhile. But not forever. But we are the exception I believe. It does seem to keep them off until they are really desperate or I just don't get out often enough to reapply. When we have 12\" of snow and it's 20 degrees out, I'm not in the mood to fill my sprayer and go out to save the shrubs. Really, who would be? Is that the fault of Deer Off? No.So I can tell you about this bottle. I've used a prepackaged spray bottle of Deer Off before. It was hard work to get it to cover all we needed treated, even if it was battery powered. It was like washing a car with a toothbrush.At least with this, I can fill our four gallon sprayer and go to town. That means some additional work on my part to mix and measure and make sure the sprayer doesn't clog but it also gets the job done more efficiently in the long run.I don't care about the bunnies. The squirrels stopped coming for tea when I ditched the bird feeders. It's really the deer that think we are an all you eat buffet. For now, they are surrounded by a plush forest full of fresh plants. But all bets are off in December.
B000BWY8KK Havahart Deer Off is among many egg and garlic based repellents.  I've used lots of brands, and found most to be effective if used conscientiously.  Even though Deer Off says theirs is a weather resistant formula, I still follow a schedule of retreating after every rain or about once a month.  Deer Off suggests every two to three months, but who wants to test those limits?I like Deer Off's concentrated form more than its ready-to-use counterpart.  Making up smaller batches better suits my needs, and the sprayer does not clog using the diluted concentrated formula.  I will never buy Deer Off ready-to-use again.  Even though the sprayer was religiously cleaned after each application, it still clogged, rendering a big container useless.  I also find Deer Off leaves a slight residue after drying, but it is negligible.I have success using this concentrate, but then again, have success with other deterrents too.  The ingredient list for most brands are pretty much the same.  Deer Off repels using scent and taste (capsaicin added), whereas others deter simply by scent.  Anyone who prefers a ready-to-use formula might want to tryLiquid Fence 112 Deer and Rabbit Repellent, 1-Quart Ready to UseorBobbex B550170 Ready to Use Deer Repellent with E-Z Pump Sprayer, 48-Ounce.  Both come in a variety of sizes.  Neither of those clog up and they are much more pungent than Deer Off.
B000BWY8KK I have a continuing problem with almost every variety of hungry visitor - rabbits, deer, squirrels - and try almost every product. The results are early with this one - but it seems to be protecting an area of my garden that takes particular abuse, especially from the rabbits.  I am keeping my fingers crossed!
B000BWY8KK I used the Deer Off Repellent to keep the rabbits from eating my decorative plants. Bunnies are big problem in my yard. When they find a plant they like they don't just take a few bites, they eat it to the ground. I use wire around my veggie garden but not for flowres. I also have bird feeders in my yard so I needed something non-toxic. Deer Off is made with natural ingredients and the package says it is safe around pets and children.Deer Off comes in a pre-mixed spray bottle or concentrate. I used the concentrate and mixed it for my own sprayer. I have tried using the pre-mixed sprayer and had trouble getting it to spray in a fine mist. When I went to use the remaining quarter of the bottle it was clogged up and wouldn't spray at all. Rinsing out the tubing for the sprayer didn't help. I prefer mixing just the amount I need and storing the rest for later. Plus it's much cheaper to use the concentrate and your own sprayer.Does it work? Yes, it keeps most of the bunnies away. There is still some chewing but I'm not sure if it's a bunny sampling the plant and moving on or some other animal, but there are no more completely devoured plants.The spray seemed safe for my plants, there was no damage or discoloration to the leaves or flowers. The product is supposed to smell bad to the animals but I didn't experience any unpleasant smell.Depending on the taste buds of the critters in your yard this may be the solution but from my experience it's worth a try.
B000BWY8KK Perhaps the squirrels in my yard have developed a fondness for \"putrescent egg\" or find the allure of bird seed and budding leaves offsets the supposed repellent tastes and odor of \"Deer Off.\" I've followed the direction, applied this product twice to the same plants, shrubs, and area. I coated the bird feeders and ground around them with Deer Off, and I also liberally applied it to the aerial access points via tree limbs and trunks, bushes, even stairs.The squirrels remain undeterred. They continue raiding the raised beds, climbing to the bird feeders, and generally seem unperturbed. If they were wearing clothes pins on their noses or had tiny gas masks, then that would be one thing. So I still have to dispatch the Aussies to chase the squirrels when I catch the varmints in the act.This repellent does work during the time I am actually spraying it on stuff to the point it coats surfaces and drips to the surrounding ground. I think, however, that my presence may be the deterrent during those moments of respite from the rodents' continual engorgement.
B000BWY8KK A couple years ago we had a huge squirrel population in our small, wooded yard. I enjoyed watching one of the most intelligent squirrels I've ever seen tackle & conquer any obstacle put in his/her way. You know anything to get at that bird feeder. I watched him try, try & try again. When one plan of attack didn't work, he'd think up another and would eventually be victorious. We weren't successful at deterring him that year (2 years ago) so last year we armed ourselves with squirrel repellent products. He never came back  last summer; as a matter of fact, we hardly had any squirrels last year.  This year has been an entirely different story. We have squirrels everywhere! And, as everyone knows, squirrels love easy food & raid bird feeders every chance they get. That's where Deer Off comes in. We had at least 8 squirrels in the grass below the bird feeders, just munching away, enjoying their 'fast food meal'. We sprayed Deer Off in the area the squirrels were congregating (under the feeders) hoping to get rid of the pesky critters. Well, I'm disappointed to say that Deer Off did not keep the squirrels away. I think they're addicted to 'fast food meals' & only violence will keep them away.Last week we decided to only use one bird feeder. That decision has kept most of the squirrels out of our yard. We are now seeing & feeling hickory nut shells raining down from our trees. If we're lucky, the squirrels will eat most of the nuts so we won't have to pick them up this fall.We also tried Deer Off around our shed. It did repel the squirrels for a few days, but we were surprised how often we needed to spray to keep them away.Summing up, Deer Off did not work around the bird feeders, but it did repel the squirrels for a few days when we used it around the shed.
B000BWY8KK The drought and drought restrictions has caused most vegetation to dry out and more varmints to munch on almost anything green or juicy. They're desperate and trying to catch a break which I understand. I just don't want to chance the illnesses they spread with their droppings or traveling guests (fleas, ticks etc).I tried this formulation to keep the varmints away. The product's offensive rotten egg smell does that BUT it dissipates after 3-4 days and the munchers return to make up for lost time. I guess our Texas varmints are used to hot sauce and chili pepper because it does NOTHING to keep the varmints away.In essence, it keeps varmints and neighbors away for a few days but that's it. This may work better where the animals are not in such desperate conditions. It didn't keep the Texas varmints at bay long enough to cost justify this product.
B000BWY8KK Its so amazing for me to see how God puts all things together. What we can't smell animals can! I think its pretty incredible how people figure out what works to keep animals away from our gardens. ( Not for direct use on plants intended for human consumption ).  Jesus' Blessings and Peace
B000BWY8KK it fixed my squirrel problems real fast. i have a huge container garden that i use to grow some plants that i love to grow. the squirrels were attracted to my nursery pots and they did a lot of damage to my plants and tore up a lot of my plants and the soil. i used deer off repellent and they didn't enter my yard period after that. i sat there in my lawn chair and watched those squirrels outside of my property line and just stood there looking. i will have to routinely spray this product around the perimeter of my garden to keep the squirrels out.
B000BWY8KK We applied this a few months ago and it did a nice job of saving the trees.  We have quite a few deer roaming around our property and it was nice to see that they did not devour our trees!  It was interesting to see the deer approach the trees, but actually ate only the grass underneath the trees but did not touch the big, leafy threes themselves.  I guess everyone will have a different experience but for my money, this is my go-to repellent.
B000BWY8KK I bought this to rid my yard of squirrels and it works great!  I apply a liberal amount around the trunk of each tree and on the tops of the branches where they like to sit. The very next day - no more squirrels. It lasts about two weeks before I need to reapply and the next application works just as well.This concentrate is a nice economical way to refill the large container I originally purchased.  It takes  up less space in the garage.
B000BWY8KK I have reviewed several different Deer Repellent products in the past 2 years and am still hopeful that either something new that works will come out or a new formula of an old standby will do the trick.The market is still prime for a great product to emerge.....The putrescent egg and hot pepper combo is not working. I think the local southeastern deer are starting to like hot & rotten.There are a couple of other details that make this product loose a couple of stars besides the fact that it does repel all deer:- The advertising that you can use it on organic gardens but not anywhere near food crops is misleading.- The price at $38 for 32 oz is slightly over $1.18 an oz and 32 oz only makes 2 gallons of repellent. This is suppose to treat 400 ornamental plants 4 feet tall or 4000 sq ft of plantings. But spraying top and bottom of leaves as per directions really gives much less than 400 plants. These would have to be very small . I estimate that with my professional backpack sprayer with constant pressure tip installed and on a very fine mist spray pattern that I would only be able to spray approx 100 ornamental 4 ft tall plants. Not sure where they are getting their numbers.So I am still waiting for that perfect deer repellent.....Sorry this may not be the review you were hoping to read about. Please comment if you have found a product that works great and I will add your comments to this review.2 stars. 3 lost (one each) for effectiveness, advertising, and cost.Hope this helps.
B000BWY8KK I was excited to get this product.  We have the same seven deer that come and eat our plants every night.  Let me start with the fact that it did seem to work.  The deer have stopped grazing on my shrubs.  The review is a three star review because of how painful it is to spray the stuff on.  I wish it came as its own sprayer that you hook to the garden hose, like miracle grow.  This one clogged easily.  With the expense of the product it made it somewhat frustrating.Also, as another reviewer mentioned, this is not to put on your edible garden.  Once I sprayed my plants, that is right where the deer went.  They are now eating my other garden, instead of my flowers and shrubs.  I will have to get deer nets for the others.Will I continue to use the product?  Possibly.  I will look around first, however, and see if I can find a product that is easier to dispense.
B000BWY8KK I do not have a problem with Deers. I do have a probllem with rabbits and mole and lizzards and frogs . I am glad to say that The Deer Off has seemed to make an impact on the for now. I have notice a decline in these critters around my property.  I live next to a wooded lot and would like to keep the animals and critters in the woods. Before I could not even put my garbage out and now I can.This has worked so far I havenot seen any frogs trying to jump in my pool or creepy crawlies running about as well.
B000BWY8KK Squirrels dig up all the plants in my small backyard in the fall and sit on my fence and throw black walnut shells against the white paint on my garage, staining it deeply.  I ignored this product for a long time assuming it was toxic and because I did not want to get rid of the squirrels completely.  Once I realized it really was a safe mix that wouldn't kill everything, I thought it would be nice to try.  And it is.  I can put a very small amount on boxed plants and on my fence without scaring the squirrels out of the yard completely.  Comes with an easy to use mixing dish that stores easily.
B000BWY8KK We don't get a lot of animal damage in our community garden, but we have had a little squirrel problem.  After 25 days of use, we haven't had any problem, so this product is quite useful.
B000BWY8KK Deer Off 32 Ounce Deer, Rabbit and Squirrel Repellant comes as a concentrate, so you will need another container to use. I have a fenced in property so do not have deer. However, I have rabbits and it doesn't work to deter the little buggers. I gave it 3 stars because I do not know if it is effective against deer.
B000BWY8KK This works fine as part of my deer-repelling arsenal.  I like it being concentrated as it takes up less space in my garage.  However, it could be a lot more concentrated - it only makes 2 gallons and is still over 90% water.Studies have shown that deer don't like strange smells (which is why some people have luck with even hair or soap), but they get used to a smell so you need to switch the sprays regularly.  I switch this with a couple of other commercial sprays and a homemade one of eggs, garlic, tabasco (the three basic ingredients in this spray) and a little dish soap.  The homemade spray works well, but it does not have chemicals in it that will allow it to stick to the leaves during a rain.  (Scientific studies have said the same thing). Their claim that it will last 90 days is bizarre unless you live in an area with absolutely no rain.  A couple of weeks (depending on the amount of rain) is more likely.Note that this and any spray that uses eggs cannot be used on edibles.  The Havahart Spray Away Elite II Hose-Free Motion Activated Sprinkler Animal Repellent 5269 is expensive but working pretty good for that.
B000BWY8KK I got this product for one thing only, to keep the squirrels off of my bird feeder.  Not the actual feeder, but the long pole from which the feeders hang.  If I was sure it wouldn't deter the birds, I would put it on the feeder itself.  The problem is, it has been raining in Georgia almost every single day for the last two weeks, so I don't know how effective it is.  I haven't seen the squirrels climb up as normal, but I'm not sure if it's just because I throw a slipper at the window and they've associated the feeder with a loud noise, or if it's because of this product.  I promise to come back and update when we have consecutive rainy days!
B000BWY8KK We don't have deer or rabbit problems, but we do have trouble with squirrels.  Ours aren't the cute little squirrels that I remember from my childhood that would rap on the window for peanuts and even come up and take them out of our hands.  No, these are squirrels that can climb up a straight wall of stucco or brick and chew holes in the eves to get into the attic.  And if they see you outside as they're making their ascent, the language that comes out of their mouths I'm sure would be censored if I could understand squirrel talk.  They tease the dogs and cats by hanging from branches or walls just out of reach and chattering nasty things.  So although this repellent is advertised to protect vegetation, I noticed that several other reviewers had some luck with making a perimeter of the yard to keep the squirrels away.  We'll try anything. (We already had someone come in and put heavy gauge wire around the eves and have tried live trapping and relocating them. That helped some. We really don't want to use poison.)I mixed the product according to directions and sprayed it around the base of the house and around some trees and fences in the yard.  It has a pretty bad smell, but not as bad as I had expected.  After a couple days I didn't notice the smell anymore.  The time we really notice the squirrels is in the winter when they try to get in out of the cold, and I'm waiting until then to actually spray inside the attic if we need to do that because if using it around the perimeter works, I'd rather not have the smell in the attic.  So far I haven't seen any squirrels hanging around.  They seem to have found more hospitable places to go.  If this keeps working it will be a godsend in the winter when we have a bigger problem.  I'm giving the product 4 stars because it seems to be working, and I'll upgrade it to 5 stars if it continues to be effective in the winter.
B000BWY8KK We have over 30 young fast growing tress that are attracting deer every evening. I decided to put this on the fencing that is around the tress as a test and every single one that I used the deer off on has no bitten leaves. The deer knew which ones did not have the product on. I have since sprayed this on all of the trees and and am very thankful I finally found a product that works.The best thing about the application process is that you do not have to wait for a specific season, which most of competitors ask. I used this late july/ early august with optimal results. There was no plant or grass damage afterward. I did however wait a few days after the rain to apply just to be sure and the product seemed to work instantly.
B000BWY8KK Seriously - this stuff smells good enough to put on my scrambled eggs. I don't use a sprayer. so I diluted this in water and splashed on and around the area I want to protect. My main varmints are bunnies and squirrels - eating my flowers, chewing through my landscaping power cables and drip water system supply lines. The squirrels even damage the chainlink fence - they chew through the wires holding the fence to the supports. So I diluted this stuff in water and splashed the fence, wires, and drip system. No more chewing damage!
B000BWY8KK I have three large oak trees on my property and lots of squirrels.  I hate it when the get into my garbage cans. They will even chew through plastic covers to get inside. The also jump from some of my smaller trees onto my roof.I used this around my garbage cans and small trees. It works. I still see squirrels in my yard but they are staying away from my garbage cans and the smaller trees near my house.I like the fact that this is safe for animals and humans. It seems to last despite some rain storms. It does not any noticeable odor.This keeps the squirrels away. It is not toxic and lasts despite rain storms. It is a great product.
B000BWY8KK To be honest, it's hard to tell how well this product is working. I haven't had any deer damage since applying it, but I haven't seen the 2 deer around that were always in my yard either, since then. (I live in a very rural forested mountainous area. They might have headed up to the high country for the hot summer.) So I'm giving it the benefit of the doubt, will update later. I have used a similar product, Liquid Fence, that worked pretty well. Both products smell really bad at first, but the odor doesn't last, for us humans, at least. And Deer Off claims to last longer, also includes capsaicin (hot pepper). It has a convenient measuring cap attached.
B000BWY8KK I got this to put on vegetable plants that were being decimated by squirrels. When I read the instructions it said to not apply it to any plants that produced edible foods, that it was not safe on human food. As that was the point for this product, which is kind of marketed as a natural repellent (I was imagining it was wolf urine, or something) this is pretty much useless for me.
B000BWY8KK Flushing little critters that find their way under our deck is a job best left for our spaniel, but unfortunately, the long barking session that accompanies the discovery can be an ordeal in itself.Some of this between the slats not only saves me from crawling around down there, but also is an often obeyed UNwelcome mat for critters.It even seems to work on the opossums and raccoons.The scent isn't as disgusting as some others, and so far is working for us.
B000BWY8KK After a very rabbit-filled spring, this product promised what we needed! Quite a few plants in our flowerbeds have been chewed off by rabbits this year, and I was having difficulty outsmarting them in order to save what was left.This product is a concentrate, so you'll need a sprayer to hold the solution after mixing with water. I used a 3 gallon pressure sprayer, and that seemed to work quite well with this product.After the first application, a few of the plants I sprayed still got chewed, but I figured that they have to try eating the plants to find out how bad they taste. Each time it rained or we watered the plants, I reapplied the spray. Since I didn't have many flowers left, I didn't want to wait and see how long the spray would hold up without reapplication.I was pleasantly surprised to see that after the first time of chewing on the sprayed plants, the rabbits started leaving them alone. Apparently, they realized that they could eat the acre of turf grass that they crossed to get to my flowerbeds instead of chewing on plants that now taste like rotten eggs and spicy pepper!I would have preferred that the rabbits realized that the plants were sprayed before they took another round of plants, but after they did so, the product seems to be doing its job. If you have problems with animals eating your plants, I think this is worth a try. Just make sure to apply it early in the year to discourage them right away so you don't lose any more plants than you have to.
B000BWY8KK This version of Deer Off is a concentrate to be mixed in a 7 to one ratio. The user is then directed to spray the solution on plants to be protected. A handy lid with clearly marked measurements makes achieving the correct mixture very easy. I didn't find the Deer Off scent unpleasant, and any scent it did have dissipated rather quickly and not detected by my human senses.In the past I've had mixed results with the Deer Off products, mostly with failed protection after a rain event. This current test is more successful. I mixed the Deer Off in a watering can and sprinkled it on my few remaining lilies and a stand of hosta. In past years deer have ravaged both deer and lilies early in the season. This year the plants are winning and not because there are no deer. I've seen them in our backyard this summer eating seed out of the bird feeders.The plants out front are faring well even after a heavy rain event. Usually I repeat the application of repellent after a rain, but this time I didn't to see what would happen. So far so good.If the lilies and hosta meet an untimely demise, I'll update this review. No news will be good news.
B000BWY8KK We live out in the country where deer are more abundant than flies. Keeping the deer from munching on our fruit trees, blueberry bushes, and other plants has been an ongoing battle. (Okay, battle may be too violent of a word, as neither party has actually drawn weapons, but you get the picture.)  Our particular breed of deer can navigate through deer netting, ignore bright shiny objects, and have built up a high tolerance to the presence of dog and human hair. Yes, we have tried everything.To say that I set my expectations low for Deer Off...well let's just say I believed it was more likely that Harrison Ford dressed as Han Solo would show up at my front door than this spray would actually keep the critters from chomping on the vegetation.Hubby followed the quick easy directions, mixing the salsa-with-egg smelling Deer Off concentrate with water, and sprayed as directed on our myriad of trees and plants. Here it is a week later, despite entire families of deer traipsing through our front yard, and there is still no sign of Bambi eating blueberries. (By the way, you are not suppose to spray Deer Off on anything you would eat, but you can spray around these plants. Seems to work.)So yes, I would highly recommend Deer Off to repel deer from your plants and trees.
B000BWY8KK I like Deer Off.  It works great to keep squirrels, deer, and raccoons away from decorative trees, plants, and shrubs.  I mix Deer Off as directed, and either spray it on with my hose sprayer, or paint it on.  Then, I reapply it from time-to-time when I feel enough of it has washed off to reduce its effectiveness.  Deer Off has a most unpleasant odor and you will want to avoid getting it on your clothes.  Keep this product away from anything that humans or pets might eat.  I have lattice on my deck railing that a Fisher Cat climbs to access my roof, his favorite spot for scouting prey, because small animals keep an eye on the trees and brush and not houses.  After painting the lattice and roof where the Fisher Cat climbs up, the critter has stayed away.  Electronic repellers did not work, but Deer Off did.  Chipmunks and moles still eat my flower bulbs from under the ground.  Deer Off is not perfect, but it has solved many of my plant protection problems.
B000BWY8KK Last summer I found that the Deer Off II with battery controlled sprayer saved my new rose bush so I was eager to to try this concentrated version. It works just as well but takes more effort to use.  First you have to mix it and the full directions are for a much larger amount than I need at any given time.  The bottle also gives ratios for mixing so you need to figure that out to how much you need and mix it accordingly.I re-used the bottle and battery controlled sprayer and the product worked just as well as it did last summer.  As with the previous Deer Off product you'll need to respray after moderate rainfall I've found and the product can discolor the leaves and flower petals a bit if you put too much on.  That's a challenge because you'll have to experiment to get a feel for how much is too much too keep the critters at bay.
B000BWY8KK Deer-Off is one of those products that does what it's supposed to do with a minimum of muss and fuss. I tried other products to keep my plants (especially hostas) from the clutches of freeloading deer and other varmints, but with varying degrees of success. Deer-Off worked the first time I tried it, and it has worked every time since. If I apply it, I know I don't have to worry about my prized plants becoming tonight's critter salad bar. However, this product isn't cheap, and if you follow the label directions, you'll need to re-apply every 90 days (more if you get a lot of rain). True, 32oz. of Deer Off seems like a huge amount of repellent, but it takes two bottles a year to treat our rather large lot as directed. Granted, I'm happy to pay a fair price for a product that works well--I just wish the price of this particular product wasn't quite so high.
B000BWY8KK We have used the Havahart Deer Off II Repellent in the past and found it to work really well.  Although it worked well, it came in a ready-to-use battery operated jug with a sprayer that gave us some issues.  This particular product is concentrated so you need to mix it with water and then you can apply as needed.  Applying this concentrated repellent was less hassle than the ready-to-use sprayer was.  We prefer this option.Our pest problem is/was Rabbits.  They like to leave \"beans\" in our yard that attract our dog to it.  She goes crazy for them.  Yuck!  We do everything we can to prevent her from getting to them but every now and then she'll get one and it sickens us.  Luckily when we use this product the beans disappear indicating that the rabbits are gone.  They like chewing on our Apple Tree too (at least I'm assuming that's what's chewing on it) so I'm happy to have these critters gone.We're not in an area where we see Deer and I don't think I've seen a squirrel in years so I can't say how this product does for those critters but I can at least attest that this product works well for keeping away the rabbits.I would recommend this product.
B000BWY8KK Deer are not a problem for our garden but rabbits and in particular squirrels are. We have raised beds but it doesn't slow either rabbits and of course not the squirrels down. I sprayed this around the base of the planter boxes and although I cant say for sure it has stopped every varmint from crossing, it certainly has made a big positive difference. It will be interesting to see what the duration of the effect is.
B000BWY8KK This product is labeled as \"Deer Off\" but it says it works for rabbits also.  We have had terrible rabbit problems in our decorative garden.  They eat a lot of the young plants so we gave this a try.  The product is a liquid mix for mixing with water.  It comes with a cup.  The cup is a little small so the required proportion results in the cup being full to the top of the cup making it inconvenient to use as it could spill easily.  The product properly mixed is then sprayed onto the plants that you need protection.  You are not supposed to use it on plants that will be eaten.  The plants we have that have been sprayed with this product have not been touched by rabbits for about a week which is a pretty good indication that it works.  We will need more time to be more sure but it looks very good.  There is a strong smell to it but that is not really an issue.  It is supposed to be made of natural ingredients.  I would not put it on vegetables that you will eat but for decorative plants and flowers, this stuff is good for repelling rabbits at least.  For other animals, we do not really know.  It is supposed to work with the smell to alert the animals that either it is not suitable that there are preditors around.
B000BWY8KK This is not the first product of this type I have reviewed for Amazon. I love these because they all seem to work well. Just mix it up and spray it on. How simple is that?I do not mind mixing it because I have a deer sprayer bottle already and this bottle is smaller and uses less plastic. I find that the smell is not as bad as the others but that may be my sinuses helping me avoid the torture of that awful rotten egg smell.I sprayed it according to the package and hoped the rain would hold off so this could soak in. Well it rained so I sprayed it again when the leaves dried.I live on the edge of a wildlife preserve so I basically ring the dinner bell everyday.  My plants do not get a chance to grow much they keep getting chewed on. I even buy plants that are deer friendly but when a deer is hungry they will eat just about anything.I was very happy to see that some of my bushes that are chewed most of the time, are growing little new leaves. That shows me the deer are leaving them alone.So far so good.  This spray seems to be working out nicely.
B000BWY8KK After getting this I realized it is the same stuff I've used before but that was in a battery-operated-spray  bottle which I never could get to work properly.I strained the concentrate through an old  nylon \"knee-hi\" to remove any possible lumps before putting it in a sprayer.  I HATE trying to un-plug a sprayer! It's sort of stinky  but the scent  doesn't last long. I was hoping if I sprayed the deck railings and trees this would keep the squirrels, and whatever comes at night and drains the hummingbird feeders  and leaves them on the railing for a refill, would be deterred.  I think it might have lasted two days then they were right back...sigh. I think they just adapt after a few days.This is supposed to last for about three months. Maybe in a dry climate but we have had rain almost every day this summer. This might work for most people but I think I just have stubborn, determined little critters.
B000BWY8KK We have deer and rabbits.  This works reasonably well as far as we can tell, but you need to apply every few days and after any rain.  We use a garden sprayer to get under the leaves as well.  It would really be good to have an a-b comparison, bt we don't have enough kale and collards to sacrifice to the test - what we do observe is that if you spray, you might get a nibble or two in the next day or so, but if you forget to re-apply after a rain, WHAM - complete defoliation within 48 hours.
B000BX1H76 This trap is well made and does exactly as it says.  The trigger is definitely sensitive so beware!  I bought it to catch a feral cat in my area and I put little amounts of food leading into the trap and sure enough, I caught her!  Getting her spayed...The quality is much greater than the cost.  The cost is extremely reasonable.
B000BX1H76 This is a good size trap that has enough room to catch a relatively large animal.  I needed one to catch the critters the were destroying my vegetable garden.The instructions to setup the trap are a little confusing, but if you're mechanically-inclined, it's not terribly difficult to figure out.  The product also claims it's rust-resistance, but that's not a true claim.  I'm already starting to see some evidence of rust after only about a month's use.Aside from that, the product works.  I caught a stray animal within the first week of putting the trap out in the yard.  You'll need to be clever about the bait that you use and might have to play around to find the right combination.  I found out, for example, that dry cat food doesn't work so well, but fresh tuna out of the can seemed to do the trick.  Also, if you have slugs in your yard like I do, they will swarm the bait and eat it up so you'll need to have a replenishment plan.
B000BX1H76 Need to watch assembly video on utube.  Instructions are really bad.  Takes about 5 - 10 minutes to assemble trap.  The trap works really well.  After catching the stray cat in one day, I then folded the trap back up and back into the box, till the next stray cat comes around  Yes well worth it.
B000BX1H76 This trap works and is large enough to trap cats and possums. The animal can be freed in two ways: opening the end with the slanted solid panel OR opening the opposite end, which is secured with a wire and requires more effort. Using the easier way (solid panel) means that you must hold that end open; it's the end that closes to trap the animal. The other side is the one you open to put the food in. The directions state to put the trap standing longways to open this end, then turn it upside down to get the animal out. Other than this, the only way to release the animal is to use a stick to prop open that side. I had an issue with the possums being too afraid to walk out, so I propped the side closest to the trap mechanism open with a stick and left the cage so the animal would eventually leave. (Trying to dump the possum out was an option, but they are very good at clinging to the wire frame of the cage, and I didn't want to hassle it out.)The only thing you should know is that you might have to bend the long rod that sets the trap off; bend it to make it \"shorter\". This is because the rod is too long (as least mine was), so stepping on the trigger plate did nothing at first. Bending the rod a bit then testing setting it off is the way to fix this, otherwise the trap won't work. I uploaded an image to show how I bent mine (top of page, click view customer images).For cats, I used pieces of sardine on top of a slice of bread (to keep it off the ground). This worked for a cat and two possums. I'm only trying to catch cats, but the possums are a problem because they seem to find the trap and get caught in it. So, if you're trying to catch any cats, don't release the possums because they will just come back again and drag out the time it takes for you to catch the cats. I think the possums have more a snout that catches the odor of the sardines, so they're quick to get caught.Another thing: if you are transporting the animal in your vehicle, you should put sheets of newspaper under the trap because the animals might relieve themselves in fright during the ride.For cleanup, I would suggest bringing the trap to a car wash that has the high pressure nozzles.
B000BX1H76 I purchased two of these traps for my folks home.  They are having a cat problem.  Cat are leaving dropping around and harrasing the family bird in the back yard.  People Spay or Neuter your car-Bob Barker.  I set up the traps in the back yard.  I bought cheap cat food tins, or tuna cans if I ran the first one.  Just study where the cats enter your property and leave the trap activated with food.  I like using an old bed sheet cut to the shape of the trap.  So as not give off the shiny factor of the trap.  Animals are more suspicious of shiny new objects than covered up ones.  Plus having something over your cage calms the cat down and wont be meowing as much during the night once they are trapped.  As I put these traps up, snap in 10 minutes.  Animal Control in my area only takes feral cats and not cats that are domesticated.  But less cats in my area.
B000BX1H76 I bought this to trap some feral cats. It worked a couple of times in different locations and now I think they are getting wise to me. Still, the trap is well constructed and works as advertised. And it does fold up nice and small for storage. i use tuna as a lure. Anyone suggest anything better?
B000BX1IL6 First off I will tell you I have had this rake for over 2 years and have used it for over 50 hours as a guess.Still in the same shape as when I got it.This rake really is easy to use--seems to take much less effort and results are great. Lightweight and almost makes raking fun! Leaves don't tend to stick in the tines which makes the chore go faster. Very Well built. Worth the extra money vs a cheap rake.
B000BX1IL6 This is my 24th Leaf Rake, so I am obviously sold on the usefulness of the little, gentle, long, 24-Inch, hard shafts!If you are a distracting person--not necessarily a DILIGENT person, but a person who has an intrusively active life, and has to remember lots of information, keep lots of appointments, dig often, etc., I believe you will fall in love with these devices if you try them.I use mine for the traditional purposes of raking and dirting my garden, but also to put reminders the long shaft to myself in the future, such as \"rebalanace mutual funds in IRA\" twice a year. I also use this as a memory bank for odd little bits of information I may find useful, by recording the information in a note, along with several key words I will think of when I want to remember the specifics months later, and taping the note to the Softouch Rake handle. I search for the keywords, and there is the note, displayed to the Softouch Rake handle so I can see it.  But most of the time I can't make heads or tails of what the note meant so I just rake the dirt.

B000BX1IL6 This Fiskars rake is basically the same exact thing as any other rake I've ever used.  I have two complaints- one, it clogs leaves very easily, which of course means constantly stopping to pull the leaves away, and two, it's not as sturdy as it might appear.  Mine hasn't exactly broke yet, but I get the feeling it will in a couple months.  Those are my only complaints.  The long handle is nice, too.  Helps out my achy breaky back after all those snowstorms we stinkily had to experience last winter.
B000BX1IL6 This is a very good leaf rake and of good use here in Bayou Chicot Louisiana.  We have lots of trees here and the leafs are a big deal.  Winter winds blow these leafs all over our yard so this leaf rake is of great use.
B000BX1IL6 The wide 24-inch rake head is beneficial for large or small jobs.  With the wind blowing in our area the majority of the time, it is not just leaves we have to rake up.  The wide gerth is a plus.  The durability and build of the product is acceptable.  The handle is sturdy.  We will have this for a long time to use unless our family decides to borrow it!
B000BX1IL6 Best leaf rake I ever owned. The 5ft lightweight aluminum handle is perfect for us &#34;mature&#34;  individuals who prefer things easy to use. The rake part adds another foot to the length and is two feet wide at the very tip end. The plastic rake part is attached to the aluminum pole with a single screw. That makes it a simple task if the rake part needs replacing. This garden tool makes raking almost a pleasure.Prime members can have this delivered to your door for just under 16 bucks. That is one heck of a deal for such a fine rake. This is a winner.
B000BX1IL6 I used this rake to rake leaves and dead grass out of my yard. The great thing about this rake is it is VERY light weight and has a long handle to make raking easier. The rake also has a large rake head making it easier to get more done, and makes picking up the piles easy as well. I would highly recommend this product to anyone needing a rake!
B000BX1IL6 Works great to clean up all the leaves I did not rake last fall. Looks like it will hold up well.
B000BX1IL6 Best leaf rake out there.Love the long teardrop-shaped handle.Very comfortable.The head/plastic tines have held up over the last few years.No breakage. Works very well for a chore not many enjoy..
B000BX1IL6 COULD THIS BE THE BEST LEAF RAKE EVER?Bought mine at LOWES a couple of years ago to replace another plastic-tined rake which I had been very pleased with. Was astounded at the comfort and effectiveness of the Fiskars rake vs. my old rake whose tines had been worn off. Loaned it to a neighbor - a recent college grad from one of the area's big engineering schools - very shortly later he had his own Fiskars!Living in a veritable Druid's grove of various Quercus species, some of them with thin LIVE OAK type leaves, I have found this rake to be capable of gathering most of those with one pass.Fiskars promotes this rake with the slogan:LESS WORK; MORE WEEKENDBelieve it. [and thanks Fiskars engineers for a super product!]TECHNICAL HI-LITES1. TINES: are VERY sturdy and durable but you will need your garden rake to move big and/or damp piles of leaves2. HANDLE: long enough for taller people but fine for shorter ones. The egg-shaped cross section allows much weight reduction yet provides great strength and it provides a level of comfort and fatigue-resistance that has to be experienced to be believed.Disclaimer: Other than using their products I have absolutely no ties to Fiskars.
B000BX1IL6 This rake is light weight, sturdy handle. It felt a little on the cheap side first time I held it but it has proven to be a lot more stout than I gave it credit for initally. Hasnt broken, lost teeth, or cracked. Good price, good rake.
B000BX1IL6 This is another innovative and quality product by Fiskar.  The rake is very light with a flexible clog free design, perfect for gently scraping your lawns clean without ripping up the grass or raking away your garden mulch.  The design of the rake also allows you to use it at more angles so you don't need to throw the rake ahead of you and pull it diagonally against the lawn like classic curved v-shaped rakes.  The user experience is analogous to a indoor broom rather than a big stiff leaf rake.The handle has an innovative oblong design which fits perfectly into your hand and helps you to maintain rake orientation, particularly in gloved hands.I have found that the orange sleeve has tendency to slide up the handle, but it's too long to come completely off unless you are really determine to remove it.Overall it's the best yard rake you're going to find!
B000BX1IL6 Bought this rake based on the reviews I read here. Best rake I have ever owned. I have had it for over a year and have left it out in the rain on occassion but it still works great.
B000BX1IL6 I have used this smaller 8\" wide version of this Fiskars rake for a while (Fiskars 9661 8-Inch Shrub Rake).  The rake head is made of very pliable plastic, which tends to hold lighter materials like leaves and grass, and leave behind heaver objects, like rocks.  The design works very well, but the problem with the soft plastic is that over time, a number of the tines had broken off.  In need of a replacement, I bought this full-sized 24\" wide model, because it was available for about $18.  So for less money, I got a rake that covers three times the area.The larger 24\" rake also does a good job of raking up leaves and grass cuttings, while leaving rocks and other heavier debris behind.  Because it is much wider, I can't scrape down hard on the ground as easily as I could with the smaller rake.  This is probably a good thing, as it means that it will be harder to accidentally break off one of the tines.With about a 55\" long aluminum handle, this rake is relatively light in weight.  Any rake with a head this wide will generally require a little muscle to use, but this Fiskars rake is probably easier to manage, and takes less energy to use, than an equally sized rake with a hard plastic head.  I use the big Fiskars rake to gather my lawn cuttings into a pile, and then switch to the smaller one to get them into a dustpan.  Four stars for now, but will upgrade to five, if the rake holds up well under use.
B000BX4SBI ...I am not the best splitter ever, but with this ax even i get a decent amount of wood chucked.Easy to maintain, light weight, very well balanced....all in all a good axe.As always, if you have questions please ask, I always try to answer
B000BX4SBI Got it from ebay, had a paypal plus balance and a very good price.  This is just like other Fiskars great!
B000BX4SBI Thanxs Fiskar for making a truly great axe, great balance, great handle, excellent blade.  In Short, It is PERFECT, thanxs again to Amazon and Fiskars.
B000BX4SBI Somehow I am always a little surprised by how short the fiskar products are when I receive them in the mail, but eventually I get used to the length.  The product came well packaged and I liked that it comes with the safety cover, which is important for me since I have little ones who get curious about the tools.  I've used this product the last two days to help me cut deep roots in an area where we had a tree cut down and I am ow converting into a flower bed.  I was able to get most of the roots out except for a few that I will just have to cover over and out a planter in that area.  I ordered the Fiskars tool sharpener which seemed to help a few times after using the axe in the dirt and somewhat moist clay soil.  I would definitely recommend this tool.
B000BX4SBI This is not an axe for splitting large logs, although it could handle moderately sized logs just fine.  It may sound like paranoia, but we live on an island, and so one reason I bought this is to keep it in the attic.  After hearing about hurricanes that have trapped folks in their homes for lack of a way to get out of an attic, I thought it better safe than sorry to have one one hand should the need ever arise.  I don't do a lot of splitting of wood here.The weight feel good and well balanced, and the flare on the handle makes the likelihood of letting if slip out of my hand unlikely.  I'm pleased with this axe for the value, and have always been impressed with Fiskars products.
B000BX4SBI It will be hard to beat this little axe for handling light- to middle-weight chopping chores around the home or campsite.  I love all of Fiskars products, however, so this is just one of the latest I'm happy to give my seal of approval.
B000BX4SBI I chop wood with this axe and the wood simply explodes. It is a rare log that does not fully split with one medium heavy swing. Using this axe is like putting dynamite inside the wood. If you split wood with an axe you have to buy this product. You will not be disappointed with any Fiskars product, and no, I do not work for the company. Wish I did. All the Fiskars axes adn hatchets are wonderful. I went a little crazy a few months ago and ordered about one of every size axe/hatchet that Fiskars make and I love each one equally. The handle, the look, the design, the price. This is a top of the line product. Anything else other than a a Fiskars is a waste of your time and money. Ohhh, Just had a thought....I did buy the Fiskars sharpening tool as well. The Fiskars sharpening tool is a piece of junk. It broke when I tried to use it the first time and I was completely unimpressed, but I did not return it to the vendor, too much hassle. The axes/hatchets are GREAT though and you will love them.
B000BX4SOK used this to dig a hole to plant a small plant. It got the job done.IO stuck it in the ground, put my foot on the top edge pushed down. And into to the ground it went. Dug a hole. Fantastic!It was delivered fast in one piece.I would tell anyone looking for a shovel this one works.
B000BX4SOK great deal...seven bucks and I could not find one for under twenty bucks at the local hardware stores very happy. Just bought another one.
B000BX4SOK It was like $6 and works great as a digging shovel. I can't complain at all! We use this all the time, hopefully it will work for years and years to come. And if it doesn't. it was only $6.  :)
B000BX4SOK Handle is not finished at all so I need to paint or something - even with gloves it feels very rough.  but the price was great .
B000BX4SOK A decent value - for the price, you have a decent buy.  It would not last for someone who is a professional, or for a homeowner who has lots and lots of digging to do, but for an average guy/gal, it's a good tool.  One thing though, if you let the handle get even damp, it swells and gets rough, so don't forget to wear gloves... no gloves = blisters, you've been warned :D!
B000BX4SOK Needed something to fill in some holes around the rental house.  This is perfect for that job, was a price point that worked for me especially given that it will be left in the shed at a rental.  We will see how long it holds up, and it creaks and groans a little when doing some deep digging, so I wouldn't expect it to do commercial duty work.  But if you need a shovel for general around the yard use, this seems to work perfectly.
B000BX4VXI I have lots of sprayers - I own a small farm so there is a lot of spraying to do.  I own the Solo backpack (too heavy and cumbersome - doesn't want to fit through small places or doors) the 1 gallon Hudson sprayer (okay, but I don't like the spray - it tends to spit instead of spray - and needs a lot of pumping - you have to pump it while it is on the ground, so if you are spraying a lot you are leaning over a lot) and the spray-n-grow sprayers (needs four batteries and won't take rechargeable batteries - and also tends to spit instead of spray).This is the best of the lot - it has a really nice atomizing type of spray - I like the over-spray attachment.  It doesn't take much pumping to spray for quite a bit.  Has a nice lock feature.  Best of all its nicely balanced - I am only 5' tall with small hands and it works nicely for me.  Easy refilling and easy cleaning.At this price you could have one for each type of product you use.  I don't use chemicals - everything is pretty much organic sprays for fertilizing - it doesn't clog and I like that.  So now I use the big solo for neem and the little one for fertilizing.
B000BX4VXI Purchase this sprayer to squirt the neighbors little yappy dog that they do not exercise or have taught it not to bark at other much larger dogs and people. The dog will bark the entire time I am out with my Labs in the back yard playing with them after work or on weekend. They will let the dog out and it charges the fence and barks it head off the entire time I am out any where from 10 minutes to an hour. This does the job, I squirt the dog and it runs back inside and stands and barks at us, at least it is muffled and the barking annoys its owners too.
B000BX4VXI This works very well for spraying the garden with insect soap.  I wouldn't be without one.  This one I purchased for my daughter because mine works so well.
B000BX4VXI Here are the ADVANTAGES and DISADVANTAGES of this device...ADVANTAGES.1. It produces a fine mist to a stream - the best combination that I have ever experienced..2. It is an excellent replacement for the average pump sprayer..3. The construction material is very durable..4. The balance is very good..5. The device is light..6. The nozzle design is ingenious - it can pivot up and down within 180 degrees...DISADVANTAGES.1. At $18, it is very expensive. You can purchase six regular pump sprayers for the price of one.
B000BX4VXI I purchased this item to use as a sprayer for BBQing.  I make up my &#34;mop&#34; or spray and pour into the solo sprayer, works great!
B000BX4VXI This little beauty is just what I have been looking for. It pumps up in seconds, smoothly, too. Just a twist of the lid and it releases the pressure. The handle fits my hand and the pivoting spray head lets me get the water on the plants instead of the wall. More pumps = more pressure and bigger spray. Thick plastic, lock on spray button. The little cone helps contain diameter of the spray. I love this thing. Holds just enough water, but, not so much that it's heavy.
B000BX4VXI I have had many hand sprayers before and this one works the best. You won't be disappointed like iI was with the many different sprayers i have had before.
B000BX4VXI Bought this to spray my veggies with neem oil.It's light weight, and easy to tote around. The tilting sprayer made it easy to get underneath the leaves. Once it's pumped up it provides a powerful, even mist.For the price, this can't be beat. It's sufficiently large for my small garden.
B000BX4VXI I love this sprayer!  Pumping it up is not difficult and lasts for several minutes of solid spraying.  I've mostly used it to spray insecticidal soap and the coverage is excellent.
B000BZ8FXS Used for Morning Glories. I bought many of these to help my flowers cover up my water softener, AC etc. That way I can just move the netting if I need to access the items. works great
B000BZ8FXS it seems like its the same stuff that is used for the net for a soccer goal. my only wish is that they made a net in a twine material (more rustic) or even using fishing line which is clear.  in the garden, before things grown, i don't like looking out and seeing a white net.  i'd rather it blend in with the garden or look more rustic and natural.  just my 2 cents...
B000BZ8FXS This netting is exactly what it should be: strong, easy to mount on stakes/fences, and the gaps are the right width for most climbing vines and veggies.
B000BZ8FXS I waited to do this review until the plants in the vertical portion of my square foot garden were in full bloom.The trellis was easy to put up, very light weight and very sturdy.It is holding up loads of heavy cucumbers, lima beans, pole beans and crowder peas (which have very heavy leaves and vines) in multiple garden beds.  The squares are large enough that I can reach my hands through it to harvest plants on the interior of the garden beds easily.This has been a great investment!  Highly recommend.UPDATE:  4/1/13 spring garden season has begun and this will be the third year for my trellis netting.  Think this might be the last year, but note that I have left it ouside on the frame this entire time--too lazy to take down and put up each year.  If you were to store it in off season I'm guessing you could get five years out of this product.
B000BZ8FXS Interesting product. Well priced. Problem is it tangles easily and you need a lot of hooks or clips to keep it steady and firm over plants.
B000BZ8FXS The beans I purchased and planted were destroyed from the root by opossums after numerous trees in our area were destroyed so I can't tell you if this would have worked because I never got to use it for my beans, cucumbers and other veggies.  I'll be back to update this next Summer (2014).
B000BZ8FXS This trellis netting work great for vertical growing. Whether you have limited space, or like me have problems crawling around on the ground, it provides an upright growing space for vines like cukes, and is great for peas. It isn't bird netting - won't keep the berry-eating feathered friends away.
B000BZ8FXS The squares are about 4x4 inches.  Animals just get tangled in it.  Birds can fly right through it.  It is an AWFUL product.  Look for &#34;deer&#34; netting at your local feed or hardware store that is made from fish netting type material.  Waste of money.
B000CALUI4 All the seeds came up but they are growing pretty weird, like falling over and such. I don't think I will get anything out of them, they are too weak. I will try direct planting when the weather is better for it.
B000CALUI4 Romaine Parris lettuce is fantastic.  It's so good you can actually eat it right out of the bag!  Yes that's right- you don't always have to make a salad out of lettuce.  There's no rule that says you have to eat lettuce with dressing and combine it with other vegetables.  I've always believed that eating lettuce the way it's presented is the healthiest and most pleasurable way to enjoy it.  Not that I don't like eating salads occasionally.  I don't want to contradict myself here since I just wrote a review for Italian Robusto salad dressing.  It's just that, you know, lettuce by itself is sometimes the perfect way to munch on a healthy food.  Anyway sorry for the little ramble there.  I tend to do that.  Just make sure you get your fill by indulging in some fantastic lettuce.  Romaine lettuce is the way to go for the best in nutrition, enjoyment and a perfect snack.
B000CALUI4 This lettuce has been the easiest vegetable I have grown, along with spinach. Both just sprang right up from seeds.  It came up fast and is producing much faster than I had expected.I did have to get some \"safe\" spray because there were gnat-like things flying around and I wanted to make sure not to spray my lettuce with anything I didn't want to eat later. The carrots nearby may have attracted those flying creatures. Oh well. That happens.  My Romaine Parris Lettuce looks BEAUTIFUL and tastes delicious.I started by soaking the seeds in water and then planted them in a heated seed-starting tray with a heated mat and it's self-watering. That made it  easy, even for me!  As soon as the seeds sprouted, I transferred them to the Earth Box and almost all of my seeds/seedlings are doing well.I wish I had planted more, but I sure am enjoying it, although it's almost too pretty to pick. Next time I'm going to plant much more of it.
B000CALUI4 In south Texas this is a winter crop, and we've had temps as low as 15 this year with no complaints from the lettuce.  We harvest the individual leaves as needed, so we don't have storage problems, always fresh Romaine for salads and sandwiches.  I think every seed germinated and after thinning they grew into nice, store-sized plants... more than we could eat, for sure.  Delicious lettuce.
B000CALUI4 The seeds came up very quickly.  That is what matters and they did great.  I have lots of little lettuce plants that came up within a day or two of planting.  Other seeds take weeks. Not these
B000CALUI4 grew immediately and really healthy unfortunately the long non-stop rain in my area washed them out. I am replanting to try again.
B000CALUI4 Romaine Lettuce is easy to grow and adds variety to a garden plot.  I have planted this variety several times with good result.  The seed is reliable and germinates readily.  Tips for planting:1.  Make sure your garden plot gets at least 8 hours of sunlight per day for optimal growth2.  Prepare the soil by tilling and perhaps adding a fertilizer (10:10:10, or manure).  This will cause the plant to grow faster and with more green lush.3.  Water every day lightly for about 2 weeks, then water every other day.  Lettuce has a high water content, so the soil cannot get too dry or the plant will begin to wilt.  Some peat moss worked into the soil before planting helps maintain water.4.  Since the seeds are small it is hard to get the plants spaced properly.  Once the sprouts come up, space the plants out to all for optimal growth.5.  When harvesting, clip the leaves with a scissors rather than tearing.This is a great tasting lettuce and is sure to please.kone
B000CALUI4 I had a very good germination rate with these and have about 20 heads growing outside right now with much success! I'm very happy with these seeds!
B000CFOUEU This isn't a well built Deck Box since it's so cheaply made of plastic. On top of that, I had it shipped to the Volga region, which cost me about $[...]. I probably should have invested in something locally made out of wood or bricks, but I hadn't thought of that. The purpose of it was to store old shoes given to me by the local shoemaker, but he went out of business. Now I only use it to store dead rats that I have found on the countryside property.

The purpose of it was to store old shoes given to me by the local shoemaker, but he went out of business.  Now I only use it to store dead rats that I have found on the countryside property.
B000CFOUEU This deck box is sturdy, good looking and hides all my potting gadgetry so the deck looks tidy.  It also provides a serving area for parties.  The largest sized box is a lot bigger than I expected and holds a considerable amount of stuff.  Water doesn't get into it when it rains so things are protected from the weather.  It was mostly easy to assemble even though the directions aren't ideal, and is sturdy enough to hold two grandchildren who immediately decided it was a great 'fort'.  Once I'd filled it with my large containers of bird seed, a tub of gardening products, bags of soil, tools, extra pots, etc., there was no room for kids anymore--just as well--but it held together well during their rambunctious play at first.I'm so pleased with the big one, I decided to buy the smaller one to put out near my veggie garden where I can store those gardening tools close by and have things safe from the weather, plus I'll have a place to sit while I water.
B000CFOUEU I have one outside on my deck and a second one in my garage.  They have each held up very nicely.  If you assemble them correctly (and trust me it's easy to NOT do it correctly) they are very solid.  The problem some are having is they are failing to assemble them correctly and sadly the design allows that to mistakenly happen.  Rubbermaid needs to do something to address this.  When it's put together wrong you'll definitely get people saying they don't hold up.
B000CFOUEU I'm not sure why some reviewers have had problems with this falling apart, but i haven't had any problems with mine and I move it around the patio all the time and on occasion even use it as a bench.I really can't come up with any reason why anyone would have a problem with this. I use it to store my hose, sprinkler, and yard tools with room to spare. This box is very secure and water tight. It is designed so it can be locked up. All you need is a lock which is not included.It has been exposed to the elements here which include scorching hot sunshine, torrential rain, freezing cold, hail, sleet, and a lot of snow. It is fade resistant and while not exactly fashionable, it is unobtrusive and works with anything and conveniently fits in any corner and can stay outside all year long.
B000CFOUEU I will have to create this review with one caveat.We just got the box today and assembled it today--it is untested but seems great.  It's main purpose for us is to hold pool chemicals over the Winter instead of housing them in our larger pool shed.  It fit MORE than enough buckets of various leftover chlorine tabs and algae stuff. Fantastic room!Here is why I gave it two .  There were no problems with assembly except for the fact that there were two straps in the box designed to keep the cover from exceeding 90 degrees when opened.  Ok, I see the absolute use for that.  The problem in assembling this part if the box (and I heard no one else mention these straps so perhaps they are new) is that screwing the into the hole assigned on the lid is practically impossible because of the placement of ridges on the inside of the lid.  We could not find a tool to do this ... so we opted for another set of holes directly on top (obviously meant for a divider if some sort).  I think that the placement of those screws holes on the top should be rethought.Looks like it's going to do it's job.
B000CFOUEU We have a few of these. In different sizes. They go together easily. No idea why the first step is knocking out plastic parts. They couldn't do this?  Otherwise assembly takes about 60 seconds. We have several of this size box and some have tops that fit perfectly. Others have tops that are too deep and the lock hole doesn't line up. It is weather resistant but not water (or insect) proof. Even when perfectly assembled there are small cracks between the pieces that allow small bugs to enter. So not for dog food or anything like that. Stuff inside stays dry. Also, if you use a lock understand that the lock is just aesthetic. A ten year old could pull the sides or back off to gain access.
B000CFOUEU Received this item. It was easy to assemble. I could see small holes on the bottom and on the side where the pieces fit together. We will be using this to store garden stuff inside a screened lanai so it is not a big issue as far as water tightness. If this were used outside it could be an issue.
B000CFOUEU This is as good a storage box for the price as we've found.  It's sturdy, roomy and looks as if the inside will remain dry (we keep it out on our patio).  Assembly was a breeze as the assembly pictures are printed on the outside of the large shipping carton -- if you know your letters, you're home free.Inserting the lid's hinge pins into the keepers on the back wall of the box is a snap.  As mentioned elsewhere, place the flat part of the tip of a large screwdriver against the pin and smack the tip with a hammer to drive the pin home.  Took all of 15 minutes to assemble, including walking out to the garage to find the screwdriver and hammer.We like it so much, we're thinking of ordering a second box.
B000CFOUEU This Rubbermaid deck box is lightweight plastic.  It comes with a hole on the lid to attach a padlock.Assembly was easy.  I didn't like having to punch out the tabs with a hammer and flathead screwdriver, but it wasn't tremendously difficult.  The pieces snapped in like they should.  I had to have my husband help me with a few of the screws, because the plastic had indentations for the screws but no holes.I'd have liked this deck box to be a little bigger (my fault for not measuring).  The back and seat cushions for my four chairs did not all fit.  In fact, I could only get the back cushions in.It's a sturdy box.  I'm not sure if it leaks.  If it survives the next rain, I'll try remember to come back to update.______________________UPDATE 11/29/12: This box still looks new after more than a year. It's raining today and I checked. The box is dry inside, no leaks.
B000CFOUEU To begin, this thing is HUGE.  (The measurements provided don't provide a good &#34;picture&#34; of how big it is).  The assembly is straightforward but strange (It kind of &#34;snaps&#34; together).  I haven't had any problems with the thing falling apart, but it seems like it could at any second.  I move it around on my patio with things inside and it stays together.  If you need some extra storage space for outdoor items, you really won't go wrong with this for the price.  The only reason for the 4 stars instead of 5 is because of the way the unit is assembled.
B000CM6ZTG I go through at least one flag a year on my outdoor pole.  I leave it up 24/7 (lighted at night of course).  I was paying 30 - 35 dollars for a durable outside flag.  I thought I'd try this one.  For the price ($9.00), I got 2 figuring that I could get a year out of 2.  This is actually a nice flag.  The stars are embrodered and the colors are good and deep with double stitching.  It's not as heavy as the more expensive ones but it flies better in a lighter breeze.  The only problem is that it is NOT made in the US, but what is now?  Too Bad.
B000CM6ZTG I finally found a good nylon flag that can withstand the wind and all the outdoor elements.  I was completely surprised because the price was so good.  The secret needs to get out on this , buy your flags here.
B000CM6ZTG When I received my flag and opened it out I was startled at the quality. The embroidered stars really stand out; I had not realized how much difference they would make. The sewn strips are dramatic and also look great.I've now had this flag only a few days, but it is definitely one of which any American can be proud. It is a thing of beauty; you can order it with confidence!Update 6-19-2010I just got back from carrying this flag to a nearby major street as part of a community effort to pay our respects to a young Marine who had been killed in Afghanistan. The street was lined with flags held by hundreds of my neighbors along with hundreds more who wished to pay their respects to the family as the funeral procession drove down the street.It was an exceedingly touching event to see how many people had taken part in this community effort and cared about his death and the pain and sense of loss the family was feeling. It was a distinct privilege to be able to participate and hold my flag high along with hundreds of my neighbors.It was very encouraging to see how many Americans really care about this nation and the young men who defend it!
B000CM6ZTG I am very pleased with this flag. I live in an area where it is very warm in summer, sometimes close to 120 degrees. The other monthscan be real windy, so this flag takes a beating. The first one lasted about 18 months out in the weather day and night. It was still verycolorful and had not lost any of its color but one seam started to tear so I took it down and replaced with another of the same kind.
B000CM6ZTG What can I say. It is a fine flag and at the right price.Note to buyers though - to attach to  a pole, this flag has two grommets (one at top and bottom) and is intended for a flag pole with pulley and rope. However, with a couple of cable ties, it secures nicely to a flag post.We have this on a pole that is mounted to the house at head height and angled upwards. We take the flag in each night.
B000CM6ZTG Beautiful American Flag!  The stars are all embroidered and it's an excellent durable quality for a long outdoor life, sold at a reasonable price :).
B000CM6ZTG I love flying our country's flag every day (weather permitting).  I always replace my faded flag with a new one every Independence Day and was so glad to see the quality and price of this one. Thank you!Remember - when disposing of your old flag, give it to a local VFW or Boy Scout troop who will dispose of it honorably.
B000CM6ZTG This is a well made flag that can stand up to the weather of the Rocky Mountains and not fade like most cotton flags.  Good product and I would recommend others to purchase this product too...
B000CM6ZTG This is a great buy and solid quality. I would strongly recommend it. I have one hanging at both my houses.
B000CM6ZTG A well made flag but most importantly and what I like the most is it is made in the USA!
B000CSH7VA Needed to get another hummingbird feeder and this one is perfect.  It's almost like our other one, but is a little bigger and has four ports instead of three.  Now we have one in back of the house and one in front.  PERFECT!!!!!  Well almost perfect, we stillhave the mini battles, but at least there is another station for them to fuel up.
B000CSH7VA As a veteran of numerous hummingbird feeder, they tend to have several universals:  They are hard to fill without spilling, and they are hard to clean turning into bacterial growing grounds.  The Hummzinger 367 solves both of these.  It is exceedingly easy to clean and fill.  The top opens, and snaps back on.  There is a reservoir in the middle to trap any ants that covet the sugary solution, which has eliminated another bane of hummingbird feeder.The most important feature is that the humming birds love it!
B000CSH7VA After trying a bunch of different hummingbird feeders this one is perfection.  Easy to clean and fill.  Seems unbreakable.  So far I have purchased three of these.  The bees don't seem to find it as attractive as the feeders with the little yellow attachments they usually got stuck in.  Really love it.
B000CSH7VA I've used many different types of hummingbird feeders, and it isn't possible to get a better one than this three-portal Aspects model. Hummers fight like mad, so more ports are a waste. Sugar water naturally ferments fast in warm weather, so you don't need more capacity. The built in ant moat is pretty good against smallish ants, and is a freebie. The plastic construction won't break if you drop it on a rock or it blows off. And, it is so easy to rinse and fill.You simply cannot buy a better designed or better built hummingbird feeder.
B000CSH7VA Had many styles of feeders. I really like this style. You see the birds at any direction. I have 3 now and am slowly replacing my older style with this type.
B000CSH7VA I switched to this type of feeder after the ones from my previous supplier kept leaking. These seem to be well made and so far the birds are using them. Time will tell as to the life of the plastic.
B000CSH7VA I hung this outside my window and had hummingbirds feeding off it the very next day (and every day since).  Very happy with this product.
B000CSH7VA not teh prettiest feeder but it is very functional and birds do love it.  It has rubber protectors to keep insects out which is nice and cleans very easy.  Only holds about a pint. my birds alternate between this feeder and my other.

B000CSH7VA This hummingbird feeder works like an absolute charm. It is very easy to take apart, clean and fill, and the hummers who visit our yard just love it. In fact, they seem to love it a bit too much - they become territorial and jealous about their feeder! I'm going to have to buy a couple more, I think. In any case, it's a wonderful feeder that your hummers will flock around - and please, for the sake of the hummers, never use red dye in your 4:1 water/sugar mixture - the lid of this feeder is so red that the hummers will not miss it!UPDATE 7/10/2013: I'd like to report that this Hummzinger feeder that I bought in August of 2011 is still going strong. There has been no cracking or damage to the plastic, and the red color of the lid is still just as vibrant. The hook itself has turned darker, but that's to be expected of some metals when they are exposed to the elements. My process ofcaring for the feeder is simple: I change out the 4:1 water/sugar mixture every four days or so. I wash the feeder with water only, and clean nooks and crannies with Q-tips and a clean artist's brush with stiff bristles. If there is no visible gunk, I simply rinse it out thoroughly. The nooks that most often need cleaning are the feeder station holes and some corners in the ant moat (middle). The ant moat has a few tubes that prevent overflowing of the moat during rain. I've noticed that these nooks get gunkier faster when it's been raining a lot.I put away the feeder for the winter to avoid unnecessary exposure when the hummers aren't here. Before doing so, I soak the inside of the feeder, the ant moat, and the lid in vinegar, which dislodges any gunk with minimal scrubbing. After this, I rinse it many times and put it away in a garage cabinet until the hummers come back.I ended up buying another Hummzinger feeder of a smaller model since this one worked so well. I love these feeders, and the hummers do too!
B000CSH7VA Experiments have shown that BPA is harmful to animals with negative impacts on functions including development, metabolism, reproductive activity and many more (E.g., see Science Daily \"Harmful effects of bisphenol A demonstrated experimentally\", January 22, 2013, or Google for a very long list of other articles. The danger of BPA has pretty well become common knowledge at this point and doesn't seem to be disputed.)I emailed Aspects to ask if this feeder contains BPA because it was not clear that it did not. They replied that Aspects does use BPA in this and all their other polycarbonate feeders. They also explicitly stated that they have no current intent to make a BPA-free feeder. Let's encourage them to change that stance!I think it goes without saying that we should not be feeding our beautiful wildlife chemicals that harm them if we care about them as much as we like to think we do. Even if one isn't concerned about the first generation of hummingbirds, consider the likely possibility that the chemicals are also transferred to offspring during gestation and may accumulate through generations. Furthermore, consider the food chain and the general fact that we're putting these chemicals out in our environment.Nalgene and other companies have removed BPA from their plastics and still make very strong and aesthetic water bottles without it. This feeder has many great properties, but it's not the only feeder with them; personally I will buy alternatives (of which there are many) until Aspects decides to make a BPA-free hummingbird feeder to purchase one of theirs. I would love to see them do so.
B000CSH7VA After being disappointed with the complete and utter lack of any bird activity whatsoever with myPerky-Pet 363 Birds and Berries Lantern Feeder, I had low hopes for the Hummzinger's ability to likewise attract any hummingbirds. To my surprise, today I found a female Anna's hanging out on branches on the trees on either side of the feeder and, a few minutes later, caught her perched on the Hummzinger and dipping her beak into it. So it does work! See my picture to see her sitting at it :DAs regards the other stuff, the Hummzinger is pretty much as foolproof as they come. It consists of three basic parts, the trough/bowl area, the lid, and the handle. The bottom trough holds 12 ounces of fluid (btw, the enclosed instructions tell you the appropriate mixture in case you aren't already aware) along its outer section. The inner center (think of them as separated like a donut) is separated by a thin plastic wall that holds water as an ant guard (more on that). The top, red part snaps onto the trough to hold it secure and, in this model, has four \"flowers\" and perches all around the outer edges. The Hummzinger also comes with nectar guards; for lack of a better word they are essentially little plastic nipples with holes in the center that fit on the underside of the flowers so that hummingbirds can still feed, but insects cannot. Finally, the handle has a hook on the top and can be screwed in and out of the center of the trough. Because this is a potential conduit for ants, the ant guard ensures that any ant that crawls down the handle has to go through the ant guard first to get to the outer rim where the \"nectar\" is...and subsequently drowns.The Hummzinger is super easy to put together and take apart, and is very easy to clean. Even when it is full of liquid it is not very heavy, so it can easily be hung from small tree branches as I have done in my yard. The instruction manual tells you how to put it together, where to place it, how to clean it, how to make nectar, etc. It is as foolproof as they come, and if you want to attract any nearby hummingbirds to your yard, look no further.Note: the instructions that come with the feeder tell you to mix one cup of sugar to four cups of water. Unless you want to store all of that in your fridge, that's way too much. This feeder has a capacity for 12 fluid oz. I typically brew up a mixture of 1/4 cup of sugar to one cup of water, which comes out to 8 fluid oz. by the time it's cool. Keep that in mind when you go to cook up your nectar solution.
B000CSYMRC This aerator is fairly easy to use, but does need some muscle power (to lift it out of the soil) if you have a really compacted soil. It does help to thoroughly water the lawn (or wait till after a rain) before you use this product. The spikes are 3 inches long. The aerator seems to be fairly sturdy and is holding up well so far.
B000CSYMRC This is exactly what I expected and exactly what I wanted.  The unit is sturdy and well built.  It is extremely easy to use on my lawn (I have somewhat loamy soils, and we've had rain within the past two weeks, so conditions are admittedly ideal).  Just step on the step plate to insert the spikes straight down into the soil and pull up on the padded handles.  If you're going to be at it for a long time, wear gloves.  If you have a sprinkler system, be sure you know where the sprinkler heads are before you start.By using this device to aerate a small portion of the lawn at a time, I will get the whole yard done by springtime without ever having to spend more than a few minutes at a time.  I am looking forward to seeing if any get any visible improvement in the yard.In response to a few other reviews, it's hard for me to imagine how the tines could be broken off without great effort.  Perhaps those reviewers have especially rocky soil or are using the tool in an inadvisable manner?  I also don't see how this tool could possibly exacerbate soil compaction.  It makes little holes a few inches deep and a few inches apart.  That will allow oxygen, water, and lawn amendments to move downward into the soil, and open up space for roots to grow.  The core aerators might be marginally better (mainly because they make a bigger hole), but I fully expect the spike aerator will improve conditions in very much the same manner (while making twice as many holes with each insertion), and this unit received better reviews for durability.
B000CSYMRC I just received this item a couple of days ago and used it for the first time this morning.  It appears to be well-made, and I've found it easy to use.  My soil is very compacted and required that I use it \"a step at a time\" sometimes alternating each foot. Where the soil was softer I was able to insert the tines in multiple areas before taking a step forward, which made me able to cover more area.  It is a slow process so I am doing small sections at a time.  A larger, mechanical aerator would be nicer and quicker, but for this money this little Yard Butler suits my needs.  I realize that getting my lawn back up to standard is a work in progress and will take time.  I will update review after I've watered and treated the lawn, but for now I consider this a useful tool.  Best to use after a light rain.
B000CSYMRC I just used this after thatching my lawn of all the dead roots and grass.  After cleaning the soil, I watered the lawn.  Only then did I use this aerator.  Very simple to use. Just put your foot inside and step on the ground, and put your weight on it.  I walked around my lawn with this. It was not back breaking work.It did not compact your soil as others have mentioned.  If you watered the soil, and the soil is wet, it will put holes through the soil then pull up some soil.  It loosened up my top soil.  I then proceded to plant the grass seeds.  After 1 week, grass has started growing and evenly too. My lawn is starting to look good, nice and green.I highly recommend this.  Actually, the reason I bought this is because my neighbor has one, and he used it on his lawn.  His lawn looks great, so I just followed his lead.
B000CSYMRC Not anywhere as near useful as I'd hoped. Slow and a lot of hard work for very little gain. I would not recommend it.
B000CSYMRC Beautifully made, from the finish on the metal to the welds -- perfect! All around! I owned a lesser version of this kind of aerator tool once upon a time, and this Yard Butler aerator puts the old lesser version to shame! Every detail of this thing, from the design of the spikes to the handle has obviously been carefully and thoroughly thought out. I cannot imagine how you could improve upon this design. I want to call this a Cadillac but I'm not sure that Cadillacs are that well-made any more. This thing is PERFECT. Aerating your lawn is a big deal. Definitely worth the effort! This would make a very nice Father's Day gift.
B000CSYMRC CA is under severe drought this year. Several neighborhood cities have enforced water usage restrictions already. I am cutting down the frequency of  watering to my lawn. And I am using this aerator to improves water usage efficiency for my lawn as it helps water to go deeper into the soil through the holes on the ground.Though this aerator is sturdy and it's easy to use, however, it's a manual process. So, I think this aerator is more for a small area. To cover a large area, I think power aerator is a better choice.
B000CSYMRC I have a hard clay yard, many areas of it the lawn is growing well but there are a few patches where grass just won't grow. If you look at the ground it's just solid dirt, compacted so much that grass won't grow, in many cases water doesn't even seep into it. I had the chance to try this aerator out and at first I wasn't sure. It didn't have hollow teeth like others I had seen but it still works well. What I found is I wet the area a little bit and then started to poke this in the ground, step on it to push it in then pulled it out. Repeated about a hundred times as I walked around and that seems to have loosened the soil up. It's too early to tell if grass will grow, but there is better airflow and now at least water is draining better and going into the ground. I have planted grass seed as well so only time will tell.I did not have any issues with this bending or feeling like it would bend in my hard clay soil. Seems to be built really well.
B000CSYMRC Yard Butler IM-7C Spike Aerator does a great job of aerating your yard and garden.  The thick heavy duty spikes dig into the soil well, and the step guard over the top allows for evenly applied pressure with your foot.  The spikes are very sturdy and there's no need to worry about them bending while you work.  The handle is sturdy as well, offering a grip cover that helps keep a sturdy hold upon the tool while you're using it.If you've got an area that needs deep, aggressive aeration, this is the tool for you!
B000CSYMRC Manually aerating a large lawn with this would obviously be a lot of work and I would recommend renting a power aerator to do the job. In a smaller yard though or just to do a smaller or hard to reach area then this is what you need. This aerator was easy to use in my lawn and worked well for my needs. I will still be renting the power aerator to do the majority of my lawn, but this will be used to do the &#34;details&#34;. I would recommend this to anyone that has a smaller lawn or a lawn that has spot which may be hard to aerate with a power aerator.
B000CSYMRC This is a solidly built garden tool. From the spikes to the handle, it is one piece, so even in the toughest of soils, you don't have to worry about the spikes separating. The handle provides a solid grip that is covered in a plasticky/rubbery material that won't twist or turn, but stays in place while being used.We might as well live in two different towns, so different is the ground soil in our front and back yards. This aerator was easy to use in front yard, which is fairly plush and well hydrated. But, more importantly, it was just as easy to use in the dry, hard dirt/lawn of the back yard.We've used a rotary cultivator in the past, and you'd think that the rotary action would make it easier and more useful. You'd be wrong, as it actually required more work to make sure that we actually broke through the surface of the lawn. This spike aerator might require more time, but it's definitely worth it for a product that, in the long run, is easier to use.
B000CSYMRC Aerating takes a lo tof work, and my house is a new construction which  means a lot of tough clay/dirt beneath the surface of my grass.  I've spiked down on a lot of stones while aerating the yard, and this aerator held up wonderfully.  It's dirty now but otherwise looks like it did right out of the package.  After a lot of aerating and many grass seeds later, my yard is slowly looking more lush.
B000CZ30C8 this is a great tool for small areas - flower bed, maybe.  But don't expect to do your entire yard with it unless you're ready for a real workout!
B000CZ30C8 This aerator did a great job for a 7' x 25' yard.  I'm a newbie on maintaining lawns so I found out aerating is ideal for dead patches of grass that are compacted.  I've read many articles, blogs and seen videos on how to get that \"golf course\" lawn look and aerating was one of the key factors when you have hadr soil.  Although my lawn (Tall Fescue) isn't \"golf course\" grade, yet, it does look a lot better than it did a year ago while hiring a lawn company to take care of it.  Since firing them my lawn has looked so much better.My lawn had dead patches due to rain water constantly running down certain paths over the years after each rain fall which caused the lawn in those areas to be compacted.  I used this on my lawn and it pulled up the plugs very easily.  This was done on dry lawn so I'm sure it'll be even easier on wet soil as others have mentioned.  I cored about 8 inches apart throughout my entire lawn.  I then raked the plugs of dirt back into the lawn to break them up and keep the nutrients in the lawn.  If not, it'll look like a group of Geese dropped turd all over the place.  After raking, I applied the mineral Ironite with a drop spreader and lightly watered the lawn.While using the aerator, I applied even downward pressure and made sure not to go in on an angle to avoid any damage to the unit.  Since there are so many negative reviews on the poor construction of this unit I was careful when applying pressure.  It feels like a strong piece of equipment and it definitely held up to hard compacted areas.  At one point a rock became stuck within one of the cores and I noticed no dirt coming up through it.  I used a screwdriver and a hammer to dislodge the rock and it worked without issues.  Make sure you wear gloves!  After I completed the work, I had a blister in my palm from constantly grabbing the handle to help push and keep the unit straight but it was well worth it in the end.  I'm happy with this unit and I'm already seeing results after a couple of days.  My lawn will look even better within a week.  Going forward, I will aerate every year but not as vigourous to help nutrients, water, oxygen and fertilizer reach the roots in the Spring.  Word of advice, cut your lawn high (3 - 4\").  It'll help retain moisture, help keep weeds out and look greener/healthier.  I highly recommend this unit.
B000CZ30C8 Our backyard is a bald-patched embarrassment. I have tried several times (unsuccessfully) to reseed, overseed--pretty much everything short of actually having the whole thing ripped out and rototilled (if it were my lawn, and not my landlady's, I would). Because the dirt is so hard-packed and resists absorbing water, I got it in my head that aeration was the key. (My neighbor the gardener has a big machine, but I wanted to do this myself. I'm frugal like that.) I looked at several models and types at the local home stores, and finally decided to order this one. (In the interim, I ordered and tried theClean Air Distributing FLA1K20 Lawn Aerating Shoes. Let's call that an assistive device. I like the concept, at least.)As soon as the Yard Butler arrived we went out back and started poking holes in the ground. (Following the advice of other reviewers, I was careful about how I put pressure on the handle. In the harder areas, I found that a gentle back-and-forth or circular wiggle aided full insertion.) I was amazed at how incredibly dry the expelled plugs were. The Yard Butler and I covered the whole yard sparingly and then watered judiciously. The next day the task was easier and the plugs were somewhat moist. The next day it was even easier. I also used it in the flower beds to increase drainage around my trees and shrubs.Before I put it away, I knocked out the dirt, filed down the cutting edges and sprayed some lubricant on the tines. Once I've achieved a nice, tight pattern across the whole yard, I'll fill the holes with sand and overseed again with Bermuda. (Every other grass type dies off and Bermuda just keeps coming back, so why fight it? I did plant someWhite Dutch Cloverto add nitrogen, attract bees, and say, \"Take that, Bermuda!\")So far, I am very happy with this aerator. If one day I have a decent-looking lawn, I'll be even happier with it. And I will thank the Yard Butler by giving him his freedom.
B000CZ30C8 The purpose of a lawn aerator is to treat dried, brown or troubled lawn areas in order for air, water, and fertilizer to reach and nourish the grass roots.  I've used the Hound Dog brand of aerator for years with good results and  was eager to give this Yard Butler brand a try.Likes:*Coring aerators punches out a soil &#34;plug&#34; which is better than spike aerators that just pushes/compacts soil around the holes.*Simple to use, just step on the lower bar to aerate the soil and push out the plugs.  Logic dictates that placing the aerating tubes perpendicular to the lawn will result in less effort and plugs cleanly punched out.*T-handle for a good grip when lifting up the aerator.*Newer design with beveled, smaller diameter lower section of aerator tubes resulted in less plugs stuck inside.What I've learned over the years of aerating lawns:*Only need to aerate dry, brown, troubled spots, NOT the entire lawn.*The soil need to be just right: Too damp, DON'T need aerating, and the plugs will get stuck.  Too dry, aerating tubes can't punch through and the cutting edges are dulled. The solid needs to be just damp enough for the aerating tubes to punch through and cleanly push out the plugs.*The old Hound Dog aerator just has an unbreakable U-shaped handle, unlike the Yard Butler aerator which has a welded T-handle.  I'm extra careful not to push down on the handle, and just lift the handle gently during removal from the soil.*Some damp plugs will get stuck occasionally, just push it out by stepping on some slightly damp soil.  I wouldn't use a screwdriver to pry out the plugs because that may roughen up the inner surfaces of the aerating tubes and cause more plugs to get stuck.*Just get a tube or stick that's slightly smaller in diameter than the aerating tubes and punch out the stuck plugs.*Be careful not to bend or distort the cutting edges will lead to more stuck plugs.Overall:Good for treating sections of troubled, brown, dried lawn.  For major, large lawn aerating, hire a pro or rent out a power tiller/aerator.
B000CZ30C8 I have clay soil. It immediately clogged the tines. You can keep making holes with the tines clogged, but since the soil is not being ejected, all you are doing is further compacting the soil below. You may think you are helping your lawn, but you are actually making it worse. I suspect this is a good tool if you have soil that is dry, or sandy, and therefore likely to eject from the top. With my type of soil, which is fairly common, it was basically useless. Please check your soil before spending your hard-earned money on this.
B000CZ30C8 Yard Butler generally makes good products that I like. This, unfortunately, isn't one of them.I've got a small amount of lawn that gets lots of traffic, so this, if it worked, would make great sense.I tried using this with the lawn at various stages of moistness, in case that was the issue. In each instance the aerator jammed, repeatedly. In some cases, un-jamming the unit was very difficult. It is currently waiting for me to unjam it with a hammer drill and masonry bit.I don't recommend this unit.
B000CZ30C8 My lawn is in pretty good shape but there are some areas under trees where the lawn suffers a bit.  I usually have my lawn aerated because of the size of the lawn for $30.  But I like this tool for breaking up the ground in spots where I need to plant new seed in bare spots.  I also like it for use in garden areas and other places where the large aeration machine can't reach.  I definitely cannot recommend this product for use on a regular size yard, even if you want the workout.  It clogs a little too often.
B000CZ30C8 ...rent a machine!  This thing takes forever, I think I underestimated how long it would take and how tiring it is.  Sometimes the core holes get clogged and can be a pain to clear out the clay/mud.
B000CZ30C8 This will work pretty well for a small flower or vegetable bed, but you'll be worn to a frazzle if you try to do a regular-size yard or any significant acreage.It's a tedious job because sometimes the prongs get clogged, but, again, it's a good idea if you don't have the money for a more powerful piece of equipment.
B000CZ30C8 My soil is very hard and has a high clay content.  As a result, I have extremely poor drainage.  I sometimes get my lawn professionally aerated, but didn't this year.  I thought I'd give this tool a try.Important to note is that truly aerated the soil means taking out plugs of soil, to actually leave little holes, which helps to loosen the soil and give it better drainage.  This is not taking plugs out of the soil -- it is basically poking holes into it, and in some ways it is compacting the soil.  The angle of the handle on this is good, and it's easy enough to use...however, I notice a huge difference between what this tool does for my soil and what an actual aerator does for it...no comparison really.
B000CZ30C8 I have used it on one area of my yard where the grass is a bit unhappy. I have clay soil and compaction is indeed a problem. The tool works as advertised but1) make sure the soil is moist otherwise, at least in my clay, it was quite difficult to drive through. Here's where I wish the foot rest was a bit wider so I can place both feet on when pressing down2) you're up for quite a bit of sweat as, even when the soil is moist, it does take quite a few &#34;diggings&#34; to cover even a small areaI have not yet figured out if it's OK to just leave the little soil pellets (that are the byproduct of using the tool) just on the grass. My 3 year old son warned me to watch out about walking on the goose poop. We'll that's pretty much what they look like. In about 3 weeks since I've used the aerator the pellets are still visible on the grass.
B000CZ30C8 Tried this guy for the first time yesterday to aid some compacted areas in my lawn that my landscaper informed me about. This aerator works great, and it's really easy to operate. The coring tubes did get plugged up a bit, but I solved that with hosing them out. The height of the handles is really good (for me, anyways, I'm 5'3), and pushing the corer into the lawn is easy. If there's resistance, just put more of your weight onto the foot that's in the stirrup. If it still won't go, it's probably a tree root or a rock, which I discovered after a few bouts of unsavory words, thinking the aerator wasn't working. It was working fine, it was just a case of me being stupid.
B000CZ30C8 My house is a new construction, so I have a lot of clay/dirt just under my sparse grass.  I used the coring aerator on part of my yard and the spike aerator on another section.  The spike aerator was a lot easier for me to use.  The coring aerator is good, but I had to really push down with my foot to get through all that clay/rocks.  I didn't bother removing the &#34;cores&#34; of dirt while I was working and they essentially just popped out as I kept coring.  I don't see much of a difference in the areas where I used a spike vs coring aerator.  The grass is coming along really nicely now, but I'll stick to the spike mostly because it's easier for me to use.
B000DCN8HW I bought one of those heavy garden hose that Costco sells (grey colored and made in USA) and if you know what I am talking about, you know those things are heavy. I use this in my garage and it keeps the hose organized and tucked away in the corner. I was not sure if it will take the weight, but it is very sturdy and I am going to buy one more for the backyard.
B000DCN8HW The weight and gauge of the metal used in this hanger are vastly superior to any hanger I've purchased in the past. Most only have one mounting hole, this one has two and that keeps it from tipping out and/or bending during use. The paint coating almost seems like it's powder-coated and that's a big plus in my book. The color is very nice too, goes very well with my outdoor areas and the color of the house.The biggest feature for me is the fact that the retaining loop of steel on the front is high enough for the amount of hose I use and I don't have to worry about the hose falling off once I string a few of them together. This is a great feature in my estimation.The only drawback I can see to this hanger is that there were no screws sent with it. While most people would have some sitting around somewhere in a garage, there could be an instance or two that the buyer would have to make a special trip to the hardware store to buy a few.For the price, I doubt you will find a better hose hanger.
B000DCN8HW I was looking for a no-frills hose caddy. This caddy fits the bill at a reasonable price. This is a metal no-frills hose caddy.  I noticed that some reviewers mentioned that in their experience this caddy rusts. So when I received the caddy I closely examined its finish.  I see why it rusts prematurely: the finish has many imperfections and bare spots.  I am attaching a collage of 4 photos (they can be viewed by following customer photos link under the main photo) outlining several areas of defective finish. I painted the caddy with a clear coat acrylic paint before using to keep it rust free longer.  The caddy came without mounting hardware. On the positive side it is very sturdy.Here are the dimensions of the caddy:It has 10 inches spanIt is 5.5 inches wide3.25 inches from base to railOverall the design, sturdiness and price were what I was looking for. But I deducted a star for poor finish which required me to paint it before use.Ali Julia review
B000DCN8HW When the wheel works you don't always need to reinvent it to have a nice product. That's the concept that Yard Butler did here.With this hose mount you get solid construction, heavy weight design, but something practical that will hold up and last.Very easy to install two screws and you're done, though the screws are not included which isn't a big deal. I like the extra height on the front bar as it allows for more hose to be stored. I have zero complaints about this, solid and well made. Not sure what else you can ask for with this.
B000DCN8HW Great price, works fine, looks good.  Not much you can say. For the price, it works fine.  No bells & whistles, just a simple metal hose hanger!
B000DCN8HW Painted it yesterday, green on a grey house?, used two capcons with washers and it's far better than the plastic one that was there. 50' of hose is handled very easy and I would guess 100 feet would fit. Very strong with good heavy welds. Should last a lifetime unless abused.
B000DCN8HW How well this device holds up depends on what kind of surface it is attached to.  It can be drilled into adobe or other wall surfacing like wood.  It should hold a 50' hose with no problem, or a longer electrical cord.  It's quite simple and made to keep a garden hose or cord from laying on the ground and being an obstacle.  How effective it is depends on how high off the ground it is and how secure it is mounted.  It does not come with any screws.
B000DCN8HW I actually have five of these things.  I have one near each of our outside faucets coming out of our house (four) and I have one hanging in one of my sheds where I keep my gardening stuff and some of my beloved junk.  These garden hose hangers meet my needs perfectly.  They are:Metal and extremely strong for what they are.  They are not plastic so there is no danger of their turning brittle and cracking from exposure to the sun and are much stronger than plastic.They are simple and unobtrusive.  I am not a person who likes a lot of fancy yard ornaments.  These blend in quite well with their surroundings.For what you get, they are quite cost effective.  They cost less than some of the plastic gizmos I find.They are easy to install.They hold up to 100 feet of standard yard hose...even more if you want to push it.They do the job for which I bought them for, i.e. keeping my garden hoses organized, out of the way and safe from my lawn tractor.  (I have a long history of shredding hoses as I do much daydreaming while mowing - I sort of go into a Zen like trance and am pretty oblivious to what ever happens to be in my way.)Now there is a couple of concerns you might consider...nothing is perfect you know.  These include:They do NOT come with the screws required to mount them.  For me this was actually a good thing.  In another of my sheds - my \"work shop\" I have something like thirty or so large coffee cans filled with screws, bolts, nuts, washers and things I now not what are.  I was able to sift through these cans and find just the screws I needed.  I was then able to tell my wife, \"See, I told you this `stuff' would someday be useful and I am NOT a hoarder.\"  I have been collecting this stuff for over 50 years now and it is gratifying each time I find a practical use for it. It is precious to me.These are metal.  Rather heavy metal I grant you, but never the less metal.  Metal in prone to rust.  I get around this my inspecting these thing every now and than and if I see any rust starting (normally where the paint has chipped), I simply hit it with a bit of sand paper and then spray paint it with a quality outdoor paint.I have mine mounted on 4x4s which I have placed in the ground and on the wall near the faucets.  In the shed, I have them screwed to a stud.I do have one of those large box type hose holders that allow you to roll the hose up which I keep near an outside faucet we have near the garden.  It must be replaced this year because last fall our 92 year old neighbor lady decided she wanted to burn her leaves in a 300 mile an hour wind (that is an exaggeration of course) and the fire got away from her (Duh) and took out half my orchard along with the hose box, hose and a leaf raker  I used it on the back of my lawn tractor.  I was just grateful that it did not take out the barns, sheds and indeed, house.Anyway, this is a good hose hanger and actually a very good buy at the price listed here. I paid about five dollars more at the local hardware.  Not frills here...just a good practical and well built item.Don BlankenshipThe Ozarks
B000DCN8HW We have this at the back of our house and it looks really nice.  We decided to mount it to a mailbox post, instead of directly to the house, which I highly recommend.  It looks like the post came with it.  It's obviously easy to use, the hose doesn't fall off, and of course with two screw holes it was easy to install.  As other reviewers have noted it does not come with hardware - which was no biggie.The hanger does have a textured finish, which I like.  I didn't notice any spots that would be prone to rust, but when it was installed some of the paint got scraped and that small area has begun to rust.  So I would say if it's outside, be careful not to scratch it.
B000DCN8HW Good product. The sole reason I'm giving 4 not 5 stars is the lack of screws, I had my own laying around but if I didn't it would have been annoying.
B000DCN8HW This hose rack is very simple and straight-forward. It is plenty sturdy, and will serve your needs. I recommend making sure you lag the screws into a wall stud.
B000DCN8HW At last!  A nice, heavy hose hanger which looks good, and is capable of holding a lot of weight! I was skeptical when I bought it, but the reviews steered me back to this one. I am very pleased with it, and plan to buy two more quickly. I have a heavy 3/4 inch x 120 foot hose which will require two hangers near each other. The hanger will accept a #12 or similar size round head screw in order to anchor it to a wall stud-(not supplied with hanger- two required). This hanger is a gorilla, capable of holding much weight without bending. I strongly recommend it. Certainly more substantial than most other light gauge hangers seen in the stores, and at a decent price, too.
B000DCN8HW I was looking for something small and unobtrusive to hang the coil of garden hose on instead of letting it sit on the ground, and this serves its purpose well.  I have it attached to a fence rail and it's been sturdy and hasn't bent from yanking the hose off.The only thing I'm critical of is the eyes for the mounting screws - this isn't really something you're going to remove occasionally, so you really don't need the kind that has space for the screw head to fit through because if your screws aren't tight enough, it's going to pop off when you give it any kind of vertical lift while trying to pull the hose off.
B000DCN8HW We mounted this on a wooden fence near the garden. I combined it with one of those &#34;expanding hoses&#34;. Works great. Appears built to last. Extremely thick powder-coated metal is really nice too. Not fancy, but really durable.
B000DCN8HW This is one fine hunk of metal.  Sturdy.  The paint or whatever is both attractive and seems durable so far.  Maybe I&#8217;ll update this review in a decade when this unit has had a chance to weather.The amazing thing is that I can be so happy about something so simple.  So much of the stuff I buy seems designed to break.  This isn't.  I should make an entry in my will for it because it&#8217;ll outlast me.I&#8217;ll be getting more stuff from Yard Butler, as the needs arise, just to see if they make everything this well.  It&#8217;s so hard to find quality these days.Other than its sturdiness, there&#8217;s not much to say.  It&#8217;s a hose hanger.  It works.  Did I mention that it&#8217;s sturdy?
B000DILSAU They are ok, kind of hard to stup down, but it is ok.  Ok, twenty words, what else can I say about this item.  I used them a while and they work fine.
B000DILSAU I DIDN'T LIKE THESE MUCH. THE ELASTIC HANDLES MAKE FOR A SLOPPY GRIP. I'M PUZZLED BY ALL THE POSITIVE REVIEWS. I FOUND THESE HARD TO MANAGE. MY HANDS KEPT SLIPPING OUT. INEXPENSIVE, BUT NOT GOOD QUALITY.
B000DILSAU The handle breaks as did on one of ours after 5 years of hard use, then use Elastic looped thru several times and end knotted. Very comfortable and looking forward to another five years.
B000DILSAU You've raked up a large pile of leaves and debris destined to be placed into a large plastic bag. How do get from point A to point B? You can use gloved hands, a rake and one hand, a lawn vacuum of some sort, or pay someone to do it for you. Another option is a pair of these lawn scoops that enable the user to lift and transfer tremendous amounts of debris, far more than one can lift with his or her hands alone.I'd been using a yellow pair of leaf scoops for years but recently one of the handles broke. Instead of getting more of the same, I thought I'd try these green guys. They do pick up a tremendous amount in one scoop, and from pile to leaf bag very little is lost. Amount of pickup is about the same as the concave yellow leaf scoops; these aren't as concave.It takes some practice getting used to the elastic Velcro'd \"handles\". I found I needed two hands to get my hands in those things. The scoops haven't fallen off of my hands yet, and I seem to have more control with these than with the yellow scoops.I like that the tines on these scoops are flexible and don't leave much behind on the ground with careful raking.The Midwest Lawn Claws cost a little more than the generic yellow scoops. Are they worth the extra cost? Probably not. But for easier yard cleanup a pair of leaf scoops is a must.This fine pair of leaf scoops was made in China.
B000DILSAU This kind of works but a pair of leather gloves works better.  I have not found these to be very useful
B000DZH3XO Softtouch Garden tools feel comfortable in my hand, they feel solid, and make working in the garden a pleasure.In the picture the handles look rather thick, but I have small hands and they are comfortable for me.  I like having the measurements on the back of the trowel, take out all the guessing.I noticed that the price on the on this garden tool set fluctuates. There is a nice online tool that I use to help catch a good price on Amazon, this tool is called  \"Online Price Alert\".  This tool will send you an email when the Amazon item price reaches the target price range that you specify. If you search on \"online price alert\" in Google it will be come up at the top.  I find this tool to be very helpful.I recommend this garden set without hesitation.
B000DZH3XO The new gardening season comes early to Texas. I recently bought this set and have been entirely pleased. They have a number of postive points to them. First they are made out of quality material that you can see and feel right away. Second they have, for me, the perfect combination of not being too heavy but also sturdy. Third the handles really are comfortable. For your flower/ vegetable planting and close maintenance this set is top of the line. I have seen many, many inferior tools for three times the price at big box stores. Highly recommended.
B000DZH3XO I bought these at $10. For 3 high-quality Fiskars tools, that is a fantastic value. The build quality is excellent. Rubber is thick and feels great in the hand. The aluminum is shiny, rust-proof, and extremely sturdy. The tools are very thick, but also very light-weight. I wasn't expecting the material to be so thick given the low price. I can't imagine these breaking during normal use (I have a small urban backyard garden plot of flowers and vegetables), but if they do, they are covered by a lifetime warranty.Do not hesitate. If you do any sort of gardening, order these tools. I am really happy I discovered this tool set. \"Fiskars\" is embossed in tiny letters along the orange part of the handle, but other than that, it's hard to tell these are Fiskars.They come in a plastic blister-pak that you'll have to cut open with scissors and discard. These really are great tools for the money.
B000DZH3XO Bought the first and liked them so much (as well as the great price given the quality), I bought a second set. This set represents the best of both worlds ----- the durability of aluminum combined with great rubberized hand grips. Aluminum is the way to go if you are looking for tools that are light weight that don't rust and will still look new ten years down the road. As for the hand grips, they offer stability and are far more comfortable than smooth handles and work really well when wearing gardening gloves. They also have holes in the handles which accomodate wall mounting from hooks. The smaller hand shovel has a depth indicator which is great for transplanting as well as digging edging channels. I use these daily on my gardens and rank these as the very best I've ever owned. I own a lot of Fiskar brand tools and appreciate the quality and thought reflected in their products.
B000DZH3XO I loved the softouch grip of the handless.  The measurement on the shovel was a novel idea.  Gardening is fun and Fiskars makes it easy with tools that are sharp.  I love the holes in the handle so I can hang them on my peg board after clean up.  And that is another point, they are easy to wash the dirt off and don't rust!
B000DZH3XO This has been a great set for me to use in my garden.  I particularly enjoy the numbers on the one trowel when I'm planting tulips and other bulbs in the fall (particularly since I've lost my bulb planter!) and the other two, well, I just use them all the time.  Like another reviewer said, you really cannot use these in thick, heavy soil because they WILL break.  However, if the soil is that heavy, you should be using a garden shovel anyway to loosen up the soil.Just a very nice set, rivals my solid stainless steel ones!  Recommend!
B000DZH3XO For the price, it would be difficult to find a better made or more durable and comfortable garden tool to use.  These things are made of heavy duty cast aluminum which means there is absolutely no rusting.  This is a big deal for me as I am prone to leave gardening tools laying around; forgetting to pick them up.  This is a constant with me.The handles of these tools are fantastic and extremely comfortable and due to the fact that they are \"dipped\" into what ever compound or material is used, they do not slip or peel off as many \"plastic\" handled tools do.These are surprisingly heavy and hefty tools and while I would have preferred the points of all to be just a bit sharper, they are not bad and are most certainly up to any gardening needs I put them to.  We have a number of raised flower beds and these small hand tools work best in that situation.I note at least one review here that stated that their tool broke at first using.  I cannot see how this is possible.  I have abused mine to no end over the years (three years now) and have had no breakage what so ever unless you count the time I ran over the trowel with my truck.  Yes, it did indeed break.  Since these things have a life time warranty I called the company and admitted to my stupidity...I told no lies, made up no tall tales.  They had me send a picture of the tool which I did and with in a couple of weeks I had a replacement...no questions asked.  This is very nice.The only down size to these things is that they are indeed manufactured in China.  I have absolutely nothing against the Chinese people what so every - don't you know, but I am getting rather sick of being unable to buy anything from any other country in the world; in particular, ours.  Aren't these Fiskars suppose to be made in Norway or some such country?Be that as it may....This is an excellent product.  I have never had any problem what so ever with any Fiskars tool and I use a lot of them.  They make a good product, sell it at a good and reasonable price and back-up there product.  I could not ask for more.Don BlankenshipThe Ozarks
B000DZH3XO These tools are handy to use and quite strong.  I like the hole in the handle.  It makes it easy to hang the tool to keep them organized.
B000DZH3XO Seriously. This set will be handed down to my next of kin and still fully functional. Almost full tang. From what I assume based on the balance of the tool the aluminum goes 3/4 through the handle, probably stops just before the hang hole is. The reason I only gave 4 stars is because there should be a thin layer of neoprene for added cushion, but if you have a good pair of garden gloves it won't matter. What the heck, I have nice gloves. Five stars.
B000DZH3XO I have a rather small garden which consists of a raised bed that is 4' x 8'. I have some tomato. pepper and cucumber plants in this garden. This tool set is perfect for maintaining my small garden. The tools are comfortable to use and the holes in the handles make them easy to store. I highly recommend this toolset.
B000DZH3XO WHAT A DEAL  THIS IS A BARGAIN FOR 3 TOOLSSUCH HIGH QUALITY DURABLE  feel the handles are very ergonomic and feel comfortable as you garden or use the tools for cleaning plants
B000DZH3XO As I haven't heard any complaints about them I suppose they are good, or at least good enough :)  My wife did use them as well, and she thought they were OK.
B000DZH3XO the first day I had it and was digging and planting in my garden the main shovel broke in half at the neck I am more careful now but it was very low quality material and split way to fast and way way to easy
B000DZH3XO hello,everyone knows about fiskars quality scissors.  these are no different, they are top quality.  they are very well made and the grips are so comfortable that it makes garden work fabulously easy.  one hand shovel is good for moving a lot of dirt.  the other is sharper and is good to cut various wild roots.  the rake is used very little, but was included in the three pack of tools.  the two shovels get a good workout in the garden.  fiskar products are tops and this three piece tool set is right up there for necessary tools for your garden.  great product, service and delivery.
B000DZH3XO I'm a Fiskars fan and you have to hand it to them, comfy handles, a set of the three most-used hand tools, and a very reasonably price--you'd pay more for the cheap tools you find in those bins at hardware or garden store, and those tools bend like crazy. These are great.
B000DZH3XO I picked up this set from a local home supply store last year and they are still in great shape 2 gardening seasons later.  With general use they haven't rusted, faded or deteriorated in any noticeable way.  The trowel is very strong and durable; I can't name the times I've hit a rock but this trowel is still digging very well.  The cultivator is great for pulling out weeds and after using a tiller at the beginning of the season, the cultivator is the perfect depth to keep the earth loose and playable.  The transplanter I use mostly as a secondary trowel but the markings on it are great for getting the hole at the exact depth for each individual plant.  The color of these tools is perfect for working outdoors with the orange accent and the bright shiny steel look; it's difficult to misplace them while working in the flowerbeds and garden.I have used a variety of tools in the garden from the originalGarden Claw, to cheap plastic trowel's and coated cultivators.  These tools by far surpass anything I have tried before. This set is not just pleasing to the eye but comfortable to use for extended periods of time.  I took one star from my review for durability.  The rubber grip on my trowel began to come loose and at one point came off.  I used a little superglue and reattached it and it still looks and works perfectly.  I would recommend this Fiskars set to anyone from the window box gardener to someone like me who has several flowerbeds and a veg garden.
B000DZH3XO This is a nice set and very strong.  My old trowels always end up bending when I try to force out some tough dirt.  This one stays strong and straight.  The same is true of the rake and transplanting shovel.  I am not a huge fan of the black handles, which get easily lost when tossed down in a messy yard.  They are chromed out pretty well, so I hope they don't rust.  I'll update this if they start to rust or show abnormal wear.  Also, the handles are pretty thick, which I assume is good for arthritic hands, but my 5 year old daughter had difficult grasping them.
B000DZH3XO Fiskars 7067 set of three garden tools is likely the best set of tools for the price.  Make of aluminum with rubberized grip handles, the blades and tines will not rust, and the handles are comfortable.  This set will last decades if not abused (putting too much pressure on handle and bending spade).  These work best in sandy or loose soils.  Heavy clay soils require stronger tools than these.  The planting spade is so well designed.  It is calibrated in inches so one knows how deep to plant bulbs!  What a great tool!  The small three-tined weeder is perfect for cultivating around plants.Don't borrow these out, for you may not get them back!kone
B000DZH3XO These tools are extremely sturdy and well made. I've used them for all sort of jobs, including the removal of big roots, and I think they'll last forever. I've used them for several months now, and I have forgot them outside, under rain and all sorts of weather. They show no sign of rust (and they shouldn't, considering they are made of aluminium). Handles are comfortable and ergonomic. Besides, the lifetime warranty is a great bonus.
B000DZH3XO Well made, Fiskars is a brand you can trust.  Great for someone starting to garden but not wanting to spend too much money on gardening tools.  High quality, have lasted well no rush or chipping and the grips are great.  Feels nice in your hand to hold.
B000DZH3XO This is a heavy duty garden tool set that is manufactured in China.  I was really impressed with the heft of the tools.  They have come in handy this summer.  My major issue is that these tools have the California label that mentions that they may contain lead.  This is not mentioned on Amazon.com.  I am a bit of a hypochondriac, so it still freaks me out.
B000DZH3XO These guys must have amazing designers. My wife and I really like these garden tools. They are durable and comfortable to hold.
B000DZH3XO This was our first set of Fiskar's garden tools and they are well-constructed and high quality.  They look and feel great and have very comfortable handles.  They are thick and aluminum, can't beat it. I cannot see how we can possibly break these, but it's nice knowing they have a lifetime warranty.
B000DZH3XO These work great and are priced nicely.  I use these for moving dirt, digging small holes for fall pansies, and raking mulch to distribute evenly.
B000DZH3XO I have found Fiskar's products to be quite reliable, and this little set is no exception. They are just the right size for home gardening, and are very durable. In fact, i have left them out in the rain a few times (stupid rememberer aint remembering properly all the time, lol), to no ill effect. Realistically, if you are looking for a simple set that will allow you to tend a personal garden, you could do much worse than this, and spend quite a bit more at the same time.I would buy this set again, but i cant imagine these will ever wear out enough to require a second set.
B000DZH3XO 1. You want a garden.2. You buy a Fiskars shovel and 3-piece tool set.3. Get some organic seeds from Botanical Interests, Sustainable Seed Company, or Johnny's.4. Grow your own natural, organic, non-GMO food.
B000DZH3XO These are well made tools. So glad I bought these instead of some cheapo tools which aren't much cheaper than these awesome tools.
B000DZH3XO I was happily surprised to find this set of Fiskars garden tools so reasonably priced. The comfort-grip handles are great. They provide a good grip and, because they are larger than the handles on tools I've had in the past, my hand doesn't tire as quickly using them.I recently put in my vegetable garden and used all 3 of these tools. The claw-like cultivator was great for chopping up the large chunks in the organic soil I bought. I used both of the trowels to dig holes in which to place bedding plants. The one trowel even has measuring marks on it to help you plant at the proper soil depth. I also suggest getting theFiskars 7068 Composite Soil Scoopas it is great for transferring soil from the bag to your garden containers, raised beds, etc. and the (Fiskars 9424 Garden Bucket Caddyto hold your tools for easy transport to the garden.Since I do container gardening, I have not used these tools to try to dig into the ground as I buy soil from the store for my buckets and raised garden bed. I don't think it's fair to expect a small, inexpensive tool to dig into hard earth or pull out substantial root balls. A tiller or other heavy duty tool should be used for that. For working with pre-tilled and commercially-purchased soil, however, I have had no trouble at all with these tools bending or breaking. I haven't even felt any \"give\" at all in the handles.Definitely recommended.
B000DZH3XO We do a lot of gardening and to ease the shopping ordered these for my wife at the last minute for a Christmas present. They are already in use for her potting projects and have a good heavy feel. Appreciate the prompt shipping from Amazon..right on time for Christmas.
B000E199HA The concept is elegant but simple. As manufacturers of lawn care machines (residential grade, that is) have been mostly consolidated, shaft sizes as well as mounting points and patterns are as standardized as they have ever been. With this little darling, you can buy one power head unit (string trimmer with detachable/2-piece shaft), and then add this or other implements as needed. The implement is cheaper than a purpose-built or standalone edger, and when the power head wears out, you can toss it and get another that mates right up to the edger.Performance is tightly coupled with your power head, so choose that wisely based on weight, power and form factor. The edger's guide wheel supports its extra weight, but this isn't true of other attachments.  If you like the power head you have, you're likely to be pleased with it behind this edger as well.  Mine works fine with an older 31CC Ryobi which I demoted after buying a commercial string trimmer.  I wish it used the bigger (9\") blades simply cause they are heavier duty ... still, the 7.5\" ones are just fine, and edger blades are relatively cheap. It would take a stronger power head to run an edger with bigger blades anyway. You'll probably wear the blade more on the first edging of the season than the rest of the season combined b/c it's harder to break new ground, ya'know?  The visual improvement of edged versus string trimmed is appreciable, and this little implement delivers a professional look, and is quick about it.For the money, ( approximately $100 less than the closest alternative, $200 less than the \"quality\" dedicated edger I would've bought ) you can't beat this edger. I use it for the inner and outer edge of my concrete circle drive and both sides of the sidewalk from said drive to my door. By the time I finished using it the first time, I was acclimated to the motions and postures needed to use my setup, I had established my feel and sightline for expedient usage, and was confident this would be a dandy tool. You will find familiarizing yourself with the depth-of-cut-adjustment to be a worthwhile initial expenditure of time. Too shallow a cut necessitates your contorting to edge. ( NEVER adjust moving parts while your machine is running!! ) After the initial annoyance of having to adjust the blade depth to suit my height/power head setup, like I said, it was a dandy. Nothing has happened this summer to contradict that initial impression. I've had some practice, and plenty of opportunity to find weaknesses. This is how I use it:Total distance: 500+ linear feetEdging time: ~ 7 minutesEdging time ( very first pass & acclimation to tool ): ~30 minutesEdging schedule: Approx. every two weeks.  ( As you may surmise, an electric model wasn't an option since I don't have, need or want a 200' extension cord.  If you have considerably less to do, or don't already have a compatible gas trimmer, the B&D; Edge Hog might be a lead to follow first as an electric alternative.  Many feel electrics are less muss and fuss, though I would rather mix a little fuel than futz about with an extension cord all day )If you need an edger, and would like to spend $60-$80 ILO $200+, I think this is a winning alternative.  I have a lot of edging work when I mow, which used to take just over an hour to perfect with a string trimmer - a miserable experience I dreaded.  There's no way I'd spend another $200 bucks on a dedicated edger unless I had 10 times as much to do.  Spend your bucks on a powerful and reliable power head instead.  Cross-reference accepted alternative power heads/engines ( the one you already own may work; most will - attachment is indicated for other makes besides Poulan, though their PoulanPro Series seems to be a good value ).  The string trimmer will still work without the edger, and can do double duty, while the mid-grade dedicated edgers are Johnny-One-Notes that introduce another possible point of failure in your yard arsenal.  Can you tell I'm pretty exuberant about gaining back that sweaty, awful hour of my life from the string trimmer, and doing so for a savings?DISCLAIMER: You should know I research and read reviews and excerpts before deciding to invest my time and/or money in a book or product. Your reviews are helpful to me, and I hope mine are helpful to you too. That said, after having read your opinions, I find I am consistently satisfied with my purchases, and thus most of my reviews are positive.If I fail to recommend a product/book, and/or fail to explain why I like or dislike it, I have not done you any service. I will try to cite evidence, facts/contradictions or at least make a case for personal objections or preferences in my reviews. I appreciate you other reviewers who do the same. Cheers!
B000E199HA This wasn't much cheaper than the store models, but 20 dollars is still 20 dollars.  I have this attached to my curved shaft troy bilt weed whacker.  It will attach to any weed whacker brand similar to a troy bilt.
B000E199HA My search for an edger attachment began with the Troy-Bilt unit. I have a Troy-Bilt string trimmer, so I figure why not stay within the same brand? Well, there's a clear reason not to - their edger attachment does not work well at all. Cumbersome to maneuver and hard to control to get a clean edge. Also cuts poorly. Bought it at Lowes, and it went back the same week.So, the next stop was the Expand-It attachment. I saw it on Amazon for a very nice price, but was not sure that it would be a keeper. So I bought it at HD instead. Very glad I did, since it also was returned the same week. While it cut better than the Troy-Bilt, it was very cumbersome to use and difficult to adjust.Fortunately, the third time was the charm. Tried the Poulan based on the positive reviews, and am happy to say everyone was right! This works very well, cuts great, easy to adjust, and I had no problems maneuvering it right from the get-go. Solid construction and clear instructions round out the list of pluses. I'm using it on a 2-cycle Troy-Bilt trimmer and have no problems getting through thick grass/dirt.Finally have nice, clean edges along the sidewalk! Good price from Amazon, and quick shipping (as usual).
B000E199HA replacement blades hard to find. most edger blades are 9\", on this unit standard and universal blades won't fit, so you have to spend $11 plus shipping to order their 7 1/2\" blades. another reviewer said he found 7 1/2\" blades are local mom and pops stores were you can find them. I called local mom and pops stores and lawn mover parts stores , Homedepot and Lowes, and looked on internet and can not find any edger blades that fit this model except the $11 plus shipping for Poulan. To make matters worse, the $11 blade wears out very fast. only worked one time on med size yard. would not recommend due to this blade issue.updated: finally found replacement blades at a different Lowes store, two blades for $10. so change back to five stars
B000E199HA The edger works good but you need to get the hang of it or it will pull you like a angry dog on a leash. The item would have been better if it had a wheel on the front but it does a decent job without the use of power cords like with the electric machines.
B000E199HA Well, it worked for a little over a year. I used the trimmer twice a month with no issues.I noticed the blade was getting worn down and quite dull. Changing the blade proved to be the downfall of the trimmer.To change the blade you insert a screwdriver in the slot behind the blade to lock the hub. The metal around this hub is very cheap pot metal. The metal hub broke apart in 7 pieces when trying to remove the blade nut.I hope everyone has better luck than me, but I won't buy another one.I'm kinda miffed that this trimmer only lasted 13 months. They shouldn't be disposable.
B000E199HA Highest quality and just simply works as it should! Can't go wrong with this product. I got a great deal on it when I purchased it from Amazon. If you use a weed trimmer to edge you yard you need to stop and buy one of these attachments and do it right. Weed trimmers will do a lot of harm when used incorrectly. These lawn edgers will allow you to only remove just the amount of dirt with the grass that is needed as compared to weed trimmers used incorrectly. I had someone take care of my edging last summer and he used a weed trimmer to do the edging and what started out being a nice 1/2\" border ended up being a 3\" border by the end of summer. I had to buy several bags of top soil to replace the dirt that the weed trimmer threw to the wind. Great product and a great buy on Amazon.
B000E199HA Fits my Troy-bilt trimmer and is easy to use. Fairly light and easy to manuver to trim or trench along driveways, etc. I also use it to edge the growth along our wood deck.
B000E1RIUU BRIEFLYTo answer the obvious question [does it work?] - yes, it does. If a mouse goes inside, attracted by the peanut butter bait (ahhh... the smell of it) and places its front legs on one electrode and the rear legs or maybe the tail on the other electrode, then the mouse gets zapped and dies. We saw it happen once with this trap. If we are to refine the question and ask \"does it work better than a much less expensive mouse trap?\", then that's where we need to discuss this specific brand because, as far as actually catching mice, the answer does not seem to be 'yes'.OUR EXPERIENCEWe only have the occasional field mice in our basement, possibly attracted by the warmth in the winter but, unless chased away or caught, seem to settle and grow families, which we don't want to see happen. We've been quite successful at trapping them and, recently, discouraging them from settling in the first place via an ultrasound-producing device but, before we did that, we didn't like the fact that the cheap, under-a-dollar spring traps had to be moved around and even taken away after a couple of catches because the mice seemed to learn what the traps were about and to avoid them. So, we ordered the Victor because we hoped that, since the other mice could not see their dead comrade, they would be more likely to give it a try.For a test, we placed the Victor and a cheap trap, about 6 feet from each other. We used the same bait - peanut butter and... the cheap trap caught 2 mice in 2 weeks while Victor caught one.OPERATIONThe Victor kills your mice by the method of electrocution. Apparently, this is considered to be safe and humane because the mice die quickly. To make it work, you will need 4 AA batteries (not included), a little bit of peanut butter attached to the back wall and you turn it on and place it wherever mice were spotted. The mouse should be able to smell the bait, walk inside and get zapped to death. When that happens, a green light will blink for either a day or for 7 days (the documentation is not clear in that respect and we didn't wait for longer than one day with the dead mouse inside). You then turn off the trap (there's a switch) dispose of the dead mouse, clean up the box if needed, place fresh bait and repeat the cycle.EVALUATIONSo far, this trap caught half as many mice the 'cheap' device did but, unlike the cheap trap that would kill a mouse by breaking its neck or spine and, sometimes would catch and cripple the mouse without actually killing it, this one would kill it quickly and that's a plus. In addition, it's possible to catch the mouse and dispose of it without actually seeing it - with some practice, you can remove the lid and let the dead mouse drop into a bag without looking. And, finally, it's possible that, if the other mice don't see the dead one because it's killed inside the box, they are more likely to give it a try themselves but this is only speculation.I will award this device 3 stars (means \"it's okay\") because it did catch one mouse in our basement and it killed it as described. I will not return it and, now that I have it, I will continue to use it but, knowing what I know today, I would not buy one unless I really couldn't stand the site of dead little mice but I wanted to kill them anyway.
B000E1RIUU Wasn't sure how to rate the product since it seems well made.  My only problem is that I have never caught a mouse in it.  To be fair, the mice around here are sporadic so it's not like they're all around and this doesn't work.  I bought this product during a time I was finding a few in the garage and I decided to go all out on them.  I don't see why it wouldn't catch mice but for now, the regular wood ones serve my needs.
B000E1RIUU it works so well, i went and got 4 more!  much less expensive than the rat zapper, and easy to clean (and you never have to touch them.  they just go into the little black box and they're done for!  just make sure you stock up on batteries
B000E1RIUU Tried this for a Month with no results. The unit no has moisture and corrosion and has died. I waisted money on this one. I swabbed the plates to keep them clean and kept the peanut butter away from them. Too bad I liked the idea but it's back to the old Victor 'finger whapping' old fashioned trap.
B000E1RIUU I really like this Victor M2524. It does the job. The LiL light blinks and you know right off you have a kill.
B000E1RIUU I bought three different kinds of mouse traps for some mice that managed to find a way into our home. I set this one up last night. I was very hopeful yet extremely skeptical of this product to see if itd actually work. Sure enough some time last night a mouse wondered in for our peanut butter and ZAP! Dead mouse. This one was super easy to set and worked like a charm. I am using 4 AA energizer rechargeable batteries. Hopefully these hold up long enough to kill any other mouse that may be left. They are a bit expensive for a mouse trap but there is absolutely no mess! that is pretty nice.
B000E1RIUU When I first set it up, it caught 2-3 mice a day! It's slowed a little now, but I'm not seeing any new mousy evidence (poops), and the bait is still in place, so I think it just might have solved my mouse problem! I'm tempted to get the multi-mouse version for my barn, but it's gotten such mixed reviews, I'm not sure.BTW, I did follow all of the advice given in the \"Questions, Complaints Answered!\" review, and it worked like a charm from the start.One bit of advice, I noticed if I went a day without a catch, if I'd move it, I'd catch one within a few hours.I wanted a trap that would quickly kill mice and not be a risk to my cat, who likes mousing--but she only she caught 1 mouse for ever 4-5 the electronic mouse trap got in the same week--though in fairness, the trap doesn't have a bell around its neck :).I also liked that it was packaged in a compact cardboard box for easy recycling, no excessive packaging or plastic. I'm using it with rechargeable eneloop batteries & so far it's great, but I suspect I'll need to swap them out more frequently than alkaline. When you turn it on, the light blinks & you hear an electric hum for a few seconds, and I've noticed after a week on rechargeable, the hum is softer.How it compares to other traps:I've had a lot of problems with wooden snap traps--when they're good, they're fast and reliable, but often the mechanism is squirrelly and the mouse would either eat the peanut butter without setting it off or occasionally get snapped without being killed--and some poor mouse dragging itself along in a trap is a real bummer and something you don't want to deal with. I don't like mice, but I'm not really down with torturing them. If we could work out an agreement whereby they'd stay out of my space if I fed them, I'd be cool with that. But it turns out mice don't really like to make deals. They like to crawl all over your stuff and eat your food and poop everywhere instead.I've also used the Victor Ultra Set Covered Trap, which works pretty well & I like that it's also reusable/no touch/no see, but only has a catch rate about the same as my cat (1/5 the electronic). And you have to look at the mouse's tail sticking out of the back end of it, which is kind of creepy.And I've used both the D-con and Tom Cat spin traps, another no-see/no touch trap that works well (somewhat more mice than the Ultra Set--but they weren't competing with the electronic yet). But they're not reusable, so at nearly $2.50 a pop ($4.49 - $4.99 for a 2-pack), it can really add up.I'd highly recommend the electronic trap over all the others I've tried. Try all the tips listed in the \"Questions, Complaints Answered!\" review, particularly the thin layer of peanut butter and wiping off the plates, and I think you'll be very happy.
B000E1RIUU I've been battling a very smart mouse in my kitchen for several weeks now. He kept eating the bait off the conventional snap traps and leaving his little pellets behind. He would circle the perimeter of the glue traps but not touch them. Due to having pets, I can't put out the poisons. I watched from a distance early one morning as he climbed into a jaw trap, licked the peanut butter off and then glanced at me as if to say \"Nya-nya-nya-nya-nya-nya!\". At that point I became enraged and purchased the Victor Electronic Mouse Trap.This little trap does catch and kill the mice. Unfortunately, the catch indicator light doesn't work on my unit. This is irritating because you don't know if there is a catch or not unless you open it up and look. While this is not a \"cure all\" I will continue to use this trap until I get all the cracks and crevices sealed up.UPDATE: Thanks to another Amazon user, I think I know why my indicator light wasn't working. Read the comment on this review for details.
B000E1RIUU We had been using more conventional mechanical traps, which would occasionally leave a half-crushed, yet still living, mouse waiting for me in the morning. I found this very inhumane and looked for a trap that would always instantly kill. This trap is it. It's humane, it is \"clean\" in that it doesn't leave parts of the mouse stuck to the trap. I would say this trap is very good for indoor use (garage, crawl space etc.) but not the final word for yard use. Perhaps with suitable covering? This trap works as advertised for us.
B000E1RIUU I live in rural NW Montana in an older cabin-house...in the middle of 8 acres of woods.  I have a dog and cat and kibble is out for both 24/7 although I've been picking up the dog food at night lately.  A lot of rain is apparently sending the critters in at what has become an alarming rate.  Both the dog and cat go after them but the Victor sits baited in a closet and it has been getting almost 1 a day.  (I have tried the spray in foam and various things around the \"mouse holes\" ???).  Decided to add a second to another spot I think they are entering.Read the directions or other reviewer's:  for the one I purchased, the battery chamber is clearly marked neg/pos for each battery.  I have had no difficult with any battery not working.  I check the traps every morning and the blinking light has been accurate.  I bait the trap with a wee bit of peanut butter which holds a disk of dog kibble against the holes but off the metal panels.  Open the door, dump critter into trash, wipe off plates, add a fresh kibble and that is that.Easy, no muss, no fuss and does the job.  HIGHLY preferable to a snap trap.
B000E1RIUU I've used every mouse trap on the market over the past 20 years, so I have a pretty good perspective on which ones are most effective (at least for New England mice).I tried this electronic trap in a an attic where several other types of traps are also installed and catching mice.  The electronic trap never caught a single mouse.  Eventually the batteries died.  Between the zero success rate, and the need to feed it batteries, I put this model at the bottom of the list of all the different types of traps I've tried.The old fashioned snap traps are the cheapest and most effective traps.  Unfortunately, they also come with significant drawbacks:  They're unpleasant to deal with after you've caught a mouse, you can't use them where children or pets might find them, and they're a little tricky to set.  Glue traps have similar pros and cons, and they have the further disadvantage of seeming inhumane (even if you don't have an emotional attachment to mice).The best trap I've found, by far, is the Victor \"Tin Cat\" model.  It's a metal box with one-way trap doors.  Mice seem to find it irresistible, and it can catch several mice in one night (in fact, it's almost as if the first mouse in the trap attract others).  The biggest downside is that it's a \"live catch\" trap, so you have to check it every day and then take it far away from the house to release the mice.
B000E1RIUU So far my mice simply enter these traps, eat the bait, and leave (sans zap) leaving some mouse poop right nearby as an F/U to me that they weren't falling for my fancy zapper traps. More traditional traps I bought after these also failed to catch any mice (but at least the mice didn't take the bait this time).My mice have no reason to suspect traps as I have thus far relied on my two cats to keep the house mouse free and it hasn't been an issue for years. That is if you don't count the occasional mouse corpse left diligently just outside the bedroom door for me to walk on half-asleep the morning after the kill...Then recently I started noticing mouse poop but no mouse corpses and assumed the cats were't keeping up their side of the deal. So, loving electronic toys, I got these expensive Thomas Edison style electrocution mouse traps which failed, followed by traditional snap traps which also failed. So I guess the little critters are smarter than I thought and the cats are back on Tuna.In any case these are batting a zero so far but are still baited as are the snapers. Time to try something else.I promise to update this review if they ever come through.PS: Cleaned all the contacts, tested the batteries, not over-baiting, or letting the bait touch the contacts. As I bought two I am doubtful that they are defective, just apparently not very effective.UPDATE: Caught one mouse in a snapper trap; same bait. So far the zappers have got none.UPDATE#2: Latest count is These traps = 2 kills - Old Fashioned snapper traps = 4 kills. I seem to me mouse free now.
B000E1RIUU First night didn't catch any mouse. The second night caught one. Third night caught two little ones. On fourth day I heard a mouse in my room while I was sleeping  and put the trap by my door and crumbled a small cookie by the traps entrance. Five minutes later I hear the mouse walking inside and zap! It was a huge mouse compared to the others. So far it's been 3 days and have yet to catch another. Ether they got scared or we don't have anymore. Next time I'll remember to close the basement window .
B000E1RIUU Love, Love, Love these traps.  Quick and humane ... well as humane as killing something can get.  Easy to bait (I use peanut butter) and easy to clean old bait out of.  We needed these last winter and I bought 3.  They caught 3 mice last year and have already caught one this years.  Since cool weather is coming the critters are trying to find places to overwinter.  Well, not in my pantry.  Didn't need to replace the batteries and I check them once a week to be sure they're still working. So nice NOT to have the mess of the snap traps and sometimes they don't completely kill the poor thing.  Glue traps are horrible and cruel.  If you haven't tried these you really should.  If I ever need any more I'll certainly buy these.
B000E1RIUU This mouse trap takes four AA batteries( not included ). The claim is 100 kills from those four batteries before they need replacing. The trap has two steel plates inside for the soon to be dead mouse to step on. Smear the bait on the inside of the back wall ( the wall with the holes in it ). Don't smear it between the two plates. Don't smear the bait all over the plates. You want the mouse's feet, or feet and mouth to make good contact with both plates. Zap! Now the mouse is dead and the LED light will flash for seven days to alert you. You cannot get shocked by this thing, as there is as safety switch inside connected to the top door. When you open the door to bait or remove a mouse, the safety switch automatically disconnects the electric shocker. To activate the trap, with the top door latched shut, push the rocker switch down on the straight line side and the LED light will light briefly. Now it is ready. Baits that I have had luck with are; peanut butter, bird seed, bread, cheese, or snickers bar. One way to keep mice from getting into your house is to use copper mesh. Sold on Amazon. You push it into or cover any open cracks or holes in the exterior of your house. Mice cannot chew through it and it is quick and easy to use.
B000E1RIUU It's worrisome when I find myself transformed from an anti-kill proponent of \"all creatures great and small\" to a hardened, desensitized exterminator.  But the record speaks for itself: I clicked the \"on\" switch on 3 consecutive nights and netted one dead mouse per night.  However, I must register one troubling observation: on this third morning there was a chewed-out gap of almost 1/2\" in diameter in the plastic at the backside of the trap.  I had been led to believe the trap was capable of \"humane\" (i.e. instant) kills of each victim, but this morning's evidence would suggest that the out-manned prey was desperately trying to escape before or during electrocution.  Worse, if the latter is true, it's possible a demobilized, half-paralyzed creature was yet capable of using its teeth in a project that was doomed from the outset.  Amazon shows a popular live-kill green plastic mouse trap that I had to abandon because within several nights the critters had chewed it to pieces, managing to escape.  In the case of the damaged Victor \"electric chair\" it appears the mice have once again scored an ultimate victory against their worst enemy (me).I went ahead and used it the 4th night anyway.  This time there was no flashing green light indicating a kill because the shocked mouse fought hard enough to lift the latched cover and break the circuit.  So much for the claims about the trap being instant, or \"humane.\"  All the same, I set the trap a 5th time, and the next morning the flashing green light indicated a kill.  Not wanting to bury the animal in my pajamas (I was still in my pajamas making coffee, not the mouse), I set it to the \"off\" position, planning to attend to the grave matter at hand in an hour or two.  However, upon returning I discovered an open door, an empty trap, a trap moreover showing not the least trace of the peanut butter I had lathered it with the night before).  You draw your conclusions. Either I'm harboring exceptionally resilient rodents or Victor's Electronic Trap is close to a \"throwaway\" (maybe the electronic circuitry is effective at giving the mice a pleasant, rejuvenating massage).For several reasons, this trap can be recommended over Victor's Kill & Seal mouse trap, and my investment repaid itself to the extent of 3 consecutive kills.  Still, I say shame on Victor for the wastefulness and misleading (paranoia-inducing) promotion of the Kill & Seal trap and for the inferior component (plastic) of the electronic trap.  Were this trap made of metal or a similar indestructible (by mice) and conductible material, it would appear to be the mouse exterminator's best bet.  But now that I'm embarked on a career of rodent homicide, it looks like I'll have to move on to something that's not worthless after the first 1-3 fatalities.  From consumers' reviews, the \"Nooski\" looks like it just may be the best bet (but stay tuned).
B000E1RIUU Pros:- Compact, sturdy, easy to setupCons:- Expensive- Very hard to clean the peanut butter out of the unit- Given the above, actual reusability and longevity is in questionMy major gripe on this product is how hard it is to clean. The peanut butter can't sit in there forever, eventually it gets a little rotten and you don't want that smell in your house so it has to be cleaned. The peanut butter, once smeared to the back wall, is imbedded into the vent holes and into the cracks and corners of the inside compartment. I bought 2 units and each unit took me 20 minutes to clean with a bunch of toothpicks, qtips anda bottle of rubbing alcohol. Not well designed with this in mind at all and at this price point, I expect more. Perhaps the sellers are just hoping you'll give up and throw it out so you can buy another one from them? It's cynical to think so but go ahead and try cleaning one and you'll likely agree with me.
B000E28UQU Works perfectly as intended.  Allowed me to spray several gallons of insecticide evenly and quickly in very little time with about one &#34;repump&#34; per half gallon.
B000E28UQU A couple of years ago,  I bought a bullet-proof metal, brass and kryptonite super-duper two-gallon sprayer. It lasted one spray of the deck. I cleaned it throughly as per instructions, and stored it inside. And when time to spray the deck again, I found pump had rusted inside. I won't ever buy a heavy-duty one again. The cost to use ratio is terrible.Enter this cheepie.  This one does what you expect it to, it holds a gallon, pumps up and holds pressure, and it has a clog free filter, you can see the liquid level. I've used it several times with excellent performance. I intend to spray the deck soon. I will try to clean this sprayer, but will just recycle it if it fails. I'd rather get several good uses out of a sprayer such as this rather than two out of the high dollar metal type.I recommend this sprayer. The big box stores have the same sprayer a little cheaper, but when you add taxes, fuel, and time, this one turns out to be much less expensive.
B000E28UQU I like the way it works, it took me a little while to figure out how to use it, but I am generally not very savvy with assembling.
B000E28UQU The factory Roundup pump sprayer never worked right... leaks & the hose + wand is too short.  My search for a replacement pump sprayer found this.The pros:+ #1 Amazon Best Seller!+ Lots of buyer product reviews.+ It cost me less then $10 & the shipping was free.+ Funnel top opens for no mess filling.+ Translucent bottle allows for ease in checking fluid level.+ Patented Sure Spray filter to help prevent clogging+ A 28-inch hose, with a 12-inch straight wand, which has an adjustable nozzle.+ Easy pump + carrying handle.  The carry handle locks when not being used to pump up the sprayer bottle.+ This sprayer will spray right down to the last drop in the bottle!The cons:- If the sprayer is opened while under pressure, the contents can blow back into your face.  Most people will only do this once! :)- The markings on the side of the tank are difficult to see.  I used a permanent marker to highlight the raised markings.Closing thoughts:&#9642; This is a VERY good sprayer for what it costs!  I ran 3 gallons of Roundup thru it today with zero problems.  If this sprayer continues to operate as it has, I'll be back to increase my product rating. :)
B000E28UQU This is a great sprayer that is super easy to use and can be adjusted for use in multiple applications. Twist the handle to unlock/unscrew the lid to fill it, then screw it back on. Turn the handle slightly counter clockwise to unlock the pump and I give it about 10 solid pumps. Be sure to push the handle all the way back down and twist again to lock into place. Very important.+ Perfect Size+ Not too heavy+ Easy to Use, Refill, Carry+ Price+ Really Sprays with Impressive Pressure+ Adjustable Spray Stream_Bottom Line_ Yes, I would recommend this to a friend. I cannot think of anything I do not like about it and I have had it for over 6 months. It works great and is offered at a great price.
B000E28UQU this is the best thing for people with a garden , it holds 1 gallon an sprays PERFECT , I use it for my tomatoes 9/7/13
B000E28UQU This is a good price for a no-frills garden sprayer. I'm not expecting a miracle at this price point and because of its all plastic construction, durability may be an issue. For $10, I can live with ordering a replacement if it breaks down after a 8 months to a year, but hopefully it won't. [Product has now failed. Please see update at end of review.]I was looking for a labor-saving way to hydrate the more delicate plants and flowers in my garden and maybe administer some plant food through foliar feeding. I had been using a spray bottle and all that squeezing was very tough on the hands, so I finally decided to do the right thing and get a sprayer. Assembly is very easy. Attach the hose to the wand, attach other end to bottle. Fill with water or your desired mix of fertilizer or bug killer, insert and screw on the pump/handle and you're ready to rock 'n' roll. Flow rate is very satisfactory and you can adjust the spray pattern from a single stream to a fine mist by twisting the nozzle cap. Fully pumped, the stream reaches approx 25 ft out.Design FlawsI don't like that the carrying handle and the pump action are one and the same. There's a little notch that the handle locks into when you rotate it clockwise. This secures the handle in place so that you can carry the sprayer. To pump again, you have to twist it 1/4 turn counter-clockwise so you unlock the handle. Once fully pressurized, dissipation rate is good, but I didn't like the extra step of having to lock and unlock the handle each time. I have to set the sprayer down, unlock, pump, lock again, pick up, then spray. Another minor issue is the squeaking sound of the pump, which I don't really mind, but just pointing it out in case you do.A secondary problem is the length of the hose (about 3 ft.) With the sprayer being held in a relaxed position in one hand (hanging straight down like a shopping bag), I can only bring my other hand to about mid-chest height in front of me. I can't raise my wand hand above my head to mist tall trees and objects. On mist mode, you can comfortably spray anything from ground height to about 8 ft without having to raise the bottle higher.Thirdly, there's no caddy or snap-in clasp to keep the wand secure when the sprayer is not in use. I am expecting a random mishap to snap the wand because of this-- either someone walking by and the wand snagging on some clothing, or it being stepped on. The wand looks especially fragile and susceptible to cracking. It is this product's weakest link. Some sort of loop for attaching a shoulder strap to wear the sprayer would also be a welcome addition.Overall, the Chapin 20000 is easy to use, but not without some design annoyances. For what I paid, I am satisfied with this product so far.UPDATE: DIY Strap Add-on ModificationI was able to fashion myself a strap for the sprayer out of 2 key rings and a camera bag strap. Stamped onto the vertical support vane on either side of the neck is a circular identation (visible in product blowup). You can punch it out with a screwdriver and insert the key rings, then attach a shoulder strap. I now have a wearable sprayer that leaves my other hand free for other gardening tasks. It's a bit clumsy and looks funny, but it works.UPDATE 8/28/10I am downgrading this product to 2 stars because after 4 days, the spray release mechanism has now unexpectedly snapped off. I had concerns about the durability of this product because of its all-plastic construction and did not expect it to last for very long, but less than a week is unacceptable, with less than 4 gallons of use out of this sprayer. The handle is reattachable via snap pegs, but it won't stay on due to the force of the spring in the release value. The clamp had become worn. When pushed down, the lever pops back out. Buyer beware! Not recommended.
B000E28UQU Got this is last week have already used it for a few different things and it works just fine! Also a great deal cheaper on here compared to other retail stores so I'm definitely a very happy camper.Would buy again and definitely recommend!
B000E28UQU I've used this to spray a lot of shrubs and trees.  It's a good size.  If it were bigger, it would be heavier than I'd like.I found that when this tank is completely full, one can't pump much pressure since there's nowhere for the air to go.  As it the level goes down, it gets easy to pump enough pressure into it.I like the spray handle.  It seems perfect for something this size.  I appreciate the low price at the time of my purchase.
B000E28UQU After the hardache of filling transmissions and rear differentials through the drain holes I decided to make my own pressure system.  Disconnected the wand after the handle and attached a tube that can be iserted into the drain hold of whatever you want to fill.  Works great and nice and fast.  Do not think it will inject too much air into the fluid to worry about.  A lot less of a mess than trying to gravity feed out of bottles.
B000E28UQU The bottle is easy to carry around and easy to spray the chemical even in herder to reach places. I do hope it would last for a long time.
B000E28UQU Great little sprayer for the price. Bought this one just for weed killer and it works great just remember to rinse it out well after each use and try to use the whole amount you mix at once. Not only do weed killers loose their strength but its bad for the sprayer when their left to set for long periods
B000E28UQU Several parts were missing--including the spray guard and measure cup, and the &#34;tool holder.&#34; Yes, I checked the box to make sure--the parts were definitely missing.We put it together anyway and my husband showed me how to use it, but I'm returning it (and not replacing it) because my husband said his from Home Depot feels more secure--the lid locks into place more and seems a little better quality (to be fair, I don't know how much it was or what brand it was). Just going to use his (after washing it) or get the same one. Not worth the hassle of waiting for the replacement, and my roses need the fungicide sprayed before then!Disappointed that so many parts were missing. But maybe I lucked out by using a more secure one.
B000E28UQU We bought this to be used as  a disposable sealer sprayer for our deck. It worked great! It can spray far, so you need to protect the side of your house with a tarp. This sprayer can easily spray over 20 feet so be careful.We did the whole deck in a few hours instead of an entire day's worth of work.The nozzle will clog unless you pump some thinner or some other cleaner through it.It was only 11 bucks so we recycled most of it instead.
B000E28UQU We've used this product to help apply a deer repellent to our trees.  It is a nice product, but yes, as noted in other reviews, it does clog from time to time.  Overall, though I am happy with this product and would recommend it to friends.
B000E28UQU In order to unlock the pump handle you have to turn the handle the same direction as you&#8217;d turn it to open the lid thus releasing any air still sealed in the reservoir and misting your hands with the chemical in the reservoir.  So, once you have the pump handle unlocked you have to wedge your fingers down onto the collar and twist it to re-seal the lid.  Then you pump it up, press the handle back down and lock it back in place.  You have to go through this process every time you want to pump the reservoir back up.  I returned this item the same day I opened it.
B000E28UQU I bought this solely to be used for spraying the weeds on my lawn. Setup and cleaning really is a breeze, and the system weighs next to nothing, so you don't have to worry about carrying it around the yard. It doesn't take many pumps to get started, so there's not a lot of wasted time here. My only gripe is actually with myself - wish I bought a larger tank, because 1 gallon only goes so far.
B000E28UQU As a professional landscaper I can tell you that this will work well for most applications but you can NOT over charge the system or the thin plastic tank will explode. Other than that fact, the sprayer is fine.
B000E2D3E4 I bought an 18 volt lithium ion cordless trimmer (similar to this modelGreenworks 21602 20-Volt Lithium Ion 12-Inch Cordless Electric String Trimmer/Edger with 6 Amp-Hour Extended Run-Time Lithium Ion Battery & Charger)that came with a sample reel of regular, round, trimmer line.  As I read through reviews, several people had suggested this Cyclone 6-sided trimmer line to improve the cordless trimmer's performance.Boy, were they right!  This really makes a significant difference, especially when you're trimming borders (like patio to grass).  I can actually cut into the dirt with my cordless trimmer, making a beautifully distinct line between the patio and the yard.  It also improved trimming spe
B000E2D3E4 It does a great job of cutting, but I found that the six-blade design causes some jams in my Toro 51480 Corded 14-Inch Electric Trimmer/Edger. The first time it happened, I thought it was because I wound the string too tightly. Even after I rewound it more loosely, it still snagged.
B000E2D3E4 It does work and works great when it works, but having to stop and unstick the line from itself is a pain you know where.  This is my first wire purchase for a specific trimmer I just purchased, though, so I don't know if this will happen on other brands, but it never happened on a previous trimmer I had.
B000E2D3E4 works well with my Black and Decker 220 trimmer.  last longer, and is not that difficult to rewind those expensive spools. I would say practice makes perfect, and now i am saving money which makes my honey very happy!! Will continue to buy this brand.
B000E2D3E4 it works great and it does a great job. i weedwacked a huge area using this trimmer line with no problems and i use it all the time for other weedwacking jobs. i am very happy with this great quality product. this is my second pack of it. thanks.
B000E2D3E4 If you like to conserve your money, then this is a good buy.  Buying pre-wound replacement spools cost way too much, so this is a good solution.  Just take your time winding it on your spool and be sure you buy the correct size line.  Do that, and you'll be a happy camper.
B000E7MTT4 It simply makes plants explode in growth .... NO more trace mineral defs in soil. I intend to buy more as my tomatoes and potted plants love it.
B000E7MTT4 The only small thing Id like to mention is that I recived mine in a clear bag.Short of that,its perfect.OMRI certified organic and its easy as gheck to use and its a solid solid but.Esp. if your gowing TLO.As an additive its excellent.5 stars across the board.
B000E7MTT4 Mixed this in when mixing firt, clay, sand, perlite, etc to make a nice potting mix.  Plants accepted the soil and are off.  Used it for tomato's, basil, peppers, and a key lime tree.  So far so good.
B000E7MTT4 We bought this natural fertilizer mainly following the recommendations of hobby gardener friends.  We did read some Amazon reviews.  Blind believers, once the small bag arrived (different from the Amazon image / supplier), we applied the Azomite first, studying the facts afterwards.  Not sure which surprised us more?  While not overnight, plant growth and vigor were perceptible amazingly fast; almost dramatically.  Either the soils had been depleted prior to the Azomite application or the added nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium did wonders.  Be it as it may, we bought a much larger bag.  Highly recommended.
B000E7MTT4 It works. You will be able to see a difference in your veggie plants. Make sure to mix it into the soil, do not top dress. My garden loved it. Will be using it again. If it is unavailable i nyour area check on glacial rock dust out of the US good old northern neighbor Eh!
B000E7MTT4 I bought this in mid winter because i had read so many good things about azomite.  Product has helped grow stronger plants.  Due to crazy temperature changes, I have not seen fruiting benefits yet.  Good product so far, but there are better prices available if you buy &#34;in season&#34;.
B000E7MTT4 I live in an area with sand, not soil so I am adding it to the compost I make. It will be at least a few months before I might see any results. I just wanted to post to anyone thinking of using it in a sandy soil area w/ lots of seasonal rain, you may want to think twice about using directly on soil. Will likely percolate through before doing any good. Mix it first with a good organic media at the least. From what I have researched I expect to see good results of the product.
B000E7MTT4 I realize that the intended purpose of Azomite is as a plant fertilizer but that some people use it as a nutritional supplement. I did myself for a while while also using it to grow wheatgrass. I have encountered a problem by storing it in a shut closed cabinet that also contained fabric softener sheets (e.g,, Bounce sheets). The scent of the sheets over time somehow made it's way through two fairly thick paper bags and also a thin vegetable plastic bag (knotted closed to lock out air), and this gave it the taste of the fabric sheets. I tried to deal with it, but I eventually threw away two 3 pound bags after realizing what had happened.I'm letting everyone know of this (in online reviews, blogs, etc) so that they can possibly share it with others who might use it for the same purpose! You might pass it along to anyone else you know who uses it in the same way...to be careful where they store it. Storing it next to anything that have a strong smell could mean that the Azomite will absorb that even through a thin plastic. (The thicker plastic bag it comes in here may be enough to keep the scent from being absorbed...I'm not sure.)Also, if it can absorb the scent of fabric sheets, I'd guess it can absorb other things in the air, so be careful not to leave it near other volatile fumes (e.g., ammonia, gas for your lawnmower). You definitely don't want your Azomite absorbing harsh chemicals, since eventually it will be coming in direct contact with something you might eat.
B000E7MTT4 I set up tiny seed garden in my basement and wanted to use everything I could to give the new starts a lift. Grow light, Azomite and compost seem to be working wonderfully. Very fun. The work starts later.
B000E7MTT4 Bought this to mix in with my soil that I was using in 2 earth boxes.  One box has herbs the other box has a small pepper plant, basil and a pepper plant that was cut down to the stem as my dog had ate it before i could plant it.  The herbs are doing ok not much better that a box I planted not using the azomite.  Some of the herbs have taken off while some are growing at a reasonable pace.  The box with the peppers and sage are doing no better than if I had not used them.  It has been 3 weeks since I planted and in my mind everything is growing at the expected pace.  The one thing I was hoping for is that my pepper plant that was chewed up would make a recovery which dispite all I have done fo it looks like it will die.  I do plan on using again to ammend the soil for my front yard raised bed that has all flowers hopefully i will get bigger blooms.
B000E7SU3I The clips that hold this container together when collapsed are superior to the competition's toggles and the less rigid stance allows it to be used with a 33-gallon bag as well as a larger one without the bag pulling off the rim.  When a larger bag is used and the container is getting full, you can pull it up to its full height so it holds more than it appears it will at first.  This makes it more versatile and my son-in-law, the recipient of the gift, could immediately see many uses, from tailgate parties and camping, to inside uses, as well as yard waste collection, its advertised function.  I can say that it was immediately put to use to contain Christmas wrapping paper, discarded gift boxes, etc., and did a fine job of keeping our gift exchange area tidy.  After that, it contained a couple of grandchildren during play, then helped haul all the booty to the car.  It was definitely a hit.I had to laugh at another reviewer's comment about the smaller 30-gallon Fiskars product being for 'grandma'.  Well, I am grandma and I bought the 30-gallon unit for myself, so he's right.  This unit is more commodious, but still stores in a small space when collapsed.  It's going to get a lot of use both inside and out.
B000E7SU3I This is a nicely constructed product - looks like it will last for some time. As the other reviewers have said, it is a very handy tool to have for yard cleanup, and it collapses down quickly and easily for storage.It does NOT, however, come with a shoulder strap as noted in the photo and description. I ordered one from Amazon. It arrived in fine shape, was 100% new and unused, but no strap! I returned it, and re-ordered another. The replacement also lacked a strap. The product info sheet that comes with the item makes no mention of a strap, so I imagine Toro stopped including one to save costs.The lack of a strap is not a deal-breaker for my purposes, but it would be a handy addition. If you order one, keep in mind that you will not get the strap.
B000E7SU3I I am very happy with this item. It is a bit larger than the typical garden bucket. The material is strong and the handles are sewn on well. It looks like it should last some time.
B000E7SU3I I love it except when you put leaves in it and push the leaves down to make more room it makes the bag hard to get out.
B000E7SU3I I'm kicking myself for not getting one of these much sooner, so easy to carry around the yard whenever I feel like doing some pruning or pickup.  When not in use it folds pretty flat and fits behind or next to my workbench.  Huge improvement over dragging around the huge and heavy yard waste bin.  The Toro is light yet very well made, feel confident it will last.
B000E7SU3I good quality with great handles above and below for easr of dumping, would recommend to all.  Randi
B000E7SU3I We have lots of leaves in the fall in spring and the second time we used this the strap came off and we had to fix it.  So I can't recommed this.
B000E7SU3I Light weight, sturdy and practical. Gets the job done and don't know how we managed before this came along!  Would recommend.
B000E7SU3I The high end mulch-er Might deliver to much force so you need to buy a bungs cord to wraparound the cover. Holds a massive amount of compost as the vacume part has a mettal blade anddoes a true 20 to 1 crunch providing high density debris for composting leaves and small twigs.
B000E7WLDI this is the third hedge hog I've owned and the largest. I've had smaller sets, one a 18 inch, the other smaller. The 18 inch has a tendency to get very hot and starts cutting out as if the plug is coming loose and not making a good contact. It doesn't burn you hands or anything like that, unless you stick your finger on the hot part...Duh. The smaller ones vibrate terribly.This 24 inch is a shrub killer. I have cut up to 3/4 inch limbs and it hogged right through it. I cut all my heavy hedges back to the wood. I was going to get my chainsaw after them, but I didn't want to butcher them up. So, I deployed this animal. It cut down to the heavy wood as if cutting a birthday cake. It did not chew the limbs, but makes clean cuts. I had about 20 feet of mature, heavy-limbed boxwoods, now I have about 20 feet of smaller woody shrubs, ready to fill back into a reasonable size. This hog did not overheat, btw its 94 degrees today. It held its edge, didn't slow down due to dulling. Does not vibrate your hands. It shows its small 3.3 amp motor strength when it stalls on a 3/4 limb. But only if you jam it; if you let it just eat through, it cuts like a charm. I recommend this hedge hog.
B000E7WLDI This is the best trimmer that I have owned.  It trims everything very well.  I like the extended cutting bar, the short electrical cord and the powerful motor.
B000E7WLDI I have been using the 17\" hedge trimmer for couple of years. The 17\" hedge trimmer can only trim branches up to 3/8\" and this is a very annoying limitation.This 24\" is far more better and powerful. First, the longer trimmer length indeed reduces the trimming time. Secondly, it easily cuts through 1/2\" branches. For 3/4\" branches, it takes a little while, but it still cuts them through (just hold the trimmer steady). Finally, it's still pretty light for long holding.Overall, this product fits my expectation very well.The product arrives with manufacturer's original box. That box does not hold up well during the shipment. Luckily, the trimmer itself does not get damaged. But I take 1 point out for that.
B000E7WLDI I received mine on August 13, 2009 (two days with Prime) and on the 14th, proceeded to trim the hedges and a Chinese Holly. Well, after about two hours of work, everything was done both properly and quickly. The HedgeHog didn't exhibit any vibration problems nor did it get stuck on the thickest branches. It was relatively quiet as well. This fall or winter, I plan on trimming several other plants with this really efficient trimmer. Hats off to Black & Decker!!(I used to use a Craftsman 18\" unit which seemed to *constantly* get stuck on several branches. No more!!!) I should add, the longer reach of the HedgeHog meant far less work.
B000E7WLDI It seems people are finding this useful so I thought I would write another update. This B&D; Hedge Hog Trimmer is a real work horse. As I have mentioned in the comments section, last week I cut through another cord, and it went through it like butter. This time I spliced it. I'm not paying for another 100 foot cord, those things are expensive! LOL. It was an easy fix, and it is wrapped up well enough that I don't think I will have a problem. I should also mention that I still haven't lifted a finger to maintain it, except for oiling the blades once. Yup, once! I'm so happy to have bought this! Just be CAREFUL!!! :-)UPDATE 2/18/2010:Just to update, I have used this to cut through very thick ivy, etc., and it is still going, and cutting fairly well. I should also note that I have not maintained this at all. I have not cleaned or oiled the blades, etc., and it still works very well. I am VERY pleased with this and recommend it VERY highlyThis is a really great trimmer. It handles thick branches very well. I cut half inch branches easily enough. It is well balanced, and I was even able to use it with one hand when I really had to stretch (I would not recommend this, as it is a bit dangerous). One thing that many people do not consider with these electric tools, sometimes, the extension cord releases easily. This is not the case here, I am happy to report. I am very happy I bought this. It makes my hedge trimming very easy. It is easy to maneuver, and I think you will be very happy using this product.June 2008 addition:Okay, almost a year has passed and this thing is still going strong. It cuts like butter....still. It is easily the best garden tool purchase I have made, and I have made some good ones. It does not bog down unless the branches are REALLY thick (read: do not fit between the teeth completely). Look no further and buy this trimmer. It's just great....the only annoyance is that the plug comes out easily using my new extension cord.....ehem....it seems while I was using the trimmer to clear out more ivy than anyone can imagine, the cord got hidden underneath some of the iyv I had not reached and when I did get to it I might not have been.....ehem....paying as much attention.....cough, cough....as I should have, and, well, you know, ehem, the trimmer stopped working. When I looked down I saw the cord was still plugged into the trimmer, but then I noticed the dangling piece of cord about 8 feet down and am happy to report that if needed this thing will cut through a 12 gauge extension cord with ease and better than any wire cutter! Luckily for me, I did not get any kind of shock, etc., (of course, it was plugged into a GFCI outlet). That's the good news. The bad news is I threw out the extension cord which, at 100 feet, costs almost what the trimmer cost. The good news is my friend later informed me that it is an easy fix to splice the wires back together. Bad news is, he told me this AFTER the garbage men took the garbage.....Lesson learned, and I only mention this in the hopes that everyone who reads this takes better care than I did. All joking aside, this could have had a completely different ending, and I am quite lucky to be able to edit this review. I can only imagine what might have happened if I were standing in a puddle, or something (I don't want to test the GFCI). So, since it only cost me a new extension cord, I figure I got away cheap. ;-)
B000E7WLDI This trimmer gets used on climbing fig, pittosporum, boxwood, and other ornamental woody hedges in my SoCal yard.  It is not that old so I cannot speak to its reliability, but it has worked very well so far.  It runs smoothly  and quietly and makes short work of leafy and/or woody hedges.  My basic impressions so far:Pros:+  Long reach - the long cutting blade is really nice for trimming large, flat areas (as in climbing fig on an 80 foot block wall)+  Strong - it did not bog down when used on heavily overgrown foliage with branches ranging 1/8\" to 1/2\"+  Good capacity - cut relatively large branches, however I don't get the sense that this would be happy doing that all day as it is relatively light duty+  Well balanced and good weight - The tool is balanced well at the center handle and the weight is easy to manage, even at shoulder levelCons:-  Trigger lock - The trigger is large and has a nice, soft action; however, the size of the trigger within the relatively small rear handle well makes it prone to shutting off the trigger lock.  In use, I am constantly shutting off the trigger lock because there is not enough room for my hand and it keeps actuating the trigger.  Not a big deal, but slightly annoying.-  No auto shut off if the cord comes unplugged - I discovered this one when my cord hit a snag and pulled free from the pigtail when the trigger lock was on; when I plugged the cord back in, the trimmer came back to life because the trigger was still locked.  Surprise!  I  should have thought of that, and forgetting to  unlock the trigger before plugging the unit back in can lead to a potentially hazardous situation.Other thoughts...The large gap in the cutting blades that allows the tool to cut somewhat large branches also makes it potentially more dangerous to fingers.  I have large hands and my fingers fit nicely in the gap- tool unplugged, of course! - so watch that.  Also, while the cutter is very long and good for extra reach or large surfaces, it also makes the tool slightly more cumbersome.  If I were to be using this from a ladder, I think I would rather go with a smaller blade, which would make the tool much more maneuverable and easier to handle. The unit came with the center handle disassembled to make it fit in the shipping box; there were only two screws needed to attach it, so that was no biggie.  Overall, I am very happy with it and it is a tremendous time saver compared to my old manual shears.
B000E7WLDI This thing is a lot heavier than I expected. It cuts well, but it will not come close to cutting 3/4 inch branches as advertised. In fact, it takes multiple efforts to cut 1/2 inch branches. If you need a long hedger, this is a good choice, but remember, it's heavy!
B000E7WLE2 This is a certifiable piece of junk. It lacks sufficient power to cut anything.  Worx has a similiar product with a decent battery. I replaced my B & D with the Worx and it does a better job.
B000E7WLE2 Great little tool!  I have a small area oh grass I need to trim and a lawn mower wouldn't work.  This tool does the trick.  I can also use the shrub trimmer to trim my small shrubs.  Very good value and two tools for the price of  one.
B000E7WLE2 We picked up a less expensive Black & Decker cordless shearer at a large local discount store and it was definitely inferior to this model.  This version is better, but not perfect.  They seem to last a few years and then need to be replaced.  It is not strong enough to cut fairly thick bushes so we also have a corded Black & Decker that really does the job.  We use this one for the quick, small jobs and the corded version to really do some serious trimming.It is probably not good form to mention this next item, but we purchased our SSC1000 on 5/7/2011 from Amazon for $49.00.  Currently the seller (which is not Amazon) is offering this model for $62.99 with \"Prime\" shipping.  The same seller is offering the same unit on another large retailers Web site for $52.09 (including tax and shipping).  I usually trust Amazon to get a really good price, but when they are not the direct seller, you need to pay attention and check the pricing.  They can't police everyone, but it's sad when the same product, from the same company, is sold on Amazon for $10.00 more.We are big fans of Amazon, but you do need to watch the pricing.
B000E7WLE2 We've had many trimmers over the years. These by far are the worst we've ever had.The problem is the design of both the grass shears and the mini hedge shears.  They do not cut anything. They are dull and set too far apart to effectively cut anything.Plus for a 7.2 volt, which should be very powerful and have a long life battery this machine fails.I usually love Black and Decker items, but these were returned after 10 minutes of attempted use.
B000E7WLE2 I used this battery operated clipper for a few years, and while I was never completely satisfied with its performance it wasn't worth the effort to return or buy a new one.  My two biggest complaints with the clipper were:1) The battery life (or lack of it).  The clipper would only run for about 15 minutes on a charge and after about 5-8 minutes the power and clipping ability went way down.2) When the battery started to lose it oomph (see item #1), small twigs would get wedged between the blades and cause the clipper to freeze.  At this point I had to stop and remove the wood fragments before the clipper would start working again.Well after the last tiny twig got wedged between the blades the clipper refused to work.  It is fully charged, but when I turn it on the motor makes a whirling noise, the blades only move about a 1/4 inch and then freezes again.I got three years of use out of this clipper so I guess I got my money's worth (hence the 3 stars), but it is a shame that a hedge clipper can be destroyed by the hedge it is clipping.
B000E7YYDS I really would like to find a product like this that was made in the USA, but this one is not.  I think that amazon would do all customers a favor and post the country of origin for each of their products that they sell.  The quality appears good but only time and use will tell.  I wash our cars a lot and I am tired of hose nozzles coming apart or breaking from everyday use.  When I saw this one, it looks like it should last.  Have not tried it yet due to freezing weather but may upgrade to 5 stars if it works as advertised.  Update 3/6/13: Finally got a chance to use this nozzle yesterday.  Works ok, but not ideal for washing cars.  More suited for watering or squirting off the driveway.  You cannot leave the spray on a certain setting and cut off the water flow.  Looks like a well-made product but is made in China.  Not worth what I paid and will keep looking for the ideal car washing nozzle.  Downgrading it to 3 stars due to my update
B000E7YYDS Beside it's rock-solid construction and excellent versatility, the BON-AIRE Original Ultimate Nozzle's easy grip and silky-smooth action make it an absolute MUST for anyone who suffers from arthritic fingers and/or wrist impairment. No triggers to squeeze means there's no strain on the hands or wrists.The easy action of the nozzle makes this a perfect gift for the gardener in your life !!!The Bon-Aire easily provides a wide range of spray patterns -- from a fine spray to a pinpoint blast that easily travels 40 feet-- and you can use it as a bubbler, too !!!After several seasons of hard use, the Bon-Aire hose nozzles perform perfectly -- and they are  definitely worth every penny !!!UPDATE- 19 April, 2014 -- STILL going strong with no problems of any kind !! The nozzle seems to be indestructable, and it still works perfectly !! Highly recommended.
B000E7YYDS I bought this after years of using a conventional nozzle.  Now I love this since it just takes a quick, short twist of the wrist to change the amount of water sprayed.  I don't have to look down and read settings.  I have just used it this past summer and so far it seems to be very good quality.  Please note that I bought the Stainless Steel model.  I think the make a lower grade model.
B000E7YYDS Please don't let the fact that this nozzle costs a fair bit of money fool you into thinkging that this is an all metal product.  See the screw right in the center of the stainless steal spray head? It's attached to a thin plastic core.  So, when you twist the outer rim to seat the metal spray head thereby shutting off the water, the relatively thin plastic core is stressed and in short time, snaps.  The spray head is then no longer attached to anything, falls out, and water gushes everywhere. It becomes a useless hunk of metal and plastic parts.  I am going to try a high strength 'epoxy' repair but I don't hold out much hope. Rather than twisting the rim to shut off the water, you could use one of these;Dramm 12353 Heavy-Duty Brass Shut-Off Valveto do the on off work.After further consideration: If they made parts available, I'd fix it, put it back in action and appreciate its other, more robust characteristics.But until they do, I do not think you get what you pay for.UPDATE: Epoxy doesn't stick to the kind of plastic they used to make the core.
B000E7YYDS I've used many different types of hose nozzles.  Some seemed to start out ok, but failed after a short time.  This BonAire nozzle is very ruggedly constructed with a smooth adjustment mechanism.  The spray patterns are very even, though you won't get a really hard, narrow jet out of it.  What I like is that it will stay in the position I set it at and that it will shut off in either direction.  I expect to be using this nozzle for years to come.
B000EDVTLW The Good:  I bought this to accompany a new Karcher 2700PSI gas pressure washer.  It works as advertised and cut the time to clean my driveway and patio noticeably.  The construction seems flimsy at first bit in reality it is very well made.  I have used it at least 6 time and every time it performs well.The Bad:  I honestly have not found anything worth complaining about with this model.  The instructions might have been slightly better written, but that is just whining on my part.  I was able to figure it out soon enough that it wasn't a big deal.
B000EDVTLW This spinning head coupled to a pressure washer does the job 5 times faster than the wand only.  Bought it to clean our concrete pool deck each spring.  Works like a charm.  Then used it to clean our presssure treated deck to reseal it.  Works real well for that too.  Finally used it to clean our asphalt driveway.  So much faster than just the wand.
B000EDVTLW This is great for large areas such as driveways and patios, where it would take a long time to wash with a regular wand.. this produces a CONSISTENT wash so you don't end up with marks on your concrete.
B000EDVTLW I am so glad I added this to my pressure washer order.  This little guy made all the difference in the world cleaning our driveway.  It moved easy.  Like a pro floor buffer, if you have used one.  Glided over the concrete and cleaned so much faster than just using the pressure washer rod.  It does not  look like it is built to last, but while it last I will enjoy it.
B000EDVTLW Stumbled on to this unit when I was researching power washers on Amazon.  I broke down and bought one for use with my running poorly older power washer.  All I can say is:  I wish I would have had this years ago.  What a time saving life saver.I have only used it once as a test and can not believe it.  It works great with the old washer, so great that I am now waiting for my new Generac Power Washer to arrive.Don't hesitate.  If you do any power washing of decks, driveways, sidewalks, etc., buy this unit!!!!
B000EDVTLW Be aware I believe it has a pressure limit of under 3000 I believe which is fine for most people..  My son uses it has had no problems cleaned a huge driveway and it worked well and fast he said
B000EHJN7K I have all kinds of plants starting from seeds that will go outside in big patio pots when the time is right. These contained little soil plugs are wonderful, as I have lots and lots of seeds to start.
B000EHJN7K During their seven to 10-day life span, Fungus Gnat females may lay up to 200 eggs into the cracks and crevices of growing media. Moist-growing media containing high amounts of peat moss are particularly attractive to adult females.I have 2, 50 pellet pot jiffy seedling starters. I ordered these for refills because it was more fpr a cheaper price. Now I know why..You can tell these were at least last years old stock or older. You can tell that simply by how long it takes the pellets to absorb the water. It should really only take 1 minute to absorb. These took over 3 to 5 minutes. Most of the seeds I planted when using this batch of pellets did not grow. I was going to try to save the peat to mix with some potting soil.When I opened the pellets there were tons of Fungus Gnat Larvae feeding on the seeds inside. YUCK Yuck Yuck!THANK GOD I CAUGHT THIS BEFORE THEY TURNED INTO FLIES! MY HOUSE WOULD HAVE BEEN INFESTED!Yes, I blame these pellets and not my seeds or myself. I have never had this issue before.In order to not waste the money I spent buying these I am going to have to spend more money on an insecticide and mix it with the water, when using them..Yes, I am sure the eggs were in the peat pellets and not from me or my home etc.I Know these are old stock, and had eggs in them hence, bad stock!I will not be buying from this seller again!Buyer beware.This is my first ever bad review. Trust me, that tells you something!...... Move on!
B000EHJN7K I had some of these that I bought in case  I ever needed them. They were easy to toss in a drawer in the greenhouse and were ready to go when I did need them. They are an effective way to start seeds.Just don't allow the seeds to bury themselves so far down in the material that they can never find their way to the light of day. That's true no matter what kind of seed-starting material you use, of course.
B000EHJN7K My first try at growing from home I used these.  After sprouting, the roots had difficulties with the peat.  I prefer soil now because the expanding peat didn't always do what it was supposed to.....
B000EHJN7K I have used these for the last 4 years to get a early start on veggies before spring. they work amazing just make sure you have a Jiffy greenhouse starter kit they have a special bottom piece that holds the jiffy plug in place so it doesn't slide around when you water it.They sell the plugs at most walmart's and targets but the price is a lot more expensive for less, this is the best price around right here 200 plugs for $22
B000EHJN7K This is a fantastic product, but yet someone posts a one star review for the product because they found it cheaper somewhere else.  The review is for the product.  If the product is excellent, you don't give it one star!!  Amazon should just delete those kinds of reviews that aren't relevant to the quality of the product.What I like about these is the sprouts that come out of them seem stronger and they can continue to grow from this pellet right to the garden.  The little plastic solutions are good, but they require transplant or the plants grow right through the bottom and you have to damage the roots to get them out if you leave them too long.That said, a good plastic base with egg cartons works surprisingly well.  The cartons hold water well because they absorb it like a sponge and the roots can't push through the bottom.You can get these peat pellets in different plastic growing containers ready to go, which I found incredibly useful and the container kits are cheap!  The peat pellets hold water for an incredibly long time keeping a moist environment for the plants longer than even my egg carton solution.  If you want easy sprouting, this is the way to go.
B000EHJN7K I've used these little peat pellets for 5 years, and every year our plants get a great start.  They're so simple to use, and I like that the refill pellets are inexpensive and can be used in the same &#34;greenhouse&#34; trays every year.  They store on a shelf, dry and compact, ready for duty every March.I put them in the Jiffy tray (but you can use any shallow dish), pour a few cups of warm water on them and wait for them to expand.  Once they're fully expanded, pour off any excess water and open the fabric on top of each pellet.  I use a screwdriver or a chopstick to fluff up the the peat and make a hole.  Drop a couple of seeds in, then press the outer fabric and peat down over the hole.  Cover the container with the clear Jiffy cover (or a clear lid of any kind) and set it in a warm, sunny location.  As soon as the plants start to sprout, take off the lid!  I learned the hard way that they will cook and die if you leave the lid on once the seeds have sprouted.  You can set the container outside on sunny afternoons, to help &#34;harden off&#34; the plants in preparation for living outside.  Be sure to bring it in at night, if it's still cool or frosty.As a side note - I use SuperThrive Plant Vitamin and Hormone in the water to give our plants a boost.When the plants have grown their second set of leaves, you can transplant the peat pellet directly into a bigger container of soil, or just plant the pellets in the garden.  I always pinch off the weaker of the two or three plants, to allow the stronger one(s) to have more room to grow.Simple, inexpensive, effective, and time saving - I love Jiffy peat pellets!
B000EHJN7K These pellets are absolutely fantastic. Most everything that I've started in these peat pellets have come up and do fabulous. I plan to keep using them.
B000EHJN7K Saw some reviews that said they got 36mm instead so I was a little nervous about ordering.  My shipment contained 42mm pellets as I expected.  This size is almost impossible to find in any stores near me so I was happy I found them on here at a reasonable price.
B000EHJN7K After ordering a couple other of the wrong size pellets, I was excited to get these under the impression that they would be the correct 42mm size. As received by seller toolboxsupply, these are the 36mm pellets (which, by the way, seem to be much more widely available; I'm having problems finding the 42mm size anywhere, but I was REALLY expecting these to be that size because the product's title explicitly states this).I assume this might depend a bit on the seller--but I doubt I'm going to try buying these from Amazon again, this being my second attempt. I am hesitant to rank the *product* down for that reason, but it's really apparently a problem with this *listing* and one that I don't want others to fall into this trap. I'd avoid this unless you don't really care which size you get--but if you have the flats already (and I don't know why or how you'd use these without them), it *does* matter.I'd like to give the product itself more stars: while perhaps more expensive than loose seed starting mix, these work well and are very easy to use assuming you follow the directions. Plus, the netting is easy to remove when transplanting or potting up with minimal root disturbance (as long as you don't let the roots get so big they creep through the netting). But it seems exceptionally difficult to find correctly-sized, reasonably priced pellets for your existing Jiffy flats (they make at least four sizes I know of, ranging from 30-50mm). But because of problems with the listing or at least some sellers, I don't think I can do that. I'll revise if this problem is ever fixed, because the product itself does work well if you manage to find the right one among Jiffy's lack of size labeling (and apparently Amazon's or others' confusion). Additionally, Amazon's return process is easy.For those who actually want 42mm pellets (the kind that come with theJiffy 5032 Professional Greenhouse 25-Plant Starter Kitand perhaps others), Jiffy's official refill is theJiffy 5777 Refill, 25-Count, but you'll notice that on Amazon, it's more expensive than the original kit with that number of pellets plus the kit (flat and dome cover) itself! I was able to find it more cheaply elsewhere, but just be warned.I'd be curious how many others actually received 42mm pellets as the listing states or who maybe didn't notice that they got the wrong ones. I'd also be curious who they purchased it from.
B000EHJN7K These pellets are at least 30% larger than the pellets in the kits at the hardware store. Other than that they are exactly the same.This is a good value. There is enough peat here to really get the plant started while the ones at the hardware store are almost too small for most seeds.Now, if only the heat mats were a reasonable price.
B000EHJN7K This was a pretty good deal for a pretty good product if you are a gardener. I started many things from seed, some annual and some perennial - I am happy with the product and the prompt deliver and packaging.
B000EHLTIQ I bought these to try them out for starting some plants indoors. They seem to be working good, no problems with growing.The main problem I had was I didn't get the full 100. I've contacted Amazon and they gave a partial refund. I've also contacted the company about the issue.
B000EHLTIQ I have bought these from other sellers. Bad experience with other sellers. But not this one!!!!!Tips: If they take longer than 1 minute to absorb water. They are old stock. Happened with other seller.Some are bad stock with Fungus Gnat eggs mixed in while processing the pellets. YUCK Gnat larvae eating my seeds. Then they turn into Fungus gnat flies. Yuck yuck!  Not this seller!So basically, I in the future have learned my lesson and will remain loyal to this seller.No I am not making this up. You can see my other reviews on the bad ones.
B000EHLTIQ Nice product, man do they grow when you add water to them.  They turn from discs to little fat cylinders.  Love buying them in bulk and cheaper than in retail stores.  WIll buy again when needed.
B000EHLTIQ I like using these for starting my seeds because they are convenient and I am able to pot them up or plant them in the ground without root damage. I also use them successfully for cuttings. I will definately buy more when I have used the current bag.
B000EHLTIQ I am learning cloning and wanted something useful for that as well as starting seeds.  This does both and makes the best use of the space in my hydrofarm.  Love to watch them expand when they first get soaked.  For cuttings I like thees because when the roots grow they will show as they grow outward.  Pete pots don't so I can't tell if my cuttings are actually growing or dying.
B000EHLTIQ I have used peat pods for years now. I was not impressed with these due to the basic problem that these did not work well with seed, and I did compare these with some others I purchased at Home Depot side by side. The others 100 percent sprouted and grew, and these 1 out of 10 grew I am sorry to say.
B000EHLTIQ First, I purchased the 100 pack...actually got 3 more than that.  My seeds started great except for one type of tomato and pepper which later I read about.  I love these things.  I love that there are no pots to empty and clean and that these can go right in the ground.  I will continue using them as I have for years.  Nice to get them through Amazon.
B000EHLTIQ These are easy to use and nice to work with. My seedlings get a great start and I have little to no mess with them.
B000EHLTIQ Great for starting seeds but the mesh netting where you insert the seed is sometimes not clear and you need to use small scissors to cut it away. Only a small percentage need fixing and I would buy again.
B000EHLTIQ First, let me start by pointing out a glaring omission and large problem with the current description of the product: there is NO SIZE SPECIFIED. Jiffy makes this in at least 30mm, 36mm, 42mm, and 50mm varieties. One recent reviewer claims to have received the 30mm version; another the 42mm version. Personally, I received the 36mm version, so I don't know if it's that different sellers offer different, unspecified sizes (I see toolboxsupply, Root.Naturally, and others, some Fulfilled by Amazon, but Amazon itself does not appear to offer these; for the record, I bought from toolboxsupply) or that each shipment regardless of seller is a random, unspecified, size. I would NOT BUY this product from this listing for that reason.Let me state that I have, however, used these pellets for the last couple years with great luck. They are very easy to use: pour warm water on, per the directions, for the pellets to expand, then start seeds per seed instructions. A plastic cover is included (with the flats, not this product here) as a dome for the flats during germination. I have good luck with germination rates, plus it's less messy than working with \"loose\" seed starting mix. Additionally, because I grow many of my transplants under lights for a period of time, I like that it's very easy to rearrange these, which is harder in peat or plastic flats where they are all stuck together. They're also very easy to transplant without much disturbance, since the netted \"lining\" around the expanded pellet is easy to remove (some people say they just leave it on, but it doesn't seem to disintegrate by the end of the season and I don't like dealing with it then). The only problem is that if you let seedlings get too big that the roots start poking through the net, it will be difficult to remove without disturbing them.Unfortunately, the kit I was using was theJiffy 5032 25-Plant Starter Kit, which accepts 42mm pellets. These 36mm pellets were a bit too small and I was worried they would tip over, so I had to return them. I wasn't even aware that they were so many sizes before this mismatch prompted me to do my research. By the way, the refill part number for the Jiffy 5032 is Jiffy 5777, a 25-pack of 42mm pellets. There is also an Amazon listing200 Count- Jiffy 7 Peat Soil 42mm Pellets Seeds Starting Plugsthat very clearly specifies 42mm. I suspect the 36mm pellets would fit a 36- or 72-plant kit, though perhaps that is the 30mm ones instead (or maybe one for one and another for the other). I think the 50mm ones are just used for the tomato kits. Part of this seems like it would be easy for Jiffy to fix by clearly specifying the sizes on both the trays and the refills, but there is obviously an important problem with this particular product listing in that not only does it not specify, but different buyers seem to be getting different products based on the seller, chance, or some other unknown factor.In summary: these pellets are great, as is the system in general--but don't buy from this particular listing unless you don't actually care what size you get. I'd give the products five stars, but only if you get the right ones. Due to problems with this listing (which does not seem localized to a particular seller and seems to stem from the lack of size specification in the listing), I'm lowering my rating.
B000EHLTIQ Unbelievable expense when adding in green house expenses for such a poor yield.  Very disappointed in the way all has gone so far ........
B000EI8QUE After I fixed my blunder of setting the bird feeder on the Nyger Seed setting while I had regular bird seed in the vessel, all has been delightful.  Watching the birds is so relaxing.  I'm sure they are speaking to each other saying &#34;it took long enough to figure out the feeder has two settings!&#34;  The instructions mention this, but I overlooked it.
B000EI8QUE This feeder is a darker green than pictured, which is fine. The standard outdoor-furniture hunter green works well.It holds a ton of seeds, is very easy to refill (flip the top up, pour seeds in) and you can adjust the feed holes at the bottom for small seeds up to small sunflower seed.  I wouldn't suggest using full sized sunflower seed, but the small black stuff (bigger than niger seed) seems to work well.  You can lift the whole feeder off the suction cup hanger to clean it, and the base toggles loose so you can really scrub it.  Very well designed, despite being lightweight plastic.The birds only took one day to find these feeders when I replaced their old clear plastic bucket-style ones and the suction cups are quite strong when placed on clean glass.Minus one star for the quality of the green plastic, but it should hold up fine to the weight of birds!
B000EI8QUE This is a great little feeder.  Sticks very well to the window and doesn't get poopy (let's not talk about the window sill beneath) and holds a pretty decent amount of seed.  My acrobatic squirrels can leap onto it when I forget to throw out enough critter food to appease them and after at least 3 years of doing so, they finally broke it.  So today I'm ordering another one.  Nothing fancy here, just a durable and fun bird feeder.Updated 5/29/2013: the replacement I bought has a quality control problem with the suction cup portion that holds the feeder to the window (kinda important).  One of the suction cups was noticeably thin and seemed to have a hard time holding onto the glass.  Turns out (after cleaning the glass multiple times, moistening the cup or not moistening it) that it just won't hold onto the glass for more than, say, 30 minutes.  This is without any squirrel attacks.  It just falls away.  So half the support for the thing is just not there and shortly after you place it, it will sag to one side hanging on the one good cup and look really, really sharp (not).  Oh well, at least I got one working suction cup instead of none.Yes, this is a very inexpensive item but it's not a high-tech or complex item to get right either.  It's meant to hang onto a window.  If it can't properly do that, there's a problem.  This is likely a sample defect but it should never have gotten to the end user in this condition.Fortunately the remains of my old one were still in the trash bin and I retrieved the old window attachment part, which still works fine, so I'm good for now.  Glad the trash pickup wasn't a day sooner or this thing would have ended up in the bin the following week.
B000EI8QUE I have four indoor cats who love watching the birds and other critters outside. Their cat tree is in the living room window with an unobstructed view of a birdfeeder on a shepherd's hook and a bird batch. However, there is a porch in between the those objects and the window, so they don't get a really good look at the birds.I recently found birdfeeders that suction cup to the window, so you and your cat get a VIP seat to watching your feathered friends as they nibble away at the seed. With a big picture window in the dining room, I ordered one for it and another for the window in the guest bedroom where my kitties like to nap.I put both feeders up on a Thursday evening, and by Saturday, the one in the dining room window was all the rage with the birds in my neighborhood. And of course, when a strange pecking sound was detected from that window, it soon became an area of prime interest to my cats. I have a cat perch the same height as the windowsill right next to the birdfeeder so they really get a good look at the birds while they eat.This is like the best entertainment center I could ever have bought my cats. Phoenix, in particular, is obsessed with it. She used to be next to me in bed when I awoke, but now she is up with the dawn, back in the window watching the birds. She stays there until dusk, with only quick breaks for the litter box or food, then she Is right back in the perch again, waiting for more birds. The poor thing is exhausted by the time the birds finally leave at night as this is seriously cutting into her ability to nap during the day.The other cats love it too, although they haven't been able to secure much time on the perch with Phoenix's obsession. They do, however, enjoy the view from the floor underneath the window.As for the feeder I hung on the window in the guest bedroom, it hasn't received quite so much activity. I'm not sure if the birds don't like it because it is higher up (that window has a screen and I had to hang it in the top pane) or if they are just too used to getting their food from the feeder on the shepherd's hook not far away. I've tried leaving the other feeder empty for a few days, spreading food on the ground and in the window sill outside, but although that feeder has had some activity, it hasn't been anywhere near the volume the other one has. I am considering moving it to the big window in the dining room too, but figure I'll leave it where it is for a few more weeks to see if it picks up momentum.Out of the first two I ordered, one didn't work so well. One of the suction cups just wouldn't stick for long. I called Amazon, who promptly exchanged it with one that works perfectly. .The feeders are easy to refill. They have two pieces - the hanger that suction cups to the window and the feeder container that has a hook to hang it on the hanger. I've had no issues yet with either of them falling and I like that you don't have to remove the suction cups from the window just to fill or wash the feed container.I've been very pleased with these feeders so far. Both me and my kitties have thoroughly enjoyed bird watching with them.**Updated 04/30/12**I can now attest to the fact that the suction cups will hold the weight of a fully grown squirrel sitting on the bird feeder, as the photo I am uploading to the product images will prove. This drove my cat Phoenix nuts! :D
B000EI8QUE This feeder holds a lot of niger, and mounts very securely on the window. It's design keeps the seed clean and dry, which platform types do not. Also, the birds can't walk in the seed. Three birds can feed at once. We are very pleased with it. PS The first one arrived with the suction-cup hanger missing. i notified Amazon, and a new one was here long before they could have gotten the one i returned. Very good service. Thanks!
B000EJ11X2 Go to You Tube and watch the \"Sprout People\" video and you will see how easy this is to use. Like most people, I have tried most of the sprouting methods and trays on the market. This is too easy. Three TB of seeds (Sprout House seeds),The Sprout House Organic Sprouting Seeds Broccoli 1 Poundinto the container. Rinse a couple times a day, swirl to shake off most of the water and put them back up on the window ledge. 5-6 days later you have great sprouts. The best thing about this is that you can store the finished sprouts right in the container in the refrigerator and they last for about 2 weeks. That is, they WOULD last that long, but we eat them on everything and they're gone long before that. I have 4 sprouters going all the time, a few days apart so we never run out. A sandwich isn't complete without them. Do yourself a favor and get the OXO mini salad spinner too. Perfect for the final rinse.
B000EJ11X2 This design is the best.As long as your seeds are viable, these sprouters make growing fresh sprouts unbelievably easy.Now, instead of purchasing bland, expensive alfalfa sprouts in the grocery store, which is often all that's available, we can grow fresh mixes that have more flavor and crunch.They're wonderful on sandwiches and add a lot to salads.We eat a lot of salads, especially in the summer months and our climate is too hot to grow most lettuces during the summer.Growing our own sprouts allows us to add nutrition and interest to simple meals year round.Years ago, I used the jar method, but nothing I've tried works as well as these simple sprouters.  They truly are Easy Sprouters.
B000EJ11X2 This sprouter seemed expensive when I ordered it but it's definitely worth the price due to its simplicity.  I had a very successful sprouting experience on my first try!These are the items in the box:- Solid outer cup- Slit bottom inner cup- Slit insert for smaller seeds like alfalfa- Domed slit lid for measurement and ventilation- Vented lid for storage- Solid lid for air-tight storageI purchased Todd's Seeds Broccoli & Friends mix and here are my steps for sprouting with the Easy Sprouter:I used 2 - 3 tablespoons of this seed mixture to sprout in the Easy Sprout.  My house is coolish in the winter (55F - 65F) so I put the Easy Sprouter in the oven which is a bit warmer than the rest of the house.  If you need to make it even warmer, turn on the oven light to add a bit more heat!  NEVER turn on the oven itself as that would cook the seeds and melt your Easy Sprouter!Here are my sprouting steps for my sprouter:1.  Since there are small alfalfa seeds in this mix, put in the small-slit insert to the inner slit cup to prevent these seeds from washing out.  Put the inner cut into the outer cup.  Soak 2 - 3 tablespoons of seed in the sprouter for 12 hours.  Put on the slit dome cap to allow aeration.  Put the sprouter in the oven for a warmer environment if needed.  Otherwise, leave it on the kitchen counter.  (You do not need light for sprouting.)2.  Pull out the inner cup (with the slits) to drain out the water. Turn on the faucet to give the seeds a \"shower\" and allow the water to drain out completely.  Shake the inner cup and tap it against the sides of the sink to drain out all water.  Put the inner cup back into the outer cup (solid cup without slits).  Put back on the slit dome and put the sprouter back into the oven.3. Repeat #2 every 12 hours for about 4 days.  It's necessary to give your sprouts showers to wash off any potential mold and to maintain moisture around the seeds.4. To store your sprouts, just take off the dome lid and put on the vented lid.  It'll keep for about a week or so.For videos and recipes, check out SproutPeople.
B000EJ11X2 Yeah, it's somewhat expensive for a few pieces of plastic, but the pieces of plastic make sprouts easy. A Ball canning jar is cheaper, but I had poor luck with it. Also tried the super thin plastic stacking trays. They didn't work either. This one works very well. Get a few pounds of sprouting seeds and one or two of these sprouters and I think that you'll be happy. I am.
B000EJ11X2 You cannot use the entire container. It states you can, but if you do, the lower third of the container will be full of seeds that either won't sprout or barely sprout at all. That makes for a container full of seeds, some having sprouted and some that haven't. If you dump the whole lot into a tray, then when it's time to harvest, you'll have that bottom third not ready to harvest. It's wasted unless you wait for it to catch up.In order to use this container properly, you can really only put one cap full into it. One and a half will fill it up once most of them have sprouted, but it will leave about a 1/3 unsprouted. If you put that much, something happens, either due to improper drainage, air flow, or pressure from the weight of the seeds above, that makes the bottom third of the container non-sprout.If I had to guess why, I'd say it's due to airflow being blocked (too many seeds in a vertical column).Aside from this, I also use a cylindrical glass container combined with a 6\" or so bowl-shaped strainer. It's just as easy as this thing is, but you're just left to rinse off the strainer. Just press the curved side of strainer into the top of the opening, tilt, hold strainer to the opening, and let it drain. It can even be flipped completely upside down. It isn't perfect, but neither is this thing. I find they both work the same, and at least with the glass container, I can flip the entire container upside down since it's larger and have the seeds at the bottom get moved around. You can't do that with this difficult sprouter because the container is small; the seeds can't be shaken and mixed up as well once they start sprouting.
B000EJ11X2 I grew up sprouting in jars with perforated lids and later in bags. Jars don't drain well but it's easy to get sprouts out of them, bags drain well, but getting the sprouts out is a little harder.This system is fantastic. If you're sprouting anything with small seeds like alfalfa or radish seeds you'll use the insert that comes with it to keep the seeds in the main part of the sprouter. This is built so you can soak, rinse and drain all in the same container- then use that container to chill your sprouts. It keeps them just right so you can rinse less often, twice a day is sufficient, and sometimes I forget and only rinse once a day.Everything grows so well in these because none of the seeds are sitting in standing water, and using a fork to toss them when you rinse them keeps them from clumping up.It takes less space than jar sprouting because you don't need bowls or anything else to prop them in at the right angle for draining. This is a set up that will travel well.I've recommended it enthusiastically to friends. I have 3 of them, and plan to get two more for my adult son to have his apartment. If you've ever decided sprouting is just a pain, or gotten fed up with the other inexpensive methods- try this. It absolutely lives up to it's name.
B000EM2SSG My husband had an old pair of these shears, and sharpening them finally gave way to the request for a new pair.  He's very happy with them--clips grass around shrubs much easier, and the handles are very comfortable.  My only \"negative\" comment is that the shears almost seemed to have been used when they arrived--either that or the oil lubricant discolored the blades a little.  All in all, a satisfactory purchase.
B000EM2SSG These are very made and they do make my gardening much easier.Pros:Very comfortable handlesSmooth cutting actionIt is light so does not cause hand fatigueSolid build quality. Will last a very long time.No batteries or charging to worry aboutAfforableCons:It takes longer to trim the grass edging than the cordless electric trimmer.Summary:It may not be as fast as an electric trimmer, it does the job very well, quietly and efficiently.
B000EM2SSG The handle grips are comfortable and reminds me of the old sheep shears, They cut great and ae easy to use on the hands,  Thank you,
B000EM2SSG These grass shears joined my backyard arsenal this past spring. I bought an old style reel mower a couple of years ago and have been in the need of a manual pair of shears ever since for the \"holidays\" it leaves.  Unlike a lot of things that I buy, I did no shop around for a cheaper model on this purchase.  I had some old grass shears that have been around for decades and had just about had it.  My neighbor bought this very same Ames model and I was totally impressed with it.  When it comes to a pair of these shears, it really does come down to the beef and quality of the construction.  For just about all of them are made with the same system in mind.  When I went to the store to buy these, I was able to compare all the different models side by side.  I had pretty much made up my mind to get this pair after borrowing my neighbors, but comparing them up front and personal solidified that decision.  These babies are as quality built as they come and should last a lifetime if taken care of. They are well padded and comfortable, extremely sharp, and make it a breeze to snip any grass or weeds.  (Also, personally I have not had any problem with the blade holding pin locking itself without accidentally. Someone else here did, and I thought it only fair I say that for me that has not been a problem at all).  If you have need of a pair of grass shears like these look no further.  In my opinion they are the best you will find without moving up to a power model.  They are a pleasure to use and friendly on the environment.  Highly recommended...
B000EM2SSG Ship'd from AZ - 15th April - arrived today - 20th - Had almost hoped they would come next week as had promised neighbor they would get a 'test ride' around her more than 100 running feet of flowerbed bricks/edgings - Took less than 1.5 hour.The grip is perfect - the cushioned handles are non-slip / blade length excellent - easy lock/unlock and rounded tips for safety - and 2 boot a 10 yr warranty -Ames True Temper True Temper Pruning Solutions Professional Grass Shear #234930Highly rec. over anything else on the market for the Ames' reliability.
B000EM2SSG Same model as pictured - but mine ended up an orange/red color. These pruning sheers are wonderful - I highly recommend.
B000EVE17S I would love to review this product, but one of the pieces arrived broken and there's no number or address to ask for a replacement part!  I've informed Amazon, but it's been almost a week and no reply.  So, here's what I can tell you.  The bench looks beautiful.  Nice, dark wood and looks very sturdy when assembled correctly.  But I would never buy another product from this company as there is no way to get a hold of them when a piece is broken or missing!
B000EVE17S The pros:1. easy to put together2. does not tip when two people are sitting on it3. lightweight but sturdy...center legs support4. nice to have as an extra seat or two around a fire pitThe cons:1. overpriced...and this is a big one!2. strangely finished...color is reminiscent of years ago when redwood was stained and varnished...does not look quite like the photo shown
B000EVE17S When you open the package for this bench, it's intimidating because there are so many bolts and such.  Also, the instructions are not helpful at all. Fortunately, my husband is pretty good at assembling products, but if that's not a skill that comes intuitively for you, you might have a hard time with this.  Also, I hope your wrists are strong or that you have some sort of electric drill; assembling this requires a lot of wrist use.Once put together, though, it seems sturdy and looks nice(I'm surprised at all the reviews to the contrary; I'm quite picky, and I think it looks fine).
B000EVE17S I'll say upfront, I really like the look of the wood on this bench and as I was unpacking it, was very pleased with the quality, finish, and look.  The box was in perfect condition, so I was very surprised when I pulled out the longest curved piece with is the support that runs under the bench and it was in two pieces (i.e. broken in half at the joint).  This obviously didn't happen in shipping because the pieces were well wrapped and, as I mentioned, there was no damage whatsoever on the box.I had the perfect number of screws (I noticed some other people mentioned having too many), but thought the instructions were pretty confusing.  There was no text whatsoever.  Just very busy pictures trying to show what screw to put into what hole.  In the end, I went with common sense.  In some places, there were wooden rods to be used as guides during assembly.  Mine were snapped off and the broken off pieces were not in the box so I know that occurred prior to packaging.In the end, I was able to piece the broken part together and because of the design, get it to fit tightly enough so that it won't come apart, but I would expect much better quality for a $90 bench.  The finished product looks great though and I'm happy with it.
B000EVE17S Right out of the box, I saw several issues: Part G was broken in half. I used some wood glue to glue it back together. Several parts had nicks and dings on them. It was not packaged well, or didn't have enough protection IN the packaging.Item took about 30 - 45 mins. to put together. Use a drill or electric screwdriver, it'll save you time! I'm not particularly quick at assembly, so I'd guess this might take the average person 25 mins. to assemble. The bench was pretty easy to assemble, though some pieces didn't have pre-drilled holes (piece H). The screws went in fine, however. Instructions were good, though not great. Luckily, this is a pretty simple piece to assemble.If you look at the picture of the item on this website, the color is not exactly the same as what you pull out of the box. It's all one color (the pic makes it look like it's two-toned wood). It's a dark brown. Almost a cherry/orange. Nice color, but the picture here on Amazon should be updated - it's not an accurate representation of the color. The varnish/stain isn't applied in the best manner and you can see streaks and drips in the finish. This item, like everything else nowadays, is made in China. The quality is average, at best.The bench is light-weight and moves around easily. It does feel sturdy, however. We've had two people sit on it (150lbs. and 280 lbs.) with no issues. Though it appears cheaply made, I don't have any concerns about it's structural integrity.Based on the quality, I'd say it's about $40 too much.
B000EVE17S I've never heard of the company that's selling this.  And I'm glad, because when products like this, they'll be out of business VERY soon.I'm not going to detail every problem with this thing, but perhaps enumerate a few:1.  The stain is applied completely unevenly.  Some pieces are much darker, and there are run/splotch marks all over.2.  There is no protective material around anything in the box.  This leads to problems later in the life of the bench:a.  There are numerous spots all over that have had their stain rubbed nearly completely off.b.  A couple people come with pegs in them:  all but two come broken.c.  A long piece that appears to be provided for additional stability:  broken in the box (no visible damage to the box.)3.  The top wood grain in the picture looks nothing like what I have.  It's just more of the same \"stain\" glopped all over.4.  The wood pieces, especially the center support piece, doesn't line up correctly.  It's about an 1/4 of an inch too short.5.  Want to call the company to ask for spare pieces or warranty info?  Too bad for you:  there is no contact information anywhere, save for the outside of the box - the same place that has this product incorrectly labeled \"OUTER DOOR BENCH.\"  The correct label:  a bunch of broken scrap wood.The only redeeming factor of this entire piece of garbage is that the instructions aren't confusing because of a bad translation:  there are a total of 4 words, and some weird picture/diagrams that aren't entirely accurate for putting this thing together.Don't waste your money on this.  It's absolutely horrible.  If you happen to get lucky and they figure out that padding small pieces during shipment is a good idea - and hire some QA for other aspects, it's still not a very good product:  most build-it-yourself pieces, when you screw them together, have the metal hardware generally hidden from view.  Not this gem:  the \"official\" pictures here appear to be some cheap 3D renderings and not an actual product picture; you can see screws in the legs and across the top ridge in the real thing.A bad design for a bench from a company that likely has no quality assurance.  Do you really want to waste your money on it?
B000EVE17S This is a nice looking bench if you don't look too closely. The finish is rough and uneven in many places as if it were applied unevenly. This does not give it a rustic look but instead looks sloppy. The quality of the wood is poor. It looks and feels like pine, although it may be fir. It's definitely not a hardwood.The bench was shipped UPS and arrived in a thin cardboard box, not the usual sturdy box that I'm accustomed to receiving from Amazon. The pieces were loosely wrapped in foam. No bubble wrap, nothing to secure it but some tape. Consequently, I wasn't surprised that them main support bar (the curved one at the bottom) was split in half. Because it was split on an angle we were able to repair and secure it with zip ties. Looks a little odd but it worked. Several other pieces have cracks in them but were not broken all the way through.Since I received this as a Vine review item we proceeded to assemble it rather than return it. Assembly was very easy and we had the bench put together in about 10 minutes. The screws and hardware provided were high quality, better than the wood for the bench itself!I am using it by my patio table on the back deck. It seats two and is sturdier than it appears. Only time will tell how well it will withstand the rain and sun. If it becomes unstable for people to sit on, it will be re-purposed as a stand for some of my potted plants in the front garden.Because of the high cost ($89), the horrible way it was shipped and the broken parts (others have had the same problem so it's not just my UPS route), I am forced to rate this lower than I would have liked, but it's just not worth it unless the company makes some changes.
B000EVE17S I really can't give this item a fair review simply because when I opened the box, one of the legs was broken. I was so disappointed as this was going to go in my garden surrounded by flower trees and pretty plants. I am very disappointed because this was a Vine selection, and I know the chances of getting it replaced are nearly 0. If I had something good to say about this product is that the photo does it no justice. The wood is a sort of pretty cherry wood, or at least that is what it looks like. of course assembly is required.  I have no doubt that who ever orders this and receives it with no broken pieces will be very pleased with it. So disappointed.,
B000EVE17S This product is very cheaply made.  Although my bench had all the parts and none of the wood was broken - it is very clear that the wood is very soft (probably pine) and will be a one-season bench.  The one I received also lacked the rustic 2-tone look that the Amazon picture presents.  Mine is stained a dark brown and it almost looks like it is painted.  The finish is not consistent and there are quite a few spots showing irregularity that could have easily been smoothed out when the finish was still wet.On a plus side - the one I received went together quickly (I would recommend using a cordless drill/driver).  The assembly directions were only illustrations and although they lacked detail - there was enough information to put this bench together with little problem.  My product was adequately padded during shipping and it didn't suffer any damages through the mailing process.Overall, this is a very basic bench that two people can sit on.  There is no doubt in my mind that it is going to wear very prematurely and frankly if you want to extend its wear - you probably should be storing it in a dry area when it's not in use.  I personally think that it is horribly overpriced for the quality and workmanship.  My Bench was a complimentary product through the Vine program - I really think that had I paid for this item I probably would have sent it back.
B000EVE17S Not a bad little bench when you get it put together. There were more pieces than I was expecting though, and the instructions are a little sparse. Still, my neighbor helped me out and we were able to get it together with a couple philips head screw drivers in less than half an hour--make sure you have each piece in its correct positions before installing screws, we had to redo a couple pieces, which began to split. But it's nice looking and relatively sturdy just the same.
B000EVE17S I have to say up front that when I received my bench (unassembled) there was one piece broken. This wasn't a big deal -- I just glued it with some Elmer's wood glue and it was fine after it dried for a day, probably stronger than it would have been originally.Then I had a friend assemble the unit as I watched -- he is much better at this sort of thing than I am. He had it together in about half an hour. There are LOTS of screws but they go in okay, no problems there.When the bench was finished and all the screws were tight, I found that it is not a solid as I anticipated. I'm pretty heavy at 265 pounds and, on my wooden porch, it does have just a little side sway if I lean one direction or another.The finish seems very good and it appears that it will defeat any reasonable weather issues.This would make a nice little campfire bench, (as long as you keep it back from the fire at an adequate distance, a couple of feet), or to put under a tree in the shade during the summer. I think it would be best to set it on a prepared surface rather than directly on soil.I wouldn't buy another but I think it will work for most folks. It would be especially good for children.
B000EVE17S I assembled this bench  right after it was delivered.  I expect MUCH MUCH better quality for the price of this bench!  The directions are bit confusing because the wooden parts are labeled A,B,C,D,E,F,G,H, etc and so  is the hardware .It is not very  big, you could fit two people but it would be tight.The quality is poor. There are all kinds of marks, places where the finish was gone do to damage.  There were a couple of places where big chunks of wood  were missing but they  put the finish right over these areas.The finish is very splotchy with areas/spots that are a different color  than the finish. Many scratches, digs, rough areas on the wood. It looks like they may have used  a wood filler in some areas and instead of sanding those areas down and staining to match the wood they just put the finish over these areas, but it did not adhere and the wood filler comes off.It looks like they  used odd pieces of wood, (pieces maybe leftover from other projects that they didn't want to waste), or collected leftover wood from  a lumber yard, I do not know . I do know this bench is poor quality  and I question how well it would stand up to the elements.  I think I will sand it a bit and use some marine grade polyurethane on it .It might work better as a plant stand! or instead of a fire pit bench you could use it to burn in the fire pit!!I took several photos but you can only  do a video on here . I would never recommend this bench to anyone. Way over priced for the quality and construction.
B000EVE2ZE We are enjoying the CobraCo Fire Pit.It is a small unit for a compact patio and is well balanced.Easy to assemble if you can get past some pretty terrible instructions.It is cast iron...so rust would be expected...protect the iron if that is an issue with appropriate treatments.
B000EVE2ZE We had one that was more plain before but it just got all beat up and wasn't pleasant to use.  This one is much more sturdy and I love that it includes a cover.  The tiling is a nice feature as well.  Overall, it is a very nice fire pit.
B000EVE2ZE Thinking here in Arizona that we do not have enough winter to really enjoy this.  Thinking winter like the east coast offered.This iron brick fire pit with a screen and a plastic cover arrived within two days,anxious to really get a good look at this pit, I worried my husband to put this together NOW!, not waiting for the week end.You could tell he thought this was going to be a few hours work and after dinner he relaxes with WOW on his computer...35 minutes out side and he came back in...I am thinking...he needs a different tool..fooling about!.. None  of that, he had finished!Some of the reviews mentioned difficulty,he experienced  perfect fit and when I got to have hands on, I was delighted with the weight, size and the brick ledge.I never thought that summer in Arizona I would enjoy a fire pit in the evening, so romantic, water features, light breeze and of course....SOMORES!A 70 year old kid still enjoying memories of a  childhood on the beach in Ocean City, Md. With a fire and marshmallows...Funny old life.  Highly recommend a fire pit to any area, any temperature!5 stars for sure.
B000EVE2ZE Out of the box, the instructions for assembly are pretty much \"eh,\" so it was kind of \"by guess and by golly\" to assemble it.Also, I was NOT impressed that the main ring that supports the cast iron firepit was bent and already had rust on it in multiple places right out of the box.  All the framework is hollow, which leads me to believe that once rust takes over, the legs will eventually break. But, I suppose it will take a number of years for that to happen so long as kids don't stand or sit on the unit while it's not in use.I STRONGLY recommend keeping the unit covered when not in use.  The metal screen cover rusted after just one light rain.  I imagine I'll have to get some high-temp black paint at some point in the future.  The cover provided is very thin vinyl, so you may want to get (or make) something more sturdy.In my opinion, the screen cover is a bit low, making for a shallow firepit, not allowing for too much wood to be added.  Therefore, if you want bigger fires, you might consider something else, unless you don't care about using the screen.  For the small-fire, backyard marshmallow roasters that we are, this should be fine.Overall: Three and a half stars. Upside - The actual cast iron pit is attractive, good quality, and should last a long time. Downside - the shallow bowl means small fires only, and early indications are that rust will be an issue.
B000EVE2ZE The instructions for this fire pit are horrible. There are two different lengths of screws in the bag, but the instructions only list one size. We tried putting it together as per instructions, but since you can't actually see the picture well on the instructions, we were having a hard time getting the pieces to match up. So, we started the other way and attached the bigger iron ring to the legs first THEN the smaller ring last (called the \"support ring\"). We kinda had to bend the legs a little to get it to work. Fire pits aren't that difficult to assemble, but without a clear picture and accurately labelled screws, this was a pain. Took two of us about 30 mins. to assemble.In fact, it looking at the instructions, the parts don't even look exactly the same. There's a sort of \"grill\" bottom to the cast iron fire tub and the leg braces are not the same shape at the top.The bowl itself is nice and heavy, but the legs and rings feel not as well-built. The cover is pretty thin and flimsy. I suspect it will last about a year or less.The fire pit itself (well, the bowl) seems well built and handled our first fire just fine. The instructions note \"before attempting to cover the fire tub with the protective vinyl outdoor cover, be sure to invert the fire screen top inside the fire pit\". I have no idea why, esp since there's a handle on top.For the price, the bowl is nice and heavy, but I'm not sure it justifies the higher price considering everything else is average quality.Item does come well-packed. Item is made in Chine and/or India.
B000EVE2ZE Since moving to a rental house with my own yard, I've wanted a fire pit. I recently built a brick patio out back, and now have a perfect place to enjoy a nice fire on cool nights. The CobraCo FB6102 Round Cast Iron Brick Finish Fire Pit with Screen and Cover sounded like just the thing for me. Since I want to leave the fire pit on the patio, the cover is a perfect addition to the set.The cast iron bowl should prove to be durable, another plus with my plan to leave it outside.The pit was packaged well - with the exception of eight screws that were thrown loose in the box. There was no mention of these screws in the instructions, and they were longer than the screws that were in the hardware package. Once I began assembling the unit, however, I realized what those extra screws were for.The frame for the fire pit was not machined very well. The legs don't fit well with the rings that hold the bowl. Consequently, the shorter screws that come with it don't fit every place that needs a screw. Enter those mysterious longer screws. There are twelve shorter screws in the box with the nuts and washers attached and I worried that with only eight of the longer screws, I might run into trouble. I was relieved to find that I was able to make the short screws work in four spots, although a couple of those places were tight.Because it was not machined well, it was extremely difficult to put the legs on the rings to make the stand. I've put far more complicated things together, such as gas grills and exercise bikes, but this was harder. Trying to get the holes on the legs to align with those on the rings was difficult towards the end, and trying to get a screw through those holes was difficult as well.Once completed, the assembled fire pit looks good. There are two small holes on one side of the cast iron bowl, and I can find nothing in the documentation that explains why they are there.The plastic cover fits well over the fire pit, and the cover seems durable enough to withstand being left outside. However, the screen cover does not fit as well as I would hope. There are gaps around the edges that allow sparks to escape. While the screen does minimize how many sparks fly away, the gaps allow for a good number to get out.If you are using the screen cover with the pit, you'll find you can't fit very many logs in the pit at once, but I expected this pit to be good for small fires, not huge bonfires. This isn't a negative, just a point for potential buyers to be aware of. I was able to fit about three logs on it.For the price range this fire pit falls in, I would have expected it to be made well enough so that the screws can be easily attached in their places and so that the screen cover fit neatly around the pit. Still, it is an attractive fire pit and does feel durable. While I think it will work fine, I think that for the $173 this fire pit currently sells for (at the time of this review), you can do better.
B000EVE2ZE I first purchased the WAD931SP Slate/Tile Outdoor FirebowlUniflame WAD931SP Slate/Tile Outdoor Firebowl with Copper Accents, which is attractive and easy to assemble. However, my husband then purchased this one as well (one is in a patio area, the other in an out-back grassy area with a smaller patio). They're pretty similar, as they're made by the same company, but there are a few differences.Aesthetically, I think the Slate/Tile Fire-bowl is more attractive, but I suppose that's just personal taste. However, this one is odd to me because realistically who would make a smooth, rounded fire-bowl out of bricks and have it supported by curved steel legs? If you look, the bowl is meant to look like bricks so that seems odd.I will say that this brick fire-bowl is definitely heavier and more solidly built than the slate/tile one. Very likely this one will end up lasting longer than the slate one I picked, just based on the solidness of it. However, if you do want to take this places, the slate one is much more portable because it's not so heavy. I find it a bit funny that this one tries to sell it as so portable, but compared to many of the various fire-pits it's heavier.Another advantage to the slate one is that it has an edge big enough around it to set things on, so you can use it a bit like a table when you don't have a fire going. If you tried to use it as a table with a fire going you'd heat up or melt whatever sat on the ledge, so not so useful in that way.Both of them have the same, kinda crappy, screen cover. I say that because the fit isn't quite right and the supposedly high-temp black paint is a joke. After one fire the paint melts off and then once that area gets wet it rusts right away. We don't have any rust on the legs, so I think those will hold up, It seems the only place rusting is where the paint melted off the screen.Another consideration is that you will need some type of long pole to lift the lid off once you have a good fire going, as it does not stay below the screen but goes above it. We build a bit of a peak when making a fire and so ours goes about 6-9 inches above the screen (thus the burning off of the paint). I ended up buying a lid lifter used for dutch ovens over a camp fire, but it's a bit short. Many of the other fire-pits come with a lid lifter and I think these should supply that as well but they don't.Brick look firepit:More durable, long lastingHeavy, so not so easily portableNo rim or edge, so only useful as a fire pitKinda ugly in my opinionSame crappy screenNo screen liftercomes with a pretty thin but functional vinyl coverSlate/Tile fire-pit:Really attractiveLighter weight, so more portableHas a rim/edge, so you can set things on it when it's not in use/hotSame crappy screenNo screen liftercomes with a pretty thin but functional vinyl coverAll-in-all they both do the job and they're fun to have. I'd say that if you want one to last a very long time go with the brick looking one. However, if you want one that is really attractive, go with the slate.
B000EVE2ZE We had another fire pit that we thought was acceptable, but decided to give this one a try because of the positive comments about it.  In general, this fire pit is functional and has several advantages, with a couple of minor disadvantages.This fire pit comes in pieces, and does require minor assembly with basic tools, such as screw drivers.  The instructions leave something to be desired, but assembly is relatively simple and the pictures on the box are there as a guide.We like the weight of this fire pit, since our previous fire pit was relatively light and easy to blow around during high winds.  The weight does make moving the fire pit more difficult, but that comes with the advantage.Some people seem to have mixed reactions about the style or appearance of the fire pit.  The metal has a brick appearance, but we paid little attention to the design until preparing for this review.  Either the design is pleasing, or it is not.  We like the design and it goes well with our outdoor d&eacute;cor, including the color of the fire pit.This fire pit comes with a mesh metal cover to prevent excessive sparks from flying about, though, as with all such covers, smaller sparks can still escape.  This fire pit also comes with a vinyl cover that is advertised to keep water and leaves out of the fire pit.  The vinyl cover is a fail in that water goes right through it.  If you really want to keep water from your fire pit, either move it to where water cannot reach it, or buy a better quality fire pit cover, preferably one that is heat tolerant.One significant flaw is the lack of a tool to remove and replace the metal mesh during a fire.  Fortunately, we have a metal tool with a long hand that we use for such purposes.  Touching the metal during a fire, either to replace or to remove the cover, is going to give you a nasty burn.We love the weight and the beauty of this fire pit, and it seems like it will give us years of service.  The vinyl cover is more for show than functionality, and a tool to remove and replace the metal cover would be a significant enhancement to this fire pit.  With a better storage cover and a tool for dealing with the mesh cover, this fire pit would easily be a five-star product.  With the minor flaws, we give it four stars.Enjoy!
B000EVE2ZE Everything is packed nice and tight inside the box, so there is no internal movement before opening (which reduces the chance of scratches).The fire pit was very easy to assemble.  It took my husband about 15 minutes.  The manufacturer even included extra screws, though the extras were too short.  I love that his is heavy duty.  We have a lot of high-wind days, and this fire pit stays put -- no chance of it blowing away, even on the windiest of days (although if I lived in hurricane alley, I'd bring it in during a hurricane).The only thing I would change is the cover...  I would prefer the cover have an elastic edge, to keep it firmly on my new fire pit during the windy days.  As it is, the cover doesn't serve much purpose if one lives in a windy climate, like I do.  I'm going to buy theVeranda 44-Inch Round Fire Pit Coverto cover my my fire pit.
B000EVE2ZE I put this fire pit together, went to 3 different stores looking for wood (it's warm here in SC and there was none to be found in April), and finally got a fire started.In order to put the fire pit together, IGNORE the instructions, and look at the photo on the top of the box. You'll be able to figure it out from there.This thing is heavy. I didn't realize but the product description does tell you up front that it's 37 pounds. It's sturdy.We made s'mores over the course of several days and invited the neighborhood kids over to help us. I used a large pieces of wood and got the fire started. I didn't use the cover for s'more making since I didn't want burnt marshmallow all over it. I'll definitely use it for cooler weather, but it will be several months before I'm able to use the fire pit in cooler weather here.It appears to be strong enough to hold up to the elements and frequent use, but will update in a few months if it doesn't.The vinyl cover is cheap, but it's vinyl.
B000EVE2ZE This fire pit is very well constructed, & should hold up for quite a while.  It's a great addition to any outdoor gathering!  Assembly is easy, even for the most mechanically challenged.  I am concerned, as a few others here have noted, that the legs & lid may rust, so I'd recommend covering it, &/or putting in a shed/garage when not in use to prolong the life of this product.Overall, this is a great product that should add enjoyment to any backyard, or camping trip.  Recommended!
B000EVE2ZE This is a very nice heavy-duty firepit. The only problem with it is that the screened lid is just not high enough to allow the burning of enough wood. So, I keep having to remove the lid to add wood. There are replacement covers that are much more rounded and higher.I like the edge all around that allows you to put your feet on it when the fire has burned down a bit. The cast iron construction will allow this unit to last for many years.Every year, I wire brush the screen lid and spray paint with black fire resistant grill paint and it lasts all season.
B000EVE2ZE I put this together by myself, but man did I mess up on the first try.  Fortunately, the metal ring was fairly forgiving.  There are a couple slight creases where I applied pressure to connect the legs because I didn't realize they were connected on the inside (lesson learned - refer to picture on box first).The instructions were not at all clear regarding leg placement. I believe the box picture is likely all you need after a glance at the instructions to read that the small ring is attached to the legs first.  There were screws of two different sizes and no explanation why. And there were leftover screws that led me to think I'd done something wrong. I finally just determined that things fit and it was sturdy, so good enough.A helpful note in the direction states to empty the fire pit after use (I know, duh) and then invert the screen to put the cover on.  This may help cover more of the legs and avoid some of the rusting issues mentioned in other reviews.  I think I'll just plan on buying a larger cover eventually, one that will cover the legs better.The bowl is quite heavy and larger than I anticipated.  I like the looks of it very much.
B000EVE2ZE This is a good, solid fire pit that throws off a lot of heat for your outdoor gatherings. The shape allows for seating on all sides.  I can't say that this is the most attractive finish I've ever seen, but it's simple, and the pit does the job its intended to do, so I can't really complain.The biggest problem is that it rusts.  The lid rusts very quickly, and I fear the legs are going to follow.  The cover didn't help protect it from our spring rains.  I fear it's going to take constant wire-brushing to keep it clean, and a coat of rust-protecting paint at some point.  Or, I can schlep it into the garage once it's cooled down.  That's kind of a pain considering the weight.
B000EVE2ZE I really like this fire pit.  I think it is attractive and durable.  6 months ago I had purchased a $60 model at *arget and I am grateful that I got this one.  I let my husband put it together and he had no trouble as he is good with putting things together.  It is much more heavy than my last pit and much sweeter to look at.  I like the cover, make sure you have let it cool down before you put it on.  We have it on solid stone so we haven't had a rust issue yet.
B000F0BVYE Our house is adjacent to a wooded area that is part of a reservoir watershed area. The woodland critter life is abundant: deer, fox, possum, groundhogs, raccoons, squirrels and chipmunks abound. Individually, cute enough in Disney movies or as babies (except for the possums), but collectively we've experienced the damage they can do when they move out of the woods and into the small area next to the woods we'd like to preserve for human habitation.We tolerate the full, two-entrance ground hog den just inside the woods beyond our back yard, but have had an intermittent problem when these chucks extend their range, and dig a one-hole \"summer den\" closer to our house. The spoil from the entrance digging is unsightly, and we can also do without the other evidence of ground hog life they leave behind. And if this summer home didn't annoy us enough, our dog can see it from the family room window, and gets more than a little agitated when he sees (or imagines he does) one of the residents traveling between their homes in the woods and our lawn.Enter Critter Ridder:I applied this liberally to the entrance and approach areas of the summer den. So far this pepper-based repellent has been effective in discouraging the groundhogs from returning. We'll re-apply after the next heavy rain, and then fill in the summer den...again (and keep some in reserve, in case the next crew to appear has no memory of the stinging reception!).I recommend wearingnitrile gloveswhen using this, and washing your hands immediately after. And don't touch your eyes or face in between!
B000F0BVYE Feral cats are the scourge of my inner city neighborhood.  They keep out down rats, but they have been using my carport as a Kitty Country Club.  They howl and fight all night.  They seem to love playing with my motion detector lights.  They get shade from the hot summer sun.  And  they spray their markers like a drunken poker game.  I can use the Havahart trap, but what to do when caught?  I can take them to the edge of town for coyote snacks.  I cannot just kill them, but the noise and using my yard as a litter box is getting to me.Havahart has a couple of other remedies.  This gritty mixture is one that I am trying.  Three weeks and not a peep.  I have not seen one in my carport.  But I cannot give a blanket endorsement:- It lasts only a month under ideal conditions.  I have not had any rain, but that might shorten the life considerably.  It is too expensive to buy 12 times a year.  And while only irritatingly toxic, I am not one who believes in laying down sixty pounds of chemical a year.  So it better make a lasting impression in just a month, which makes sense.  Negative reinforcement is powerful.- It works by repellant odor.  So while a dry climate may mean it will not just soak into the ground, dryness also dampens odors.  But it is working.  They do not like sleeping around it.It covers 500 square feet, which is just right for me; the Amazon description says only 200.  So if I do not get new cats, or the old ones do not return for six months, that would be acceptable, but only time will tell.
B000F0BVYE i have a dog that likes digging in the most unwanted places. Recently, the dog started digging a hole right in front of the front door! I tried everything to stop the dog , nothing worked. Finally, i poured some of the Havahart critter ridder into the hole - it worked wonders.My dog not only stopped digging that whole, she gives the front door a wide berth. The packaging of the repellent is also well thought, it comes in a plastic container that has a pop-up dispenser which you can close by pressing down after use.It is tightly sealed, so unwanted pouring out is prevented. This definitley keeps DOGS away from unwanted places.
B000F0BVYE A neighbor puts out whole peanuts for what was one squirrel.  Now all the squirrels in town know about it.  They get a bunch of peanuts, all that will fit in their mouth, then come to my flower pots and flower beds to stash them for later.  Not only are my pots & beds sown with peanuts, they dig up everything!!  As soon as I received the product I put out the Havahart Critter Ridder and no trace of squirrels in the pots or flower beds since.  I smoothed the dirt before spreading it and it is still smooth!!  There are no deer around but there are cats...  I don't see signs of cats digging and covering poo out there, but it's harder to detect (until one is digging in the dirt to insert a new plant).  I haven't tried this powder around the edges of the back yard plantings yet to keep my dog from going into the area to 'talk' with the neighbor.  If it DOESN'T keep out the dog, I'll be back to let you know.  So, if you don't hear from me again on this...  it's working for the dog too.  Yeah!!!!  Finally something that truly works (and even after a rain or two on it).  Oh, it was very easy to spread with the built-in shaker.  Since my areas are small I just barely lifted the lid section intended for spreading the product and the right amount came out.  For larger areas one might want to open it further to get a handfull for broadcasting, although I believe it works best as the label describes, to just sprinkle it around areas where you do not want critters to enter.  It's working!!7/9/2012 update:  Saw a squirrel head down the fence top yesterday so it's time to re-apply.  Lasts a good month which is really good for this type of a product.
B000F0BVYE I applied the product as stated, still had problems.  I even threw it in a garbage can with 1 bag of garbage to see if it would scare anything off.. nope.  Luckily my garbage is far away from the house where it isn't a horrible issue and I can feel good I feed the critters all year round.
B000F0BVYE While I do not mind the cats or occasional squirrel in the backyard I do mind the racoons.They are smart big and so clumsy that they can wake me from a not too deep sleep while going about the garden hitting and banging and bumping their way through the night.However, I do not want to hurt them just kind of shoo them away.  I keep Food for them on the outside of the fence but that is never enough. So I am grateful for something other than the cayene pepper a neighbor suggested to move them along without any injury to the animals or the garden itself.It was easy to apply and lasted well into the season and there were no victims or problems.That is a clearly successful product to me.
B000F0BVYE I've tried everything I can think of for our raccoon problem - powdered mountain lion urine and various sprays, and nothing has worked for more than a day.  Unfortunately, the Havahart Critter Ridder joins the long list of things that have tried and failed to keep them from trying to get into the kitchen or tear apart the deck.The Critter Ridder is made from various peppers and capsaicin oil.  It does not smell very good, and you have to use gloves to apply it to make sure it does not get on your skin or in your eyes.  The raccoons seemed stymied by this for two days... and then they were back.  I reapplied the powder, and it still didn't seem to matter - they were rattling the cupboards at 3 am like always.  So, in my experience, failure for raccoons.I gave this product three stars because it did seem to work in the garden to keep the deer from eating the flowers.  I apply this once per week and so far so good with the deer.Other reviewers have also mentioned the cost factor, and I agree - if you have to apply this weekly or even more frequently as a deterrent, it is going to get pricey quickly.  I do not think it worked any better or worse than the lion urine or Keep-Away, which due to the quantity you need to apply was actually more cost effective.If you want to keep deer away, I think this would be a good choice.  For raccoons, I just can't recommend it.
B000F0BVYE This product has a number of appealing features.  Most importantly,it is not toxic, created from pepper compounds.  It is reputed to last up to thirty days.  It is easy to apply and the shaker container is managable.  Additionally, it can be applied indoors or out.  According to the package,it is designed to  repel racoons, chipmunks, squirrels,skunks, and groundhogs as well as cats and dogs.I thought this would be an ideal way to deter my neighbor's dogs from charging on to our property.  Even though the road is lethal and the woods are full of hungry predators, think bobcats, coyotes and bears, the neighbors let their pets run loose.  So far they've lost two dogs to traffic and three cats to predators.  Although the dogs seem like nice little fellows, I have a territorial German Shepherd who takes umbrage at their daily excursions. I don't appreciate them using my lawn and garden to eliminate. So it was with high hopes that I sprinkled this about.  Unfortunately it did not deter them for more than a day. Ironically, I now see that the dog crossing has now become a chipmunk transit route.  So while I like some things about this produ
B000F0BVYE Maybe the neighborhood cats relieve themselves in the flower beds a little less often.  Maybe.  It doesn't affect the squirrels at all.  The Deer Off spray from Havahart works better at keeping the squirrels away but even that is only temporary.Maybe it will work better for others.  We have what amounts to a wildlife sanctuary in our back yard.  The neighborhood is full of pecan and oak trees.  Those trees are full of squirrels.  We have bird feeders to attract birds.  The bird feeders also attract the squirrels.  The birds and squirrels attract cats.  Sometimes the cats get lucky with a bird or squirrel but mostly the cats just hang out and turn the flower beds into latrines.  The squirrels destroy plants and containers and chew through wood trim on the house and get into the attic.  If the cats would only eat all the squirrels and leave the birds and flower beds alone it would be welcome.  Doesn't happen.  And this stuff ain't makin' it happen either.This stuff doesn't work for us.  You might have better luck...if you're not living in a wildlife sanctuary like we are.
B000F0BVYE This product is essentially ground up pepper ingredients.  It even looks like pepper, and smells somewhat like pepper.  The three main, active ingredients are:#1.  Oil of black pepper:  0.48% by weight.#2.  Piperine (comes from black pepper): 0.185% by weight.#3.  Capsaicin: 0.032% by weight.The other 99.3% are \"other ingredients\".When you open the big blue jug, please note, it is five pounds by weight, but the jug is about 3/4 full, so visually you get the impression its a bigger quantity by volume than five pounds actually is.I used it around the perimeter of my home, which is regularly visited by a couple of stray cats, chipmunks, and deer.  I also have a pet dog and cat.  I did not expect miracles, and as with any product of this type, you need to accept that it is a deterrent, which hopefully minimizes these unwelcome visitors, nothing tends to eliminate intrusion by these animals completely.While pepper odor can be an effective deterrent to ward off some animals, I find it effective sometimes and ineffective other times.  Some animals will deal with it and others will move on.I did not find that this product made any difference at all in the amount of pests who frequent my property.  I tried a couple of applications in various places.  None of the chipmunks, cats, squirrels that I observed seemed to notice its presence at all.  I did not spread it thin and I followed the instructions.  In fact, I ended up applying it heavier than instructed, and still no noticeable difference in animal visits.But, if you do want to include pepper in your deterrent approach, I do not see any reason to pay $5 or $6 a pound for this product.  5 pounds amounts to 80 ounces.  Since the active ingredients (various forms of pepper) make up less than 3/4 of one percent of this jar, or about half an ounce, you could buy black pepper and some hot pepper powder or sauce and make your own, homemade powder for far less.For deterring deer from flowers and shrubs, I use a mixture of tap water, some chili powder and one egg (left to rot in a one gallon plastic bottle), along with some liquid dish soap for adhesion.  So you could possibly not use the egg (attracts some animals, even when rotten) and add a little more pepper, dish soap or baking soda.  You'd end up with something that would work as well as this product.
B000F0BVYE I got this for the crawl space under my parents cabin.  I wanted something safe for when the kids are playing, but strong enough to chase away critters.  My parents are mostly concerned about skunks and the occasional groundhog or woodchuck.The odor is strong and peppery, but much better than skunk spray.  I think you have to stay on top of applciations because the damp soil/earth will probbaly reduce the potency.So far so good and it seems to be doing its job.  I wish it were a little less expensive, but then again professionals are much more expensive.
B000F0BVYE Someone told me that chipmunks are becoming an endangered species, but not in my neighborhood.  They were having a free for all in my flower garden.  Since using Critter Ridder, I haven't seen them and there's no evidence of digging.  Though it doesn't make any claims about deer, they haven't eaten my impatiens so far.  Havahart has a pleasant odor to humans, kind of like cedar, but apparently is umpleasant to animals.  A humane solution of pesky animals!
B000F0BVYE Citter Ridder's main ingredients are Oil of Black Pepper & Piperine (extracted from black pepper).  The product states that it is safe to use around cats, dogs & other small mammalian wildlife.My main purpose was to put it on my indoor potted plants to keep the cats out of the plants.  CRITTER RIDDER WORKS!  No more sleeping in the pots, chewing the leaves (pots are tall enough so the leaves do not hang down far enough for kitty to reach), or using the dirt as a kitty commode.The container is 5lbs, so large enough for multiple applications.  It has a good handle & the shaker is easy to use, but there really is no measuring - the product comes out of 2 large holes in the pop-up lid.  It does smell like ground pepper & may make you sneeze. But, in my opinion, a little sneeze is worth it if the cats stay away from my plants.I've found that I have a cat that wants in my plants no matter what, so the 30 days is too long to wait in between applications - I re-apply every 2 weeks & that seems to keep the cat at bay.  The plants are happier.
B000F0BVYE I live on an acre lot in a rural subdivision. White-tail Deer are a daily nuisance inthe neighborhood and over the spring and summer, I used Deer Off to help protectazaleas, day lilies, and other ornamental plants around the yard.During this time deer continued to come into the yard on a regular basis but theydid not nibble on the treated plants nearly as much as when I left them untreated inearlier years.I tried the Critter Ridder granules around my back deck where we keep ourtrashcans and recycling. Raccoons, skunks, and oppossums are all attracted to thisarea. While I've been using Critter Ridder, I've not had them get into the trash at all.I applied the granules to create a 1 to 2 foot wide barrier around the deck and alsosprinkled some under the deck around the cans. I did this roughly once a month.The shaker can is easy to use and it only took a few minutes to spread the granules.
B000F0BVYE I have flowers planted on the opposite side of our sidewalk next to two trees which are a magnet for male dogs. It makes me disgusted that people let their dogs urinate on my lovely flowers, but I can't stand guard 24/7, so I decided to try this product.I must say again, I cannot watch 100% of the time, but each time I've seen someone walk their dog past, they have not stopped to do their business on my flowers anymore since using Critter Ridder. The best part is that this product is mostly made from hot pepper, so there's no harmful chemicals or nasty ingredients going into the soil. I would definitely recommend this product.
B000F0BVYE I discouraged squirrels from beneath my birdfeeders with a heavy application of this stuff.  It worked until we had rain.  I also spread some in front of my hosta to keep the dogs at a distance, but those two applications, far less than advertised coverage, used the entire container.  I started with a light application, but that had no effect at all, so I sprinkled quite a bit more in the places I wanted protected.  I saw no squirrels where I applied it for over a week, but after it rained they were back.The container handle and pour spout makes spreading the product quite easy.  The material looks about like rough coffee grounds and isn't visible on the ground but would be on a deck or concrete surface.  I didn't find the odor bad at all and could only smell it when I was first applying it.  If it were less expensive, I'd continue to use it for problem areas like around the trash cans and birdfeeders, but as it is the price is a bit high for me, especially when considering the need to reapply after rain (and I presume after watering flowers or shrubbery in the area).
B000F0BVYE I live in southern Arizona.  We have a problem with coyotes and feral cats and even our neighbors' free-roaming dogs and cats.  This product does work against repelling both cats and dogs, but I've noticed you must use more than directed.  Heavy rains (like our current monsoons) also affect the efficiency of this product.My dogs clearly hate this stuff.  When I opened this container I definitely noted the black pepper aroma.  The granules, which feel like sand, are also oily.  That's surely from the active ingredients of black pepper oil, piperine and capsaicin (the latter being the \"hot\" in red chili and powder).  All three combined make up only .6% of the active ingredients.  So why is this so expensive?  It looks good in the garden because it's not noticable.Capsaicin is one of the most effective organic materials to use against dogs and cats.  It doesn't harm the plants nor the soil. But its effectiveness is reduced by direct sun and heavy rains.  Capcaicin is one of the most recommended product to use against dogs and cats and is more easily available in raw form in spice shops, and also much more affordable.I find the most effective use is for our large indoor plants.  Our cats now stay away from our potted indoor trees with this stuff applied around the top of pots.I can not vouch for chipmunks, squirrels and raccoons since we don't have those animals here in the high desert where we are.  I rate this a 4-star product because 1) it's very pricy and 2) it needs to be applied more and heavier than 30 days even under ideal, dry conditions.
B000F0BVYE There is a neighborhood cat that likes to use our yard as its litter box. I have been very frustrated by this problem for a long time. A few weeks ago I sprinkled some of this stuff in the areas I have seen the cat hang out and so far so good. I haven't seen any evidence of the cat leaving its \"calling card\" in our yard. I like the convenience of this product. The granular pellets are easy to scatter around the yard. I don't have to deal with a messy, smelly liquid that I have to spray all over the yard. I just grab a handful of this stuff and scatter it around. Couldn't be any easier. It has yet to be determined how effective it will be over the long run. I will update my review when more time has passed. Like most other animal deterrent products, you have to reapply after heavy rains. The biggest drawback of this product is the price. Hopefully the price will come down and make it more affordable.
B000F0BVYE I like cats.  I like dogs.  I just don't like my neighbors' cats and dogs using my flower beds for toilets or digging through my trash cans.  Therefore I ordered Critter Ridder.  It has a strong peppery smell but I like pepper so it didn't bother me when applying.  I would advise not using when windy out, though, because you might get a face full and I fear it would be like being pepper sprayed.The shaker container is easy to use.  I sprinkled in my flower beds and so far (two weeks) no cat visits that I can tell.  But then no rain either and I have spot watered so the repellent doesn't lose its effectiveness.  I also sprinkled some in and around my trash cans.  One dog is pretty persistent and it hasn't kept him away but it does seem to keep the other dogs away.I also have some ground squirrels that have burrowed under my storage shed so I sprinkled out there, too, and haven't seen any activity since I applied.I hope this continues to work and that I don't need to apply too frequently because it is fairly expensive.  But if it lasts at least thirty days as promised I will be happy and will continue to use it.
B000F0BVYE This Havahart \"Critter Ridder\" is effective at repelling the animals that make a habit of frequenting my low, rock fence line, most notably squirrels, rabbits, squirrels, and the nasty little dog that the neighbor likes to let do it's \"business\" in my yard. This applies easily from the shaker bottle and seems to last about two weeks for us but we did have several very powerful rain storms come through, which will reduce the effectiveness.I am hoping that a few applications of this will condition the pests to seek other areas where they can frolic, away from my plants and not befouling my yard.Recommended!CFH
B000F0BVYE This product is designed to keep away pests - small pests- when they dig and ruin gardens.  I originally wanted this for use around the perimeter of my vegetable garden, but it is not for use near food plants.I have had only a few problems in other areas of my yard which I could test this on, but the problems are not as bothersome as they are with the vegetable garden.I have tested it around flowers and garbage areas (we live in a rural area) and so far nothing has touched those areas for 30 days.  We have not had a lot of rain, so I can not comment on how long it lasts during rainy seasons.So far, nothing seems to be bothering those two areas, but again, the real problem areas are my vegetable garden so I wish I could have tested it on those areas.  But at least I have it for the garbage area in the winter, and the other areas which seem to attract the little pests.I will update with any further input as I continue to use this.
B000F0BVYE This product works to keep critters out of specific areas, but seems to only work directly where it is applied.I was hoping to also use it as perimeter control, sprinkling around my barn to keep out cats, skunks, etc. However as a perimeter control it didn't seem to work.When I applied directly to the corners in the barn that were being used for nesting it cleared out those areas, but the critters found somewhere else to make a home. I kept tracking these areas down and applying more repellent and eventually it seems the critters are gone.
B000F0BVYE We wanted to try Critter Ridder to see if it would help keep the squirrels away from our birdfeeders.To be honest, it seemed to keep them away but it also seemed to keep the birds away too.
B000F0BVYE I put a line of this stuff around my yard (it covered the half of my yard [going down border] that I have problems with neighbor dogs).  The stuff is easy to pour and you can easily walk around and sprinkle the stuff around.  I have not seen any animals in my yard (main concern is dogs), and when I see dogs running around I do not see them coming into my yard.  My only thing to note, is that dogs seem to hate this stuff.  We put it around our yard, and dogs in a nearby fence (about 10 feet away), started growling and barking and baring there teeth as we put the stuff around.  So be careful if you do it near a dog, as they seem to get very violent toward you when you have this stuff out.In the end this seems to work and covers a pretty good amount of coverage, however, dogs seem to hate it so hopefully that will mean they will stay away and out of my yard!
B000F0BVYE I got this in hopes it would stop the rabbits in my yard.  I applied it as directed in paths of the critters.  I did not notice ANY improvement, nor did my cocker spaniel seem to stop at it's locations.  I wish I could report it works well, but not for me id doesn't.  My imagination says it kept them at bay for maybe a day, but a no rain day later, things were back to the way they were.  I think it was my imagination.  I have not had luck with any product.  Nothing more to say about this - it failed me.
B000F0BVYE I've had problems with coyotes, wild hares, skunks, opossums, gophers, mice, and neighbors' cats messing up my front/backyard lawns and gardens. I spread thisHavahart Critter Ridder 3146 Animal Repellent, 5-Pounds Granular Shakeraround areas where I've seen those critters frequent and caused damage. After about two weeks, I haven't seen any new damage caused by those annoying critters/intruders.  The granules are easy to dispense; similar to a giant pepper shaker. The granules' aroma is not too offensive; smells like strong black pepper and doesn't bother our family or guests.  The only drawback is the rather high cost of $27.50/5 lbs.; I've already used about half the container to apply one application to my front and backyards. The claims of rain-resistance and 30 days effectiveness remains to be seen.
B000F0BVYE I live in an area frequented by all kinds of wildlife -- chipmunks, deer, squirrels, groundhogs, foxes, raccoons, and even the occasional bear.  I had hoped that Havahart's Critter Ridder would keep them all at bay, particularly the groundhogs.This product cannot be used on vegetable or fruit gardens/plants.  Although I knew that going in, I decided that I could outline the perimeter of those areas to discourage critter trespassing.  I also had newly planted areas of my property where the deer had nibbled, and I wanted to see if this would keep them out so I didn't have to spray the actual leaves of those delicate, new plants.  Last, I had clear entry points to my property where the deer and groundhogs entered and left, and I wanted to encourage them to find other ways, hopefully onto someone else's property.Not surprisingly, the Critter Ridder did nothing to discourage the chipmunks that had already moved into my vegetable garden.  It also did not discourage new animals from visiting.  Veggies must be too tempting to let the scent of Critter Ridder drive them away.  I had much better results around my newly planted areas.  My guess is that this product works best first thing in the spring, before animals have a chance to establish their routines and favorite feeding grounds.The product smells like black pepper when first applied, and then dissipates in a day or so.  Animals supposedly can still smell it.  This 5-pound container doesn't go far, unfortunately, because it must be reapplied after heavy rain.  For those of us with larger properties, one container doesn't begin to cover the perimeter of garden beds and property lines.  I wonder if a large container of ground black pepper would work just as well -- and that could be used in vegetable gardens without toxic results.-- Debbie Lee Wesselmann
B000F0BVYE I have had a horrible time with rabbits eating my plants so, even though rabbits weren't listed as an animal this repels, I figured I'd give it a try.  First, I watered everything and noticed as I watered that the ants had nested in my garden again.  I have a horrible time with ants and, believe me, in the past, watering hasn't gotten rid of them at all.  I put down the Havahart Critter Ridder pretty thick and left everything.  I came back two days later to water again and noticed the ants were GONE.  I'm talking, not a single one.  The only thing I did different was the Critter Ridder so, for now, I'm going to give the credit there!  It also appears to have stopped the rabbits because nothing was eaten down more than two days prior.On a side note, I didn't read the container until after I sprinkled it all around my raspberry bushes.  It is not to be used with food crops.  Oops!  Good thing we're in our first year of raspberry bushes and they aren't producing yet.
B000F0BVYE I was hoping that this product would keep the squirrels out of the fruit trees, but it didn't phase them.One of our pear trees is far enough from other trees that they can't just jump from tree to tree, so I decided to try this product around it.  Less than an hour after applying the product all around the tree, the squirrels were crossing the band to climb and retrieve fruit.Other reviews seem to indicate that it work from some people in some situations, but our squirrels are determined to strip the fruit from every tree and this product didn't stop or slow that process.
B000F0BVYE We live in a completely wooded area in NW Wisconsin; woods begin where our lawn ends with the nearest house 1/2 mile away.  We have had \"issues\" with deer, bear, coyotes, raccoons and little ones like rabbits and gophers.  We've tried moth balls, pepper, red pepper flakes, etc.  Nothing really worked on a consistent basis.This does seem to work.  It is obvious when you open it that pepper is the main ingredient.  The container has a built in pour spout, it is convenient but may be larger than really needed and given the price of the Ridder this is important.  It comes out smoothly and is easy to sprinkle around.  But a five pound container does get a little heavy quickly.  We went about a week with no problems around the three flower beds and one tree that I put this on.  Given the amount used this application would have cost about $10.  After some rain I did have to reapply it as I noticed some animals seem to have reappeared, in fairness the Ridder does say this in the instructions.Two caveats:1  Above I repeat the word \"seem\", there is really no concrete way to know for sure, we have gone weeks with no problems with no product used and then have found bears tipping our garbage cans (they have to go out the night before pickup giving bears, etc. a night to find them - we actually spray a liquid repellant on the cans), deer munching on our newly planted trees and so on.2:  It does not work on for dogs.  We have FIVE dogs and to be honest they do not bother our planting areas of which we have nine.  The day after I put this on three planting areas all three boy dogs (two Shelties and one Golden) went around and marked the area as if it were a challenge to beat out the smell of the Ridder, our female Golden stuck her head into the plants like she was searching for the Holy Grail.  Our female Sheltie did ignore it.  So for dogs it did have an 80% failure rate.
B000F0BVYE I got this in the spray bottle and it works just as poorly.  I shake the product around my plants and it works fine until we have a dry spell and everything is withered except my garden.  Then NO-thing will prevent critters from raiding your watered plants.  What a disappointment.
B000F0BVYE I got this product hoping it woud keep squirrels away from my bird feeders. I have six squirrel proof bird feeders. My squirrels, Mensa members all, have figured out how to overcome the \"squirrel proofing\" and eat the bird food until the feeders are completely empty. I placed generous amounts of Critter No-Ridder under each of my feeders. As soon as I walked away the squirrels were back and I could hear them giggling and winking at each other as they brushed away the No-Ridder whle giving me knowing glances. This is a genuinely useless product, at least as far as squirrels are concerned.
B000F0BVYE LOCATION TESTEDSouthwest VirginiaPESTSDeer, Skunk, Raccons, SquirrelsUSEI applied this in the yard since we get deer and skunk.  For about a month, we had no issues and our flowers survived the typical onslaught from deer.  I didn't see skunks, and I haven't seen skunks for some time, now.  I don't know if it repelled them long enough to move elsewhere.OVERALLI'm impressed.  It actually works.  I'll need to acquire more to keep this up.
B000F0BVYE I normally have a family of chipmunks that like like to eat my pea and bean plants, I sprinkled this around the outside of my raised beds and I did not have any problems. I only used it once, after the plants are bigger they don't want them. I am not sure if it would work for other animals.
B000F0BVYE The screens around the pool and deck were breeched.  Finding that a raccoon (in the middle of the night right outside my door) had come in was bad.  Finding that the raccoon had found the cat flap and gotten into the house was much worse.  I had a broken arm the first time and still I went after him swinging a broom and stomping loudly on the reverberating deck.  Yes, he was scared.  He was so scared that he didn't look where he was going and landed in the pool.  He came back a few nights later.  Finally I set a trap with a chicken leg tied in the back over the trip plate.  He was so annoyed that he tossed and turned and moved that trap 15 feet from where I had left it and in turning it over - escaped.I put critter ridder outside on his avenue of approach and carnage.  NO FURTHER INVASIONS !!!Nuf said?
B000F0BVYE I did not have any success repelling rabbits with this product. I wish I had though, because I hate rabbits and they're ruining my lawn.I had much better luck using this product:Havahart DO64MS Deer Off II Deer, Rabbit, and Squirrel Ready-to-Use Repellent with Battery Powered SprayerGood luck!
B000F0BVYE This gentle and all-natural organic Havahart Critter Ridder 3146 formula repels by taste and odor groundhogs, skunks, dogs, cats, squirrels, raccoons, chipmunks and other nuisance animals unless they are starving or otherwise out of normal control, e.g. rabid.  This is not an industrial repellent working against anything that walks, but rather for the suburban home and garden use.  Its oil of black pepper, peperine and capsaicin are not offensive to people and applicable not only in gardens, lawns, and landscaped areas, but also basements, cellars, and storage.
B000F0BVYE I have 4 dogs in my house, two of whom are real diggers.  Their favorite places to dig, naturally, are my flowerbeds and garden areas.  Two years in a row I've tried to use a 4' x 8' raised bed for growing some vegetables.  Each year the seeds or plants were dug up and often replaced by a bone, rawhide chew, or even a toy.  I'd decided not to even bother using it this year because of the wasted time and effort to say nothing of seeds and plants.I received the Havahart Critter Ridder a few weeks ago and immediately sprinkled it over my raised garden bed just to see what would happen.  My garden bed has quickly become a no-pets zone.  Every animal I have, dogs and cats both, avoid the treated area.  No more holes, bones, or \"kitty surprises\".  I can finally use my raised bed for what it was intended, not the amusement of my pets.Great product, I highly recommend it.
B000F0BVYE This definitely works to keep our cats from using our window planter as their favorite litter box.  I don't like spreading chemicals all over the garden so I researched the ingredients in this product before I started using it.  I like that it's all natural.  Here's a description of what it contains:Essential Oil of Black Pepper - Famous for its use as a spice, some animals hate the smell, but it's perfectly safe.  According to the EPA: \"When used as proposed, Animal Repellent Granular is not expected to result in oil of black pepper residues at levels that are of toxicological concern. The information submitted indicates there is already widespread exposure to oil of black pepper without any reported adverse effects to human health.\"Piperine - This is another extract of black pepper, which triggers nociceptors (pain sensing nerve cells) just like the effects of red pepper.Capsaicin - This is the main ingredient in chili peppers that causes the burning sensation, familiar to those who love spicy food.  Although it triggers nociceptors, there are no lasting biological effects.Animals have an excellent sense of smell and will avoid these compounds before they get too close, and will learn to avoid it forever if they do, so pets will not be harmed.
B000F0BVYE I understand why many like this and many don't.  Havahart is asking you to throw down a lot of loot for what amounts to something that smells like mace (the spice) and nutmeg and cloves (or whatever) all mixed together into a small container.  While spices aren't cheap, their potencies will fade with time (compare freshly ground pepper with the pre-ground stuff), so that's why some are outcrying that the stuff only lasts a month, etc.  I found the product worked best in conjunction with other pest control measures.  We were getting an opossum or two in our crawlspace (under the bathtub) along with accompanying fleas, so I crawled under the house for several hours (not fun) and sealed up a bunch of areas with flexible latticework, patio tiles, a staple gun, Great Stuff Pestblock Insulating Foam Sealant (Dow Product 11000714 \"Great Stuff\" Pestblock Foam Sealant - 12 Oz Can Gray (Pack of 8) and the Havahart Critter Ridder Animal Repellent.  Bottom line is that you either need to use 100 pounds of this stuff and reapply it often (after rain, perhaps) OR you need to use it in conjunction with other pest control measures.  If you want to go with the former option, dumping vinegar, bleach and/or freshly ground black (or cayenne!) pepper might be just as effective and less expensive.
B000F0BVYE There was a groundhog digging all around our shed, he had entrances at all four sides of the shed, and we couldn't get rid of it for ages. This year I applied the Critter Ridder at each of his holes and I see vegetation growing around undisturbed, and I didn't  see the animal since then.Most important, it didn't smell of urine as other repellents, so I could actually enjoy my yard after applicationMy only complaint was with the jar shaker cover, it lets too much product out so you should be careful and not dump the mix all in one big pile.Edit on September 28, 2012: the company representative commented on my post that the lid has adjustable opening, I checked the package, and it is true - you can open it halfway, and it \"clicks\" in this position, so it won't slide as you shake. I wish I realized it earlier.And I still do not see the groundhog, so the repellent still works, maybe it is because I applied too much of it earlier.
B000F0BVYE One thing I've learned about critters: Not much is going to stop them if there is promise of a big reward, especially in the way of food.  I doubt this product would work to keep squirrels away from a bird-feeder, for example. And if a yard is overrun with raccoons, it might not make much of a difference unless you eliminate the attractant.Our main issue is the racoons going for our garbage can. We already use a bungee cord, so they can't get into the can. But they can still create a racket. I've sprinkled this product around the area and so far, so good.I took off one star because I remain uncertain as to the safety of this product. There are too many warnings about how not to use it (e.g. in vegetable beds). I don't know if that's due to the pepper, etc,. potentially damaging delicate roots or something more toxic. The active ingredients comprise less than 1% of ingredients. I would like to have known about the 99.3%. Why not say what it is?The product container does sport a \"seal of approval\" from the OMRI (Organic Materials Review Institute), which could be legitimate or could be a pesticides-industry mouthpiece. I don't know which one.Here's what it says about OMRI at Sourcewatch:The Organic Materials Review Institute (OMRI) describes itself as \"a national nonprofit organization that determines which input products are allowed for use in organic production and processing. OMRI Listed -- or approved -- products may be used on operations that are certified organic under the USDA National Organic Program. ... Mainly, however, the organization generates income through fees collected for the review of products intended for use in organic production or processing.\"At any rate, I'm unlikely to use this near any soil where food crops might be grown.
B000F0BVYE I had a terrible time with ground squirrels and rabbits eating our new plantings this year. I used this item in conjunction with other products, including moth balls, and it made the difference between survival and replanting. I can't say this product did it all, but as part of the mix, I was very pleased with the results.
B000F0BVYE This product can be washed away easily.  So consider the area you want to protect:  A garden that you water frequently?  A yard that is covered by a sprinkler system, or is mowed frequently?  If those situations are representative of your problem areas, forget this repellent and keep looking.But if you can keep the product out of the weather and away from the watering, then this will work for you.  I've used it around the perimeter of our pier and beam house--placing it underneath the house about 6-12 inches.  My neighbor's cat likes to hang out underneath the house where it's cool.  We do love Coco dearly, but she started stowing her kills under there--somewhere we can't reach.  Well, she's put some very large dead things under our house this summer and you can imagine the smell that lingers.  This product has put a stop to her habit.I could rate this product five stars because it worked for me in our particular situation, but claiming that it works in gardens is far-fetched.  I wish it worked for armadillos and possums. If Havahart ever develops an effective armadillo deterrent, I'll buy stock in the company.....We used to have a major problem with squirrels and we got them under control using three Havahart products:Deer Away 5202 Animal Repellent Ready-to-Use Spray with Hose 128 oz.We spray it on tree trunks and the dense foliage keeps the spray from washing away in the rain.  We also use two Havahart traps:Havahart 1083 Easy Set One-Door Cage Trap for Squirrels and Small RabbitsHavahart 1078 Live Animal Professional Style One-Door Rabbit, Skunk, Mink, and Squirrel Cage TrapThe first trap I mentioned is the better choice for squirrels.  (We trapped over fifty squirrels in the past six months.)
B000F0BVYE We really only wanted to rid ourselves of the pesky chipmunks stealing our bird seed and planting in all the flower beds.  We put the Critter Ridder down and I haven't seen one in the area we protected since doing so.  So, so far, so good.  I am going to purchase another so I can sprinkle all around the house.
B000F0BVYE This product is presented as a safe and effective deterrent for a variety of animals. The active ingredients are pepper compounds, the scent of which can deter animals. However, I've found that many animals aren't really affected by the application of Critter Ridder, either because it wears off quickly or isn't active enough in the 1st place. If you use it I would recommend a solid application in the areas where you'd like to repel animals, if it's too weak then animals can easily adapt and ignore it. Also, rains neutralize it, so it's a waste to apply it during rainy season. I believe you could create your own herbal animal repellents with plant oils and extracts and get better results than using these granules. The granules may seem convenient and safe, but so far they seem low on the scale of effectiveness.  The cats, dogs, and rodents in my area don't seem that disturbed by this repellent, and applying even larger amounts in hopes of making the application stronger would make the cost excessive.
B000F0BVYE I was excited to try this, as I've had raccoons knocking over my garbage and recycling cans for weeks this summer. I followed the directions and applied lots of this all around the area where my garbage is, even sprinkling a little in the garbage for good measure. I closed the lids tight. That same night, it was worse than ever-- garbage knocked over, trash all over the side of my house. By the time I saw it, there were flies swarming and birds picking through it... meaning that I guess flies and birds don't mind this repellent either!It would be one star except that I do like the idea that it's safe and approved for organic gardens-- but it's clearly not effective in all cases.It leaves a peppery smell in the area, and you're advised to wear gloves while applying it.
B000F0BVYE I've never used pest repellent before however live at the edge of a forest treeline so we constantly have skunks, deer, racoons and other critters coming out of the woods. I like the deer but don't like the skunks, for some reason something startles them around my AC unit and when that happens the house just starts to stink. We also have some bushes in our front yard that neighborhood cats seems to like to use as a bathroom. Typically daily I'd go out and see an animal, yesterday I put this out around the house and I hadn't seen the guys roaming around which is unusual.Also, I appreciate the design of this container. It has an adjustable cap on it that doubles as a dispenser so you can sprinkle a little bit or a lot depending on your application.The repellent itself has a peppery smell, it's a bit overwhelming at first but after it's been on the ground for 15-30 minutes the scent dies down.So far so good. I would recommend this if you have a critter problem.
B000F0BVYE I I have a skunk that has taken up residence under my sidewalk. I tried replacing the soil and gravel that it was excavating. It just kept digging. I covered its entrance with bricks, it just pushed them aside.Then I found this Cridder Ridder, which seems like just what i needed. I pourted it all around the perimeter of the side walk.So the skunk is just working hard at coverpowering the spicey smell of the Critter Ridder with it's own scent...The strongest skunk odor I have ever experienced!This may work with deer, but apparently not skunks!
B000F0BVYE We have problems with deer, raccoons, possums, groundhogs and more, eating grapes off our vines and flowers out of the garden. I sprinkled CRITTER RIDDER liberally around both areas, and was really pleased for several days. I could literally watch the deer completely avoid both areas. Unfortunately about five days later we had several days straight of on and off heavy rains, and before I could re-apply the product, the grapes disappeared. Perhaps the product would work better in a drier climate than what we have, as I can see the cost being prohibitive if I have to re-apply it every week or so.When it worked, it worked great. But rain is NOT your friend when it comes to Critter Ridder.
B000F0BVYE I have been successfully usingHavahart DO64MS Deer Off IIfor a couple of months to ward off the squirrels, raccoons and cats that were plaguing my garden.  When I ran out of that product, I decided to try the granularHavahart Critter Ridder 3146 Animal Repellent.This product is granular and you just shake it around areas you wish to protect.  A single application is supposed to last 30 days, but in central Florida we do get a lot of afternoon thunderstorms, so I find that I have to reapply the product after a heavy rain.As with the Deer Off II, this product is nearly as effective.  The liquid solution seems to be a greater deterrent for my animal pest situation, but the granular repellent does seem to work for squirrels and raccoons.  For some reason, the cats still want to use my flower beds as a litter box when i use the granules but they tend to avoid the area when I use the liquid.Overall - the granular shaker seems easier to shake into flower beds and vegetable gardens.  I think the shaker is less obtrusive than the spray - I was hesitant to spray my tomato plants with the spray but I have no issues shaking the granules.  I like that this product is OMRI listed, so no worries with using it in an organic garden.The only thing I don't like about Critter Ridder products is the price - it is somewhat expensive, but the price you pay for this product is (hopefully) recouped if your garden is not destroyed by animals.  I recommend the product - it did work for me.  However, I can't speak for all situations.  I think it is definitely worth a try if you want to rid your yard of critters.
B000F0BVYE My goal for this product was to help keep the neighbor cats out of my flower and veggie garden.  I followed the instructions on the container and I did notice a little less activity but one running of the water sprinkler seems to dissipate the strength of the granulars enough that the cats are able to ignore it.
B000F0BVYE It is hard to tell if any animal deterrent is actually working, but there seem to be no more cat droppings in the areas I used this. It has a peppery smell which is an irritant. This is obviously how it works. In areas that do not get rained on the odor, and presumably the effectiveness seems to last (several weeks now).  In areas that get rain (or watered) then smell goes away quickly, but it still seems effective. This may be due to the training of the cats to stay away even after the smell dissipates.The shaker container is easy to use and stays closed/sealed between applications.So far, so good.
B000F0BVYE We have a vegetable garden - tomatoes, cucumber, basil, parsley, rosemary, and mint.  I have seen woodchucks, deer and a groundhog munching on my garden.  We have tried several things in the past to deter them.  The rosemary actually worked to deter the deer, but the woodchucks and groundhog kept coming back.This stuff smells terrible - like a very strong black pepper.  We shook it around the perimeter of our 25 x 15 garden.  We reapply after each rainstorm.  After a week of use, we have not seen any more woodchucks or groundhogs - they were previously daily visitors.So, I would say that this works.  However, it need to be reapplied often (certainly after any rain).  It is quite an expensive solution.
B000F0BVYE We've been having a couple raccoons stopping by each night and foraging around the plants and trash, so we've been looking for a deterrent to keep them from getting too  comfortable and deciding to hang out.  We didn't want to trap or hurt them, or use anything with chemicals that would be bad for the plants and animals, so this Critter Ridder seemed like a good choice since it's apparently all natural and unharmful.  Apparently, it just stinks really bad to animals yet isn't bothersome to us humans.  But I  think we went a bit haywire with it because it's a 5lb canister and we used a bit over half of it for a relatively small area.  Supposedly, the canister is good for multiple applications to a mid sized area, but I doubt that, given how much we used for just 1 application.  But it seems to be doing the trick, because our security cams caught the raccoons steering clear from where we sprinkled the Critter Ridder.  The only downside I see, is this stuff is it's quite expensive for something that needs to be reapplied every 30 days, or sooner, if you water the area often or it rains.  If you had to keep this up regularly, it would cost quite a bit over the course of a summer, especially if you're trying to cover a larger area.  I'm just hoping the raccoons learn to stay away and forage elsewhere before we run out and need to buy more of this expensive stuff.  Fingers crossed.Bottom Line - works well enough but costs too much to be practical.
B000F0BVYE Havahart Critter Ridder 3146 Animal Repellent, 5-Pounds Granular ShakerSkunks, opossums, raccoons, fox, gigantic Cottontail bunny rabbits, groundhogs etc. -- there seems to be an endless parade of some cute little critter, or another, wandering around my yard (especially at night) looking for something to chow-down on -- vegetable gardens, flower beds, young trees and even my lawn -- especially in Spring and Summer!  If it's not a hungry critter, it is a stray Kitty looking for a place to take a dump -- usually in my vegetable gardens.  Yuck! :|So I thought I'd give Havahart Critter Ridder 3146 Animal Repellent a try because it says it is safe around humans, lasts for 30 days and will not hurt the critters -- just keep them out of the important stuff, if ya know what I mean..A couple of my observations:the smell is extremely spicy/pungent and may cause the eyes to water -- so, (tempting as it may be) don't unscrew the lid and take a big sniff (like I did)...wearing rubber gloves, the sturdy plastic handle, on the container, is very easy to hold on to and sprinkle Havahart Critter Ridder 3146 Animal Repellent at the same time.broadcasting over a wide area, around the outside perimeter of my vegetable gardens and flower beds was quick and easy.It's been 30 days (since I first applied Havahart Critter Ridder 3146 Animal Repellent), and my vegetable gardens and flower beds  are still intact, with no munch marks or bare spots where plants might have suddenly disappeared over night.  The stray Kitties have stopped using my vegetable gardens to bury their treasure. :)  A \"plus\" if ya ask me!  Still, I do see the rabbits hopping around the yard, in the evening, but they make a wide path around the areas I have treated with Havahart Critter Ridder 3146 Animal Repellent and head straight for the untreated clover and grassy areas to dine -- which is what I wanted them to do to start with.Life just got a whole lot easier. 'nuf said. *sips ice-cold lemonade and relaxes*Does Havahart Critter Ridder 3146 Animal Repellent sound like what you may be looking for? :)  Highly Recommended!  --Katharena Eiermann, 2012
B000F0BVYE The major reason I wanted to try this product is that we have a strong presence of feral cats, plus raccoons and badgers come out at night as well.  I have a square lot running a little over a quarter acre.  One five-pound container was not enough to cover the entire perimeter, so a week ago, I concentrated it on the two borders where I have seen the cats the most.  No change; I just chased two cats out of the covered area this morning; the product does not seem to bother them at all.  In order to cover the entire exterior perimeter (four-inch wide band) of my lot, I would need 2 and  containers; the label also indicates that one application only lasts up to 30 days, assuming you apply it as directed, only on sunny, dry days.  The annual cost for me to use this product would, therefore, be:  2.5 containers x $27.09 (current cost per container) x 12 months, equals $812.70.  From what I have observed this past week, it would not be effective.
B000F0BVYE About a year ago, a female groundhog burrowed underneath my front porch. Until I did a little online research, I didn't know just how annoying and destructive these rodents can be. Among other names, these critters are also called woodchucks and whistle-pigs. Having one of these near your foundation (and my basement) makes getting rid of them extremely difficult. According to online \"experts,\" the usual extrication methods are putting a water hose down the burrow or pumping in poisonous carbon monoxide from the exhaust pipe of your vehicle. Of course, for my situation these methods are neither practical nor safe for the house or the occupants. So, short of catching her outside the burrow when she happens to be out for a stroll or foraging for a snack, what could I do?Critter Ridder! Manufactured by Havahart (Caring Control for Pets and Wildlife) [I'm not making this up] seemed like a possible solution. The company claims that their product is \"The #1 selling multi-species animal repellent on the market.\" The product I obtained came in a 5-pound jug and, according to the label, the granules repel skunks, groundhogs, chipmunks and raccoons. Further information in the small print on the back indicate this can also be used to discourage domestic pets, like dogs and cats, from coming into your yard, flowerbeds, tagging your property, and damaging your lawn, gardens and other annoying and mischief activities.The label also stated that the formula is \"Patented & Proven Technology\" which sounded just like what I needed. It came with an \"Adjustable Shaker Spout and a Comfort Grip Handle.\" Each application is only good for \"up to\" 30 days and must be reapplied for maximum effectiveness. The instructions are very explicit that gloves must be used when applying. The printed red sticker on the label [can be seen in the product photo] had a curious claim: \"2.5x More! (than 2 lbs.).\" Though I didn't expect there was going to be math involved, I quickly realized this was a mildly clever, but completely unnecessary way of letting prospective customers know that this jug contained...2  times more granules than their 2-pound jug. In plain English, the seal affirmed that the jug I had contained a full 5 pounds of granules. Some advertising is just plain silly and unnecessary.After filling the hole with as much dirt as it would allow, I sprinkled the Havahart granules in the opening and around the burrow according to the instructions on the container. Every good burrow has a backdoor, so I did the same at the exit. Since it is spring (almost summer), this is a popular time for rodents to emerge from a long winter hibernation and stock up on food. I sprinkled the product about a month ago and so far there is no signs of any activity, either digging in or out of her burrow (aka, my home!), which is a thumbs up for this product, so far.CAUTIONS: The label on the container has an expected listing of cautionary statements concerning the hazards to exposed skin, eye, clothing and domestic animals. One thing I immediately noticed when I opened the packing box was the absence of any kind of protective seal around the cap and spout. Also, after screwing off the cap in search of an internal safety seal, I noted that there was a safety seal over the opening of the jug, but the seal was BROKEN and some of the contents was missing! I can't say if this was the manufacturer's fault or the distributor. I was probably sent a used container from Amazon.com. I will take that up with them. This discovery will not factor into my product rating. I do think, however, if the manufacturer would put an external seal over the outside of the cap, in addition to the internal seal, with a warning not to use product if the seal is broken, it would go a long way in preventing this kind of mistake. In the case of my package, there could have been a spill inside the box during shipment.I plan to add periodic updates to this review as postscripts to provide a complete picture of this products effectiveness over time.UPDATE (April 2013): I reapplied this product several times during the year and considering the lack of further damage and no signs of any activity from my \"squatter,\" I must conclude that Critter Ridder did exactly what it claimed it would do...safely rid my home of the unwanted groundhog.
B000F0BVYE I had a problem with my radishes being eaten by Peter Cottontail.  I caught him 2-3 mornings in a row.  I put this out and he's still eating my radishes.  I used more.  I have maybe 6 radishes left.  (I had tried to get a row to go to seed because I wanted the seeds more than the radishes.)  So it was no help at all with Mr. Cottontail.  I've got a trap now, and it hasn't worked either.  Maybe he is just a smart rabbit.BUT my cucumbers are directly behind my radishes, and I let my chickens out once a day and usually they try to go over and nibble my vines and we have to redirect them.  They have not been at all interested in my cucumbers since I put out the Critter Ridder.  It seems to work on chickens.I have a feral cat that gets over there a lot.  I think he's stalking the rabbit.  It has not deterred him.I haven't had trouble with deer there.SO, I think it might or might not work, depending on your critter.  Deer netting is something I've used in the past, and it seems cheaper and more effective.  I ended up potting some of the radishes and moving them into the greenhouse so I could make sure to get my seeds.
B000F0BVYE Although the product says its formula is proprietary, it leans heavily on red and black pepper. I have used these same ingredients to keep cats (off the porch) and squirrels (off the birdhouses) away. I have discovered that, like this, it is sometimes effective. Most animals do not like pepper and will learn to stay away. However, there are some--not many--who do not have the aversion.The one thing I particularly like about this product is that the granular shaker bottle makes it easy to spread the product as well as store it. It's much cheaper to buy red and black pepper, but this is definitely a more convenient solution.
B000F0BVYE I love that this product is really organic and will not harm anything, just keep it away.  I know some people are complaining about the smell, and while it is a bit black peppery, it does the job.  Frankly, I would rather notice the black pepper smell than to have to put up with some chemical smell and wonder if it was harming me, my dog or the environment.I had a problem with possum getting into the garbage cans, and tried lots of other stuff that neighbors and friends said would work.  None of them did, but so far this is working for 2 weeks straight.  I know it is working, because I have seen possum getting into other trash cans in the neighborhood, but avoiding ours.  Another neighbor has complained about raccoons and squirrels, but have not had problems with them, either.  We've had some rainfall since I put it out, but the rain was light and did not seem to wash away the powder to the extent that it quit working.  The only reason I am not yet giving it five stars is because it's only been a few weeks.
B000F0BVYE I use this Critter Ridder to keep animals away from my koi pond and veggie garden.  This item works much better than fox urine at keeping pests away.  I had a problem with animals eating my koi.  I did find that it has not kept stray cats away; however, I have not lost one koi since I started using Critter Ridder.  I was losing at least one fish a month before using the product. Fox urine alone wasn't keeping the pests away.  I recommend this product and I will use it again.
B000F0BVYE My main reason for trying Havahart Critter Ridder is the neighborhood cats. They like to hang around my house for some reason and I even found one in my car one day when I had left a window down. I sprinkled Critter Ridder all around my perimeter and especially around the garage where I see the cats hanging out the most. I watched for a week and saw only one cat where there are usually there are three or four in the gang and the one didn't hang around long. It's only been a week, so I'm going to keep watching, but so far so good for the specific reason I tried this product. However, I have not noticed it effecting the gopher that shows up every couple days, he still shows up and doesn't seem bothered by the granulars at all. The squirrels are unfazed too, but they don't really bother me. I have not seen the skunk that waddles occasionally through my backyard either, but it's a little too soon to tell with him, he doesn't show up all that often. All in all, I'm pretty happy that it seems to be deterring the cats, but it's pricey. If it only lasts 10 days as some have said in other reviews I don't know that I will be using it again.I've never tried a product like this, so if this is the case, I will be checking out other similiar products to see if they work as well. If I am cat free close to 30 days as the description promises I may reconsider.
B000F0BVYE I sprinkled this around my tomatoes and bean plants to stop the deer and squirrels from ruining my garden. So far, this has stopped the critter destruction and thievery.  I am finally getting to harvest my tomatoes and it looks like my bean plants are starting to grow again.  I like that this is not so horribly scented as some of the other products on the market.  This has a very strong black pepper smell instead of a rotting garlic smell. It seems to work as well as many of the other products out there. It has a convenient shaker lid. This is definitely a product worth getting.
B000F0BVYE Havahart Critter Ridder 3146 Animal Repellent, 5-Pounds Granular Shaker. This product was easy to apply and blends right in with the ground and dirt. There appears to be less Chipmucks and cats around. Finally the skunk has left from under our pool deck. We have tried many things and this is the first one that has worked. Their is very little odor from this product even after it rains. This product won't hurt the animals but does discourage them from coming around.
B000F0BVYE I grow a small vegetable garden every year in my back yard.  It's not much to write home about, but I am quite fond of it and don't like it when the neighbor's cat decides that my nicely rowed mounds and raised bed are it's new dumping ground.  I have often gone out in the morning to find where that cat (one cat in particular) has destroyed an area of my garden, leaving my baby seedlings lying around dying and soil scattered everywhere.  And also lying there is big pile of cat poop that I have to pick up and discard. I repair the damage as best I can but the cat comes back again and again to repeat it's havoc.I sprinkled a bunch of this pepper loaded stuff all around the perimeters of my garden and especially on the corners where the cat prefers to attack.  So far I haven't seen any sign of the cat since then (it's been several days) and I'm hoping this product is working at keeping the little beast at bay.  I like cats, I even have my own indoor cats, but I've seen this cat numerous times in my back yard and have chased him out more times than I like to think about.If this product continues to keep the cat away then I will keep using it.  It's pepper so I don't think it can really do any harm to the soil or my other plants.  I hope the worms can handle it o.k.  I like to remain as organic as I can.  I think I will try an experiment next season on squash beetles.  Every year, despite my best efforts to intervene before the damage is done they worm themselves into my squash plant stems and I can't eradicate them.  All my squash plants end up dying.  I'm going to encircle all of my squash plants with this product as an experiment to see if the squash beetles can tolerate it or not.  I hope not.
B000F0BVYE We have a variety of animals in our neighborhood including deer, squirrels, rabbits, birds, etc.  And, that doesn't count the pet varieties.  We wanted a way to keep the animals, especially the deer, away from our plants.  They come off a park behind the houses across the street from us, go through our yard, and then scatter through the neighborhood.  This product did okay, but it washes away with the rain (which occurs quite a bit) and it needs to be reapplied.
B000F0BVYE I ordered this because I needed to find something that would keep Lady, my black lab mix dog, out of the garbage.  The mice like to burrow underneath the garbage cans, and Lady loves to dig, trying to get to the mice.  This worked.  In fact, after the first application, she tried to dig under the garbage cans, and she looked at me in disgust and walked away.  Unfortunately, this only worked a week, instead of the 30 days promised.  Lady is back to digging.If this had worked for the full 30 days, I would have bought a year supply of it, just to keep Lady away from the outside garbage cans.  Unfortunately, it is too expensive to apply every week.  I'm still searching for the perfect product.
B000F0BVYE Critter Ridder is a safr-than-most way to repell small critters, from dogs to skunks, around your property. This did not work in keeping two dogs from pooping around two areas, so sorry, the main goal was not hit.  BUT, the almost daily scent of skunk is GONE. We had some fears of a sneak attack if we let out our dog; one day we realised it: No skunk smell? Hey!  Sold!
B000F0BVYE This was purchased to keep away the skunks and cats who dig up the soil in my yard.  I live out in the country and have a problem with skunks at night.  It works well for the first few weeks and then the affects grow less and less.  Wish I could find something that lasts longer.  But, to be honest, it works great while it lasts.
B000F0BVYE I am always trying to keep the dogs away from the garden and short of putting up an entire fence they just wont leave it alone. I will be honest I was quite skeptical about how good this product would work but I ordered it anyways. Boy am I glad I did. They have stayed away from the garden ever since I laid it down. The only time they went close to it was after a hard rain but once I laid down another layer they stayed away. Great product that I would highly recommend!
B000F0BVYE This is a great Animal Repellent that uses Pepper to keep areas safe. It can last up to 30 days depending on your weather. Also any digging, watering or anything that disrupts to ground will affect the coverage and duration.It works by affecting the animals sense of smell and taste with hot pepper and by getting it on their skin and in their eyes. In fact, one way to use this to take some table scraps and cover them with it. Once that skunk or opossum tastes this hot pepper, it will go elsewhere for it's next meal. Also keep in mind that open sources of water and food are what draw in such animals, so if those are still present, you will get other animals coming to the location.This also works to keep cats from using your flower beds as a bathroom, you can shake it over your birdseed to keep squirrels out as birds can't taste hot pepper and it is a non-chemical way to protect your vegetable garden from animals eating your crops.
B000F0BVYE It's very difficult to tell if this product is working. I applied it around my deck to repel rabbits. We have them in the yard, and sometimes they hover around the hostas around the deck. I haven't noticed any rabbits near the house since application, but we had rain nearly every day for a week, so I'm not sure if the product is effective anymore or not. I also sprinkled it around one of my gardens that doesn't have a fence to deter rabbits, groundhogs and moles. Since I don't have a camera set up, and I'm not monitoring it round the clock, I just can't tell if it's keeping all or some of them away.When I sprinkle it on, the product has a very strong smell of black pepper. It's easy to apply, but doesn't go very far. It's a little expensive for me to purchase for additional applications.For those wondering what the other 99% of inactive ingredients might be, I'm 99% sure it's sand. So, this is black pepper, Piperine, and Capsaicin, and a ton of sand. If they made it in a liquid that customers could mix with sand for spreadability, I wonder if they could make it at a better price.
B000F0BVYE I had high hopes for Havahart's Critter Ridder.  I live in a neighborhood that doesn't really have any public space to it, so you often find people that walk their pets and use your lawn without respecting their neighbor's to clean it up.  There are also a few pets that roam freely and have their pick of lawns.  I used Critter Ridder around the edges of the lawn to create a border.  Most dogs appear to have just walked over the border of repellent and continued to use my lawn.  They didn't even appear to be affected by the repellent, so it wouldn't have helped to spread it over a larger area.I'm sure some pets might have not like the repellent, but I definitely could not recommend this as a general purpose solution.  There were too many breeds and kinds of dogs in my yard, even the very next day after using this.
B000F0BVYE This DOES DOES DOES repel just about every critter! I put it along my tree line and it repelled the neighbor's pug who loves to dump in our yard. Also, the folks across the street have a cat that loves to poopy in our garden. With this stuff, no issues! The only reason I took off a star is because (to me) it's expensive and it does NOT last 30 days. I suppose if it never rained, it might last three weeks. Maybe..maybe four?? Now if they would just make something to keep my Beagle from running off..because at top speed, this doesn't keep her in the yard! (No, I don't expect it to..just dreaming...)
B000F0BVYE I have a severe squirrel problem around my house. The chew the cable line outside, they have even been in the house one year. I also have a large chipmunk population that creates other issues as well. I thought, hoped, prayed that this would work. It didn't. They are still all over. Don't waste your money folks. I suspect I'll have to start trapping them and \"re-homing.\"
B000F0BVYE I got this b/c we have Beagles who keep digging out, so I spread it along the base of the fence.  It has a nice pour spout that pops out of the top and handle, so that makes it very easy to spread, although it does come out quickly b/c the pour spout opening is quite large.  It is the consistency of sand, so it's not visible once it's spread on the ground.  It's been about 1 week and so far it seems to be working, our dogs and the neighbor dogs on the other side of the fence have been avoiding that area and our dogs have not attempted to dig anywhere near the fence where the granuals are spread.
B000F0BVYE I got this product to protect the strawberries and other fruiting plants in the garden, mostly against the chipmunks. It does not work well. I have since orderedContrac Blox 4x 4lbs, but I have to make sure the dog does not eat the rat baits first.
B000F0BVYE I used this repellant to kind of set a boundary for my dog. We have pet ducks and the dog likes to harass them or chase them sometimes when they are out of their coop.I poured this fairly heavily in basically a line, in a half circle and then scattered some radomly bordering the ducks' main area that they like to hang out in. It actually has worked well. My dog can smell it and he will stop almost dead in his tracks, sniff quick and look around almost like he is confused. I am sure at some point he will just jump right over it or run through it, but with it used heavily it seems to work so far.I haven't noticed the ducks trying to pick at it to eat it and they don't seem to be bothered by it either.So in my case, for this use, it seems to be a great product so far. We didn't have an issue with any other animals, so I can't really speak on much else - just our own dog.
B000F0BVYE I will update this review as I don't think any firm conclusion has been reached.We have an outdoor birdfeeder that has been victimized by racoons and a squirrel (I know it's the same one, because he has a crooked tail and is not bothered by humans!).I spread the Critter Ridder out, and have not seen the squirrel since.I can't believe one spreading would annoy a determined squirrel, but the evidence remains that I haven't seem him - so who knows!It's rained since I treated the area a couple weeks back, and a raccoon came back and tried and failed to pull the feeder down - but I'm sure the repellent has been diluted in the interim.I am going to spread the Ridder around again, and leave the feeder out - so we'll see if the raccoon comes back. He has to work pretty hard to dislodge the feeder, so maybe the Ridder will make it not worth his while.So for now, I like the product. I haven't seen the squirrel, so I can only go by the evidence. But...I'm not a total believer yet, either. I'll update and change this review as more evidence comes in!UPDATE 8/24: I still haven't seen that squirrel again. I sprinkled some more down, but I'd still be very surprised if this was the complete solution. I do have a pair of chipmunks that run around the deck area, and I have seen them before and since I've sprinkled the Ridder - but they don't mess with the bird feeder anyway.UPDATE 9/5: Bird seed is declining rapidly, and while I haven't seen the squirrel (and there are a lot of birds), I suspect him! So I'm spreading it again, and we'll see what happens.
B000F0BVYE This is a scent-based animal repellent.  Cats, raccoons and opossums come into my yard over the fence, or under it, and I sprinkled this product near their entry points.  They avoid it for about a week, but I find they tend to enter at other places; if they are coming to feed or to bother my cat, they wreak their havoc anyway.  Water, either sprinklers or rain, completely inactivates the product.I don't use scent-based repellents much any more.  If I were trying to protect a very small area - say, a patio - this might do, but there is no way to use this kind of product to protect a whole yard.
B000F0BVYE I have every one of the critters mentioned and then some (add opossums, mice, voles, shrews and even the occasional river rat) from time to time. This product does not seem suitable for application only to be washed away by rain, but is outstanding for use in an old barn where its effect is long-lasting and I am anxious to deter inhabitants such as squirrels, raccoons (especially since they are so messy) and possums. This is an old unfinished space so I don't mind strewing something semi-noxious such as this product. And since it is roofed, the stuff lasts.Another similar area is my front porch which is visited on occasion by a woodchuck and by marauding neighbors' cats. And the space underneath it where the neighborhood cats that owners claim to love but don't mind leaving out all night to pick up parasites and fight, have their Cat Conventions. This too is a protected area where Critter Ridder is cost-effective to apply.People who fail to abide by our town pooper-scooper law and allow their dogs to defecate on the sidewalk in front of my house where my Vibram-soled shoes or vehicle's tires will encounter feces only to spread them further, seem to be a bit surprised when their canine pest friends want to hurriedly leave the area. Hee hee.I have noticed a definite reduction in pest visits since I have been using this product as I have described. And I don't mind using it in unprotected areas on a limited basis, such as at the entrance to my driveway where critters trigger my security light and even walk on my vehicle. I never never leave a garbage can to be an attractive nuisance. Anything smelly is stored in the fridge until right before my disposal trip. Yes, this is sometimes not easy to manage but does work and is my solution to raccoons and dogs.So I recommend this product for uses as I have described but you might want to think twice about use where constant reapplication is required, unless your pockets are deep and your time is plentiful.
B000F0BVYE Cats are the only animal on the list that I have a problem with and they are what I used the product for.  Neighborhood cats keep getting in my raised flower beds, digging and using it as an outhouse.  What I did was put it all around the perimeter and then watered the beds with a watering can to avoid getting the applied area wet (and washing away the product).  I haven't seen any droppings in there since I did that.
B000F0BVYE I've tried using assorted repellents like this for a while, always with mixed success. It's mixed enough for me to somewhat suspect more of a placebo effect--I want it to work so I think I notice more effect than it has.However, that being the case, there is enough of a indicator it has an influence in keeping away pests. But, I've found that if I try to use this as a complete solution, I'm both disappointed and quickly run out.  For me it works best with more of a targeted approach, using it where I particularly don't want pests to be or to go through--gaps in fences, openings between brush.  I have to be careful because I likewise don't want to use this where I or my family want to be.Mostly, I find it's helpful to keep our yard a relatively unfriendly place--so that we don't get overrun.  I've noticed a decrease in critter activity, so for that I keep using it.
B000F0BVYE I applied this liberally around our back entrance which is frequented by squirrels, raccoons, possums all who know what else at night. While most of these critters are not problematic, the raccoons are a nuisance and empty our birdfeeders and even our hummingbird feeders. After sprinkling this product around the entire area, the racoons (and squirrels) pretty much ignored it. I have found success with Deer Away spray which works much more effectively.
B000F0BVYE I managed to trap 8 squirrels in 2011 with havahart animal cage (Havahart 0745 Live Animal Professional Style One-Door Chimpunk, Squirrel, Rat, and Weasel Trap). See my previous review of havahart animal cage. They were attracted to the bird feeder on my neighbor's backyard. It was a way to catch humanely. They have been \"relocated\" to a much bigger park where they can search more food and harass small birds. This year I have a difficulty catching the newcomer squirrels. They do not respond to the tasty peanuts that I put in the trap. I am not happy to find some spots here and there that have been dug by squirrels. So I pour this critter ridder around the garden and in the container. It works. The squirrels hate the powder so much that they do not touch my garden anymore.
B000F0BVYE I obtained this product because we have cats and chipmunks that invade an area between our house and our shrubbery.The product is nicely packaged and easy to use.  I was concerned a bit about the warning label that suggested you contact a poison control center in case of contact with skin.  It was hard to believe it was that dangerous.  The coverage was also less than I would have thought for five pounds, but adequate for the job at hand.The material is granular with a not-unpleasant smell.  The smell was completely gone within a few hours of application.As a test, I set up a motion activated wildlife camera and recorded the area in question for about a week.  I saw cats every night (two different ones), chipmunks during the day and a few birds.  I then applied the product.Unfortunately, I have photos of the same cats and chipmunks in the same area after the product was applied.  There did seem to be fewer chipmunk visits- but the cats continued apparently unaffected.  The birds were gone, but I wasn't worried about them.Could be I did something wrong (or that we have strange neighborhood cats) but the product did not work for me.
B000F0BVYE This stuff chases away pests from the house area, back to the woods where they belong.  It does not repel bears, salesmen, or coyotes, but it isn't supposed to do that.The beauty of it it that it is not a poison.  I enjoy sharing the land with critters, but don't want them right up to the house.  If it will work on the colony of flying squirrels in my attic, I will update it's rating to 5 stars.
B000F0BVYE I spread this around my lettuce boxes, which have been exhibiting little nibbles despite us living in an urban area (I see the bunny hopping around from time to time).  I made sure to apply on a dry night, when I knew there wouldn't be any rain for a day or two.  There were no new nibbles, but the smell was significantly diminished after a night or two.  It's worth noting that most of what I'd want to protect (herbs, veggies) needs a lot of water, making this \"lasts 30 days\" claim a bit dubious.  That being said, I think a mouthful must have deterred Peter Cottontail, who hasn't been back for seconds.  So, maybe even if I can't smell it, it's working (or maybe he has a memory of these things).  I'd purchase again if I saw more rabbits.
B000F0BVYE I'm in the Suburbs of Chicago, and our area has a lot of Possums and Raccoons - some of those Raccoons look like giant mutant Ferrets. I'm remodeling the house, and am away a week at a time. I've occasionally found animal droppings around the foundation and under the deck. In the past I've tried the commercial bottles of animal urine (really stinks, easy to spill, requires a lot!) So I liked the idea of 1) pellets, 2) ease of application, 3) Does not stink.After spreading these around the perimeter with the handy-dandy container design, and adding some to the fence where I thought the critters were entering (climbing over and digging under) I left for a week. No new signs of these foul critters. In other words, the little used side of my house (you know, where the A/C sits along with little used hoses and the like) was poop free.The stuff looks slightly oily (I assume from the black pepper oil) and smells like a day-old Cajun dinner. Lots of spice, a little stale. The active ingredients are Capsaicin (as in pepper spray and really hot spices), black pepper oil and piperine (piperine is responsible for pungency of black pepper.)So when animals, with their super-sensitive noses, smell this stuff, it chases them away. Like pepper-spray does, only this is passive.There's also a decent amount, so I can apply several times (after heavy rain, a few weeks, etc.)
B000F0BVYE Earlier this summer, we updated our front yard.  We put in new flowering plants and covered the dirt with special paper to help deter the weeds from growing.  On top of the paper, we laid down black mulch.  It looks so nice!  The beautiful effect to the whole front of the house is huge.  We're so happy.But, then we started getting cats pooping in our mulch!  GROSS!!  Yuck...  They would come and mess up the mulch and do their thing.  Then we'd have to clean it up.  Not nice.We used the Critter Ridder on half the area.  On the other half we sprayed vinegar.  Both areas have not had any 'kitty gifts' since we applied both products.  The one big difference between the areas: the cats still come and move the mulch around in the vinegar area.  No poop, but they still make a mess for us to clean up.  Drives me batty.This product works great for what we need it for.  It's a 5 star product for us, but I took away a star because it's so darn expensive!  But, it works.
B000F0BVYE I'm always cynical about these sort of products... especially the more natural varieties, but this one does work. I don't know how long it will work, it's worked now for about 5 days. I used the whole container so I would have to buy another to refresh it, 5lbs seems like a lot, but I have a lot of area to cover.It smells good, almost good enough to eat! :) It helped cover the cat spray smell that we have in the front yard from strays. I was very happy about that part.  I used it in a circle around a favorite pooping spot and so far, 3 days later and a light rain, it's still effective.The only thing wrong is that I'll probably need a 25lb container of it to cover all the areas that have been used by the neighborhood cats. Other that, since it works, I like it!
B000F0BVYE We applied this yesterday around the perimeter of our house. Today I watched a squirrel come right up to the window next to where I was sitting and dig in the dirt where this product was applied. He stayed quite a while, dug up a nut and ate it while staring at me. I'm not at all impressed with this product and don't recommend it.
B000F0BVYE I was interested in this product to help deal with an abundance of chipmunks on my property  as well as stopping raccoons and squirrels from getting into my garbage cans. It has worked in both cases.Chipmunks: For some reason chipmunks have been in great abundance in my neighborhood. I live in New Jersey so my guess is the mild winter had something to do about it.  A few chipmunks are nice, more than a few eat flowers and vegetables and make a mess.I saw two holes in the ground that the chipmunks  were using as burrows.  I poured the Critter Ridder in and around the burrow holes and it seemed like activity around the burrow holes stopped. I still see some chipmunks but not as many as before.Raccoons and Squirrels:  I have half-a-dozen plastic garbage cans whose covers have holes in them due to hungry squirrels wanting to get at the food in them.  I also have awakened on many days to find my garbage cans knocked over but what I am pretty certain were raccoons foraging for food.Certain foods tend to be more appetizing than others. For some reason chicken and fish and certain fruits like apples and pears tend to attract the squirrels and raccoons more than others but any food is a target to them.I have been pouring Critter Ridder around my garbage cans and it seems to be keeping all animals away.  I threw chicken bones out one night and was expecting some animal to try to knock over my garbage can or get into it and nothing happened. I have been using this for three weeks and it has worked.I like the idea that this product is natural and will not poison or kill anything.  The smell alone is enough to make me take notice and I got some on my hand  which burned a little but I felt fine after washing my hands. The bottle has a handle and an easy pour cover which works great and except for the one occasion I have not gotten any more on me.Every week or so I pour out some more Critter Ridder around the burrows and garbage cans. So far this is keeping the critters away.
B000F0BVYE This has worked very well in saving fruit trees and other plants from wildlife and the family pets.
B000F0BVYE Either I got a bad batch or this doesn't work. I have some young seedlings I've been trying to protect from being dug up by armadillos and dogs. The dogs just keep marking the spot and the armadillos dig right through it. Totally ineffective for me.
B000F0BVYE I broadcast this around an area of yard that a neighbor's cat perches on. The darn thing sits there and taunts my dog, yawning as my pup goes bananas. We had a good rain 2 days after I put it out, but it still seems to keep kitty away. Very happy, but will try to catch it on sale.
B000F0BVYE To test this product, i sprinkled a layer onto an area of my yard that one of my cats has taken to using as his private litter box. It's bare dirt, dry, sheltered from the wind.I used about half of the package, which claims to cover 300 square feet, on this area that's approximately 75 square feet. I didn't intend to overdose it so badly, but it's very hard to estimate how much you're shaking out over what square footage. (In case you don't feel like doing the math, that means i used about twice as much per square foot as the packaging says is necessary.)Day 1: The cat went to his new favorite toilet, sniffed around, and meandered off. I didn't see him set foot in that space all day.Day 2: The cat went to his new favorite toilet, dug a hole, and did his business.So even at double strength, this product deterred a housecat for all of approximately one day. One windless, rainless day. That hardly seems like something worth spending money on.And speaking of money, you're paying for something that is, by weight, less than 1% active ingredients. That means about 0.8 ounces of this product is important, and the rest is filler. And those active ingredients are basically black pepper and a little bit of something like cayenne pepper. You can buy a 2-3 ounce container of black pepper at any grocery store for a few dollars, so why pay more than $20 for this? Even if it worked, it would be a waste of money.
B000F0BVYE The particular critters we want to get rid of are chipmunks - they're destroying our garden, tunneling into the lawn and even invading the house. The Havahart Critter Ridder is easy to use - just pop the cap and shake onto the ground.  I tried it around a peach tree the chipmunks had been fond of, and it did seem to reduce the number of attacks. I didn't expect miracles, given the number of chipmunks we have around, but it did seem to help for a while. As with all products of this nature, it needs to be periodically reapplied.
B000F0BVYE As the container says, Critter Ridder works best in conjunction with a fence or some other barrier. With that in mind, I applied it around the perimeter of my fenced garden. Several rabbits had managed to beat the fence. With the critter ridder, only 1 rabbit was able to make it in. So, it was not as effective as I have hoped but I was pleased to reduce the rabbit pillaging.
B000F0BVYE The product label says to apply at the rate of 1 lb. per 40 square feet. Impossible to measure the rate of application and when using the narrowest opening on the spout the 5 lbs. were gone in about 50 square feet (???). If it had some color to it you could a least see where you've been with it but as it is it blends in with the grass so well you can't tell. I used it to circle my peach trees to keep the varmints away and so far it appears to be helping but it will be very expensive to have to reapply every rain. I think I will look for a cheaper alternative or I will have the most expensive peaches in the country.This is a follow up to my review. It has been about 4 days since I sprinkled the product around the base of the peach trees. It has not rained but today I was watching the squirrels running through the \"protected\" area without even noticing it as they continued stealing my peaches. So much for that idea!
B000F0BVYE This was easy to apply. I just shook it out around the perimeter of my garden.It kept the rabbits out of my garden.  It does not seem to keep the deer away from my trees but it doesn't claim to.It does nothing for the birds eating my blueberries but again, doesn't claim to.So.. for foxes, rabbits, and other small creatures, this seems to be very good.
B000F0BVYE We have two types of nuisance pests - bunnies and voles. The bunnies eat up our garden and the voles eat up our lawn. I've tried all kinds of repellent, from commercial granules such as this to home-made recipes containing urine & castor oil. Although they may repeal for a time, our pests always return.This critter ridder was easy to apply, although I wish the shake canister top had a more finely calibrated way to shake out the ingredients. The ingredients appear to be relatively natural, and the dominant smell is of pepper - which didn't bother us while we applied or spent time in the yard application.It's been 2 weeks, and so far, so good. There has been no sign of bunnies, and there are no new vole trails. The product is expected to last 30 days, so that gives us just over 2 more weeks of protection and cover. Time will tell, but I would use this product again.
B000F0BVYE I have a lot of critters to deal with for living in town.  I have used this stuff a lot.  Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't.Worked-SkunkCatsDidn't work-RabbitsGround hogSquirrelsRaccoonI was however victorious over all these critters.  When this stuff didn't work, my box traps did.  They are all now residents of the forest 10 miles to the east!!!
B000F0BVYE When it comes to nuisance animals, pepper always helps, and this Havahart Critter Ridder's main ingredient is pepper. We have problems with chipmunks and rabbits digging holes in our yard and of course there are the dogs and cats that keep using that same area of our yard to do their business. I always just use regular pepper on the spots of our tree lawn that are dead from the local dogs and cats leaving their business there. Does pepper work? Yes, but you have to re-apply it every single day. The animals must do their daily business, so in a week, they will find a new place, as they hate the smell of pepper- which is great for our lawn.Now, when it comes to hole digging animals, that's another story. You can put a whole can of pepper in a rabbit or chipmunk hole and you will simply see a new hole dug a few inches away. We have found that moth balls, peppermint oil, and pepper placed in a hole will make the animal move, but you have to keep putting these not so great smelling items in each new hole, until that animal will get the hint that moving may be a better option. We finally figured out, that adding tiny stones or gravel in the holes with a little cement to make it hard to keep the animal from digging around helps even more.This Havahart Critter Ridder does work, but not for over a day. You have to reapply it daily, just like any pepper to bother the animal. You literally have to keep at it, so the animal will find it easier to move to another place than to be bothered by you every day. And don't forget for those hole digging animals, that you have to add stones or gravel with a dab of cement in the hole- when you make their bed not so cushy and comfortable, they will eventually find a more comfortable place to live where it isn't so smelly either. By the time you buy all the different moth balls, peppers and expensive peppermint oil, the price comes out to be the same as this Critter Ridder, so it doesn't matter which one you buy- as one is not cheaper than the other.This Havahart Critter Ridder works daily, but your persistence in working daily to get rid of the animals is just as important. Making their existence on your property less comfortable will eventually drive them away to a more comfy home.
B000F0BVYE The North East has had a very warm winter and thus all sorts of stuff is living around my yard this year.  We particularly have a lot of rabbits, and moles/voles...  I know..rabbits are cute...but sometimes they are cumbersome because of the gardens they destroy.  Moles/Voles just jump in to our pool and die there...thus increasing my chemical costs.  The solution: Critter Ridder:  I sprinkled this in front of our flower beds and around this shaded area of our lawn where we have woods... So far the population of rabbits has gone down from 1 dozen to about 3...which is great.  The mole/vole/mice issue from our pool also improved, we are only finding 1-2 a week where as we were finding 6-8 a week.I dont have many issues with the other animals listed on this item..but it does seem to work.  We sprinkled a little less then half of it - which lasted about 3 weeks or so...once I saw more rabbits I went and sprinkled another 1/4 of the bottle - as a touch up.  Voila...rabbits gone.  This is going to become somewhat permanent in my garage...There is a odor that this stuff lets off, so be ready...but that will eventually dissipate and you will be happy with the results.Great item.ps. I have also noticed that snakes dont like it (we have milk snakes and corn snakes around one area)...they have all but disappeared.
B000F0BVYE I have possums and raccoons getting in my trash all the time.  Raccoons make a big mess, possums make a littler mess.  Anyway, I put this stuff in an area around the trash cans and since then no critters have been in the trash.  That could be a fluke--I don't know.  But since critters are always in my trash and now they are not, I figure this stuff just might be working.  I'll know more as I use it more.
B000F0BVYE When you get a product to drive critters away from your property (or garden, in our case), the stuff needs to do two things well:1) Repel critters2) LastHavahart Critter Ridder Animal Repellent does both very well, and while it does cost a bit, it's worth it if you're concerned about the havoc wild animals can do to your yard and garden.Highly recommended!
B000F0BVYE I have been dealing with pests in my summer garden.  Mostly squirrels but also rabbits and possums.  I am usingHavahart's Motion Detector Sprinklerto help keep them out and it really seems to work.  However, I believe in a multi-prong defense strategy.  Havaharts Critter Ridder adds an additional layer of protection for my precious veggies.  When a wild creature gets used to the spray this repellent seems to keep them from hanging out in my little garden.However, not every plant-raider is a wild foe.  My 5 month old Miniature Blue Heeler likes to dig up some of the bushes that I planted this season.  She saw me plant them and I think that she believes that she is helping me (a Heeler trait.)  I used this product to keep her away from the bushes that she loves to excavate.At first the odor kept her away but the urge to dig won out.  However, when she starting claw at the ground the hot pepper irritated her just enough to make her stop and she hasn't gone back since.  I like this stuff and it seems to work for several weeks for the squirrels and longer for my puppy.  I also like that it does not contain some of the nasty stuff that other products have.
B000F0BVYE After trying this product, I agree with other reviews that it doesn't last 30 days.  The price point is high for what you get.  I prefer going to BJ's or Sam's Club and picking up a vat of black pepper and/or Cayenne powder and sprinkling it around any perimeter where you don't want critters and it is cheaper to use & I feel safer.  I've used the black pepper before around the perimeter of our home to deter black ants and it works.  We also use the black pepper & cayenne powder around our veggie garden to deter animals away.  We reapply as needed, but it seems once they know it's there, they find somewhere else to dine.  I've also used moth balls around my flower gardens to deter cats from eliminating in them.
B000F0BVYE Maybe my New Mexico critters are used to spicy food (this is the home of green chile after all) and the capsaicin and black pepper in this product just made them want to grab some chips and dig in.  I put this around 2 rose bushes that the rabbits and ground squirrels have been chewing on.The squirrels and rabbits happily snacked on my roses with this product applied liberally to the area around the rose bushes.  I watched them sitting on the product, eating my rose bushes.Perhaps they tested this on squirrels and rabbits who have no taste for chile.  Mine were yelling for me to throw out some tortilla chips.
B000F0BVYE Package says the active ingredients irritate animals when they touch or taste the product. Also lists that the poison control center should be contacted if the products gets on your clothing and contanimation of food and water should be avoided. Because we have young children and pets, I don't think we will actually chose to use this product due to saftey and ground water concerns. I would rather have pests dig up my lawn than end up taking our pets to the vet or the kids to the doctors for medical treatment.
B000F0BVYE This is a tough product to review.  I put it around the flowers in the pots at my pool.  I was having squirrels literally toss the flowers out, I assume looking for nuts from last year. Not being terribly squirrly myself I can't claim to know why the squirrels were yanking my flowers out but that is my guess.  I put this stuff around the flowers and have not had any issues since.  I am making a leap of faith that the granules are the reason why the squirrels have not returned.  They are still in the yard but have not bothered the plants. Since I am not sure that the product drove the squirrels away I can't give it 5 stars but since I am pretty sure, I will give it four stars.  BTW it does not have the strong odor I have found on similar types of products I have used in the past.
B000F0BVYE This is a great product for the short term. It will repel most mammals that are likely to take up residence under a structure or deck. I had a skunk under my backyard shed, and I spread this around the openings that it used, and the animal left. However, it's not practical to keep spreading this product indefinitely (though I do like its black-pepper odor). I ended up purchasing theSunforce Solar Pest Repeller two-pack(it is best to have at least two of these), which is now my long-term deterrent of choice. However, for a quick solution, Havahart Critter Ridder is hard to beat.
B000F0BVYE This Critter Ridder says it is rain resistant and then at one point in their description says heavy rain resistant. When I received it, the weather forecast had a low probability of rain for the next 10 days; so trusting? that, since it was the best I could do, I spread this along my problem area for dogs. We have a sidewalk with a grassy median between it and the street and several trees surrounded by hosta gardens that it's been very irritating, in more ways than one, to find dog waste left in.The directions say to use gloves to spread it, but since the can is a shaker, it seemed much more handy to just give a shaking application that way. I spread it along the edges of the sidewalk and in a ring around the hosta gardens. As luck would have it that evening was one of those 10% scattered showers, not that heavy of a rain. The next morning there was no trace of the granules or the smell, which had a slight ammonia odor and there in the corner which had probably gotten a heavier dose because that is also where an area the hosta are was a huge pile of dog poop.That sort of destroys my opinion of this product's effectiveness.
B000F0BVYE This stuff sure smells spicy - black and hot pepper spicy.  It comes in a nice shaker and is considered organic.The issue seems to be that it has a limited effectiveness.  I shook it around our garden and under the birdfeeder where the squirrels and chipmunks congregate, but they either got used to it right away or I didn't use enough.  That's the other thing - for the price this seems to be a small amount and did not go very far.  The container is quite a bit less than I was expecting - 5 lbs is not much at all.  They indicate this is enough to cover 300 square feet but it's pretty hard to shake it out that finely or evenly so your'e really only covering perhaps 100 square feet.
B000F0BVYE This product was ordered to help save my peach and pear trees from squirrels. I wasn't thinking and did not realize that it cannot be used on food plants, or sprayed on the foliage. That being said, I spread it liberally on the ground around the base of the fruit trees. The little creeps took a flying leap from my arbor and stole the peaches from the tree tops before I finished applying the product. I will use it in the flower bed to try and deter the feral cat from digging up the ground. It has also been used in the large planter pot that holds my almost ripe figs. I now have to move the pot to an open area so the squirrels can't make the jump.The product has a heavy black pepper smell with is not offensive when sitting on the deck. It says that it can be used in none living areas of the home, such as basement and attic.One note about the cap: the sprinkling lid can be adjusted to open at various widths. This is something I realized later after the product poured out too quickly. Price is steep for pepper oil, if it saved my peaches it would have been worth it. If it saves the figs, I'll up it one star.
B000F3DUW2 I am someone who has never really had a garden. The best I've done is plant some tomatoes around the edge of my yard. When I worked with a group to do a bigger garden, we had someone come in and rototill. So, it sounds strange, but I have never owned a serious shovel.Now we have a huge yard, and I am putting in a small raised garden for three 4x4 plots. If I succeed this year, I will expand next year. I had already placed the wood, but the next step involves removing the sod. For that I needed a shovel.I considered buying one locally, but after reading the reviews here, I grabbed this one and had it shipped. Even if I haven't owned a shovel, I have owned many sets of scissors, and I know I can trust the brand name.Unfortunately, my shovel arrived just ahead of a snowstorm, so I had to wait to use it! Nothing worse than having a cool new tool and not being able to use it. The snow finally melted in my garden area, so I snuck out today to try things out, even if the soil is really still too wet to do the full job. I am short and not muscle bound, but when I placed my foot on the huge footrest and pushed, I was amazed at how easily it penetrated the roots of the grass. It sliced right through.The heighth and weight worked well for my inexperienced 5ft 4in frame. Not only did it cut easily through the roots, it was easy to lift and transport the sod to a new location. The well finished metal handle was easy on my hands, and the D handle made the task easier.You can buy a lot of shovels for a lot less, but this is one classy and nice shovel. Unlike wood, this one is built to last. Besides the three gardens, I hope to plant some fruit trees this spring, and I was afraid of digging the holes. But now that I have checked this out, I am actually looking forward to it.I am very glad I decided on this particular shovel. It is the right one for me.Edited - I have been using this shovel to remove the sod and it has been just perfect. I'm doing a little bit every day. What I didn't realize till I was regularly using it was how much help the D handle would be as I pry up the grass. I have also planted a five ft tree, and had no trouble at all with digging the hole. I know different kinds of soil will have different results, but the fact that I can use it to cut through and dig out Bermuda sod is pretty impressive.Edited again ... Not only have I dug out two horseshoe pits and the 3 ft posts, plus a tie-out for a dog, another tie-out was buried in roots. It was beyond my capability even with the shovel. A friend assisted with the heavy work, and was able to cut through the roots and dig out the metal tie-out out of the roots. At one point, his wife was worried he would bend my shovel, and I pointed to the clearly marked lifetime warranty. Yep, another successful dig.
B000F3DUW2 This digging shovel has a sharp spade that slices the dirt.  The wide handle allows you to use both hands easily to push the shovel in the ground.  Works well especially when transplanting small flowers or bushes.  The orange handle is easy to spot when you have many tools on the ground or propped up.  Very happy with this product.
B000F3DUW2 Two of the features that are the most noteworthy are the handle and  the foot space on the top of the blade. The handle makes it much easier to use than a straight handle. The extra width for the foot is a real benefit for comfort and for being able to exert more digging force. This is a very fine shovel.I removed one star because of a flaw in the finish on the pole portion. It does not affect the usage of the shovel but it certainly affects the appearance. But, more importantly, by having a bare spot on the steel it is more subject to rust than the other portions that have a finish on them. I guess the days of quality control are long gone.
B000F3DUW2 This is a wonderful shovel.  What I liked best about it is it has a step built on it so you can step down and dig into the dirt easily.  Worked great for pulling up big potted plants in my backyard.  Built very heavy duty
B000F3DUW2 This is by far the finest made and most useful shovel I have ever used. I have been gardening for over 60 years and have never been more pleased. The extra width for placing your foot is especially helpful. It truly is The Greatest Shovel ever made.
B000F3DUW2 This is the best made shovel, and should last a lifetime. Stop looking at other shovels. Get the Fiskars Digging Shovel, Spade, or Transplanting Shovel (or all three).
B000F3DUW2 I have another shovel purchased at our local big box store but this has become to the go-to shovel for both myself 5'3\" and my husband 6'2\".  It has a great pointed end that digs well into grass and dirt (I am in the process of getting rid of a lot of sod and turning it into flower beds).  We have also used this to dig out old tree roots from trees that were removed last year.  The oversize-step works well for people of different heights.
B000F95CZY I ordered this Fiskars Big Grip Garden Knife to add to the bucket of go to garden tools.  It is a strong tool which combines knife, saw, weeder and spade into one tool.  The heavy galvanized coating and heavy rubber tool handle with a cord strap to hang, is as good as I have.  I refuse to buy expensive garden tools, as almost any tool can be used to do most work.  Even a claw hammer as needed to dig out a hole.  This tool is probably the best of all worlds.  It should last the life of your desire to do gardening.  I love it.
B000F95CZY This is a fine tool for very light use. Unfortunately, most of the tasks you use a garden knife for are anything but light duty. After losing my many-years old hori hori knife, I thought I'd try this, mainly due to the price. On the plus side, the grip is comfortable, and the notched point is a nice feature. However, the build quality is not at all suitable to the things I want to use a garden knife for, such as prying out major weeds, dislodging rocks, sawing small roots, and dividing dense perennial clumps, etc. The blade is very thin and it is not securely attached to the handle. Returned it and went for a more sturdy knife (AM Leonard brand) that works much better (albeit at a higher cost). This knife would be fine for very light use in light soil. It won't survive anything else.
B000F95CZY This is the best all around gardening tool ever. Very heavy duty with the concave section in the blade making it very robust. Serrated section for cutting. Must have tool for weeding and transplanting/digging!  Perfect companion.
B000F95CZY All the grandkids wanted this.  They think it's some sort of cool weapon.  It does what it should do...gardening!
B000F95CZY This is a very handy tool for use in my small garden. The grip is large and  comfortable which makes for digging and transplanting an easy chore. The serrated edge is a handy convenience when cutting is required. There is a hole in the handle which I use to hang it on a pegboard along with my other Fiskars garden tools. This has a lifetime warranty so all bases are covered.
B000F95CZY The Fiskars knife has actually lasted for 2 years of use with my professional gardening company, and due to the big black handle and orange detailing, has never gotten lost in the weeds like the wood-grain hori-hori, a similar tool, has. It doesn't appear to be made of long-lasting materials at first glance, but we've put it through the paces with 20 hours a week of weeding and it has stood the test of time.I would prefer an option without the dandelion fork attached since the forked tip can make it harder to plant and dig other things with it. Otherwise, I find the serration and sharp blade handy in the garden and appreciate the ergonomic handle that is easy to grip.If you're used to using a trowel you'll find this soil knife a huge upgrade. The straight blade make it easy to plunge into the soil for fast bulb planting, annual planting, and weed removal.
B000F95CZY Fiskars Big Grip Garden Knife #7079My wife & I have used this knife (digger) many times to remove weeds from the lawn and garden. It has worked flawlessly, yet easily and I can't wait to try it out when metal detecting since we have some heavy, clay-like ground.One caveat: they should include a scabbard which would make it easier to carry around.
B000F95CZY I've had this knife for about 2 years and I used it moderately to divide perennials.  It has worked fine for that purpose until I used it for the first time this spring and the handle slipped off.  The big-grip handle is glued to the metal shaft and the glue seems to have deteriorated with age.  If you are interested in a garden knife, I would recommend something with a forged handle since these tools see some tough duty, glues and plastic aren't going to last.
B000F95CZY I bought 3 of these after seeing a hori hori knife belonging to a friend of mine. The design is exactly the same, and 2 of the knives have survived for 2 years. The first knife snapped after only a few weeks of use (but an employee was using it, so you never know exactly what was going on....).The knife seems to work great and at a fraction of the price of a genuine hori hori knife. After 2 years of using it myself I'm pretty sure that it won't snap off if you don't treat it like a shovel when you are using it. I give it 4 out of 5 stars for the one knife which broke a few weeks after purchase.
B000F95D0I The entire shovel except for the handle is steel so it has great integrity with no flex. It has a nice heft which helps cut into hard or clay soil. I used it to dig a shallow, narrow trench to place edging stones and it worked great.
B000F95D0I This is an excellent narrow shovel. I had never seen a spade of this shape until I had a professional landscaper working on my yard. He had two of these. It makes so much sense to add this spade to my gardening tools.
B000F95D0I I like these Fiskar shovels.  This one is really handy for transplanting as you would imagine.  Good for digging any type of deep narrow holes or edging a lawn.  Seems sturdy and good steel.  The handle is a bit plasticky and I hope that it holds up.  I also have the Fiskars 9668 shovel which has all steel handle to the end - no plastic.  That shovel seems a little stouter than this one but is also heavier and for different uses.  This is a winner.  I want more Fiskar shovels.
B000F95D0I This is the Chinese Fiskars product line. All their shovels are made there, and I have repeated problems with their D Handle shovels. The blade is not aligned properly with the handle. The handle is cocked at an angle so that it twists the wrist when using it. I have returned several shovels to Amazon, and now I give up. And, yes, it is not pre-sharpened. And, no, it came with no PVC sleeve. If Fiskars wants to cheapen their image with this poor quality, I will be thinking three times before I buy Fiskars in the future.
B000F95D0I Bad news, made in China. Good news, well-made. Nice wide tread (width tapered 1\" to 1 5/8\") and textured to prevent your foot from slipping off. Blade (6\" x 4.5\" x 15\" long) welded to the oval steel shaft. Great \"D\" shaped handle (4 1/4\" x 8 1/4\" and screwed to steel shaft) at just the right angle for tough jobs. It is 47\" long and weighs 4 pounds. Nicely balanced. UPDATE/CAUTION: This spade has a problem with the way the handle is attached to the blade. It is not welded all of the way around allowing water to get inside if you wash off the blade. I did this and the next time I went to use the spade it was rusty in this area. I have found Fiskars to be a good company that stands behind its products, so I contacted them. I explained the problem and they immediately sent me another spade. I thought the defect might have been an isolated problem but the replacement has the same issue. I like to take care of my tools and this rusty defect is enough for me to downgrade my rating from 5 to 2 stars. Not recommended.
B000F95D0I Another wonderful Fiskars product I have added to my gardening too collections.  I have used it to move some plants when we needed to have a tunnel dug through the middle of my flower beds to repair broken pipes and I had no problems using this spade.  I definitely would recommend this product.
B000F95D0I This shovel upholds the great experiences I have had with other Fiskars hand tools. Its metal construction gives me the confidence to lean on it when trying to get a bush out of the ground, and pushing it through clay soil is no problem. I've never had a transplanting shovel before, and now I wouldn't do without one!There are cheaper tools on store shelves, but after using this several times, I would not hesitate to replace it with another one. I don't think I ever will need to, however, as this shovel is so well-made that I can't imagine wearing it out or damaging it.I liked this shovel (and another Fiskars shovel that I bought) that I gave this one to my brother as a gift. This gets a rare 5-star review from me!
B000F95D0I totally loving this thing, it shaped like a trench shovel, only hollower, steel shaft make this a well balanced package, d-handle also helps on yanking soil loose, if you need one heavier shovel for landscapping use, get this one. It can serve many purposes.
B000F97DWO After a few uses the blades no longer slide tightly against one another - so partly-cut branches slip between blades. You get what you pay for - should have bitten the bullet and purchased a Felco.
B000F97DWO I have a number of pruners including a Felco and a Fisker power gear pruner. Both are fine pruners, but the powergear really is intended to be used by a righty. Which my wife is.I am a lefty and short of buying the Felco lefty pruner I thought I would give this a shot. I am glad I did. First the handles are very comfortable. Excellent shape to them. The most comfortable handles I have ever used on a pruner. Second it is very maunervable. You can get to branches from any angle and direction. And I do want to point out that is really hand-neutral. My wife likes it just as much as I do. Of much less importance it looks cool. All black.But bottom-line is you get an excellent performing pruner with extremely comfortable handles at a very good price. Great choic for a lefty or righty.
B000F97DWO One tool that I use on a daily basis is a hand pruner. Plants constantly need to be pruned and dead-headed.For the last year I have used Fiskars 9124 Professional Bypass Pruning Shears - $15.22 on Amazon.com. I have made thousands of cuts and they have done a great job. I recently took them apart, sharpened and oiled them and they seem to still be doing a good job.I thought I would try some other more expensive pruners - Bahco Ergo Bypass Pruner PX-M2 - $45 is what I paid on Amazon. (Note - they are now $53.) These pruners are three times more expensive so I was expecting a lot.Bahco - Medium Size - are significantly smaller than the Fiskars. To me the Fiskars were more comfortable in my hand. I'd probably choose the \"Large\" size Bahco in the future.When it come to cutting small branches - there is no difference. They both cut well. When I was cutting larger branches - say 1/4 inch or more the Bahco slid through the branch easier than the Fiskars. This could be to the fact that they are brand new and still have that factory edge.In summation, for the money Fiskars makes a great product and I would have no hesitation recommending these pruners and use the extra $30 for other tools.
B000F97DWO When I first used it the lock for keeping closed was VERY hard to work. It took a lot of strength to move latch to open and close. My thoughts were how difficult it would be for the elderly but it has gotten easier  to do as I have used it over time.
B000F97DWO I've used this to trim some vines and many branches off of trees, and it cuts through everything very smoothly.
B000F97DWO These clippers use leverage to make the cut a matter not of strength.  It works for even clipping right against the trunk.I used these clippers, which I purchased, to trim small branches off a variety of trees and shrubs. Some of these were dead and others were turned inward against the tree.  My work was done quickly.  Worth the price.
B000F97DWO Wow, Wow, Wow.  I used this to prune our rose bushes, mums and various other bushes around the house to get ready for Christmas decorating outside.  It didn't take me long as the blades are so sharp and one snap of the handles took care of the job.  Always impressed, always reliable Fiskars.
B000F97DWO I have a large number of pruning shears of my own that I have collected throughout the years and am fortunate to have access to many more - different brands and different models.  I get to \"test\" a lot of these things.  I also do a lot of pruning as we have an orchard, heavily planted and landscaped yard which includes thick woodland.  I don't particularly like doing all this cutting, sawing and chopping but hey, it has to be done...or so my wife feels.Anyway...For the money these Fiskars 9124 Professional Bypass Pruning Shears are some of the best I own and in my case are quite handy.  First is the fact that they are built so that they can be used by both the left and the right hand.  Unfortunately I am old.  Unfortunately there are some drawbacks to becoming ancient.  One of those is that many people develop arthritis of the hands.  I am one of those people.  This is a real bummer to be quite frank.  It is not a major problem yet, but it can be quite painful and most certainly has an impact on the strength of the hands.  Repetitive motion is of course good for this condition but it should be done in moderation.  I am not one of those individuals who enjoy pain...any pain.  Now back to fortunately...I happen to be somewhat ambidextrous so it is really nothing for me to switch from one hand to the other.  This design is ideal for someone like me.  When one hand gets tired, weak and painful, I simply switch hands and keep going; giving the other hand a rest.I like the fact that this particular tool has replacement blades available.  I also like the fact that these items, like all to most Fiskar products have a lifetime warranty...one that from past experience with other products I know they honor...no questions asked.This is a smooth operating pruner.  There are a couple of things to note though.  It does indeed work well on green limbs up to 1 inch in diameter.  Dead and hard word is a different matter when you get into the one inch area. This tool is made to cut relatively small limbs.  Do not buy it and expect to go out and start your own logging operation.  I note that some forks have problems after they have used their pruner for a bit with the blade not making contact correctly...it being out of line.  This is almost always caused by cutting and twisting at the same time.  This sort of thing will break ANY pruner! It this problem happens, even with the previous abuse mentioned, I have found that simply tightening the bolt will usually fix the problem.I not that several folks have had problems with the locking mechanism i.e. the pruner stays open.  I happen to own two of these things and each had the same problem.  I have found that if you just work the mechanism back and forth about ten or twenty times that the problem will simply go away.The sap grove on this tool makes sticking unlikely and this tool gives a very nice clean and precise cut.Note that this tool, like all tools, needs to be dried and cleaned after every use and a drop of oil now and then is highly recommended.The handles are extremely comfortable but since they are made of a plastic material they do not do well if you leave them out in the sun and elements for extended periods of time. (We are talking weeks and months here).  Plastic, my nature, will deteriorate over time.  It is also noted that if you drop these thing in a brush pile and then burn the brush pile, it will ruin the pruner.  Trust me...I know this to be a fact.Are there better pruners out there?  You bet there are, but you will pay far, far more money for them that the cost quoted here.  For the money and for what you get for your money, it is difficult to beat these things.Don BlankenshipThe Ozarks
B000F97DWO I did a bunch of pruning with ease using these fine shears. However, when I tried to lock them shut I could not get the lock arm to return to its initial position to lock the shears closed. I decided to check the reviews again more thoroughly to see if others had the same problem. A reviewer suggested loosening the Phillips screw holding the lock arm. I followed that advice and the result removed the slight negative feeling I had toward these shears and now all is well. These may well be the best shears I have ever owned.
B000F97DWO I found these shears to be very comfortable to use and they easily cut through some branches I needed to trim (1/2-3/4 inch diameter branches).  I am very satisfied with my new shears!
B000F97DWO So far so good. I have used it to trim bushes and other plants around my yard and have not had any issues with it.
B000F97DWO It's sturdy, well made and it really takes care of branches up to 1 inch. The handles are very comfortable and this shear makes extremely easy to reach all branches at all angles. I agree with the reviewer that mentions that it's &#34;hand-neutral&#34;. I'm left-handed, and this was the most comfortable pruner I've ever used.
B000F97DWO This works great for pruning.  The quality is made to last.  Fiskars is a great brand for pretty much anything to do with gardening.  Can't go wrong
B000F97DWO High quality tool!  Ergonomically designed and makes pruning a breeze.I was sick of using cheap pruners that were hard to use and never lasted.  I expect this to last many years.
B000F97DWO I'm no garden professional, but I do have a fair amount of plants in my yard to take care of. I've been using the same old shears for years and they finally became to hard to use on some the thicker items. I decided to go with a new shear and this has been perfect. clean cuts with ease on all the plants I need it for.
B000F97DWO These shears can cut a twig to a small branch with very little effort.Fiskars quality can be seen by how tough these are and very durable,you won't find a better pruner than these. The price is also excellent!
B000F97DWO What a wonder product. I have almost all the Fiskars gear for our household. It's reliable and made with high quality.
B000F97DWO I love Fiskars.  All of my good scissors are Fiskars.  I was so excited to be getting these, but then disappointed at the quality and design.The small piece that locks has rough edges, and does not latch right.  There is a screw to loosen it, which I did, and that helped adjust it some.  But, it is not lined up right.What has happened to Fiskars?  I may return them.
B000F97DWO I do a lot of work on my 2.5 acres of southern Florida yard. Everything grows fast, even in the dry season. I use saws, machetes, cutters, trimmers,and pruners depending on the task.  Pruning is a big thing for me since I had rotator cuff surgery on my dominant shoulder and swinging a machete or using heavier equipment is harder than it used to be.So I do a lot of pruning and depend on my chosen tool to be sharp, work properly consistently, and have a functional safety mechanism if provided. Unfortunately I can't keep this blade sharp, it seems to crush what I'm cutting instead of sharply severing it, and the locking mechanism continually engages when I don't want it to. Big disappointment.  Perhaps it's time for Amazon and other retailers to indicate on their descriptions where each product is manufactured.
B000F97DWO cuts nicely, very good balance compares to newer fiskars design which use comp. handles, fits all my family's hands nicely, reasonable spring response, also able to gain a good grip at varies angles, which is not possible on their power gear line, good general purpose prunner.
B000F97DWO These pruners work great, feels very comfortable, and is very smooth when cutting.  But it is true regarding what an earlier reviewer indicated.  The locking mechanism once open will not go back into the closed position.  I had to remove the locking mechanism and grind it down a bit so that it will close.It works great now, but I should not have to grind down the mechanism right out of the box.
B000F97DWO I purchased this on Gold Box deal and it was defective... the latch that keeps it closed would not engage after a really tough time opening it. I mentioned the GB deal because when Amazon shipped me a new pair the price had dropped by a buck and had I checked before asking for a replacement I'd just done a return and made a new purchase for the savings... because that's how cheap I am! As usual, Amazon made the return simple and shipped a replacement right away. My wife has a very small hand and this pair is a great fit for her because of the angled handles. I gave it 4 stars because the first one was defective but otherwise I'd be going with 5.
B000F97DWO These shears work very well up to about 1/2\"...after that I prefer the larger loppers because of hand fatigue.  These have stayed exceptionally sharp despite my constant abuse.  I would recommend this product.
B000F97DWO This is my first-ever pair of pruning shears so I have no way to compare them with other pruners.  Having never used a pruner before, I wished it would have come with more directions than it did; for instance, I had no idea which side of the blade to hold \"upwards\" for the best cutting leverage, and it says the blade tension is adjustable, but I have no idea how to adjust it.  It does have a diagram on blade replacement on the card (but no part number listed for the replacement blades).I ordered this to help with trimming down a burning bush that had grown all the way up to the soffit and gutters and had grown completely out of control.  Then for cutting the branches up so they would fit in my trash cart.  It worked great for that.Kind of hard to tell the size here from the picture, they are about 11\" long.  The description says they are good for up to 1 inch in diameter.  Maybe I'm just not strong enough, but I had to use a small hand saw to cut through the wooden branches that were an inch thick.  I tried at first using the pruners with a two-handed method for more cutting strength, however I was afraid I'd break the pruner.  Even though these come with a great full lifetime warranty, I didn't want to chance breaking them by stressing them out too much.  Maybe I would have done better with a ratcheting pruner, but as long as these made my job easier, I'm happy.So I used the hand saw on my large branches that were basically old wood and for anything more green and soft, \" and under, the pruners worked fine.  Being ergonomically correct, they are comfortable in the hand, and went through the smaller branches like a hot knife cuts through butter.After pricing some locally, you can't go wrong buying your pruners here at Amazon.
B000F97DYC I got this tiny tool under the theory that it would feel like an extension of my arm. I was not disappointed. Last weekend, I used it to strip and chop up some oak branches for kindling. Sharp as heck, light, but powerful enough to quickly chop through the branches.  Feels good to use.  Would be a great one to take along on outdoor trips, but you would want to get a different cover in that case.  The plastic snap in is more suited for hanging in the garage than for travel.One reviewer said it's dangerous. It certainly could be if you're not careful. But I mean, it's a frickin hatchet.  What do you expect?
B000F97DYC Fiskars 8-Inch Hatchet is very dangerous. You can cut off a limb or a protrusion from a hand if you don't know how to use this. The level of training it takes to competently instate yourself with the knowledge of \"Hatchet chopping\" is about 2 years.Most people pick this up for recreational use at the local fish pond or RV camp and meet disastrous results, which result in the trip to the local hospital ward. I can not endorse a Hatchet that is so flauntingly dangerous. If you need wood, you can buy it somewhere or hire a vagrant to cut it from a forest.I implore you, Do not use this!UPDATE:I've documented numerous cases where the use of the Hatchet has produced a variety of injuries, ranging from simple cuts to the loss of a limb.UPDATE #2:Certain counties in Louisiana have banned the Hatchet.UPDATE #3:Many films have glorified the use of Hatchets in murder complots.  Hatchet (2006), The Baby (1973), Hatchet for the Honeymoon (1970), Blood Night: The Legend of Mary Hatchet (2009), Deep Red/Hatchet Murders (1975), and Strait-Jacket (1964).  Hatchets should be outright banned.There is even some offensive American southern metal band formed in Florida called Molly Hatchet.This is a notable abuse of an already dangerous \"tool\".
B000F97DYC Fiskars 8-Inch Hatchet is very dangerous.  You can cut off a limb or a protrusion from a hand if you don't know how to use this.

B000F97DYC I adore this product. My husband and I recently went camping and tool this MUST have tool with us. Since it is so small it was easy to pack and fit in our car and it is very light weight making splitting logs for the fire SUPER easy! This is a must have for any outdoors person, and I love it.
B000F97DYC I own a few Fiskars axes.This hatchet is excellent! Well balanced and keeps it's edge.Very durable handle.I suspect it would last a million years in a landfill..Nice nylon sheath included.This is the perfect small hatchet for preparing kindling.Hot knife through butter..Easy to control.
B000F97DYC It is small.  Great for it's size.  If you car camp get the bigger one.  It will not really cut anything over 4&#34; in diameter.  It is good for making small pieces smaller for kindling.  It is also not heavy. I wish I bought the 14&#34; model
B000F97DYC Thank you for finally requesting my review of an item that I did order and that you did deliver...TO THE CORRECT ADDRESS THIS TIME!  These little buggers are great for hacking off small pieces of wood for kindling.  They hold a nice edge and are extremely light weight, but handle well and do the job they were destined for...Thanks!
B000F97DYC You will not be disappointed with any Fiskars product, and no, I do not work for the company. Wish I did. All the Fiskars axes and hatchets are wonderful. I went a little crazy a few months ago and ordered about one of every size axe/hatchet that Fiskars make and I love each one equally. The handle, the look, the design, the price. This is a top of the line product. Anything else other than a a Fiskars is a waste of your time and money. Ohhh, Just had a thought....I did buy the Fiskars sharpening tool as well. The Fiskars sharpening tool is a piece of junk. It broke when I tried to use it the first time and I was completely unimpressed, but I did not return it to the vendor, too much hassle. The axes/hatchets are GREAT though and you will love them.
B000F97DZG This rake was perfect for under the tree branches of an evergreen when you want to rake up dead needles.  The small 8-inch rake combs in a large quantity of debris which is good.  You can spot the orange handle when put aside.  Great product!
B000F97DZG I am not overly fond of leaf rakes; rather I am not overly fond of raking leaves - truth be told, but rake them I must.  We live in the woods and with more or less a hundred large oak trees along with countlesss hickory, walnut, wild cherry, hedge apple, persimmon, maple, ash as some strange big old leafy thing I know not the name of, well, leaves we have.  In addition to this we have quite a number of ornamental shrubs and we have flower gardens.  Quite a number of these flower gardens consist of spring flowers - you know, the bulb kind.  They are my wife's favorites.  Therein lays the problem!She has these large beds of these spring flowers...not only beds but she has the things planted in odd nooks and corners, under bushes, along walks and paths and intermingled with the regular flowers that grow all summer.  I leave the leaves on these plants all winter, not because I am particularly lazy you see, but because we (she) has found that these spring bulbs do better over our winters with a nice covering of leaves.  It protects them from freezes and frost.  Each spring the little guys poke their heads up under the leaves getting ready for truly warm weather.  That is the time she want the leaves raked off of them.Now there are several kinds of small narrow leaf rakes like the one being reviewed here, but in general, those are broken down in to two major types.  There are the kinds that have softer and more flexible tines, and there are the ones with very heavy and hard tines with little give in them.  I have an old, old hard tine rake of this size (about 8 inches) which works great in cleaning out certain areas.  This thing, which I purchased at a auction years ago and no not the brand, is stiff enough to move granite blocks.  This I have found simply shreds the relatively delicate leaves on my wife's spring bulb plants.  This does not make her happy - my goodness no!  What to do?  What to do?Well, I ran across this lighter and springier rake at a local building store.  I must tell you that it works perfectly in removing the leaves from the plants and unless I am not paying attention to what I am doing (hey, It happens now and then), it is possible to remove those leaves with little or no damage to the plants.  This makes my wife happy, ergo, I am happy.Now the long handle on this thing most certainly saves my back.  I use to get down on my hand and knees with heavy gloves and remove the trillions of leaves by hand.  Now those of you that are my age (old) will know that getting down on your hands and knees is a snap...no problem! I do it all the time with out thinking or even meaning to.  (Oh! See! The old buzzard just fell again, grrrrr).  The difficulty comes in getting back up once you are down there!  With this rake there is no more of that sort of thing!The aluminum handle is quite light and enables me to maneuver this rake quite well with no real strain.  The aluminum handle does not rot if I leave the rake where I last used it, forget where I placed it, and don't find it until the next year.  This is not good on wooden handled yard tools!  Go figure.The price on this one is about one third less than I paid for it locally and if you have Amazon Prime...which I do, shipping is really not a consideration.The handle is extremely comfortable in the hand and the rake is well balance and a piece of cake to use.I do like this tool!Don BlankenshipThe Ozarks
B000F97DZG This rake is the perfect tool to use in my raised garden bed. It is small enough to get between the plants but wide enough to get the job done. The aluminum handle and the plastic tines make for a lightweight tool that is easy to handle. The rake is held in place on the handle with just a single screw which makes it easy to replace should that become necessary. This is a nice companion to its cousin, the Fiskars garden rake which I use mostly to rake magnolia leaves. This shrub rake also does a good job of raking the leaves between the shrubs that surround my house.This shrub rake is reasonably priced and a very handy addition to my Fiskars collection. It is a worthwhile purchase.
B000F97DZG Although we have a rather small lot, probably 1/5 of an acre, we have a tremendous number of maple trees, tulip trees, etc, all those that lose their leaves for the winter.  We also have a lot of shrubs and arbor vitae on the ground around the yard.  It's always been tough getting those leaves out from around these areas.  These rakes really fit the bit and it's much easier getting around those areas now.  In fact, with the other rakes, I just said \"forget it\".  With these, the yards look much cleaner because I can get those leaves out.  In fact, I ordered 2 of these... one for the garage in the back (back yard) and one for the garage alongside the house (side yard and front yard).
B000F97DZG Incredibly light weight and durable. I'll never buy another type of rake. This one is phenomenal. Used it for fall clean-up and loss track of the time.
B000F97DZG I don't know if I would be able to face the job of raking under our front hedges without it.Not only great for leaves, but for hedge trimmings and large seed pods, too.  We have huge, 100-year-old magnolia trees in our front lawn.  The seed pods are like hand grenades!  Heavy and prickly, too!  (Think twice before planting magnolias....)  This rake has very heavy-duty plastic tines--with just the right amount of give. It gets into tight places and is capable of dragging out weighty plant debris, too.Don't even suggest that the plastic tines will break easily.  I've been using this one rake for four years and not one tine has broken.  And we live in an area where we have different trees shedding all year long--no seasonal breaks here.The rake is light-weight, nice and long, and has a great-feeling grip--all teriffic qualities.  I can't say enough about how much I like this rake!We love Fiskars products.  I guess you could say we're Fiskars Fans...
B000F97DZG Like its big brother, this is an excellent quality rake. The 8\" shrub rake is durable and has a comfortable handle.Great for getting into tight spots around your landscaping.The head and tines are flexible and durable.I have had this rake for a few years and it is still in mint condition even after a lot of use. I have had small shrub rakes that have too stiff a tine and end up with broken tines.These are flexible and strong.A very nice item.Highly recommended.
B000F97DZG It's got along handle and it lightweight, Works great for hard to reach areas. It works for what we need and it has a nice design and good warranty.
B000F97DZG I wasn't aware that they made rakes that kept the bark and dirt where it was supposed to be, until I stumbled upon this.  It works great and isn't super expensive. Good use for flower beds and areas where you don't want to disturb the soil too much.
B000F97DZG This rake is perfect for between the bushes around my house. It easily pulls the leaves and other waste without disrupting my rock beds. The super lightweight material makes it comfortable to use for large areas and the long handle makes it easy to reach behind the shrubs without getting tangled in them.
B000F97DZG I bought this along with the 24\" Fiskar rake and carry both of them where I go in the garden.  Like the 24\" rake, the design is very light with an oblong handle designed for better grip and orientation.  The tines are very flexible and are useful at a wide range of angles unlike most rakes.Although this is called a shrub rake, it's useful for a variety of garden projects, such as raking the edge of borders, sculpting the mulch around plants, or sweeping fine garden debris from the lawn into a dust pan.The only drawback with the Fiskar rake is its flexibility which means it can't be used to scrape the ground or move light soil around like I am able to do with my stiffer shrub rakes.  However this makes it ideal for gently combing your plants.Overall, I believe every fastidious gardener could use this product.
B000F97DZG Very light, very handy under tight spaces and you don't have to spear this thing like bigger and heavier rakes, just reach it out and put it down, pull the claw back and towards you with a little elegance in your posture, too bad though the claw are too thin and it bounces more than I wanted from time to time. Other than that, the design of the claw really works.
B000F97DZG The Fiskars shrub take is a great little tool and a necessity for cleaning shrub beds and clearing leaves from behind and between bushes. It's size makes for great maneuverability and its flexible tines get the leaves out, but leaves the mulch where it lies. As a bonus ,it even sports the Baltimore Orioles black and orange colors.
B000F97DZG The Fiskars 9661 shrub rake is notable mainly for its length (66\"), ultra-flexible plastic head, and relatively light weight.  Using a rake with a longer handle may feel strange in the beginning, as the angle of your typical raking stroke changes, but it shouldn't take very long to get used to.  The handle is made of lightweight aluminum, which makes wielding the rake pretty easy.  Even when you choke up your grip, the rake is still very manageable.The 8\" wide flexible head comes in handy in tighter spaces.  The limited coverage and flexible head, means it may take more strokes to get some jobs done.  You may be scraping a bit harder to pickup smaller objects, but the rake is generally quite effective.  The plastic is extremely flexible and resilient, and although it bends a lot, it will take an extreme amount of force to actually snap off one of the tines.  Since the plastic has a lot of \"give\", the rake is actually rather gentle, and doesn't rip up vegetation or disturb soils, as much as a metal, plastic, or bamboo rake.  It takes a little more force to move heavier objects, which can sometimes be a plus, as rocks are often left behind when raking grass or leaves.The longer length can be a slight inconvenience when storing.  There is a soft plastic handle at the end, but no provisions for hanging the rake.  Drilling a hole through the handle is a simple solution.  You may lose a tine or two along the way, but this rake should hold up well under general use.  It's not inexpensive, but it is worth the money.  If you can't find it one at a local store, the free shipping at Amazon is an excellent deal.  For bigger jobs, you might considerFiskars 9660 24-Inch Leaf Rake.
B000F9K7JA Not only did the one I got from Walmart look identical (except for label Kelsyus), and cost 1/3 of the price, it is also holding up better.I bought the two at the same time and Kelsyus one won't hold air in the pillow.I've returned this one for a replacement and will give the company a second chance. Kelsyus has a good reputation but the two products I have bought from them have not held up.Update after a year:  I have now purchased a dozen different designs of floats and this design remains the most popular for use with young children because it's the easiest to climb onto, particularly with waterwings (life jacket).  My husband also prefers this design because more of your body is in the water.
B000F9K7JA This was really easy to inflate, but nothing is as easy as floating around in the pool on a hot summer day and keeping cool.I bought this a couple of weeks ago because I wanted an extra float for the pool. With the recent heat wave it has been getting a work out not only in the pool but in the gulf as well. It submerges every so slightly but is cooling enough to offer real comfort from the extreme heat. It is compact when deflated and easy to take to the beach as well. The construction is decent given its extremely reasonable price. In this weather however, it is priceless. I just went to the pool store today and picked up another water hammock for the weekend when the family comes down.
B000F9K7JA I bought this last year to use with my new pool. So in about six months of using it, here are my initial thoughts:PROS- Very comfortable- Lets water come up through the float so you actually feel like your IN the pool, not ON the pool (my pool temp is usually 82-85 so this is favorable)- Easy to pack up to carry or store- Colors have not faded even with salt water and sunCONS- Could be challenging to get in if you're, uhm, voluptuous- You can't lay on your stomach, only on your backOVERALLThis is an excellent float to have for a pool. My kids keep me busy in and around the pool so I don't get to use it much but when I'm alone, this is the first thing I grab.
B000F9K7JA This water hammock does a great job of allowing you to relax in the pool. It quickly unfolds from the carry case and is easy to inflate. The material of the hammock is perforated so you keep cool in the hot sun.The hammock easily supports a 185lb adult and packs up neatly when finished for storage or transporting. It seems pretty hard wearing too, and has already coped with several children clambering over it and using it as a pool toy without any damage.
B000F9K7JA I love the idea behind this, but it did not hold up well at all. The edges frayed and it started to fall apart quickly.
B000FBQJA4 This is an effective formula will kill your moles in the yard. However, why kill moles when you can distract them to go elsewhere?Try the Tomcat 34532 Mole and Gopher Liquid Repellent, 32-Ounce instead to repell the creatures.
B000FBQJA4 I've tried the sonic spikes, I've tried traps (which works somewhat, but kind of a pain), and I have used poison pellets.These seem to work well, but as mentioned elsewhere here (same for kill traps for that matter), you MUST find and use these on the main tunnel, or you might as well be throwing them away.  I think this is the most difficult part in controlling moles, because the main tunnel is not always obvious.I was able to find the long, straight run that my critters were using, inserted the worms, and after about a week, I noticed much less activity.  Will continue to use these throughout the summer if they continue to be so effective.Highly recommended.
B000FBQJA4 After trying every environmentally friendly and non-poisonous remedy for moles on the market, we have reluctantly tried this as our first poison.We have tried the sonic mole repellent, cayenne pepper, pepper spray repellent, flooding them out, cat poop in their tunnels, traps and snap traps.  Our tomatoes, vegetables and lilies were still being dug up and chewed on for the past 2 years of trying all these products.  Setting the dogs to dig terrify them didn't work either.This product is supposed to mimic their food and looks vaguely like a worm.  We're very cautious about using poisons and chemicals because we have dogs and our neighbours have outdoor cats.  As the trick to making any sort of trap/bait work is proper placement, we followed the advice of some other reviewers and partially collapsed the mole tunnels and inserted a cut-up portion of the &#34;worm&#34;.  So far it seems that there has been some mole activity near where the tunnel was collapsed but no new activity has been seen near the lilies or the tomatoes.  We have also been walking around the yard in areas where we usually see mole activity to check if any dead moles are on the ground where our dogs or the neighbour's cats could pick them up and so far there have not been any dead moles above ground.While this product seems to work - though we're not entirely sure since we haven't found any dead moles - there hasn't been any additional damage in our garden.  My current worry is that the dogs will dig up some dead poisoned moles.  Recommended with reservations if you or your neighbours have pets that have access to your yard.
B000FBQJA4 This worm killer formula probably works well but I was too concerned that the bromethalin might get consumed by non-targeted animals, causing paralysis, convulsions, and death.
B000FBQJA4 The Tomcat mole killer worms are a really neat idea. We've had various mole eliminating or repelling products. I like the concept of the worm baits. The mole traps that actually stab the moles are just little violent and gory for my liking. The repellents just aren't effective enough. The worms are a toxic bait just like when you bait mice. The good and the bad thing is that you don't have to get involved in the aftermath. I say good because I don't want to dispose of dead mole bodies and I say bad because you won't always know if you are getting them. You may find a body or two but mostly just that the little mole runways all through your yard aren't being occupied any longer.
B000FBQJA4 I&#8217;ve got critter problems this year and moles tend to be a constant. And as a result I&#8217;m trying a few different things. My usual castor oil concoction is nothing like this and so I found myself checking out the ingredients. The main ingredient is bromethalin, a far cry from my inoffensive castor oil. I do want to drive them off the property, but what I don&#8217;t want is for other animals to ingest it.We do have other animals who trespass and I&#8217;m using other &#8220;stay away,&#8221; but natural methods. What I don&#8217;t want is for other animals to dig for this in hopes of a nice snack. Not that I like the presence of red squirrels or chipmunks when they invade my home or outbuildings, but don&#8217;t want to use this very toxic poison. Think I&#8217;ll take a pass on this one.
B000FBQJA4 Apparently someone tipped off my mole that these strange colored fake worms may not be healthy to eat. My mole runs around happy as a lark and would not touch this fake worm with a ten foot pole. I will have to try a different method to get rid of this unwelcome guest because the fake worm does not do the job.
B000FBQJA4 I have a huge mole problem in my yard which I wouldn't care about if it didn't make huge holes in my yard that make me trip. These worms work great. I put a couple of them down and one was even moved to the surface by the mole and they I think it killed him because he moved it. I will  notice a difference  in the holes in my yard by fall.
B000FBQJA4 The worms of Tomcat Mole Killer are big enough that their half/quarter size cuttings are big enough to kill a mole.  A thread can be attached to pull them up to check, if were eaten. They can be inserted to the tunnels trough small holes made with a stick.  Placing several pieces in various tunnels at once kills faster, but placing just one piece and waiting for the result saves money. However, the poisonous worms are not the most environmentally friendly though very effective.
B000FBQJA4 I honestly don't know if this bait works. So perhaps I should not even be writing a review, but at least I'm being honest. I find a few tunnel holes in the backyard but have never seen moles, so I may not even have any. We do have small roof mice here in Arizona. They tend to feed on the backyard oranges & grapefruit that have fallen to the ground. But, since placing this bait out I have seen no dead ones, so I really don't know if this bait is working, at least on them.
B000FBQJA4 While I seem to be in the minority, I did not love this product. There just wasn't much activity on it. I put them in a high traffic area but they were left untouched. I did better with the repellent.In the end, I rolled these in a little tiny amount of PB powder and used them in a barn wall to get mice. They worked great.
B000FBQJA4 All I can say is that the 5 people that reviewed this product MUST work for \"Tomcat\" cause these little \"worms\" are as much of a joke as every other mole bait out there.  I have used 5 boxes of these (yes, literally 5 boxes) and I have had NO success whatsoever.  Granted, I must be a fool for spending over $100 on one product, but I have tried everything else and was desperate.  Don't waste your money.  Not sure what else to tell you to try though, outside of making sure that your yard doesn't have grubworms.
B000FBQJA4 This is a pretty good product I have placed the grub worm shaped mole killers in the ground and have started to notice that the mole tunnels seem not to be gaining any ground.  So I assume that it is working.  This is very easy to use and comes in a shape that moles like.  Will try this again if I start to see more tunnels
B000FBQJA4 I really didn't know what to expect with these, I know I had moles in my yard last year so I tried these. They are a bit strange. They remind me a lot of fishing lures. The concept is you bury them and the moles tunnel in and find them. In concept they are good, they are toxic. What I found is in the one area I put them to test them out I found my dog was doing a lot of sniffing around. I had to constantly keep her away from the area because I was afraid she would try to dig them up and eat them.I can't confirm if they work or not, but it is an interesting concept, easy to deploy. Just make sure you don't have kids or pets that may be curious and try to get to them.
B000FBQJA4 Controlling moles in our area is a very difficult problem due to being in an area with more wild lands than &#34;tamed&#34;. These 'worms' seem to be helping cut down the population of moles in our yard. We only even try to keep a fairly small area in green lawn, so it is a real challenge.
B000FBQJA4 I get moles sporadically throughout year forever...  I have used pellet poisons, castor oil spreads, smoke bombs in the holes, water hose in the holes, sonic spikes you push into the ground, various traps you put in the runways, and on and on and on.  I discovered these &#34;worms&#34; a couple of seasons ago.  The first time I used them I thought it might have been a coincidence or maybe just one of a combination of things that worked.  The next time the moles showed up I used a bunch of other stuff before finally getting another box of these and within a few days the holes and raised runways disappeared.  I was a total skeptic but these things have really worked.  A box of them isn't cheap.  Fortunately, I don't have a big lawn/yard.  I even cut the worms in half and spread them around the lawn.  They look ridiculous and when you first see them you figure there is no way they would work but you should give it a try.  An expensive box of these will be cheaper than a shed full of other worthless spreads and traps.  If you have little kids be careful as they do look much like candy gummy worms.
B000FBQJA4 Works just the way it is advertised.  Bait the tunnels and moles will die.  What more could you ask for?As a rural country dweller, moles were a constant thing.  Using these and a few other Tomcat products, my yard is no longer covered in mole tunnels.  I will be buying this product again.One caution though, might not be a good idea to use these if you have outside pets that may either dig them up and eat them or eat the dead mole once it has surfaced.  May truly harm your dog or cat.
B000FBQJA4 Tomcat is who I turn to help me rid myself of pests.I was new to the annoying presence of moles and with the help of Tomcat, I am now Mole-free.Tomcat helps rid me of the assorted pests that appear each year, in a safe way and I plan on using it each year .
B000FBQJA4 According to the package, this is a slow working poison and would leave moles suffering for two days before they died.  (I might be willing to let a nasty rat suffer that long, if necessary and found no alternative, I will admit.)  But, it seems a cruel and inhumane for a cute little mole.  And we only have a mild issue with them.  We will seek another solution.Perhaps you have a mole issue rampant enough to justify that, and if so, I'll not certainly not judge you.  Just, well,&#34; there's the facts&#34; on this one.  I'm not willing to torture the little guys.
B000FBQJA4 This product from Tomcat works great, just like all the other Tomcat products. It helped us get rid of our little problem and now things are back to normal.
B000FBQJA4 Not sure these work, I bought to boxes and still have moles.  If it killed any I can't tell.  To expensive as well.
B000FBQJA4 They've been having mole problems at my apartment complex.  I got several Tomcat products through Vine and tried this one first...hey it did work.  Moles seem to be gone.
B000FBQJA4 I tried this product for a mole in my front yard.  It was easy to use but I wore disposable gloves just to be safe.  I didn't cut the worms in half, I just made a hole and tossed one in whole.  I noticed mole activity for a couple of days afterwards but not it seems to have died down so it quite possibly worked.  No mole has surfaced and died so I can't really know for sure.
B000FBQJA4 I think this is just too hard to say if it works or not. New moles come and take a prior one's territory so quickly and unless you see them dead, you just don't know...and you won't see them dead using these. I have dug up the tunnel over and over to see if it is still there and haven't seen it taken. So, I have switched to Cinch traps and they work for me because I have so many rock walls and landscaping that can only fit those kind.
B000FBQJA4 This package contains six baits per pack and they are shaped like earthworms. The bait is made of mole-poison Bromethalin. I tried to use this to kill moles in my yard where there is significant traffic in the soil. The trickiest part is the proper application. I use a hard wooden stick or a metal rod to pierce a hole in the mound and detect the tunnel, and then drop a teaspoon full of poison pellets, when I am using Bromethalin pellets. Generally the holes are below the surface and the stick gives a reasonable measure of where the tunnel is. There are hits and misses, but you have to place this where moles can find it. I found it very challenging to put this into mole tunnels (the product is very wiggly) and finally gave up. I recommend Bromethalin pellets which are easier to handle and apply.
B000FBQJA4 cut the worms in pieces, crushed the runs and waited for repair, baited each hole.  Waited days and checked, worm gone in some, but no dead moles, and burrows continue to appear.  I have tried traps, poison peanuts, more traps, more traps, more traps.  These moles seem to live close to the house foundations and burrow into the grass sod to eat worms each year.  One came up and died on it's own last fall perhaps from &#34;old age&#34;.  Nothing seems to kill these critters, as long as we have earthworms and sandy soil and shade.
B000FBQJA4 I have alot, alot, alot of moles in my yard.  Or are they voles?  I'm not sure.  I find little holes everywhere, and I find big mounds everywhere.  Maybe mine are hybrid mole-voles.  Whatever they are, they do not like Tomcat worms.  Never even touched them.
B000FBQJA4 We tried this and two different \"repellent\" products.  Unlike the \"repellents\", which did nothing for us, this Mole Killer was very effective.  Our yard seems to be fully reclaimed.
B000FBQJA4 I've done it all to get rid of the grubs in our yard ... Sevin, nematodes, milky spore, caster oil, among others. Yet we still have the grubs that little pests like to feed on. Next best thing is bait, I guess. We've just put it out ... cutting into thirds as a previous reviewer suggested. It's out and time will tell!
B000FBQJA4 Moles generally breed in February and March and, within approximately 42 days, have 2 to 5 young that leave the nest in 30 to 45 days. Moreover, moles are quite hardy. This seems to be the crux of the problem and why they are so difficult to get rid of.According to Wikipedia, &#34;The mole runs are in reality 'worm traps'; the mole senses when a worm falls into the tunnel and quickly runs along to kill and eat it.&#34; This is the principle behind this product. Where I live (the northeast), spring is finally here (as of April 11), and last year's traps have emerged from under the snow, though the ground is still frozen. Last year, I bought the Victor Out O'Sight Mole Trap, and later the Talpirid Mole Trap (both available from Amazon, though I bought them too late last year to be effective). Now I have this product in my arsenal. I also acquired Tomcat Mole & Gopher Bait. I set one trap and will set the other and put out the bait as soon as the ground thaws a bit. It will be interesting to see which products are most effective this year; I will update this review with the results (and adjust the number of stars accordingly).The reason I have already given this product 4 stars is that I like the theory, and many of the comments from other users lead me to believe this will be one of the most effective tools in getting rid of the moles. I didn't give it 5 stars for two reasons: first, it is quite expensive, and if the &#34;worms&#34; are not placed in the right way, they will have been wasted. It was suggested to me that one should use latex gloves when handling this product for two reasons. The first is obvious: this is poison. The second is that moles have a sensitive sense of smell, and worms should smell like worms not people. This may be the reason that this product hasn't worked for some other users.Overall, I feel optimistic about this product (this may be spring talking), and I will update this review in a couple of months.
B000FBQJA4 I hate to be responsible for killing any sort of animal, but the moles in our yard have become too much. The burrows and tunnels create a danger for my 89 year old mother to walk around the yard, she has fallen when her  foot went down into a tunnel and turned her ankle.The burrows go right up to some of the plants I have had for several years and enjoyed. Evidently the moles did too because they were gnawed at under the surface. It is possible that these were also voles; but the bottom line is that I wanted them gone. This product accomplished that and was much more efficient than repellants that let them come back.
B000FBQJA4 I planted about 7 of these in various trails in the yard.  The activity in the grass seems to have stopped, but I think I'm still getting activity in the vegetable garden, which borders the back of our yard.  The tricky thing about this is that you have to find an active tunnel, then carefully place the worm in the trail, trying not to disturb the tunnel too much.  That's tricky.  The other downside is that since the little buggers go die somewhere buried in the yard, there's no proof that they did the deed. That said, I recommend these as part of a multi-pronged anti-mole arsenal..
B000FCEPMM In the year 2014 the most reliable way to kill rats is still the old-fashioned trap with food (peanut butter works really well).This trap is supposed to snap the rat and thus kill it. This is a theoretical situation. I would caution you to watch your fingers and set it very carefully. also, sometimes, rats do not die in the trap, and are pinned against in it instead. Be very careful when handling the trap with the rat in it. Traps in general are hit or miss and this one is no exception.Also, beware that using peanut butter or cheese will attract pets. Place the trap in a place where the pet can't get to it.Warn children not to go anywhere near it as well -- you don't want the child getting his or her fingers snapped off or handling a dead rat, or worse, getting bitten by a trapped rat.
B000FCEPMM I don't think I needed a trap this big.  It's for rat's, not mice.  It is a well built trap, easy to load and set.  I attempted to find out how quick it works by dropping a small lightweight item onto it.  It snapped the second the bait holder was touched and since there was nothing holding it down it jumped into the air a couple of feet.If a rat comes near this trap it likely will not make it out alive, which I guess is the purpose.  If the user is not careful when setting the trap or the location, it just might catch more than rats.  I'm thinking of small pet animals such as some breeds of dogs, cats, squirrels, not to mention a curious child's toes and fingers or for that matter an adults fingers and toes.  I have no doubt this thing could break fingers and toes.  There are safer and more effective options available.I don't care for rats and mice in my home.  If I were going to use this trap anywhere at all it would be in my attic as I&#34;m 100% sure my grandchildren can not get into my attic.  If I knew I was being invaded by rodents big enough to fit in this trap I would use a live trap.If you feel comfortable using these traps, it's a good one.  It's strong and reacts very quickly to the slightest touch.
B000FCEPMM Motomco 33528 Wooden Rat Trapby MotomcoThis works well. Scarey when you see how big it is.. but its got to be done when you have a situation. Highly recommended to get the job done and correctly the first time.
B000FCEPMM Some people on here have had issues, and I think it's because they're dealing with mice (who steal the bait) or mutated cat-zed wharf rats that can withstand the impact which would normally break a rat's back.This works fine for me. I have a couple for my back porch, where rats will try to nest after feasting on some of my garden vegetables or compost bin. A little speck of bait will do the trick. 5 stars for being so cheap and reliable.
B000FCEPMM Not sure if I got a bum trap or what, but I have a real hard time getting my trap to set.  I have other, smaller mouse traps and have no problem setting them, but I just can't get this one to reliably catch.  It ends up being really stressful trying to set it. Not sure if mine is just defective.
B000FCEPMM We have either a roof rat or some sort of squirrel or chipmunk in our attic.  There are small piles of spindle-shaped poop scattered all over part of the attic.We set a few different traps to see which one would work as rats are notoriously cautious about changes in their surroundings.  Right now the Tomcat Wooden Rat Trap is baited with peanut butter and birdseed. Our Victor Wood trap is baited with peanut butter and bacon grease.  Plus we have a Victor battery powered zap trap set just in case.So far we haven't caught anything and the poop is still fresh and shiny.  I will report back when we do (or fail to) catch anything.
B000FCEPMM We set this Tomcat Wooden Rat Trap in our garage to trap what we thought was a rat. It turned out to be squirrel that was gnawing at our plastic gas cans. It was not pleasant to clean up, but it did the job.Recommended... but eeewwwww.CFH
B000FCEPMM Don't set out a mouse size trap if you have a rat size rat. We had the opportunity to find that out when we knew that we had a big rodent when our mouse traps were being sprung but not catching anything. The mouse was just too big to be caught in a small trap. We've used baits in the past but don't like them because we don't want a mouse or rat going off and dying in the wall. The downside of a trap is definitely having to fool with the thing. I don't like having to set them, bait them or dispose of the trapped animal. I really don't like having to set a rat size trap. It makes me nervous, that thing is big enough to break a finger if you're not careful. I actually set it without any trouble. We did not have any trouble with it whatsoever. It worked flawlessly. Worked well for what it is.
B000FCEPMM This is the big one. The trap you need when dealing with a big rat in your basement, barn or shed. We baited ous with peanut butter and it worked well. Remember this is big and needs to be kept away form children. it can be lethal to small animals like cats and dogs and kittens or even chickens, so when you set it make sure to put it out of reach of the small ones.
B000FCEPMM The reason people have used this kind of trap for a hundred years is that it works.The TomCat Wooden Rat trap is a breeze to set but PAY ATTENTION. This trap is powerful enough to cause your fingers real harm. I have not had any false triggers off this trap. It has killed quickly and cleanly. None of the little critters have still been alive and biting when I got to the trap. Anyone who has had that experience will appreciate that.Make sure you set this where you know only unwanted critters will get to it.
B000FCEPMM This is a very powerful trap! Be very cautious when setting or moving, it can definitely hurt fingers or toes (or pets!) To catch critters this large I recommend the hav-a-hart humane traps instead. Use with much caution around pets or little ones.
B000FCEPMM Obviously, this is something you want to keep out of the reach of children and pets (not to mention quite a few adults). While mouse traps can hurt if they snap on you, this thing would crush bones.It's easy to bait and set, has a metal pedal (which is fine), and works.My only suggestion? Since all rat traps are pretty much the same, and you're paying quite a bit for the convenience of shipping here, if you have access to one locally (a hardware store, etc), it would probably be significantly cheaper.
B000FCEPMM I had the chance to try this trap out and I'll first start by saying it is very easy to set. The metal bar that snaps down simply pulls back with a bit of force, and a little bar locks it into place. The trap was very easy to set, I was able to set it exactly where I wanted it and it did not go off without something hitting the bait plate. Now I haven't had it kill a rat yet, but in playing with it I was able to barely tap the bait plate and the trap snapped and left a mark on the wood dowel rod I used to trigger the trap. It seems like it has a lot of force.If you need a rat trap this one seems to be a good option in terms of ease to set it and reliability. As for stopping power as I haven't caught a rat yet you would need to find another persons review for that.
B000FCEPMM This rat trap is designed pretty much like any standard mouse trap. You place the bait on the designated end, you pull the u-shaped bar against the spring and secure it in place with another bar that fits into a little hole on the same piece of metal as the bait. It wasn't too difficult to set up, though the spring is rather tight, and given the size of this thing, you'll want to watch your fingers. I tested it out a few times with a pencil to see how well it might respond to vermin.The first time I tested it, it took a couple of jabs with a pencil to release the bar and have the trap close. But every attempt after that, I had to literally force the bar to move in order to get the trap to go off. And frankly, my opinion is that if the trap is not going off when I'm trying to force it, it's not going to go off for a rat that doesn't have two hands trying to forcefully set it off. I chose not to set it with actual bait and then leave it anywhere because I didn't want it to just attract rodents without actually doing anything about them. We know we've got something that keeps coming to the front entryway of our house, we don't want to give it any reason to keep coming.
B000FCEPMM Make no mistake, this will kill mid sized rodents right quick. And they'll even snap a few fingers if you're not careful while setting them. The spring is very strong. This old school style trap is still the best solution by far. Yup, you're gonna see the dead rodent laying there, staring at you with that blank, lifeless look in it's eyes. But it gets the job done. Just be careful not to put it anywhere pets or kids can trip it by accident. A trap this strong will definitely hurt if tripped accidentally. I find peanut butter works best.
B000FCEPMM In all honesty, I think this trap would kill any small rodent (squirells, chipmunks, small rabbits) as well as rats, so be cautious where you place this.  We have it in out well pump house - where we also store animal feed.  So far, it's taken out one - using the Tomcat Mouse Attractant gel as bait.  Super heavy duty trap, I would suggest wearing gloves to spring load the trap after placing the bait on the tray.  Might save some nasty bruising to your fingers if the trap slips what setting.
B000FCEPMM Recently I had the horror of facing a large roof rat IN my house, something new for me.I did NOT enjoy it and after taking a few lame suggestions from people that have never lived with this thrill, an experienced friend suggested one of these Tomcat Wooden Rat Traps.I bought it and the suggestion brought results quickly....Bye Bye Roof Rat!!!It Does The Job!
B000FCEPMM Just like the classic traps, it takes a bit of strength to set. Just be certain to keep fingers away from the strike end of the board and tension the trap bar while holding firmly. Lay the trigger bar over the top and flip the trap inverted to let the platform cover the end of the trigger bar. Keep out of reach of children and small pets. Use a minimal amount of peanut butter, don't overdo it
B000FCEPMM I sincerely I hope I never have to be THE person who empties this.  Just this size of it gives me shivers.  However, it's a nice addition-to-cats in the storage barn.Tomcat makes a reliable, functioning trap.  I'd like to feel sorry for the critters, but they're rats....  (Shivver.)I hope you never need this product!
B000FCEPMM I bought some of these Tomcat brand at Lowe's - which look the same as the Victor brand.Little did I know that the spring/catch don't work as well. They are more difficult to set, & so far, the bait is eaten but the trap doesn't spring (on all 3 units). The Victor brand works much better.
B000FCEPMM THIS IS A GIANT TRAP! I never knew that mouse traps could be so well made. If you think of your regular size mousetrap and multiply times 5 you get this well made TOMCAT RAT TRAP. This could catch a large cat because of its size and weight. The steel is twice as thick as a wire coat hanger or more. The wood is large and heavy. Only get this trap for a huge rat...not small mice. Be careful when setting it because it can easily break your fingers. It is quality made and is huge.
B000FCEPMM This is the typical old school wooden rat trap. It is large (about 4&#34; long)  It is very responsive and snap quickly.  We set it with some peanut butter, the peanut butter was gone and the trap was snapped, but with no rat in it.  The second time it snapped with a rat in it, which is good. Overall, it's not any better or worse than the other wooden traps.
B000FCEPMM The above is just a suggestion that peanut butter is better than cheese as mouse bait.  The trouble is that even with the right bait, this trap is unreliable.  It just doesn't spring that easily.  So, sadly, I can't recommend this product.
B000FCEPMM This trap is for rats, so don't try to use it to catch mice.  It uses the same concept as the typical wood mouse traps, just a lot bigger in size.  Look out rats, this one will get you!
B000FCEPMM I live near a river and some woods as a result mice and other wildlife are abundant. Mice will often make it to my outdoor shed, my garage and my basement.  My shed has also been home to larger rodents.I placed this in my shed to see if I had rats and happily I have not caught one. It is good to have around just in case.It is easy enough to set but I would be careful. If this came down on your finger it would hurt. This also needs to be kept away from children for that reason and pets as well. If it did catch a Rat I think the Rat would die.
B000FCEPMM First of all, this is a sturdy built rat trap. The wooden base is thick and flat, and the hardware is firmly embedded into the base. The trap is easy to bait, and fairly easy to set once you get the hang of it. It does seem harder to make this trap trip than another well-known name brand rat trap, but if you use a sticky bait like peanut butter it will guarantee success much more readily than something like a bread-ball.Where the mixed results come in, is the spring tension. It feels as if it has plenty of tension, and it is enough to kill smaller to medium sized rats, but larger rats might not be instantly killed. There was one larger rat trapped across the neck that was still gasping for air when I found it out in the barn, and it had managed to drag the trap several feet away from where it had been originally set. With that in mind, if you have big rats, go for a bigger trap.
B000FCEPMM We thought we had a rat in our barn, so this came in at just the right time... but lo and behold, no rats in the trap. It looked like the bait was eaten a little, but sometimes we'd find a tripped trap, but no bodies or body parts - so we're thinking a small mouse might have tripped the trap. After reading mixed reviews for the trap, I tried some testing with a stick to see how hard it was to get this thing to trip. I gotta say, other brands I've used (mostly Victor, I believe), trip much more easily... but it does have to do with the kind of bait you use. The purveyor of lore and cartoons will want to put cheese on a trap - but that is only effective if the rodent has no other food source... and there are usually tons of food sources they already have access too. The bait has to be irresistible for them to venture onto that trap with your human smell embedded in the wood... so I use peanut butter and it usually works like a charm. Rodents also tend to run along walls/baseboards for navigation with their whiskers when it's dark - so the placement of a trap is also crucial. My experience is that peanut butter has several things going for it. It's sweet - and rodents love sugary stuff. It's gooey and sticky - so the critter isn't going to take the bait and run with it - they're going to relish in their (hopefully last) meal as they lick the trigger vigorously to get the last morsel. Every trap I've ever used before has tripped and killed when I've used peanut butter. I lived in a house with roof rats and they were too smart to get into the live trap - so we had to lay out Victor traps - and boom - one right after another.So - that being said, I did testing with a stick and really poked the snot out of the trigger before it snapped. If tripped, the spring is strong enough that it would definitely do the trick - but I can see after lots of testing how people are dissatisfied with the mechanism. I did discover that if I carefully set the trap barely on the trigger, it's more sensitive - but it can also trip as you walk out the room when you do it like this.In a nutshell, I don't think I'd get this brand in the future - but if you lay enough gooey peanut butter down, they should fiddle with it enough to cause it to trip.
B000FCEPMM We use these bad boys out at the hangar where rats roam freely. If they don't get scooped up by the owls and hawks, swallowed by the rattlers and king snakes, or whipped up by a propellor (I've actually seen that happen) this trap will get them. I use honey which rats can smell for miles. Works every time.
B000FCEPMM These traps work well, but you have to use a bunch of them.  Don't just put one or two out and expect to get lucky.  Also, be very sparing with the bait.  Too much bait and they can steal the bait without setting off the trap.
B000FCGS6I In the year 2014 the most reliable way to kill mice is still the old-fashioned trap with food (peanut butter works really well).This product is four traps. One trap is supposed to snap the mouse and thus kill it, and then you go and dispose of it in your trash (hopefully, while wearing gloves!).I would caution you to watch your fingers and set the traps very carefully. Also, sometimes, mice do not die in the trap, and are pinned against in it instead. Be very careful when handling the trap with the mouse in it. Traps in general are a hit or miss and this one is no exception.Also, beware that using peanut butter or cheese will attract pets. Place the trap in a place where the pet can't get to it.Warn children not to go anywhere near it as well -- you don't want the child getting his or her fingers snapped off or handling a dead mouse, or worse, getting bitten by a trapped mouse.
B000FCGS6I My husband is the expert at setting mouse traps and he said these traps do the job.  I gave up trying to set mouse traps years ago because I never caught anything.  He tells me you have to set traps so they have a hair trigger.
B000FCGS6I The ever faithful wooden snap traps are my least favourite method of attracting and getting rid of mice.  These are only used as a last resort as I hate having to dispose of the catch.  I would much rather mice not make it into my home at all; therefore I put1 Pack Dispos Bait Station, Mouse Bait Station 16ref, and pellets underneath my home and in sheds and any place on my property that mice like to make a habitat of.These are by far the easiest wooden traps I've used.  When I bait and set these traps they remain set even when I place them on the floor or underneath the cabinets, they don't snap and scare the bejeepers out of me when I least expect it.  The plastic \"slice\" of cheese is a cute addition and has a designated place for theOZ Mouse Attractant Gel.I haven't caught anything yet and I hope that's a good thing and means that my efforts to keep them out are working.
B000FCGS6I We get mice every winter. We've tried plugging holes, sticking around peppermint and mothballs, and we have mice. We bought these traps, put peanut butter on them. The mice ate the peanut butter, the traps did not spring. They are total junk and we went back to Victor. There was a reason these were the only ones left on the store shelf when went to buy them.Jim said the problem is when it's set the platform is high and it seems that a mouse would have problems setting it off, the trigger is not sensitive.
B000FCGS6I Sometimes you don't need a better mousetrap, you just need a decent, tried and true solution.  These are a very classic design which has proven effective for generations.  Preferably, I would go with live traps coupled with a short car trip to release the mouse onto some other unsuspecting homeowner, but these have already proven their effectiveness.Easy to bait and set, just need to keep them away from kids and cats.  We are actually also keeping one unused for Rube Goldberg contraptions.
B000FCGS6I We usually use these types of traditional snaps traps in our circa 1700s house where there are so many cracks in our dirt basement that there is a neverending supply of mice crawling up inside the walls into the attic.Pros:+ These snaps traps have an adjustable sensitivity setting of F or S (for Firm or Sensitive)+ Inexpensive when bought in bulk.Cons:- Yellow plastic bait panel is just that : a panel for bait. It is not pre-scented with artificial bait scent as some other brands are. But this is not obvious on the packaging itself.- Yellow plastic bait panel makes it easy to clean dead mouse and used bait off for reuse. But at this low price why bother dealing with the yuckiest part of the whole process?- Sensitivity setting is not obvious on the package nor on the website.  It was only by reading another review here that I clued-in on what those markings meant.Overall:I would recommend going for the cheapest snap traps available and buying in bulk for areas with a continuous supply of mouse  activity.  I use this style of class snap trap along with a battery powered zapper for mouse control in our unsecured (mouse-wise) basement and in the attic.  As for bait, peanut butter works well as does bacon grease.
B000FCGS6I We don't get mice in or house often but when we do, these mousetraps really work at getting rid of them.I didn't know until I read on another review that you could set these for FIRM or SENSITIVE release. That's good to know. I tend to bait the trap a couple of times before actually getting the little critters. They are able to steal the peanut butter from the traps without springing them. But I think now I was setting them on FIRM release. Also I think I was putting too much peanut butter on the trap.But I was always able to get the nasty little rodents using these traps.And they are cheap enough that I don't feel bad about throwing trap and mouse carcass away and not re-using the traps. That has a big yuck factor to me.I would have rated this trap five stars if there had been better instructions on the package.
B000FCGS6I These 'Tomcat Wooden Mouse Traps&#34; have the standard mouse trap design and relatively easy to bait (we us chunky peanut butter) and set, but take quite a bit of force to set off. We have seen definite signs that something was getting at the bait but the traps were not set off. These have killed one larger mouse since we set them out, so they do work.CFH
B000FCGS6I These are your basic, reusable mouse traps. Bait with cheese, peanut butter or a mouse attractant and you'll likely catch any mouse that's small enough to be caught. If you have larger rats or a really big field mouse, you might need a larger trap.They are economical because they can be used over and over again. Easy to set and use.
B000FCGS6I My husband is the mousetrap man and has used these traps several times with success.  He uses a bit of peanut butter and yes, it&#8217;s sometimes stolen before any mouse is trapped.  These are a bit fancier than the Victor, but work somewhat similarly.  The trick is in how to set them.  There are directions on the package, but like most people, I think using a mousetrap is intuitive and never bothered to read them.  There are visuals to additionally help the hapless mousetrap person like me.  I&#8217;ll type them out exactly as they appear on the package:Here&#8217;s How to Use:1)  Bait trigger of Trap withTOMCAT Mouse Attractant Gelor peanut butter.2)  Set trap by putting U-shaped bar to opposite end and insert tip of pin into underside of trigger.  Move pin toward &#8220;S&#8221; on trigger, for more sensitive trigger setting.3)  Place against walls where mice travel.My husband claims that these traps are quite sensitive and have often gone off in his hands.  Our &#8220;busiest&#8221; season is in the fall when the field mice decide to make their way into the barn, an outbuilding, or the house.  We don&#8217;t get hoards of them, but enough to really annoy me.One suggestion, for those who get large field mice, chipmunks, or red squirrels in outbuildings, is to attach a wire to the loop at the end of the trap and then tie it down.  We&#8217;ve lost a lot of traps in the barn.  Unsure whose walking off with them, but critters don&#8217;t always leave them behind.  The Tomcat?  They work as expected and are the same quality as the Victor, just a bit fancier.
B000FCGS6I These traps are of the common design as the classic Victor models.  There is an adjustment for sensitivity.  To catch any mice, use a minimum amount of bait on the trigger spot &#8211; I have found peanut butter or smooshed soft cheese to work.  I have not caught any mice yet on these traps since the mice are now living outside the house / garage.  They make their way inside when it starts to get cold in the fall and winter.  The traps do seem to be of average quality with a hard snap.  My tests at triggering the trap showed them to perform similarly to other mouse traps I own.
B000FCGS6I 
B000FCGS6I these traps get mice. You have to set them while they are on the floor or other surface. You also need to place them properly - the mice have routes that they use and you have figure that out. The best bait I have found is peanut butter and a little dab will do it - that stuff is like crack to them. These are great because you can reuse them if you have a mind to, or you can separate the parts and recycle them.
B000FCGS6I if you want to do it the real old fashion way, then this would my mouth trap set is for you.  I used the tom cat attract gel.
B000FCGS6I These work ok. I used to prefer traps because poison leaves you finding a dead mouse somewhere. With traps you know exactly where they'll be.But I just don't find these traps to be any where near as effective as the TomCat mouse killer poisons. Even on the sensitive setting I didn't catch mice very well. Once the trap was tripped and there was no mouse.These are very easy to set and use.
B000FCGS6I I've used these for years...successfully. Living by a forest mice are going to attempt to get into the garage and house in the fall. This is the best method of stopping them I have found and used for ages. Honest. This is not my first set of traps. They tend to last for 3 to 4 years.Mice can be caught with no bait attached to the yellow-orange Swiss cheese looking bait holder. Instructions suggest an attractant get or peanut butter. The photo shows a chunk of cheese. My mother-in-law taught me to use thread and tie on a raisin which was then swabbed with peanut butter. This trap need little of the. However a raisin can be tucked onto a spear point on the bait plate. A small dab of peanut butter is good on the bottom side, making it attractive but hard for the mouse to get to without consequences. If we spot a mouse, or signs of one visiting, I set a trap and have results usually within 24 to 48 hours.Like I said, I've caught mice with nothing added. I can't explain it, but it works. And if it works, why change. Except to get a new pack every 3 years whether they are worn out or not.It may look old-fashioned, but it works.
B000FCGS6I We have tried a lot of different mouse traps over the years including the electric kind. I prefer these as they are cheap enough to throw away when let's say a mouse decomposes on it because we didn't check a shed for a month. I like I can see if I caught a mouse from a distance without touching the trap. I like they kill quickly most of the time, I don't want rodents but I don't want to be cruel either.  We recently used the gel bait which worked great, caught a mouse on the gel sitting next to a trap with peanut butter on it. We always get mice in from the cornfield across the street in the fall, prefer to kill them before they breed more.
B000FCGS6I These are your basic wooden mouse traps and they work very well.  One was kind of hard to set but the others were no problem. I just set them normally and used peanut butter on them like my other traps.  I just spread some on the bottom of the little piece of plastic cheese that is the activator button.  It makes it a little harder for the mice to just take the bait and get away.  The worked great and caught a mouse already.  Will use again.  Just keep out of where kids are as they might set the traps off easily and get their fingers smashed.
B000FCGS6I They're just like every other wooden mouse trap you've ever seen or set (except maybe the kind with a metal pedal). Several brands distribute these traps, and they work just fine. I tend to prefer mechanical traps over poisons, since there's less chance of something or someone accidentally getting poisoned. The risk then becomes keeping them out of the reach of pets and kids, but I don't find this too difficult.I have caught mice with these traps.One thing to mention: if you look at hardware stores locally, you'll probably find an identical trap much more inexpensively (the last ones I purchased locally were on sale: two traps for a buck). Shipping them from an internet vendor necessarily increases the cost of these lightweight items.
B000FCGS6I I had the chance to try these out. I have had a number of traps lately and comparing them all together these are one of my favorites. i like the simplicty of the old fashioned trap with the spring bar. There is little room to fail, it either works or it doesn't. Other traps I've tried include some that spin, some that are reusable and don't kill the critter, and still others that caught the mouse from the top in a weird way that never really worked right.These traps are simple, they are NOT as sensitive as some of the other basic traps but they are still sensitive enough. If you put loose bait on the trap you might not get your critter. I would recommend putting peanut butter as others have suggested as it will &#34;stick&#34; to the trap and require a little more movement of the trap plate to get it to trigger.These traps work, they are cheaper and reusable then the fancy &#34;spin&#34; style traps and frankly these are all you need. I have them set out around the garage.
B000FCGS6I Can't find anything about these to complain about. I use these in my garage with peanut butter and have been very successful with trapping mice.
B000FCGS6I These are pretty standard mouse traps. They set up just like any of the traditional traps where you put bait on a platform (in this case, the yellow piece which resembles cheese) pull back the u-shaped bar, use a cross piece to set it. I tested these with a pencil to see how sensitive the trap was and it seemed to trigger just fine, though it did take a little more jostling than I think a typical mouse might make.I didn't actually order these to catch mice though; my purpose was a pinterest project wherein you remove the piece where you place the bait as well as the cross bar that sets the trap. The remaining piece then becomes something like a giant clip. You paint the wooden base and use it as a clip where you can hang papers. I will be using these in my classroom, and for my project, they filled my needs perfectly.
B000FCGS6I These traps aren't popular with the squeamish, however, sometimes tried and true is the best choice. We've all seen traps like this before, so not much needs to be elaborated; they haven't changed much in 50 years at least. Just put a little peanut butter on the yellow part, pull back the spring arm, carefully latch it, and then pull your fingers away gingerly, lest it go snap, and you go ouch! With all the newfangled traps out there, these always catch way more than any of them. If you got a mouse problem, this kind of trap will do the best job. Cheap too. Use it once and toss it.
B000FCGS6I This is your typical wooden mouse trap.  Bait the trap on the plastic bait tray (using cheese, peanut butter or the Tomcat attractant gel), spring load the metal bar and set it in place.  More than strong enough to kill the mice and loud enough that you will know when the trap has been tripped.  Great for homes where only traditional traps can be used.
B000FCGS6I I'm surprised by the number of negative reviews for this trap. Maybe our mice are less hefty than others (we live near woods and they seem to come in the garage and/or house even when they are still tiny). Maybe we've just been lucky. But we've used these traps for years so I was delighted to be able to get more of them.Just as advertised by the manufacturer, we've found these easy to use. They do the job. I did have to find the courage to use snap traps in the first place but the ones that catch mice alive don't seem to reduce the mouse population. I'm convinced they come right back and I'm not comfortable with that.One tip: if you're going to use traps, be sure to inspect the exterior of your home for any obvious openings that could allow access to your home. Even a small hole is enough for a mouse to get into a house. We plug ours with steel wool (recommended by pest control services). It has helped a great deal.
B000FCGS6I It was the end of the school year and even though there were probably mice in our garage, we had a greater need; the mouse trap car experiment for honors science. To be the best you have to have the best trap. And this one does not disappoint. The spring action is fast and powerful and, combined with a great design, allows for a long coast down the hallway.The build of the trap is just right in that it can be dissected (the trap not the mouse...) to modify it for tension, release and appearance.The pack of four allows for some test models and a double set for dual action rebound.If you are practicing to set the trap, they are easy to trigger so be careful to keep your fingers out of the way. We have actually had good results with Tomcat in the past - for their intended use - which is sad to say that not only do we have mice, but we've had some bite the dust in our Tomcat traps. The nice thing is for this price, you can just toss the trap and the mouse in the 'stairway to mouse heaven' trash.
B000FCGS6I I live in an old house with woods close by and we have always got mice from time to time.  These always work great for us.First we check to see if there's anyplace they are getting in - we had a problem with a hole around the stove outlet- if you've got something like that, fill it with the spray foam if you can - that really helped us.Then, put the traps out close to where you think they are getting in, or close to where you see them- they tend to like to run along the baseboard or in the corners we notice.  Put out MULTIPLE traps along their route.We use peanut butter on ours.  We smear it on the little yellow thing.  Go to bed- or in another room and turn off the lights- listen for the SNAP. They are cheap enough to throw the WHOLE thing away.Usually they kill the mouse dead.  We have had one occasionally NOT kill the mouse.  We take it outside and it it with a bat so it dies immediately.  That's the only bad thing about these traps - if they don't kill the mouse, it can suffer.  They usually do kill it right off though.You can't beat a good cat that's a good mouser- that's the only thing I know that's been better than these traps.  Bait works pretty good too- if you aren't concerned with other animals or kids getting into it.  I had one of those expensive $90 electric traps but it didn't work well at all.If these don't work for you - try smearing the yellow with peanut butter- smear it so they can't get a chunk off and run.
B000FCGS6I Just like the classic traps, it takes a bit of strength to set.  Just be certain to keep fingers away from the strike end of the board and tension the trap bar  while holding firmly. Lay the trigger bar over the top and flip the trap inverted to let the platform cover the end of the trigger bar.  Keep out of reach of children and small pets.  Use a minimal amount of peanut butter, don't overdo it
B000FCGS6I These are sturdy, fully functioning traps.  Reliable should you require such pest control.After 21 years, my calico has &#34;retired&#34; from mousing, so this (and calling someone else to empty them) is the just-in-case back up plan.
B000FCGS6I The basic design of the mousetrap has not changed in over 100 years, but there have been some minor improvements. They are less likely to catch your finger instead of the mouse. One thing I especially like about these is the trigger, it is larger than most. So the mouse is more likely to set off the trap. The plastic actually smells like cheese, so you can put it out without bait ans still catch a mouse. Personally, I use peanut butter with a touch of bird seed to bait my traps. And from past use of Tomcat mousetraps, I can tell you they still work when you go months between mice and have fewer to none false alarms of the trap just failing.
B000FCGS6I These are the typical old school wooden mouse traps.  They are very responsive and snap quickly.  We set them with some peanut butter, the peanut butter was gone and the trap was snapped, but with no mouse in it.  The second time it snapped with a mouse in it, which is good. Overall, it's not any better or worse than the other wooden mouse traps.
B000FCGS6I So far, I appear to have only one mouse and I thought getting these traps through Vine would solve the problem.  It hasn't yet using sll four for more than a week.  I practically expect a thank you note from the mouse for setting the bait out every night.  Since I got these for free through Vine, I do wish I could give a better review.
B000FCGS6I Living on a farm, I've tried a lot of different mouse traps.  And quite frankly, the classic wooden mouse trap is the most humane, quick way to handle mice.  They are a bit intimidating setting them and worrying about snapping your fingers; but if you can ignore the fact that you have a steel trap about to snap your fingers off while you are setting it... then I definitely recommend them!The &#34;cheese&#34; part attracts mice on it's own but it works much, much better if you put a little dab of peanut butter near the little &#34;square&#34; on the cheese base.If you haven't used a wooden trap, definitely try it out because you won't catch nearly as many mice with any other type of trap!
B000FCGS6I I have used these for years and never caught a mouse with one, particularly when using the Tomcat attractant.  What they do well for me is scare our cats.  We remove one of the 2 springs to avoid injury to our little friends, then place them all over the kitchen counters and stove in the evening to teach the younger cats that those are scary places.  It rarely takes more than 2 incidents to drive the lesson home.  Find a better use for a mousetrap and the world will........
B000FCGS6I The traps are a little easier to set than other brands as the metal bar can lock on the plastic cheese part, which has a lot more room to latch onto.  How effective they are depends a little on luck and how smart the mice you have are.  One mouse got away from a trap I set, but I reset it and am hopeful that I can still catch it.
B000FCGS6I I live near a river and some woods as a result mice and other wildlife are abundant. Mice will often make it to my outdoor shed, my garage and my basement. My shed has also been home to larger rodents..This trap has a plastic bait trigger on which it  is easy to place peanut butter or mouse attractant gel made by Tomcat. The trap is easy to set and did not snap when I placed it on the ground. I caught a mouse with the trap.
B000FCGS6I I already have the Motomco 22310 Tomcat Tier 1 Disposable Bait Station which I use in my house but these are very useful for areas like your garage or outbuilding where you want a simple trap and where kids are going to tamper with them.  You just put something like peanut butter on them and set it to F for firm and wait.I didn't catch anything in my garage and no sign of anything getting the bait but bingo and I caught 2 in an outbuilding so far so these certainly work and are simple to use.  Only problem I have noticed a few times bait disappearing and no catch so maybe not the best traps but still effective eno
B000FCGS6I I am very impressed with these mouse traps when compared to another well known brand. These traps are very easy to bait and to make the bait stay in place. The traps have two trigger settings, if you look closely at the yellow plastic near where you set the little bar, you'll see an F on the left side and an S on the right. Those stand for Firm or Sensitive release, and depending on which side you choose for setting the trap, you'll either have it trip with very light pressure or with moderate pressure.When these traps snap, the mouse is dead. They snap with enough force to break the neck and kill the mouse instantly. The wide bait platform ensures that the mouse will more times than not, trip the trap when trying to get the bait.
B000FCGS6I I have an enormous old house, live in the country, and have 4 chicken coops nearby -- we get mice. The last 3 years we've been getting kangaroo mice, which seem to be somewhat more skilled at unbaiting traps without triggering them.One wretched mouse (I understand they are territorial, so I'm guessing this guy has been running the gamut of 2-3 rooms) has outsmarted the 3-way plastic trap, the live trap (more on this unit in another review) and my old wooden victors.These were very easy to set, even on the sensitive setting, and did not snap and scare the crap out of me -- like the victors did EVERY SINGLE TIME.Last week I set out all 4 of these, 2 of the plastic three-ways and 2 of the old victors. Yes, 8 traps across 3 rooms. The next morning 3 of these were licked clean but not triggered (note:  I set them on the most sensitive setting) the two victors were licked clean and neither of the three-ways were touched.I was bummed, too bummed to clear out the traps so I left them. The next morning the trap that had already been licked had been hit again-- this time I got him. I'm not sure what that was about. The next morning the 4th trap, which still had bait, had another mouse (so much for big territories for each mouse).So, what I've decided that I will buy these instead of more victors. These set much easier and seem to work better -- even when the peanut butter has been licked off.
B000FCGS6I This trap is dangerous....and not only for mice!It's a slightly better design than the all wood and wire cheapies that spring either when you look at them, or not at all.It's easy to smear peanut butter on the plastic 'cheese' holes, but be careful setting the trap. Right now my middle finger has a blood blister from getting caught as it snapped while getting the stabilizing bar in the right position.I'm not complaining too much, however, as it shows that it snaps with enough force to kill quick and clean. Probably more humane than poison.
B000FCGS6I These traps have not changed much in centuries of use. They work every time and can be reused if you are so inclined. My favorite part is setting them and the angst that comes with knowing that if you screw it up you will get snapped. It's all part of the sport. To be fair, I think you have to place yourself at some kind of risk, be it ever so slight.
B000FHAJ90 These are horrible. The soil clogs the bottom on the bulb so the water can't come out. Look cute, but they don't work
B000FHAJ90 I love how pretty these bulbs are, but they are also quite useful.  I have four of them, two for indoor plants and two for outdoor plants that are in an awkward, hard to water spot in my garden.  They seem to keep the plants adequately watered, sometimes for up to two weeks depending on weather conditions.  My one complaint is that it is really hard for me to trickle water in to fill them up.  If the hose is on too heavy water just splashes and doesn't fill the bulb.  I've also tried dunking them in a bucket of water to fill, but this is slow to fill also, I think just due to the narrow aperture of the stem.  Overall I'm very happy with these and intend to get more.
B000FHAJ90 This is a great buy for a 2 pack.  The globes are gorgeous and they have that imperfect shapes that show that they are hand made.  These are pretty simple and the physics are even simpler.  You add water to the globe stick the spout in the water and as the dirt (after soaking it) and as the dirt dries it sucks the water in from the globe and keeps the soil moist.  They seem to work pretty good and if you water the area with a sprinkler the globes go even further.  When i put it in the soil did get in the pipe, but since it is soil it will pull the water and still work.  I have not had any issue and these are a gorgeous addition to my flower pots.I will note that you need to put the spout away from the edge of the pot or the water will run out quickly, I find around 1.5 to 2 inches in seems to work pretty good!
B000FHAJ90 These are very pretty blue globes with fragile stems small enough to service small pots where there isn't much space between the root system and the inner edge of the pot, and sunlight shining through the blue globes is striking.  However, they need to be completely removed from the soil to refill and each time they are reinserted, dirt easily clogs the stem.  There are a several other drawbacks: it isn't easy to see the water level because of the darkness of the glass, the small opening of the stem makes refilling the globe a tedious process and, if your plant growth covers the pot's soil, it can be tricky getting the stem placed back into its previous hole.  Be aware that the weight of the full Aqua globe can tip a small pot.  For pots larger than 6\", I much prefer the Plant Nanny where the stem remains in the soil and only the globe is refilled.  The Plant Nanny globe is clear, sturdy glass, and the water level can be easily seen even from a distance.  The stem and the globe of the Plant Nanny are considerably larger than the Aqua Globe, so buy the Aqua Globes for plants in your 6\" or smaller pots that won't easily tip over and I think you will be happy enough.  For pots larger than 6\", I much prefer the Plant Nanny.
B000FHAJ90 I got a set of these and I love them. I use them on 2 indoor plants, and am considering ordering a set for the office. I have quite a lot of plants, and I do have a tendency to give some of them too much love and overwater. These seem to have fixed the problem - I fill them, then don't have to worry about watering those plants at all until the globe is empty. I found that for my 2 plants (in smallish pots - probably 6in diameter or so, one pothos and one arrowhead vine), the globe lasts about 2 weeks. Plants are very happy - not too dry or too wet.Tip - when you go to refill, sometimes there is dirt stuck in the tip of the tube that just won't shake out, stopping you from filling it. Poke out the dirt with a paperclip or old cake tester and you're fine. Also it takes less time to fill if you do have the water on verrrrry slowly so it doesn't overkill the small tube.Seems the consensus on colors from where I've seen them is that they are both mostly blue, but one has just white specks and the other has multicolor specks (both very pretty).Note - I don't know that I'd use these outside. I don't think they're large enough to water an outdoor plant effectively in the heat, and I'd worry about the sun pinpointing through the glass and overheating in a magnifying glass effect (I'm probably just paranoid! The glass isn't smooth, so it's pro be ok - or use in a shady spot).
B000FHAJ90 I am a \"brown thumb\" and I killed an African Violets plant which somebody gave me as a gift. The problem is that I watered it too much. I really liked those violets, so I bought another plant. A friend of mine suggested to buy these Aqua Globes. I was a bit skeptical about this product, but I decided to try it out anyway. I know that many people use these Aqua Globes to keep their plants watered while they are gone from home for a few days. My purpose for using these watering bulbs was to have my plants watered the right way: not too much and not too little. This product did the trick for me. It keeps my plant watered just the right way. I can see when there's no more water in the bulb and then I fill it up again. The water lasts a few days. There's always a bit of soil at the end of the tube when you pull it out, but it is very easy to just rinse out the soil before you fill up the globe. My African Violets also love these watering bulbs and they look great. I received orange globes which I am not too crazy about (orange is not my favorite color), but I forgive the orange because this thing does a good job for me. These Aqua Globes are not only useful, but they are also decorative.  I am glad that I gave this product a try.
B000FHAJ90 Aqua Globes are one of those myriad \"as seen on TV\" products that promise to change your life. Mrs. Spudman picked up a box  along with the equally promising \"Smooth Away\" miracle that is also \"seen on TV.\"In the box were two Aqua Globes, each made of hand-blown glass, and even this skeptical Spudman must admit are somewhat attractive and stylish. The globes are about 11 inches long and far too fragile to put into the hands of your pet gorilla or chimpanzee.The long thin tips are \"cut\" at an angle at the ends to help with ease of filling and inserting into potting soil.When we bought our present home, we inherited a potted palm tree that's' close to five feet tall now. It showed signs of stress after being transplanted into a larger pot, so Mrs. Spudman chose it as a candidate for the Aqua Globes.After several weeks, I noticed that the Aqua Globes were still full of water and brought it to the attention of the Globe master. She pulled out the devices, cleaned compacted dirt from the ends, and reinserted them at a different angle and depth. This seemed to do the trick because the globes needed refilling about a week hence. One site I browsed suggesting putting a piece of screen around the tip of the Aqua Globe to prevent dirt clogs.Filling the globes is time consuming and tedious because one has to use a gentle, thin flow from the spigot. Mrs. Spudman started using a small funnel for filling and seems to be happier with this procedure.Before inserting the globes into the soil, one is advised to predrill a hole using a stick, dowel, chopstick, or screwdriver. An electric drill makes a big mess with flying dirt and is not recommended for making the preparatory hole. If you don't make an insertion hole first, you might break the globe's delicate neck or clog the end with soil, neither of which is desirable.It took some trial and error for Mrs. Spudman to determine just the right angle and depth for her Aqua Globes. They seem to be working as promised at the moment, and the palm tree test subject seems healthy and happy.Finally -Mrs. Spudman is relatively happy with her Aqua Globes though not particularly enthusiastic about them. We both agree that they are an attractive novelty.To ensure that a cherished plant is getting water while you're away on vacation, these Aqua Globes may not be a bad option. If you have many cherished plants, this option could become expensive.Mrs.Spudman sort of likes her Aqua Globes. I think they are silly and unnecessary gimmicks of dubious value that at least don't harm plants. Watering plants is not that much work and isn't all that time consuming. If you resent the time and effort spent watering houseplants, then maybe you shouldn't have any. Most importantly the use of Aqua Globes deprives the plants of personal contact with their caretaker(s) , quality time shared, and the all important bonding experience.Thus I give them a lukewarm recommendation.
B000FHAJ90 These were a waste of money. They clog up with dirt and don't work like they claim to. I wouldn't suggest them
B000FI2VHM We've been lucky with the herbs, so far. They grow well and we grow enough of them to have all the herbs we want, when we need them. We find it difficult to grow tomatoes and impossible to grow them in any significant quantities. Everything else is in-between. We never tried flowers but we might this coming summer because we have a real outdoors garden that produces everything we need during the summer months.So, go with the herbs, young or post-young woman or man :)The basils are fantastic and we got good oregano and arugula too.
B000FI2VHM Dont waste your money on on this. Use rock wool instead. I called the company asking what kinds foam is in their kits and they wouldn't tell me they described it as bio degradable special foam - so I called a couple of foam companies asking questions and experimented a bit. What worked best for me and is drastically cheaper is rock wool instead.
B000FI2VHM Well, this is the kit I tried first, and the back row of plants & center front are doing the best.  Both basils shoot right out of their pods.  The Dill and Cilantro are growing tall, and there is lots of mint, but it is tiny.  The chives are looped back into the sponge & have yet to try to stand up straight, and the Oregano is sprouting within the sponge, but has yet to come out of hiding.  And this is at the beginning of week 2.  I believe I could probably harvest a little basil at the end of week 3.The big question is, where is the Parsley?  People have suggested they substitute Parsley for Oregano.  I'd rather they replace the Red Rubin basil.  I have recipes with oregano, but none specifically calling for purple basil.  However, I never tasted the stuff, so I may change my mind once I do.  Hopefully they included it becase of taste and not for looks.This is an easy, low maintenence kit.  You only have to refil the water bowl when the water gets low & add 2 nutrient tablets every 2 weeks.  It comes with 2 starter nutrients, 2 sprouting nutrients & 12 regular nutrient tablets  They ask you to place the pods in the order they came in the box.  Possibly because of slightly variable light levels.  The light is on 17 hours and it only waters when the light is on for this setting.Parsley will be part of both the Italian & French herb kits that will be available in September.
B000FI2VHM So far, I've grown lettuce and gourmet herbs in the Aerogarden. The herbs had one failure (the cilantro) and the lettuce grew like gangbusters but didn't seem worth the trouble. Then I planted the French herb garden, wanting to have chervil and savory, among other herbs not commonly available at the grocery.The kit has chervil, sorrel, savory, parsley, Marseilles basil, sage and chives. All of these are quite useful. I might have substituted thyme for the parsley--parsley grows pretty slowly and I think it is a waste in the Aerogarden as it's commonly available in huge bunches at the market. But it is convenient to have this essential herb at your fingertips. Sad to say, one can't have rosemary or tarragon in the Aerogarden. Both of these are woody herbs and don't really grow from seeds. But one can often find pots in the garden center. Maybe with an additional grow-light, I can add them to the kitchen garden. I wonder if the Aerogarden pods could someday be adapted to grow slips of plants like tarragon (shipped live.)All the pods germinated before the estimated time, including chervil which has the longest (3 week) germination. The herbs are growing healthily and quickly. So far, this looks to be the most versatile of the sets I've grown. My previous herb garden resides in a flower pot and is more or less humming along--the basils and mint and chives are doing quite well in soil rather than hydroponics, though they were sulky when transplanted. I may keep this French garden growing indefinitely unless something more interesting crops up.
B000FI2VHM Today is June 29th and I began this adventure on March 1st, 4 months ago and the production expectancy for this set.  The sprouting was slow, but the CS Rep from AeroGrow suggested I be patient.  He said they would really take off once they sprouted.  Well, they did and we were off to the races.  So far, 1 mini jalapeno and 1 purple super hot have bit the dust completely.  The second mini jalapeno grew huge but never produced a single pepper.  Two of the purple super hots are still alive, but have never even produced a flower either.  Both of the red fires are lush and have produced a total of 10 peppers so far.  Considering the cost of electricity, the kit, the extra nutrients which needed to be purchased because there are not enough included, the replacement light kit, and the hours upon hours of talking to, touching, fertilizing by movement and a tiny hand held fan (CSR's suggestion) These are the most expensive peppers I've ever consumed.  I'm thinking of transplanting these into my garden plot to see if they ever produce.  I have one more seed kit (herbs) which I'm going to give a try and then I'm going to give up on this, and I'm not going to buy another set of bulbs even though it's advised.  If you want alot of leaves which you do not consume, then this is the seed kit for you.  I, on the other hand, wanted something to use in the kitchen.
B000FI2VHM This so much fun.  Plant and watch it grow.  And, grow it does.  I just wish I could afford a couple of dozen of these.  AeroGarden should just send them to me for the advertisement.
B000FI2VHM The seeds sprouted within 3 days just like it said and within a week tripled in size. Arugula is one of my favorite salad greens but I always have a tough time keeping them alive in my outdoor garden. So far it looks like the plants are going to thrive in the Aerogarden!
B000FI2VHM We've had an Aerogarden for two years now and love it.  This is the first time we have gotten the Japanese Herb Kit and it has some problems:  the Red Shiso, Green Shiso and Nira Chives did not germinate at all.  We e-mailed Aerogrow customer service department and they are sending us a new Japanese Herb Kit free of charge.  We've used the herbs that did germinate:  Chrysanthemum, Mitsuba and Cress in salads and on sandwiches.  The flavors of these herbs is interesting, but we are really looking forward to using the Red and Green Shiso, which are more widely used in Japanese food.
B000FI4O8Q Updated 7/24/2013------------------------Herbs are doing okay in this so far, they all sprouted. However they claim there is a sensor in this that detects if the water level is low. This is not true, it's on a timer. I found the water level low multiple times without it warning me. When the system did alert me of low water the tank was already filled. This tells me it's on a timer because it blinked at the same time the nutrient timer blinked. Also, adding nutrients as soon as it tells you to is not really needed. If you have a PPM meter you can see that it tells you to add to it way before it's needed.These \"alerts\" are just something special to remind you. They serve no other purpose other than to blink every 2 weeks or so, even when not needed.  The \"grow\" setting don't really change anything either, they just seem to be there for looks.You're pretty much overpaying for a light, small air pump, and a tank. You can build this for about $30 if you don't want all the electronic stuff.I suggest investing in a PPM meter and you judge when it's needed, I suggest also investing in a PH kit to control the waters PH level.  A PH level of 6 would produce best for these herbs.Also the PPM is best at 560 (for start) and around 1000 for mature.So like I said, it's best if you do it your own way and not when the timer says so.The AeroGarden Ultra comes out with a retail price of about $250 this fall. The ultra seems to be more worth the price, but cannot truly say without testing it.If you think it would be too hard to make your own then this may be the way to go. In the end you're going to ask yourself \"Was this really worth it?\".To sum it up; it's great for people that don't know much about gardening. But for those of you that know more about hydroponics, etc.. then you will see how this system can be a ripoff.You should know that all my herbs are bending over towards the light, having more light near the AeroGarden might prevent this. Please consider that before buying if that is an issue for you.----------------------------------------------------------I purchased this AeroGarden 7, but the product itself it labeled as AeroGarden 6. I felt ripped off so I contacted Amazon and they couldn't replace it. They offered $20 credit, so I accepted it. Still feeling ripped off I contact AeroGarden about the issue and they were very helpful with the issue.The product IS the AeroGarden 7, it was just mislabeled. The newest version of the AeroGarden has no pump, it's aerated only. Which is what mine came as.So if you purchase this make sure it has an air stone only and no pump. It may come labeled as the 6, but it's actually the 7.The instruction manual is for the old version, so it's useless. I will break it down for you.Step 1: Place base on table.Step 2: Place That long thing (light holder) in the back on the base. The buttons face away from you.Step 3: Place both lights inside the holes on the top part. DO NOT TWIST. You need to give it a little pressure to get it in. Do not touch the bulb!Step 4: Place the light on the light holder. For me I couldn't get it to go all the way down. Seems to be a design issue, but seems secure still.Step 5: Place the water inside the AeroGarden. Do NOT use well water, or softened water. RO water is the best. You can get a gallon of Deer Park spring water at ShopRite for $1.00.Step 6: Add in the nutrients (shake first), you can use theirs or you can use your own hydroponic nutrients. I suggest using theirs unless you know what you're doing.Step 7: Plugin and set to whatever you're growing.Now all you do is wait until it tells you to do something, in about a week or two.
B000FI4O8Q These things grow like crazy.  I planted my gardens (one gourmet herbs, one holiday herbs) three months ago and I have trouble keeping up with the amount of growth.  I use a lot of parsley and thyme so I'm delighted there is so much, but the excess of some of the others is going to the freezer. . . more chervil than I've ever seen.  The plants are healthy and clean with no bugs like outside gardens.  What a blessing.Yes, the lights are the very white daylight bulbs, but in my den, it adds nice lighting where I wouldn't otherwise have any and I rarely use the overhead light anymore so the electricity is a wash for me.  The pump in one garden made noise at first, but I read the FAQs on the website, which said it was likely that nutrients had gotten into the pump.  I jiggled the pump a bit and the problem went away.  Since then I put the nutrients at the front of the water well and have had no further problems.  Some people complain about the dripping sound but if you keep the water level up you don't hear it.I tried for years to grow fresh herbs indoors during the winter and was never really successful until now.  The units are very easy to care for and you can't beat the prolific harvest.  Now, if only they'd let me choose the individual herbs to grow instead of offering just the combination sets.  I may have to try planting my own seeds as they have kits that allow you to do that.  I'm looking forward to free salads all summer when it comes time to replant. Great product.
B000FI4O8Q This device waters your plants and turns the lights on and off based on the setting.  Add the nutrient plan and you have some of the fastest growing plants out there.  It comes with a seed kit, but I couldn't tell which one is included.  Probably Salad (the fastest growing, 3-4 weeks!) or Gormet Herbs (the most popular).  Here are some of the specs:It takes a standard plug, instead of a 3 prong, so it can plug in anywhere instead of just the kitchen.  The bowl holds 14 cups of water.  That's one pint shy of a gallon.  The light goes on for 15 1/2 hours to 17 hours depending on the plant, and the water goes over the roots & sponge for the lights on time or longer for thirsty plants.  You have to hand polinate (a rapid 10 second wave in each plant) the tomatoes & peppers every other day when flowering, and the Peppers & International basil require you wash out the bowls every 4 weeks, but otherwise there is very little maintenance.  The light comes on when the water is low and another light comes on when the 2 weeks are up and the plants need more nutrients, but other than that you can pretty much forget it.  The lights also work to help my potted plants grow when near it.  The plants like human comfortable temperatures (61-80 F) but the peppers & tomatoes will produce more fruit if safely over 70.The nutrients are different for each plant (I have a breakdown on my dinubabear site) and come in 2 to 4 sets in a kit (Starting, sprouting, normal & fruiting).  You give 2 nutrient tablets every 2 weeks.Aerogrow guarentees their kits to sprout as described, or you can call them & they will replace their kits.New kits will be available in September, such as French, Italian & Japanese herbs.
B000FI4O8Q If, like me, you have little outdoor space and/or lack a green thumb (me too!) you'll be delighted with the AeroGarden. It's more or less fool proof in that you supply water and nutrients when the light flashes on the front. The newer units are very quiet so they're perfect for a kitchen or office and yield maybe $100 of herbs over the course of a harvest. The lights operate on a timer so it really is very simple to operate.Here are a few kinks and quirks:- The life-cycle could last much longer if they gave you more nutrient. While I understand the desire to sell more pods, it's somewhat wasteful to kill the plants just because there's no more feed left.- Some of the seed kits are bland - out of 7 pods, one I ordered had three different types of basil. I like basil but not that much basil! Others have a better variety so definitely check before ordering.- Spiders and bugs do like attacking the plant and I haven't found much information on what to do about this. I had a million little spiders living in the thing during the final harvest so had to dump the crop.- Pods are not foolproof - some simply do not grow. To the manufacturer's credit, they'll replace any that don't germinate so don't forget to contact them if this happens to you.Still it's a good system and I can only believe it will get better with subsequent iterations. If I could buy the pods for half the price or get the nutrient in bulk, it would be perfect, especially given the inflated price of herbs in supermarkets.
B000FI4O8Q So this is my family's second AeroGarden.  When it comes to easy, compact fresh veggies and herbs - you can't beat it.  We planted the salad greens kit on Christmas and they were all sprouted and growing quickly within a week or so.  The setup is fairly easy - take the parts out of the box and snap them together as directed by the incredibly simple and picture-filled instructions.  Plug it in, fill it with water, select whatever you're growing, and off it goes.  The light will cycle on and off based on the veggie you selected and the display will let you know if you're low on water and when it's time to add nutrients.The downside - 1: this thing is noisy.  The bubbler runs constantly and some times it gets into some weird harmonic rythem where it really starts to make a weird racket that sounds like a dog yelping or kids yelling outside.  Even when it's not doing that, it's loud enough to be noticable.  Don't think of installing this in an office or near a bedroom.  2: Setting when the light is on / off isn't the most intuitive.  Chances are you'll set it up some time during the day, and it will begin its cycle then.  That means the light is on all night and then off some time in the morning / early afternoon.  You can reset the timer to turn on or off at a specific time, but you need to be at the garden at that time and perform a series of button pushes to get it set.  Mabe a cheap light sensor with the unit would allow it to know when it's night time and set some sort of light cycle based off that.If you want fresh herbs, salad greens, peppers, or tomatoes during the winter or some place where having a garden is difficult or impossible, then this product will do you quite well.  Noting that it's a little noisy and takes some time to get the lighting set up right, it should work great for you in the long run.
B000FI4O8Q We love this product.  It actually works and is a lot of fun for the kids to watch as you from seedling to useable herbs strawberries, and tomatoes.  It's very easy to use and is low maintenance.  A few things you need to know, however:- It does make a bit of noise... not too bad, but it sounds like a mini-pump.- The grow lights are VERY bright and need to be on about 17 hours per day, so don't expect to put this in a bedroom or other room where a bright light at night will be a problem.  I do have it on the bedroom, and it serves as a wake-up light at 5 AM every morning.  You only get 7 hours of off-time with the light!- I need to see how much electricity it uses...  Between the two bright lights and the pumps, it isn't the most sustainable approach to gardening.- You have to buy mini pods to use this indoor garden, and they are expensive.  You can either buy pods with seeds in them, or you buy blank pods and supply your own seeds.A nice product, but we need to find a place where the lights aren't overwhelming in the evening and at night!
B000FI4O8Q This is an attractive, almost decorative piece in the kitchen.  Love to see the little plants grow.  Some I will transplant to the outside in time.  But, Houston is too hot most of the year for salad greens, cilantro, dill and the like so these will stay indoors.
B000FI4O8Q I bought my Aerogrow garden last February (2007) and have had three long lasting crops since then:  Italian herbs, French herbs and International Basil.  The whole family has enjoyed the process and it has been great to be able to just snip herbs when neeeded.  I've had one major problem -- my pump stopped working after I put in my latest crop (Salsa Garden).  I called Aerogrow Customer Service and they took me through the steps to try to correct the problem and when none of them worked, they sent me a brand new pump free of charge and a replacement Salsa Garden Kit free of charge. MARCH 1, 20009 -- My Aerogarden is still one of my favorite purchases and the Customer Service is still wonderful.  A couple of seed pods from my latest kit did not germinate; one call to Aerogrow and they are sending me a brand new kit, free of charge.
B000FJTV42 This is a great bird feeder. The birds are loving it. It's very easy to fill and hang. I'd recommend it to hang in any tree. The cardinals are already eating from it
B000FJTV42 This is one of the worst bird feeders I've ever bought.  It allows the birds to waste seed and the top doesn't stay seated.
B000FJTV42 But, the next morning it was empty.All the seeds were scattered all over the place.Now I have weeds galore.
B000FJTV42 This unit serves a purpose but has just one flaw.  While I am watching the birds feed it seems that they have a difficult time perching because the landing perch is a little too small.  At the moment they are young birds and as they grow it will become harder for them to land.  Making an extension might help.
B000FJTV42 I have two of these and the birds love it as much as I do, they are easy to fill and you can see when they get low to put more food in the feeder.
B000FJTV42 This is a pretty chintzy product.  First it arrived in pieces due to poor packaging.  The windows are flimsy plastic that do not fit all that well as two of them came out during shipping.  Easily put back in place however they all rattle.  The feeding wells are not well designed.  This was $20 and it is perhaps worth $10.  You need to look for something better and/or less expensive as this one is not a very good value.
B000FJVRAS What can you really say. My last one of these lasted three years which is about normal thus happy with thepurchase and it was less than at the local retailer
B000FJVRAS The last dispenser we purchased had come from a local \"big box\" hardware chain, and that one fell apart in a year. This new unit from Kem-Tek seems to be made of much thicker plastic. Hopefully it is well treated for UV and chlorine resistance as well. We've been using it for several months, and so far it is holding up perfectly.
B000FJVRAS a little thinner than I expected, but suits the purpose.  It is large enough to hold the large 3&#34; tablets and floats good.  Good value for the money.
B000FJVRAS Its a bit big for my small pool, however it floats around and dispenses my chlorine. It works great, I have no complaints.
B000FJVRAS Nice dispenser. It will hold up to four 3\" chlorine tablets. I did come across one problem though. Letting it float free throughout the pool allowed it to get stuck in the opening of the skimmer. This caused a decrease of water getting to the pump. Now this would eventually cause your pump to overheat. So I have to keep it teathered to the ladder and let it float free when the pump is off. I seem to have done better just putting a couple tablets directly in the skimmer. But all in all it does what it suppose to.
B000FJX67U My husband just loves this sprinkler head.  Works great, good distance and covers the area well.  This is the second one he has purchased.
B000FJX67U I took a chance that the interface of this sprinkler head was compatible with my Scarecrow. The original sprinkler head that was supplied with the Scarecrow (and came apart after several years of use), had a little different sealing method than the Rain Bird, but the Scarecrow's mounting port appeared to be universal, so I ordered the Rain Bird. It works, in fact, it's adjustments make it so much more versatile than the original that it adds to the effectiveness of the Scarecrow.
B000FJX67U I purchased one of these plastic rain birds about a year ago and was very pleased. It does actually work better than the brass rain birds. So now I wanted to order some more and was pleased to see the price had dropped by a couple of bucks. So I ordered 4 more but low and behold these are not the same and of course not as good. My well is set at 70 pds. and with a 3/4 pipe and one sprinkler attached I can only get 28 ft. coverage max and there are dry spots that it does not cover. All four are the same. Shame on rain bird, they are ruining there reputation. I would gladly have paid the extra couple of bucks to get the same as I had before. They seem to have the same model number as the old one too.
B000FJX67U This sprinkler is very easy to use and with plenty of water pressure it definitely makes it to 40 feet! Mine was coming up short but then I noticed a leak in the hose. Once it was repaired it was working great. I also purchased the Orbit 1/2-Inch Metal Ring Sprinkler Base 58030 to go along with it. It is very simple and works great. Highly recommended, especially for the price.
B000FJX67U This is my all time favorite sprinkler, its pretty amazing. Don't waste your money on others and don't waster your water using others.Pros: NO overspray after setting your pattern! It seems like all the brass ones sprinkle water farther than the set pattern and that can be a waste of water. This is a sharp shooter and moves very fast because of the lightweight plastic parts. It shoots farther than other comparable sprinkler heads. It is easy to install. It is easy to adjust the spray range. Low cost. It has three ways to adjust the spray pattern (variety of nozzles, screw that touches the stream of water, and the top of the head raises and lowers).Cons: None.Other: I have tried multiple brass/zinc sprinklers and all of them seem to spray water farther than the set pattern, which is a waste of water. I have noticed the plastic rain bird sprinklers are very sharp in keeping the water within the pattern and they have absolutely no leakage on the head. Most sprikn
B000FJX67U After researching, I read several people who preferred these to the more expensive, brass models. This is a fine sprinkler, and the price means you don't need it to last forever. They screw into standard female 1/2\" pipe thread. I have high water pressure, and the water shoots far.
B000FJX67U I bought three of these and use them on a Nelson auto hose shut off timer. They are attached to an 18&#34; extension then onto an Orbit metal ring sprinkler base. Works great to water my front and back yards. Very easily adjustable when I move from location to location.
B000FJX67U This is a very inexpensive sprinkler head. The Rain Bird works well in the short radius range. It gets everything covered out about 24 feet with reasonable even water coverage. If it is adjusted to a larger radius, it tends to put most of the water out near the outer perimeter and close to the sprinkler. Not very much water falls in the middle area. Since I wasn't really looking to pay much and don't need a very wide coverage it works for me. If you need a large area covered evenly, I suggest a better sprinkler.
B000FJYSHW I needed to connect a timer to a drip irrigation system and a hose connected to a sprinkler to the same spigot.  Gilmour Brass 2 Way connector does a perfect job without any leaks.I needed to use Vise Grips to loosen the valves for the first time, but after that they operated easily and smoothly.  The splitter was easy to install. I used plumber's teflon tape connecting the splitter to the spigot and to hose on one connector and timer on the other. The valves operate smoothly and do not require a lot of strength to open/close, and none of the junctions leak.The Gilmour Brass 2-way connector stock photo makes it looks a bit larger than it is in real life.  I am attaching a photo of the connector after it was installed so you can see it in context.Photo posted: installed Gilmour connector.
B000FJYSHW You wouldn't think that a 2-way splitter would be a difficult purchase but there are splitters and then there are splitters. This item is easily five-star out of the box. First, I was able to connect it to an outside faucet that was right up against the wall of the house. The black top allowed me to tighten the connector sufficiently tightly to eliminate leakage. Note that the whole unit does not have to turn, just the top connector. Secondly, the two on-off valves turned easily and tightly sealed the connector when off without leakage. Lastly, the fit and finish were excellent with no burrs on the threads or marks on the body. Now if it continues to operate well, it will continue to receive the highest rating I can give it.
B000FJYSHW Seems like I go through these 2-way connectors every season.  Maybe it's because I am cheap and buy the cheapest and get what I pay for.  I finally parted with a bit more cash and this feels like a nice, solid product.  It is easy to OPEN/CLOSE the valves and NO drips after connecting.  Very happy so far!
B000FJYSHW I've had terrible experience with short lived plastic or plastic knob units .. this one seems like it should last.
B000FJYSHW I used plumber's teflon tape at both of my hose connections, as they're more or less permanent. The valves operate smoothly and effectively, and none of the junctions leak.
B000FJYSHW the knobs are stiff at first, but I'm sure that's why it doesn't leak at all.  If it obeyed verbal commands it would be better, but then it would be whole different product.
B000FJYSHW This item works as advertised and it does not leak, which was important to me, as we have it in our atrium.  Works greats and seems to be very good quality.
B000FJYSHW After trying several plastic connectors that broke when connecting hoses or turning the off/on selectors I decided to pay a little more for the Gilmore brass connector.  A great difference!  You don't have to worry about breakage and the flow rate is unaffected by the unit.  Top rated!
B000FJYSHW This is a handy gadget when you want to use an outdoor faucet for two different feeds. It is made in China of solid brass. We have been warned many times about health issues concerning materials used in China. This is no exception and has a warning that it is known by the state of California that this can cause cancer. Hands should be washed thouroughly when handling this item.Installation is very easy using the plastic gripper that surrounds the brass faucet connection. So far it has not had the leaks that other reviewers have experienced. The shut-off valves are not particularly well designed and are somewhat difficult to operate.Overall, there is nothing especially noteworthy nor particularly negative about this product aside from the cancer causing. It functions as expected and has a fairly reasonable price tag.
B000FJYSHW While I did not buy mine on Amazon (I bought at HD or Lowes), I wanted to give a positive review for this connector. I have used mine for at least three seasons without any problems. The on and off valves close completely and do not leak. They allow for a precise amount of water control so you can get just the amount of flow you want (good for soaker/weeper hoses). One thing I really like is the collar that threads onto the spigot. It has three little pieces of rubber that stick out and allow you to get a good grip for attaching to the spigot. Some other Y-connectors I have do not have this and are much more difficult to get on and eliminate all leaks.
B000FJYSHW Over the years I have installed almost every variety of garden bib valve.  This one is still working after 10 years.  Some of the others that are made from a combination of zinc and plastic fail after about 5 years.  The worst one is the Goodyear/Nelson high flow (big yellow handle) valve which usually breaks after 1 year.  It's worth it to pay a little extra for this model if you don't like having to replace them all the time.
B000FJYSHW Pay a little more for this and its worth it !! The brass units will last much longer and are better built. Spray wd 40 every so often around the valves and it will last even longer.
B000FJYSHW hello,in addition to our new gilmour 1/2 inch hose, we purchased a gilmour 2 way connector.  the brass fittings shut off the water without any dribbles or leaks.  it is a little hard to twist, but it shuts off the water and redirects it to the correct hose fitting.  again, this is another gilmour quality product and everything should last for years.  just be patient with the hard twist in the valves.  it shuts it off much better than the  products at the local stores.
B000FJYSHW I purchased one of these around 2 years ago at local HW place,  to find out Gilmour had moved to China. Gilmour used to be very good quality, but not anymore. Apparently most everyone has gone to China and the quality of these valves has really gone downhill, but not the price they charge you. This valve is really cheap and can't take much pressure and it got  a pin hole leak in the valve after about 2 years and I foolishly  replaced it with another one, to have it blow it out six months later as it was the only Y valve the HW had and I needed another one ASAP. I use quite a few Y valves/hose splitters  and 4 way splitters, so the 'search' was on to find something better.Here is how I rate the valves now after ordering them and studying them and using them.BEST1. Camco-Y  ball Valve/ hose spliter. Made in the USA, solid , solid brass with amazing full sized ball valves. High flow. Designed to also fit RV. Commercial grade valve! Hands down winner and same price as the Gilmour and made in the USA. Available on Amazon. This is superb valve.2. Achla Designs. Made in Taiwan but very solid and heavy. For commercial use. Available on Amazon. This is a great valve.3. Orbit Y ball Valve /splitter - Much thicker than Gilmour valve. And much cheaper. Made in China. Available on Amazon. This is a pretty good valve.4. Nelson Y ball valve/splitter-Nelson went to China not to long ago. Current valves are very lightweight and not suitable for commercial use. Orbit splitters are heavier and better made. Available on Amazon. This is acceptable if you turn the Hose bibb off and have lower pressure water lines.5 Melnor, more cheap made in China stuff, quality is not as good as Nelson made in China stuff largely as Nelson is has better finish quality. Available on Amazon. This is similar to the Nelson.6. Ray Padula- More made in China that is suitable for gardening but not commercial use. All of Rays Products are made in China and are very expensive. He's kind of what is wrong with the USA, marketing hype and advertising then off-shoring to sweat shops and delivering poor quality and hoping you're 'dumb' as he rolls in the money . Ray should have gone to college to learn mechanical engineer and manufacturing and learned what it means to be an American manufacturer. Give a 'lifetime' guarantee to try and convince you its worth the time to drive and pick up a new valve. His prices indicate he expects 2.5 valves to fail in your lifetime. Buy Camco and pay once and less and get made in the USA!!! Let Ray move to China, the Chinese want made in the USA for their own gardens.WORST---------------------------------------I wish someone with an engineering background or industrial background would write these reviews, but the made in China crowd would not make as much money replacing their blown out valves.I don't know why DRAMM does not make a Y valve or Hose splitter or if they do, why Amazon does not carry it.  Amazon carries some of their high quality nozzles and hose disconnects that are made in the USA and high quality.  DRAMM is the best when it comes to brass. Camco is the next best quality you're going to find.Stay away from that Made in China stuff, we send them fake money, with Pictures of dead Presidents and they send us fake valves that break down. Made in Taiwan quality is pretty good if you cant find American or Canadians products.
B000FJYSHW Chose to get the higher quality connector and I think it paid off. Easy to open and close and the quality is great! Would buy again if needed.
B000FJYSHW Very well made, the brass always works better than the plastic, and unlike the plastic, this well last you a very long time.
B000FJYSHW This 2-way connector worked very well as I was setting up an automatic patio watering system but I still wanted to hook a hose to the spicket. The knobs are great since I leave the water always on for the automatic watering.
B000FJYSHW Solid and strong, this 2-way connector does the job.  It's a little hard to turn the small knobs that open/close each hose connector, but other than that I have absolutely no complaints.  I use this connector in conjunction with a timer to water my garden.  Using 2 hoses at the same time adequately covers it.
B000FJYSHW I had a hard time at first moving the little levers to open up the spigot that lets water enter each hose.  But it works great now and seems well made.  It has not leaked for me so far.  But I have not had it very long.  I am using it to attach two soaker hoses at one time.
B000FJYSHW When it comes to splitters, I have gone through a lot.  This is the best so far.  The seal is good and the valves feel sturdy, plus they are very easy to turn.  The only thing I would improve is making the nobs a bit larger, but that is very minor.
B000FJYSHW I have bought many similar style adapters over the years, but this brass adapter is by far the best one on the market.  Some of these have dials that are easier to turn than others, so I recommend testing them out in the store first, to see if you can move the dials easily.  They do not leak; they last practically forever; and I have one on each of my outdoor water faucets. A top item, highly recommended.  Got mine from Home Depot and Lowes.I recommend using this with a small piece of teflon to prevent corrosion at the connectors. If corrosion does take place, it can become very difficult to unscrew it.
B000FJYSHW I got one of these to replace a &#34;plastic&#34; one that had became unusable.I have found that Gilmour product are very well made and usually last a lot longer that a plastic item.I ended up getting two of these, of for the front and one for the back yards. now I don't have to disconnect a drip system for the flower beds to attach a hose.
B000FJYSHW I got tired of the plastic 2-way connectors that lasted only one season.  I felt that this should be better than those as well as slightly more expensive.  So far, it has held up in daily use.  I do like the fact that the valves knobs are made up of brass and not plastic.
B000FJYSHW I was impressed when I felt how heavy this connector is.  I was worried when I couldn't get the on/off valves to budge.  They wouldn't move at all.  Before I gave up and sent it back, I got out a pair of pliers.  Success!  After they had been turned once using the pliers, I could then turn them by hand.  I like the grip that helps you to attach the connector to the faucet so the switches can stay facing out.  The fit was tight and there was no leaking.  I anticipate this connector will last for a very long time.
B000FJYSHW Brass, better than plastic and safer for drinking water than aluminum and pot metal type 2 way connectors that are cheaper in prive
B000FJYSHW Have You ever seen them $500.00 Water faucets at Lowes? I hate Jonesy stuff, Lowes needs to separate their store one side the Jonesy stuff the other side the practical Items.So far this Is the best shut off valve I know of, It will withstand the freezing cold better than all other shut off valves especially plastic even If It does bust the leak will Not be as bad as with plastic, also It with stands hot Water and high pressure very well, but the tightener needs to be made out of metal Instead of plastic also the knobs are hard to turn and I have to keep some pliers near by to turn It on or off but other than that Its almost perfect.
B000FJYSHW Even though it is pretty new - I have been using connecting this to 2 - 50 foot soaker hoses. Works as charm and controlling lock are useful as well. Since its brass expect them to last long and work as well.
B000FJYSHW I call it a splitter, this is a great item that will probably last for ever! The connector mounts to you bib easily with the easy to tighten collar.
B000FJYT4E These work fine,  Relatively easy to put on the line and are snug.I use them as end caps (since the &#34;EZ Plugs&#34; I ordered didn't work for this.  To do this, put one leg at the end of your run.  Take a short piece of your distribution tubing and make a loop with the other two ends of the Tee.  I did this look around a tree so that the tree would hold the end in place.
B000FJYT4E If you have a garden, a drip system is the best way to conserve water. These are affordable, easy to install into a half-inch plastic hose. I used them on ten papaya plants that outgrew the original quarter inch line.
B000FJYT4E They work just as intended and are good quality. I have not had any issues and would recommend based on the low price.
B000FJYT4E THESE ARE NICE. THEY GO ON EASIER THAN THE BROWN ONES FROM RAINBIRD, THOUGH I ALSO LIKE THOSE. BOTH ARE TIGHT AND DO NOT LEAK.
B000FJYT4E Nice and price is very good.  Takes fair amount of effort to put together but will NOT blow off- pretty much have to cut the hose to get them off.  THe ones I got where brown. Used on Rainbird poly and emitter hoses.
B000FJYTC6 I have used many different styles and brands of dripline stakes but these are the best. I like the fact that the stake has a bug guard and cap attached to it for easy access. I put the 1/4\" drip tube into the stake, clamp it down, and position it right where I want it. That is it. No more worries that the tubing will pop out.+ Inexpensive+ Bug Guard and Tube Cap+ Precision Positioning+ Perfect Size_Bottom Line_ Yes, I would recommend these to a friend. I am going to use these to stake down the tubing at each one of my emitters. I normally just lay the tube down with the emitter and hope it stays in place. Not anymore! Easy 5 Stars.
B000FJYTC6 I really like these stakes as they keep the drip line where it supposed to be placed.  The cover fitted on the end of the tube (its the attachment seen to the left in the photo) supposedly keeps bugs out of the lines and since I've never see bugs, I have to assume they are working.  The attachment to the right in the photo keeps the tubing from slipping out of the top of the stake so they stay secure.
B000FJYTC6 I am very impressed with how the Rain Bird Landscape Dripline System 1/4-Inch Tubing Stakes stay in place and the ease of holding the tubing exactly where I want to water a plant.
B000FJYTC6 My four star ratings are based on the flimsiness of the product. It has to be handled with care. I like it because it is helping to keep the 1/4&#34; dripline in place. However, I could have achieved that objective without the Rain Bird Landscape system. The bug prevention concept is noble but does not apply to my need.
B000FJYTC6 This was easy to install.  You will definitely want to consult their web site for additional installation information.  More so, you want to use the cap to prevent bugs from coming into the tube.  One piece of advice, the tubing to attach can be very rigid. Take a lighter and quickly hole the tubing opened end to the flame to soften it up a little, then attach it to the tube.  As it hardens , it will make a better seal.
B000FK010Y Essentially you're bending the end of the tubing and tying it up. I think zip ties would do the same job but I guess this looks marginally better.
B000FK010Y For anyone who uses dripline irrigation I share your love of it but if like me and you bought a system it only comes with one end closure for enough for two hoses!  If you want to separate your hoses because you have a oddly shaped garden or you intended it for more then one use and need to get more 1/2&#34; hose you will need more!  We have a green house on the opposite side of our main garden so we needed to separate the 1/2&#34; hose used for that to be able to run drip line to our green house we needed an extra end closure because we did not have the option of using one irrigation system because we did not even set up the rest of our garden for the year yet!  To conserve water we had to separate the system and that is why we needed extra closures!  I like this enclosure and have not had any issues as of yet!  So as with any of my reviews I will update if any issues arise!Happy Growing Season!
B000FK010Y They are extremely simple to use. Just put the end of the hose in and fold a few inches back and you're done!
B000FK010Y My five star ratings is based on the simplicity of this product while its cabability to cap the nutrient solution from extending beyond my control was pehnomenal. I can easily continue whenever the need arises to extend my Dutch Bucket System with the 1/2&#34; Rainbird dripline. No adhesives were needed to manage the open end of the dripline(a clean job). I love this product because of the simple application and perfect work I was able to accomplish in a very short time period.
B000FK010Y Work incredibly well and simple.  Easy to open line up for flushing or draining if needed.  Not much else to say
B000FK258K These work fine.  They are good to splice the tubing or splice/repair the tubing if it gets a hole in it (which mine did twice)I will order more.
B000FK258K Does what it needs to do, couples 2 1/2 inch drip line tubes together. Not complicated or anything. Just plug and go.
B000FK258K THESE ARE GREAT. UNLIKE THE BROWN ONES, THESE GO ON EASIER. BOTH BROWN AND BLACK STAY ON ONCE THEY'RE SNUGGED.
B000FK258K Nice and price is very good.  Takes fair amount of effort to put together but will NOT blow off- pretty much have to cut the hose to get them off.  THe ones I got where brown.
B000FK258K I purchased this to connect two pieces of tubing in an aquarium setup.  The tubing fit on very well, and seems secure.  Just to be sure, I used a pair of worm-gear clamps to be sure I didn't have a catastrophic leak at some point in the future.  This coupling is in use behind the setup - between a very heavy aquarium and the wall, and I cannot access it easily if a leak occurred.  The fit seemed tight on it's own - I only used the clamps out of an abundance of caution.
B000FLV9H2 The product inside of the container is a good one, as Diatomacious earth has been known to work on controlling insects in a planet-safe way for decades. Great, Safer! Five stars for that!The amount you get for the money spent on this product is questionable. Half a star off for that.As well, the dispenser is not very effective. It either trickles out or comes out in a large blast. Shaking it does no good and squeezing it seems to clog up the hole or blast it out all at once, leaving a cloud of white powder which you need to avoid. Not that great, Safer. Half a star off for that.I used this in and around my strawberry garden to keep the weevils and other insects from eating the fruit. It usually works, so I'm not inclined to believe this product will not.It's interesting to note that Diatomaceous Earth Powder does not work like a poison would wherein the product would kill an insect on contact. However, it is an irritant that gets into the joints and digestive tracts of insects because they have an exoskeleton which begins to deteriorate once the ground glass starts to get all over them and inside of them once they clean themselves. As well, if it gets on a social insect, such as an ant, they will carry it into the nest where it can begin to cover the others as well as the Queen. With time, it is very effective and very planet-friendly.All in all, I'd recommend the product for someone who is not needing a lot of it.
B000FLV9H2 I work at home and often eat at my desk, resulting in lots of desk and keyboard crumbs.  I try to keep everything cleaned up, but this spring my office appeared on the ants' radar and they staged an invasion centered on the desk and keyboard.  I live in an area where we don't have fire ants or serious biters, and I don't really have anything against ants personally (those tiny titans of industry), but I'm not really inclined to share office space with them.  I'm not keen on sharing my office space with poisonous pesticides, either.I applied a thin film of the Safer Diatomaceous Earth Powder Ant etc. Killer on my desk and near the location where I suspected they were coming in and soon learned two things: First, diatomaceous earth near my mouse was a bad idea.  I tend to drag my wrist and the side of my palm when using the mouse, and although the powder was barely noticeable, it was  enough to irritate my skin after awhile.  I would avoid using it anywhere you would be directly exposed to the abrasive powder.  (It did clean up easily with a damp cloth.)Secondly, it takes awhile to work.  I knew it wasn't a shoot 'em dead on the spot type of product, but after a few days I began to wonder if it was working at all.  Maybe I'd missed the troop routes.  Maybe there were so many that a few casualties weren't noticeable (ugh).Then, abruptly, they disappeared.  For a day or two it seemed as if there were fewer, and then there were none.  I haven't seen any at all for a couple weeks now.The product is a white, talc-like powder and has no noticeable odor, so it's very unobtrusive once applied.  The container puffs it out in little clouds, so don't hold it close enough to inhale it, and you might want a disposable cloth/paper towel handy to help you spread it around thinly and thoroughly instead of leaving little drifts all over.If I have occasion to use it against other insects and find it is not as effective, I'll update my review.  Right now, though, I feel it has completely lived up to my expectations:  It eliminated the ants without turning my office into a Superfund site, and it appears to have eliminated them thoroughly.
B000FLV9H2 This powder does not work at all. I followed the instructions meticulously and it seems that ants and spiders are laughing at my face!I assumed it would take a couple of days for the product to work so I waited. The ant \"traffic\" around my window did not diminish, no change whatsoever.I also tried this powder in a corner where we usually have spiders and they are happy as ever. So I had to go back to Raid spray (that does not fail).
B000FLV9H2 It won't be long before the ground is warm and wet enough to bring out slugs, snails, ants, spiders, etc. who love to chew on our tender spring plants.  From past experience I know diatomaceous earth powder works exceptionally well in preventing these creatures from getting to the plants.  I expect this product to work just as good.  This also says it works for indoor plantings.  I've never tried diatomaceous earth for indoor use so will have to see if there is a situation indoors where I can try it.  I'll be back with a more thorough review as spring, and the growing season, advances.7/11/2012:  After a period of time now to use this product, it works very good for outdoor crawling and chewing creatures in plantings.  I still have had no occasion to use it indoors as there are no insect problems with my indoor plants.  The only problem I have had with the product is getting it out of the container.  It has a small inverted funnel-shaped tip (cone, or pyramid shape).  The powder inside seems to pack tight so it is difficult to 'puff' it out the tiny opening.  It took a while shaking it, and the powder seems like a fairly solid lump because it thuds when shook.  It was stored in a closed, waterproof, storage bench outdoors under an awning and next to the building in a very low humidity area so I don't think moisture had anything to do with the lump-like product inside the container. ( Nothing else was affected by moisture inside that storage bench.)  So, my suggestion to the manufacturer would be to add something to keep the product from packing together or solidifying, or whatever is happening inside.  I was able to get enough out each time to adequately cover the planted area, it was just difficult to get it to do so.  This is a product I would buy for crawling, chewing insects again in the future.
B000FLV9H2 I use this to keep slugs out of the strawberry beds. I don't have bug problems in the home, so I can't verify it's effectiveness on ants,roaches and other tiny critters.To apply around the house in cracks and corners, this narrow tip applicator bottle should work very well. I was able to lay a neat border around my plants and not waste so much by the usual sprinkling out of the bag.Safety tip: If you do sprinkle out of the bag, wear gloves and a face mask. It's non toxic but you shouldn't be breathing it into your lungs.If you are using it outdoors you will need to reapply after a rain. I'll be saving this empty bottle to refill it from a larger money saving bag.I have successfully used many Safer products through the years, it's nice to have non toxic solutions to bug control.
B000FLV9H2 I have a wife, four children and a dog living in my home with me and it's very important that I keep bugs out while also avoiding harmful chemicals. When I saw this brand name I was worried that it was another company trying to trick consumers into thinking that they were getting something safe to use but really the product was full of unsafe chemicals. I'm happy to report that this product lives up to its brand's name.While there is a blend of bait mixed in with the diatomaceous earth, the product is still certified organic for gardening and farming. Diatomaceous earth is ground up hard shells of fossilized algae that cuts and dries organic material so bugs that walk across this stuff get cut up even on exoskeletons, and absorbs the moisture on and in the bugs dehydrating then to the point of death. It also kills when ingested.Overall, I'm very satisfied with this product and how well it works keeping the bugs out of the house and keeping my family safe while inside.
B000FLV9H2 I have wanted to find something that will get rid of ant's & bug's without using pesticides.  After being offered this to try, my daughter and I found the largest ant bed we could find in our yard.  We covered the ant bed with a coating of Safer Brand 5168 and poked a rake handle in the middle of the ant bed.  Hundreds of ants began pouring out of the mound and immediately began writhing and balling up trying to get away from the Diatomaceous Earth but they couldn't crawl over or through it.  We checked the next day and saw very little activity in/around the bed.  After a week we again poked a rake handle in the bed and very few ants crawled out.  My conclusion.....Although it takes time, the ants die.  I guess it's possible that they could have moved but there are no new ant beds in the area around our trial ant bed.I also applied around my windows but didn't like this bottle because it's hard to squeeze out without blowing everywhere.  I'm still looking for an alternative to putting in tight spaces without making a mess.  I have already orderedSafer Brand 51702 Diatomaceous Earth - Bed Bug, Ant and Crawling Insect Killer, 4-Pound Bagand apply using aGilmour D1 1-Pound-Capacity Dry Application Garden Dusterto easily apply to ant beds and around the house but it's not easily to use in tight spaces either.I would not have believed how well this product worked if I hadn't tried it myself and will continue to use in the future.
B000FLV9H2 We had lots of rain recently. The next day I noticed hundreds of specks on my windowsill. I called in the termite inspector, who wasn't able to immediately identify them either. He sprayed them with some aerosol canned air bug killer, but a few days later I saw a few moving around. My Safer Brand Insect Killer arrived and I tried it while waiting to be called back after they check those bugs out under a microscope. They still haven't called back, but any of them that made contact with the Safer Brand are no longer moving. I saw one just now moving around outside that area, so I enlarged the treatment area a bit. It appears to work well. I don't have any ants to try it on right now, but I will be back to report when I do.The ants came. The Safer Brand worked.
B000FLV9H2 We get these teeny, tiny, TEENY little ants around this time of year.  I've used the liquid ant bait traps with limited success in years gone by.  I thought I'd try this DE this year and see how it works.  As soon as the ants appeared (and they like to crawl up the side of the house and into the bathroom) I went out and foofed some of this all along the space where I saw them coming up from the ground, then gently swept it into every crack and crevice I could find.  HEY!  They're GONE!  Let's hope they STAY gone.It's a very lightweight container for its size, and has a fairly good nozzle on it.  The best way to get the very fine powder out is to aim that nozzle where you want it and then gently squeeze the bottle, dispensing some of the powder.  Too heavy a squeeze and you get a BIG poof of it though.  I do recommend using some safety glasses and a face mask when you use it - not good to inhale this stuff, even though it's not a chemical compound.  Reapply if it rains or gets wet otherwise, to keep the effectiveness going.I'm also going to put some around my lettuce beds and see if I can keep the earwigs and sowbugs at bay this year.
B000FLV9H2 I used this mostly indoors and it's pretty nice and effective. It seemed to work pretty quick as well - within 24 hrs the ants had almost completely disappeared.I also used this for what looked like termites in the trim wood work on our front door. There was a hole in the wood and this device was handy for putting in the powder inside such a hole. The termites too haven't come back since. So I really like how effective this powder is, and how easy it is to apply, especially in the hole inside our wood work.But the only negative, and it's not too much of a complaint, is that you have to clean up the powder after your problem is over. I left the powder for some time to make sure the ants wouldn't come back, and they didn't. But during that time, the powder is very visible. Also, I guess I had to eventually throw away all the remaining powder. So in that sense it's somewhat of a waste. In the future I intend to put less powder.Still, this is a very good product - highly effective and easy to apply in tiny spots (like a hole in the wood!).
B000FLV9H2 I used Safer Brand 5168 around our flower garden when I noticed a couple of trails of black ants trying to move in. I placed some of the powder down as a barrier around the garden the ants for the most part ignored it. I came back two days later and still found a few ants going back and forth across the white powder. It looked like it slowed the ants down but not eradicated them as I was hoping.  Maybe it was the batch I had it wasn't as quick as I would have liked seeing in getting rid of the ants.
B000FLV9H2 I have ants EVERYWHERE it seems..this year they started in February when it was still cold.  I live way out in the country in the middle of the Hoosier Forest but no anteaters in sight to help with the overabundance of ants. Anyway this stuff does work..I don't like the application bottle very well.  You aim and squeeze and it blows the stuff out.  I needed to place it on a vertical strip of window casing so I have been squirting it out and then using a paint brush to dab it on areas where I need it to go.  Seems to be working.  It's messy..I don't like it but I don't like the ants either. The ants avoid it entirely even though someone said it had bait in it.  I put this near my cat's food bowl and the ants are finally leaving that alone.  So for that I am grateful and would buy this again.
B000FLV9H2 A quick round of education on certain types of Cancer, medical folk take note.  One of the causes of Lung Cancer, done by cigarettes, asbestos, and other breathable contaminants is due to the stability not the volatility of the agent.  Asbestos for instance, is so stable that fire can't burn it. Thats exactly the quality that makes it a fire retardant. The problem comes when it's ground, or sanded, or other wise kicked up as a dust, the fine crystaline structures get stuck in the tiny air sacs in the lung. Now the body attacts it as a foreign body and tries to eat it, break it down chemically etc. Unfortunately, something that stable will not go way so easily.  After a time from being attacked by it's own immune system, the area around the crystal gets damaged, and can become a cancer.OK, I know, so what does this have to do with Diatomaceous Earth Powder. Well it's a fine powder too and it has a crystaline structure, that stucture is exactly what tears the crap out of anything with an exoskeleton \"read insects\".  Therefore, the stuff sticks to them and they get damaged and die.  Now this substance in a different grade was used to keep bugs out of grain silos and other such places in the past, so it was often found in the American diet, and it was relatively harmless when eaten.  Health food people consume it today as a supplement, and provided the crystaline content is not too high, it's generally safe to eat.  This \"ant powder\" is probably not edible because of additives, but it will do the job it's intended for fairly safely.I still recommend applying this with a mask on.  The red tip applicator is better than my old method, which used a spoon in a big jar of the stuff.  You want to place it in cracks, and around the edges of the carpet where the bugs walk.  In the garden around the plants anywhere, the bugs will die, the plants won't.  This is especially good for a flea infestation, and will prevent you from calling out the services who rip you off, and poison your house and pets, with foul smelling chemical treatments.
B000FLV9H2 I love diamoaceous earth for safe, natural killing of unwanted crawling insects in the garden and barn, but since it typically comes loose in a bag, I've always found it a pain in the neck to apply. I feel like it's alwasy a struggle to avoid wasting it or underapplying it. I previously had a duster to use in the garden, and while tht spread it quickly, it made a big mess and it was hard to guess how much to use, and messy and inconvenient to either empty or store.This little squeeze bottle is a very handy solution, and it really helps you direct the powder just where you want it--into a crack that a trail of ants leads into, for instance, or right on the blister beetles pestering my tomatoes. It's also handy to squirt a bit into your vacuum bag--my hope is that it's killing the many spiders that seem to invade every summer in Kansas before they find their way back out of the bag. Previously, I was reluctact to try it for indoor pests, but the squeeze bottle should make that much nicer.Best of all, the bottle is refillable, so you can still use the big, economical bulk bags.Because diatomaceous earth is a physical abrasive that wears down crawling insects' exoskeletons, instead of achemical poison, you don't have to worry about bugs becoming immune, or about harming pets. It's safe to use in dog houses, chicken coops, barns, etc.
B000FLV9H2 I wanted to like this so badly.  We have an annual ant problem.  My husband sprays outside around the foundation, but they still manage to find their way in somehow...those tiny sugar ants.  This year, they have taken over the small bathroom off my bedroom. I've doused all visible cracks, but I'm still seeing ants two weeks later.  I have used DE in the past for pests and had good luck.  Maybe these ants will eventually disappear.  I hope so. Update...eventually I just mixed some of this with sugar water and voila!, no more ants! July update:  I haven't seen ants for months anywhere in the house.  It seems that the product just needed more time to work.  I changed my rating from 3 stars to 5.  Just don't expect this to work overnight, especially if you've had an ongoing problem with ants.
B000FLV9H2 I am familiar with Diatomaceous Earth, so this wasn't a new product for me - just a new brand. The powder works as it should. For those new to DE - it isn't your traditional bug killer. It doesn't poison or drawn the bugs - it cuts them up from the inside out. As a result - it doesn't kill quickly, but it is effective. What makes this product nice is the spout from the top. DE can be very messy to work with. You need to put it in the patch of the bugs - which means getting it into corners and such. That is very difficult with many containers of DE; this one solves that problem very well.The only reason I took off one star is for the size of the bottle - you don't get much. This will probably last you one buggy season (maybe less for a larger infestation). However, if you know exactly where the bugs are entering your home - get this bottle! You will be much less frustrated with application.DE is safe around children and large animals - just don't let your kids or pets eat is as it can give them tummy trouble. However, it is much, much better than spraying a bunch of poison into the air. Definitely would use them again and purchase.
B000FLV9H2 I was looking for something safe and easy to use to kill fleas. My cats got some and they are indoor only so the fleas must have been on something I brought in the house. I didn't want to fog the whole house so I washed the cats in flea shampoo, washed the throw rugs and bedding in hot water to kill them, then sprinkled this around the edges of the mattress in the room they sleep in & I sprinkled some very lightly on top of the mattress. I made the bed with a thin mattress pad as well as clean sheets and the next day there were 3 dead fleas in the mattress pads so it worked and for now my cats are not scratching. I'll do it again every 2 weeks for the next 6 weeks to be sure the fleas didn't leave eggs that will hatch later. Sure was a quick way to take care of it all, of course, I have all natural hardwood floors in my house throughout so no carpet for the fleas to have gotten into & I don't know if this item is safe to sprinkle on carpets because if your pets lick it maybe it would make them ill but I don't know so I wouldn't try that.
B000FLV9H2 I typically useOrtho 0196010 Home Defense MAX Perimeter Granules - 2.5 lb.to work around the perimeter of my house.  The granules are easy to apply and use and they really seem to work.I decided to try Safer Brand Powder Bug killer and applied it as directed.  This is a powder and it is best applied to ant hills and as directed provided there is not the lightest bit of breeze.  It will blow around like talc and that isn't fun since despite it being called \"Safer\" it is hazardous too.This did not work for us.  I find the perimeter granules more effective.
B000FLV9H2 I love this bottle because you can direct the powder where you want and not have to get it all over yourself.  Such a concept!I have a greenhouse of orchids attached to my house and bugs get in all the time, despite my doors.  Lots of mole crickets, roaches, and silverfish come in and also infest my bathroom nearby, creeping out my guests.  A little of this spread around and they don't come out alive.  When I visit the bathroom I have to clean up but not squish, which is a much preferable solution.As far as my greenhouse, there are many places to hide and I've found some dead bodies here and there so I guess it's working fine.  I love that it's safe for my pets and family.
B000FLV9H2 This bug killer comes in a powder form. The bottle is supposed to be a squeeze bottle where the powder comes out gently when squeezed. Not much but a poof of bug killing powder came out when I squeezed the bottle and I was not too keen on breathing a fine cloud of bug-killing powder while I was applying it. So, I took off the top and applied it by tapping out some along the doorway where the ants choose to invade every summer.The ants were already in the midst of a full invasion and had survived applications of other pesticides in the form of outdoor bait traps. I re-applied this product multiple times over the course of a month and eventually the ant invasion stopped.The bad news - it took a while to work.The good news - the traditional fall encore of the springtime ant invasion did not happen so it seems to have had a lasting impact.
B000FLV9H2 Originally I gave this product a low score and it wasn't fair review.  After awhile the ants stopped coming and now a year or so later the ants are no more!  It started working within a month or so.  It worked as described I just had to give the product a chance to work as described.  I have changed my review and the amount of stars from 1 to 5 because of the effectiveness.
B000FLV9H2 Works well and I like how easy it is to direct on a specific location without splattering on myself. It's simple & safe to use, while be effective. It's great to for completely bordering your house on the outside walls.I'd recomend this product.
B000FLV9H2 For the last several years, I've tried to cut out use of most of the poisons that I used around the house and outside, without really considering any effect other than killing the bugs.  Being more sensitive to environmental effects now, I find the idea of a non-toxic material very appealing and am willing to wait if it takes a little longer to work.  I spread a line of the Safer Ant & Crawling Insect Killer inside our garage where I often see ants entering, expecially after a rain.  As luck would have it, it did rain, and I began to see the parade of ants.  A few days later, they had stopped entering at that spot.  I then saw ants entering at another spot, but I don't really know if these are the same critters taking a detour, or another clan seeking refuge from the wet earth.  However, in years past, I would have used the same technique with a can of Raid, so I do feel better about the whole process.The packaging is very convenient to use.  The pointed spout loosens, and the amount you pour goes right where you want it.  So, conclusion:  Easy to apply, and very likely effective.
B000FLV9H2 Safer Brand Diatomaceous Earth Powder Ant And Crawling Insect Killer Rocks. Because it is safer I can trust that it non toxic to kids and pets so I am good with using it in my home. I got it to take care of some ants that have appeared on my kitchen counter all winter long. Put it down yesterday and so far so good because I haven't seen any ants. What more can you ask for ?, good enough for me.
B000FLV9H2 Take Note:  This product is not \"food grade\" diatomacious earth (which is what I want and searched for on Amazon), does not state that it is safe for use near pets and children, and does state that it includes a bait ingredient -- obviously it is not intended for human or pet consumption.This is not the one best suited for my uses, but should be perfectly effective, and in a handy applicator-topped bottle, for anyone using it in the absence of precious mammals/critters.
B000FLV9H2 Used this to cover my canna roots. basically it keeps the bugs away and what bugs eat it or rub up against the powder will die. not, safe for humans so don't panic!
B000FLV9H2 This year we are having huge ant problem. In the years before I would put 4 ant baits around kitchen and in the garage, and ants disappear, but not this year, looks like they had adapted to it. Since I have a small child, I cannot just spray poison at the base boards and around the outside of the house, or leave more baits out in the open. I was excited to try this powder to see if it helps. I applied it all in and around my trash can, entrances, outside perimeter, and kitchen floor. It seems like there are less ants after the application. Of course, after rain or cleaning session, I have to reapply it. It didn't eliminate the ants, unfortunately. I found another product which is organic spray with peppermint and rosemary oils, and I use one of the two (at different times, of course). It seems to work a bit better then the powder alone, but it is no cure, unfortunately.
B000FLV9H2 Diatomaceous earth is a naturally siliceous sedimentary rock according to Wikipedia, but my bottle has a paper adhesive label on the side of the bottle that says Boric Acid. So which is it - Diatomaceous fossilized sediment or boric acid? Or is a mixture of the two?  Whatever it is, it doesn't work all that well.  Spiders build a web right across it. I still see the occasional silverfish looking for water in my sink.  They have to cross this boric acid to get there, but there might still be a sneaky path somewhere.The directions make it seem like you have to pour or spray a perimeter around every crack and crevice and pipe and under the drawers in your vanity cabinet and dozens of other suggestions.  Who has time to do it in that level of detail? I hold my breath while dispensing this dust and I can only hold my breath so long.  I'm definitely not inclined to breathe the dust. I live alone with no pets, so at least I don't to worry about young children or pets - just myself. But someday, I'll have to clean up this dust - not sure how to do that without getting it into the air I breathe. It would take an extraordinary well sealed dust mask to make it safe.  I sort of regret putting it in so many places already.And this dispenser either blows out a huge amount of dust all at once or you can barely get it to puff out anything.  I've shaken it and sifted it and it just has a mind of its own. Maybe it works to some degree, but everything seems the same as before I used this powder.
B000FLV9H2 I've had some \"issues\" with little black ants in the past.  I've used this product, and so far,  I haven't seen any ants.  I will say that using a powder is not preferred for me, but at least I can see it and know that it's still there.  Fortunately I don't have issues with other insects, such as bed bugs and such.
B000FLV9H2 After spending most of my life in the semi-arid climate of the Southwest, the last decade in the coastal South has taught me a lot about fleas.  The biggest lesson is that a lot of toxic stuff is used to keep them at bay somewhat and the dogs are going to get frequently infested no matter what I do.So after using the monthly flea treatment, we often still needed to administer medication for their flea allergies because the fleas STILL bit them every time they went outside.  (I think every animal in the South is a walking buffet table for fleas.)  That meant we could soon have a flea fest going on inside too if we didn't do something.  I hated dusting their beds with toxic chemicals but that seemed to be the only solution to keep them down.Then I tried this.Non-toxic, I simply dust their beds (we have a carpet free home) and voila...any fleas hitch hiking on the dogs is now treated to dehydration and death.  It's more effective, longer lasting (we only have to reapply it after washing their beds) and I don't worry about its toxic nature either.  Even a large bed only requires about a tablespoon sprinkled over it, and the dogs finish spreading it around themselves with their paws and fur.After a month of using it, we're all a lot happier and a lot less scratching/chewing is going on too.  The one older dog had developed dermatitis due to flea bites and had nearly chewed herself bald, and is now proudly sporting a beautiful coat once again after only a month!Fleas are more than a nuisance.  They spread disease and parasites, neither of which are things we want to invite into our homes.  I took flea control seriously, but they really did seem to be winning the war.  I'm ecstatic to have a non toxic solution that really does work!
B000FLV9H2 I love the spray-tip applicator -- they call it a \"puffer\" -- excellent way to direct the diatomaceous earth. Diatoms are a type of algae and they leave behind their extremely tiny shells, which bugs hate. Cuts them to ribbons. So this isn't chemically-based or poisonous to humans (though you certain do not want to inhale or ingest it), which I like. I feel good about having this on hand vs. some kind of poisonous spray or even Formula 409 which apparently messes up the sense of smell ants use to navigate.
B000FLV9H2 Annual ant problem. I used the DE powder around the foundation. It seemed to work for 2 or 3 days but the ants returned. I reapplied the product but it does not seem to work with this type of ant or perhaps it's where I am applying the powder. Either way, I have not been successful using the product.
B000FLV9H2 This product works well but appears to be tempered by the particular type of ant that you're dealing with. In my part of the world I have to deal with the regular black ants that live pretty much everywhere, Fire ants, and the big Carpenter ants. I only tried this on locations that impinged on my yard or house, no testing on locations that were in the desert minding their own business. It worked very well on the black ants and carpenter ants, not so well on the Fire ants. The powder has the consistency of flour and is completely harmless to the environment, a big plus in my book. I have pets and want to keep any chemical use to a minimum. I would recommend this but don't count on great results for fire ants. It looked like they just ignored it or found some way to get around it. Tough little buggers.
B000FLV9H2 This Safer Brand diatomaceous earth insect killing powder is safe to apply around your home since it's not toxic to mammals. Place a full layer of the powder in places where insects crawl and you should soon find a reduction in any infestation you've had. I found this worked great in a place around my front door where bull ants congregated after rains. It isn't as completely effective with roaches since they have more varied hiding places and it's hard to place this powder everywhere. The main thing I like about this product is its safety, as I'd rather have my health than have bugs completely eradicated while being poisoned myself by chemicals. This is as effective as I would expect for a diatomaceous earth bug killer, and Amazon has a reasonable price on this compared to some retail outlets. If you apply this properly you are likely to get good results - plus, this stuff lasts and will continue to do its job for a long time, without promoting bug killer resistance in bugs. Certainly a much better option than chemical pesticides. I do think the top nozzle could be redesigned for an adjustable diameter from which to pour the powder and clearer instructions could be offered to help people identify how thickly to apply the powder. Overall, this is a valuable product that I would encourage people to consider so that our society can do away with all the toxic bug killers that are doing harm to people, pets, and the environment.
B000FLV9H2 LOVE this stuff.  (The powders always work better.)  I mix this right into my potted plant's soil and it keeps the ants out.  Best stuff ever.  The fact it goes IN my plants is awesome because I won't have dogs in the pesticide power I used to have to sprinkle on my deck.  Much safer that way.Even with the pointy spout, wear a mask.  That's just good common sense safety.
B000FLV9H2 I applied this powder to a crack between the tiled floor and the threshold by my front door where ants were coming in.  I have not seen any ants since I applied it.  It is easier to apply than ortho boric acid but it does make a similar mess.  I vacuumed up the excess after a few week and still no ants.
B000FLV9H2 I'll admit up front that I am not a big fan of these more environmentally friendly products for pest control.  Not because I don't think they are a great idea, but because my experience with them in the past has been that they work slowly, if at all, and are expensive.  This Safer Brand diatomaceous earth powder, (DEP), has proven to be not much different in my opinion. But it does seem to work, with time. That being said, for the price of 7 oz of this powder you can easily get a full pound of another brand.  And they are not always a regular ant powder that uses harsher chemicals, but more earth/pet friendly ones like this one.  Even Safer Brand itself makes another powder that you get more than double this amount for about the same price.  If this DEP compound was far more effective it may be worth it.  But I have found it to work, but very slowly, and with no better efficiency or effectiveness than other environmentally safe brands I have used. It's a little early here in New England for any real ant problems so I searched out a mound in the back yard to try it on.  My first impression of this powder was I didn't like the applicator.  This is not a granular mixture but a talc like powder that clogs the hole at the end of the spout quickly.  You have to shake it and squeeze it quite a bit, and often, to get it flowing.  My experience with it had me either pouring out a very thin amount of powder or a whole lot at once.  Once the powder was on the mound the ants crawled through it without any real mind to it other than curiosity.  I have never seen a \"safe\" brand of insecticide yet that killed immediately and this powder was par for the course.  But I think what makes this type of powder eventually effective is that the ants and other crawling pests don't seem to recognize it as poisonous.  Ants will avoid regular chemical type insecticides because the smell seems to alert them that its not safe.  This powder seems to carry no real scent, or give off any indication they are tracking through something deadly.  That I feel is one of the key reasons this powder seems to kill effectively, eventually.  When I returned the next day there was still some activity around, but by the third day all the ants were gone from the area.  No bodies were visible but the mound that was once infested with ants was quiet and barren.  It's good that it works in some time, but I have to wonder how well it would work in a doorway where ants would pass through or over it very quickly with little exposure.  Given the favorable results of most of the other reviews here, I will concede it may be effective in that area as well, but still an expensive alternative.In conclusion, this powder is definitely not a waste of time and money for the sake of being safe.  It does seem to work as long as you have some patience and get it into the areas the ants will frequent as a corridor for their wanderings.  But once again I must take issue with the price of this product when compared to both regular powders, and more environmentally safe ones that are available right here on Amazon.  For that reason 3 stars is the best I can do for this Safer Brand, 5168 compound...
B000FLV9H2 I have a big problem with cabbage loopers in my veggie garden, and an intermittent problem with ants on my back patio. I've used this both around the kale and other veggies prone to the loopers, and in the cracks between stones on the patio, and it seems pretty effective. The most dramatic was when I sprinkled it(*) along an edge where a whole colony was running back and forth, and very quickly many were dead, and it became an ant-panic scene with the rest were trying to carry the little bodies of their compatriots away before succumbing themselves. Since they weren't actually in my house, I felt kind of guilty about the mass murder I'd just committed.But the (*) -- \"sprinkle\" is the wrong word. This bottle is not really optimum for applying the product in a \"light coating\". It's more likely to come out in clouds or not at all, resulting in a pretty uneven application.So I also puffed clouds onto the kale, and I didn't see any new looper damage for several days. After the next rain, and a failure to re-apply, I began finding little loopers, then progressively bigger, etc. So definitely re-apply after rain!Bottom line: Diatomaceous earth really does work, and for small applications, this is a good size, as long as you don't need the bottle to do really precise application.
B000FLV9H2 It's the same thing every spring--ants, ants, and more ants. Not only do they love to hang out in my kitchen, but this year they've decided that there are several spots on my deck railing that are perfect for staging their rallies and sporting events (or whatever those hordes of ants do when they get together). This year, I applied Safer Brand Powder to the ants' staging areas (where they get together and plan to take over my house), and it did the one thing I needed it to do--made the ants disappear.  I have spent way too much money on ant traps that do a half-ant job, and am satisfied with the Safer Powder, especially because it not only works, but it works quickly.
B000FLV9H2 I'm willing to accept that this product takes some time to work, and I really don't think it presents a safety hazard like some others said. The applicator is hardly a precision device, however. It delivers the powder in bursts, alternately creating quite large lumps along with a cloud of fine dust, then next to nothing. I used it outside; I would never consider using it inside the house. Too messy.
B000FLV9H2 I found out about diatomaceous earth from a friend years ago who uses the medical grade to worm her animals and family with.  She lives on a farm so mites and all were a problem as well, so she'd use it on her animals.My son had an allergic reaction to commercial bug spray when he was little - a very severe reaction that has made me very, very leary to use the chemicals in my older home again.  We live in Georgia, in an old home close to the woods, so bugs are QUITE common.  I use boric acid powder and diatomaceous earth and it works well for all my problems.When you get this, expect it to be very light - it won't mean the bottle is empty, it's just a very lightweight substance.  Also, don't expect to squirt it on an ant hill or a big ugly cockroach and watch it die.  They won't.  What happens is the bugs get the powder on them and they run back to their mounds or nests and hopefully they get it on their friends.  It gets in the crevices between their 'shell' plates and also in their guts and it rips holes and kills them.  It IS very effective.  Even in Georgia, with open doors and windows, I have NEVER had an infestation.You can put it in animal bedding and it won't hurt your dogs and cats.  It's not chemical, as another reviewer said, it is mechanical in nature.  I really don't know why more people don't use it.  The Safer brand is trustworthy, and the tipped bottle makes it very easy to apply in the thin lines I use the most in applying this.When I've seen a bug in my house, I put a line around my doors and whereever I saw it crawling.  Then usually a few days later I find 2-3 dead bugs just belly up.  Season change is very important - I've learned to go ahead and put my protective lines down when the seasons are changing and that's really helped keep my house bug free.  IE every equinox or solstice.  But again, I'm in a climate and area with a LOT of bugs.  It maybe different if you're up North.A bottle this size lasts me - for household use - about 4 months.
B000FLV9H2 I had heard about Diatomaceous Earth or DE Powder from friends so I thought I would give it a try. I had an army of ants invade my kitchen while I was away on vacation so It was the oerfect opportunity to put DE to the test. I put a trail of DE along their path and within days they were gone! It's been 2 wks and I haven't seen a single ant. I would deffinately recommend DE as a safe and effective alternative to poisons. I mean,who wants poisons in their kitchen anyway?
B000FLV9H2 I saw a huge colony of ants on my sidewalk and used this DE to try and get rid of them. The ants crawled through the powder and nothing happened. The powder is supposed to damage their bodies and kill the insect. I gave it a few days and nothing happened. I made sure the powder stayed dry. We still have ants galore outside trying to get in. I will try it again.
B000FLV9H2 I had high hopes for the Safer Ant & Crawling Insect Killer. I have used diatomaceous earth-based products before and was pleased to think that Safer had produced a household-sized applicator bottle that would solve the age-old problem diatomaceous earth presents. Sadly, I found out they hadn't. Diatomaceous earth, although extremely safe, is difficult to apply due to the flour-like consistency. Applicators thus have a problem with caking and uneven distribution. It is difficult to find an applicator that properly aerates the material so that it does not clump. Unfortunately, the simple applicator bottle this Safer product arrives in allows the product to clump unmercifully, leaving large, intermittent deposits of the product among areas bare of any product whatsoever. A better applicator would be most welcome-because diatomaceous earth does the job on crawling, soft-bodied insects without poisonous chemicals. Safer Ant & Crawling Insect Killer contains an unlisted 'bait' ingredient to attract the insects. I would prefer to know what the bait ingredient is but cannot find any information on that. One thing that the packaging doesn't make clear is that diatomaceous earth-based products are NOT instant killers . . .insects slowly die over a period of time as the sharp particles of the diatomaceous earth pierce their outer skin and cause them to dehydrate. This is fine if you know what to expect. If you don't, you may be disappointed!
B000FLV9H2 Nontoxic insect killers made from food-grade diatomaceous earth do not kill with harmful chemicals; instead, the silicon dioxide powder damages the target insect's protective shell through abrasion, causing it to die after a few days from dehydration.  The powder will also kill nestmates, when tracked back to the insect's home.  However, because the nontoxic, abrasive powder is a \"physical\" killer,  it will take a few days for any results to become noticeable.Safer Brand insecticides have always worked well in my garden, so I was interested in trying this nontoxic Safer product in my home.  I have a recurring ant problem--every year, the ants come inside when seasonal rains flood their outdoor nests.  From experience, I know that fine silicon dioxide powder, which is applied to cracks and crevices (and should not be inhaled), is hard to control.  Thus I was particularly interested in the Safer container with its built-in applicator spout.Unfortunately, the spout was a disaster:  whether the spout was wide open or almost closed, squeezing the container produced either no powder or great quantities of powder.  Afterwards, there was a lot of careful cleanup of excess powder needed--because the working powder must be kept dry, or else the target insects will not pick it up when they walk or crawl through it.Packaged in 7-ounce containers, this is a fairly expensive diatomaceous earth insect killer.  In the future, I think that I will stick withConcern Diatomaceous Earth Insect Killer, which I apply with a fine-tipped,  mustard/ketchup-type squeeze bottle (for example,12-oz. Squeeze Bottles).  I get much better control of the powder, and am able to apply it in small, even bursts, when I use a fine-tipped spout.
B000FLV9H2 For years, I usedSENORET CHEMICAL 300 \"TERRO\" LIQUID ANT BAITS BX6.  It worked extremely well.  Within 12 hours, all ants were gone.  However, my latest infestation was not responding to Terro, in fact, they were eating the liquid up, but it wasn't killing the ants.  My neighborhood Hardware Supply store told me that insects could become tolerant to certain pesticides.  I found the \"Safer\" product, but was skeptical.  Take off the spout cover and blast a fine white powder into the cracks or places where the ants are coming through.  For me, it was under two long baseboards in the kitchen.  Then I swept up the excess white powder into the cracks some more and cleaned the tile of any powder.  It worked instantly.  Any ants that even touched the powder immediately started to wiggle and die.  I have a cat, so I cleaned any excess up carefully, so she cannot get any on her paws, as it is very toxic.  It's as good as Boric Acid.This powder claims to kills Ants, Cockroaches, Earwigs, Silverfish, Crickets, Millipedes and Centipedes.  I did notice that immediately after applying this product, Silverfish started to appear, evidently sensing the chemicals.  Soon, they will be gone.  Do check it out.  I am SO glad to be rid of those ants (they even got into my freezer where I had chocolate!).
B000FLV9H2 This did work for me, but it took a few treatments and about 1/2 the bottle. We had a lot of rain around that time and that may have been the reason it took so many treatments to work. I had used other stuff, but within a week the ants would be back. This took about two weeks of continual treatments, but the ants are now gone from around my sidewalk. I can't say it killed them off, maybe they just relocated? But, they have been gone for almost two months and I credit this product for it.
B000FLV9H2 I like the idea of this product -- a safe way to kill crawling insects without using a strong pesticide.  The spout is also extremely convenient, especially when trying to get it into large cracks and crevices.  I'm a little apprehensive that the product only contains 79% of diatomaceous earth and that it does not say on the packaging that it is \"food grade\".  I have used this in the cracks and other areas outside, but I think I will continue to use food grade diatomaceous earth when using it inside because that's what I prefer to use around my dog.  It IS much easier distributing it with this packaging rather than using a spoon or scoop with the typical DE containers or bags.
B000FLV9H2 Although relatively harmless, earwigs are a disgusting looking insect and I certainly don't want them in my home. Three years ago after moving into our current house, we were overrun with the creepy crawlers. Apparently a combination of moisture and dark crushed granite (they like dark ground cover) was the perfect breeding ground for hoards of them. Worse yet, not satisfied with the great outdoors, they began crossing the threshold and entering the house.When it comes to pesticides, I look for natural alternatives. In my research, diatomaceous earth came up again and again as both safe and effective. Now I've been using it for three years and have found it to work beautifully and safely on both the small carpenter ants that appear near the outside of my garage and the earwigs that live around my back door.Because the consistency is like talcum powder, applying it is a little tricky. After trial and error, including the pointless purchase of an insecticide duster that spent more time clogged up than working, I use a hair color applicator bottle (similar to a classic ketchup or mustard squeeze bottle - thin cylinder with pointy spout) to have greater control when applying the powder. I do like the container the Safer product is packaged in because it will make refilling the smaller container I use infinitely easier.If washed away by rain or tracked away by humans/domestic animals, the powder needs to be reapplied.  Apply near the entrance into the house - the point is that they must walk through the powder. So, it isn't important to find their nest, just make it impossible for them to avoid the powder while trying to enter the house.If it isn't possible to catch them before they are inside, leave a little trail of powder on the floor where you have seen them walking. During my worst year with the earwigs I sprayed a small line of powder next to the baseboard by the back door. Within a couple of days there were no more earwigs. Again, it is important to reapply the powder, which is no different than most pesticides that wash away in the rain or lose potency with time. And, much as I wish there were a less messy way, I am not willing to sacrifice safety.The importance of the safety of this product for use in my home is why I have remained a loyal user. I have two older dogs, one with a terminal illness. The last thing I want around her with her weakened immune system are any toxic chemicals. My internet research revealed this product was initially used for worming dogs, (this product is not food safe, so please do not use it for any other but its stated purpose) so when the dogs or humans residing in this house walk through the product, there are no worries. Main warnings are that the product is an eye irritant and shouldn't be inhaled.In past years as the seasons moved from Winter to Spring and Summer I sometimes had difficulty locating diatomaceous earth. It was frequently out of stock -- I guess it was a matter of demand. Price is relative because when I couldn't find it locally, I paid much more than is being asked for this Safer brand product. In my household, diatomaceous earth is indispensible.After three years I am sold on this as a solution for earwigs and ants.
B000FLV9H2 If you are looking for a non-chemical way of dealing with bugs, Diatomaceous Earth ( or DE) is an easy way to kill them without harming anyone in your family or your pets. To your touch, DE feels like coarse sand, but to insects and slugs, it is like crawling thru broken glass. It will cut them and lead to dehydration and death.Since there are no chemical components, there is nothing for the insects to adapt to. And with no liquid component, you can puff it around electrical outlets without fear of shorting anything out. In fact DE works better in cracks and narrow access points because the insects will have to force their way thru it.DE is also great for your garden as you can use it on your crops without risk to you or your family. Puff it around the base of your tomatoes to stop cutworms and if you have slugs, fill a saucer with beer and surround it with DE. You will get them coming and going.
B000FLV9H2 This product works well. Kills insects and simple to use. Convenient squirt tip.Contains nontoxic Diatomaceous Earth, which is ground sedimentary rock that contains many diatoms. It's an abrasive powder, and it kills insects by scratching their exoskeletons.
B000FLV9H2 The recent unexpected blast of warm weather that his the Midwest has resulted in a similarly unexpected explosion in the insect population, including those least welcome in the house: Ants, silverfish, millipedes, wasps, flies, and more. I don't particularly like using the usual anticholenergics, as they're very toxic to humans, pets, birds, and insects you want to keep around, like bees and earthworms. I've used other non-toxic products in my garden- pyrethins, beneficial nematodes, and Bt, and many years ago I got a bag of diatomaceous earth from a friend in the water treatment business to treat my apartment for cockroaches.Diatomaceous Earth (DE) is actually pretty cheap, if you buy it in bulk (about $1/pound for the food grade product, and Safer will sell you the plain stuff asSafer Brand 5170B Ant and Crawling Insect Killer 4 Pound bagfor $4/pound), but the raw product is not an idea insecticide for home use. The problem is that it clumps up when wet, and is hard to disperse. What Safer has done is to mix DE with a silica agent to keep it dry and help it disperse better. So how well does this work in practice?It certainly disperses much better than the plain stuff. Using the dispenser, it's pretty easy to puff it into cracks and holes, or ant hills. I've dusted my basement, my bathrooms, my kitchen, and my back porch. After two days, I haven't seen any creepy-crawlies in any of those places. This might be because the DE has wiped out the bugs, or it might be because the temperature has dropped significantly since I dusted the place. Possibly both.I have no doubt this product does control insects- DE has been used for years to protect grain stores, among other applications. For me, the big question is the price- this product lists for over $34/pound, and even at the discount price it's 17 times as expensive as plain DE. Is the addition of a little silica and a plastic jar worth the extra? For most people, probably yes. If you want to mix your own, you'll end up spending $15 or more on materials, including shipping, and then you'll have to find the finely powdered silica. For the hard core do-it-yourselfer, it may be worthwhile to make up your own mix, but for most homeowners the Safer product is a reasonable deal.
B000FLV9H2 I own two cats and recently purchased a property in a wooded area. The first time I went to the property to look at it I noticed ant traps  placed randomly inside the house with a line of ants comically walking right past the traps so when I got my Safer Diatomaceous Earth Powder, I was excited to give it a try. I placed the powder in the openings by all the base boards. Application was effortless and not at all messy. I wasn't worried about the Cats because of what I know about how Diatomaceous Powder works. In a phrase, the evidence of ants was remarkably gone within the first three days. Since then, I've surrounded the house with this and made sure to get the seams that would be hard to get. My realtor noticed the absence of ant traps and we laughed that after all my hard decorating and moving, THAT is what she noticed. But hey, when you think about it, that's a pretty big deal!
B000FLV9H2 We have been having ant problem most of the year, bought this and the problem goes away. Ants no where to be found after one use.
B000FLV9H2 We have a really nice garden that now and then gets hit with slugs, ants, spiders, etc, however after using this powder we have cut their apperance in our garden by almost 100%. It is great to not have to battle different insects all the time and with different methods, this one covers most of them and gets rid of them. I am very happy to say our crop looks good and all our veggies and herbs are doing awesome with very little maintenance. We love this product, it works great! Definitely a buy!
B000FLV9H2 I received the Safer Brand Diatomaceous Earth Powder as a vine reviewer and knew that I would be using it shortly as spring was right around the corner.  And was I right!  We have a couple cracks by the door that ants and other little creepy crawleys seemed to find their way through all the time.The container says to coat a thin layer - or to lightly coat - depending on where you are applying (indoors vs out)  I found it very hard to use the \"puffer\" on the tip to actually apply a thin coat.  It came out in big puffs.  I tried adjusting the amount the tip was open and then nothing would come out.  So I ended up with thick spots of the powder that I had to spread out to be a more even thin layer.  Not a big deal, just kind of annoying when you think you can just puff out a thin layer easily.But the most important part.... it seems to work!  I haven't had any creepy crawlies entering since I treated the outside of the doorways.  I can't wait to use to to apply along our piles of wood where we get ants every year that try to eat our heat source to nothing!
B000FLV9H2 I really try to use natural products instead of chemical-laden ones. This has been a practice and passion of mine for over 6 years. For ant hills, I use boiling water. For the SC palmetto bugs, I was told when I moved here that natural, organic products just won't work. And after several months, I ended up replacing my previous solution with a chemical spray from the local big box hardware store.In my current townhouse (I rent), again, I have a bug problem. I feel as if I live inside the forest, and it's my understanding that when you live near a woody area the problem gets worse. It had been just about a year since the landlord used a chemical treatment and we would find 2 to 4 bugs (dying) each day for about a month. So the opportunity to try this product was timely since I was behind in treating around the inside and outside of my unit. I \"sprayed\" the powder around the perimeter of every room and up and down the stairs. I attempted to use it outside but just under 1/2 of the house is surrounded by a deck where there's about a 1/2 inch space between the edge of the deck and the brick of the house.I didn't find this product to be super effective for us. I had high hopes for it. Instead of finding half-dead bugs inside the house, I was finding live roaches (\"Palmetto Bugs\") running around. Combined with my fear of bugs, and it just wasn't working fast enough for me. I've had this product for over a month and I found no dead bugs. The closest I came to a dead bug was an upside-down one which couldn't turn itself back right-side up.I think it might work better in a home not surrounded by woods, or a home in a more moderate climate where the bugs were killed off over the winter. It just didn't work for me here in SC with the extremely mild winter and in a heavily wooded area.
B000FLV9H2 I have an issue with ants invading the kitchen in the spring. Previously I was using Maxforce pre-baited ant traps with little luck. Those traps came from a pesticide supplier, not box store junk products, so my expectations were high for those traps.The Diatomaceous earth product popped up on Vine, so I gave it a shot. First, the instructions say to apply it directly to the ants if possible. Kind of a strange instruction, unless you can see the infestation source, with ants that is next to impossible. I used the bottle to apply a boundary line to the kitchen sill above the countertop. Over night, there was a huge reduction in ants crawling on the counter, from uncountable, down to one ant scouting the area.The premise behind this product is that the diatomaceous earth cuts the ants with microscopic razor sharp edges and causes them to bleed out, or if ingested, it tears up the digestive tract. The ants seem to know that they can't cross the line, as they touch it with their legs and immediately turn around and continue looking for another way across the boundary line.One plus is that there are no warnings on the product about humans ingesting the product. Granted, I'd take all precautions not to do so, they only tell you not to breathe the dust for a prolonged period.The application method of the bottle leaves a lot to be desired. You can't get a good solid line laid without using a different application method.This really is a topical method, and won't solved any infestations as it doesn't treat the root problem in usage against ants. It is quite effective in creating a boundary.
B000FLV9H2 TL;DR: This diatomaceous earth got rid of bugs in my kitchen when everything else had failed to work.Long story: About four months ago, a friend gave me a plant from her garden.  It was very late when I got home that night, so I put the potted plant on the kitchen counter to remind me to put it outside in the morning.  The next morning, when I picked it up, I saw movement on the counter where the pot was--there were hundreds of mites, almost too tiny to see.  I got rid of the ones I could see, but it was too late.  There were plenty more somewhere in my kitchen.For four months they spread out across the kitchen and into the pantry, getting into anything that had a hint of sugar in it.  I threw away all the opened food and tried every bug killer I could think of, from borax mixed with sugar to just about every pesticide that was safe to use in my kitchen.  No good.When this arrived I thought I'd try a test before pulling the refrigerator and stove away from the wall.  (The instructions tell you to dust this where the bugs are found, and that's the only place left where they could nest.)  I took a piece of paper and put a ring of diatomaceous earth on it, then put a drop of honey inside the ring.  I left it on the kitchen counter, and I figured in a day I'd see if there were any dead mites on the paper.  (It's safe to leave on the counter because it's not a poison, it's an inert dust.  I wouldn't want to eat it, but if a little gets on my food it won't kill me.  The label warns: \"CAUTION: Causes moderate eye irritation.\")A day later, no mites on the paper.  I left it out another day in case they hadn't found it yet.The next day, there were no mites on the paper.  But as I cleaned up from breakfast I realized there were no mites ANYWHERE.  Not in the sink, which is where I usually found 20 or 30 in the morning.  Not dashing across the counter.  Nothing in the pantry by the baking supplies.  I sprinkled a little sugar on the counter--usually this would attract a dozen mites in an hour--and none showed up.  Since the honey had been absorbed into the paper, I scraped the diatomaceous earth onto a new piece of paper and baited it with powdered sugar, in case I've got a new round of mites waiting to hatch.Either they're gone, or they're massing for an attack on the neighbor's house.  Either way, I'm thrilled.If this is how well it works when not properly applied, for a bug not listed on the label, I can only guess it will do well on the bugs it's supposed to kill: roaches, ants, earwigs, silverfish, crickets, millipedes, centipedes, fleas, and bedbugs.Come to think of it, I buy a lot of used books and sometimes end up with books with silverfish--I think I'll make another trap for the bookcase.
B000FLV9H2 With all the rave reviews I really expected this would work but it has not worked at all for me. I've been using it for over a month now both inside and outside. I put it along the baseboards in the kitchen because we live in the tropics and we get a lot of ants, spiders and roaches inside the house. I left it there for three weeks, its really ugly and messy but I was willing to put up with that if it worked. I never found the first dead bug just lots of live ones so I finally gave up after three weeks and cleaned it up. I went and got new Combat traps and I found 5 dead roaches the next day! I decided to try this on ants outside coming in up the outer wall into the window frame. Same thing, did not get rid of the ants, none of them and we have three kinds coming in. I tried it on carpenter ants living in the crotch of a tree, it did not kill them they simply moved to another spot. Did not work on Fire ants either they walked right through it and two weeks later I found them about three feet away in a new mound. I checked my doorway this morning after 6 applications in 5 weeks and the black ants were just walking over this powder without any issue, they didn't even move after all those applications! So what does this work on? Nothing. So far it has proven useless here, so based on my 5 weeks of using this I cannot recommend it. All it does is move the bugs not kill them.
B000FLV9H2 Ants and anthills are a common nuisance in my neck of the woods and we are continually battling them both in the garden and inside the house. The Safer diatomaceous earth powder is effective on anthills in the lawn. I have sprinkled some of the product over an anthill (early morning or late evening is recommended) and the ants are gone in hours. However, I have noticed other anthills popping up short distances away so I'm wondering if they are merely relocating. I have also sprinkled some of the powder on our windowsills to deter ants inside the house. This also worked for a few days but we saw ants again a few days later. I will continue to use and monitor the effectiveness of the product but for now, it only seems to be a temporary solution.
B000FLV9H2 I have used similar products for years to keep ants and other bugs at bay around my home.  I like that the Diatomaceous Earth is not toxic to my dog or kids.  I was also told by a local store worker that if I called a pest control person to my home for ants, this is what they would apply to weepholes in the bricks.  Since then, I have done just that - sprayed the powder in to fill up the weepholes around the outside of my home, as well as lay down a line along any place where ants might be marching in (such as the edges of my garage door.)I have already been treating my home this spring because insects are already much worse than previous years due to the warmer-than-usual winter we had.  The Safer Brand has been just as effective as the other products I have used.  It keeps the ants and the spiders out, as well as other crawling insects - I'm not seeing any inside the house, that's for sure!My one and only problem with this product is the self-closing dispensing nozzle.  The hole is too large, and it clogged easily due to its design.  I had to squeeze hard or shake the bottle to get the clog dislodged, and when I did, an excess of powder often came out, causing unevenly treated areas.  As a result, this bottle ran out only halfway around the house!  The brand I usually buy has a nozzle that you trim off to customize your dispensing, and you cap it to close it (instead of being self-closing).  That brand's bottle is the same size as this and it lasts through about 3 treatments to my entire home, so I am going to be sticking with that brand instead.
B000FLV9H2 I used this along the perimeter of my front door, but since it's a powder, it scatters all over when the wind blows.  I don't recommend it for outdoor use unless you don't mind it blowing all over the place.  This product did manage to keep ants away, but I have yet to see any dead ants.  The tip doesn't really help with any sort of application precision...the powder mostly comes out in poofs.It might work at keeping bugs away in areas that aren't exposed to drafts.  I like the fact that it's \"earth friendly\" but I need something that I can line my windows and doors with and not have to worry about insect powder blowing AWAY from where I need it most.
B000FLV9H2 Well the ants was crawling out of the woodwork, I sprinkled some of this powder around and waited to see what would happen.  By next day, I didn't see any ants what so ever.  So I would say it worked.
B000FLV9H2 I live in New Mexico where odorous ants are a problem. I have used mostly boric acid based products with decent success. I've wanted to try diatomaceous earth for some time and after reading an article by a local pest control expert recommending it, I ordered a bag. I have so far been disappointed. I have only used it indoors and the odorous ants just march right through it with no apparent affect. I do suggest using a bulb duster of some kind to apply as it tends to clump when just sprinkling out of the bag. I like less toxic products and with four pounds of this I am going to continue to experiment and see if I get some favorable results. So far, unimpressed.
B000FLV9H2 I got this product quite a while ago but had yet to use it because the weather here in the Pacific Northwest has been so cold and rainy that I didn't have any bug problems. All good things must come to an end and Mr. Sun finally reared his head and stirred up those wacky, zany ants. Let me tell you, the ants must have been hungry after such a long winter because the ants came marching two by two, hurrah, right into my kitchen. Alas, I had Safer Brand Ant Killer which I had been dying to use. I distributed it evenly around my window where the ants seem to have carte blanche into my house. I put it both inside my house around the window and outside where they were making their grand entrance. I kid you not...within 24 hours I did not have ONE ant in my house. I'm not sure where they went, but I am assuming they ate this powder and went off to die somewhere. I highly recommend this ant killer. I couldn't be happier.
B000FLV9H2 I used this to help get rid of slugs in the garage.In the Spring/summer I come home to find them climbing up the garage walls. I put this in the space between the garage floor and walls and it worked great! Because I have pets I do not like to put chemicals down. The pets cannot get to the space between the walls and floors and it has no odor  or anything that would attract pets. It worked great for this application .Highly recommend!
B000FLV9H2 I'm afraid that I need to agree with the reviewers who had less than favorable luck with Safer brand ant powder.  I've had a ongoing problem with ants that come in through my kitchen door and window.  I used the product as the label directed, and applied both indoors and out.  It's been three weeks now and while I've seen a slight decrease in the amount of ants, they are still coming in.  It's possible that the ant problem might have been worse without it, considering the early warm weather.The powder is easy to apply and I like that it is safer than chemical poisons.  You do have to be careful not to inhale it when you apply it, but once it is down it doesn't pose a threat.  I just wish it were a bigger threat to the ants.  I think the product helped a little, but did not control my ant problem.
B000FLV9H2 I sprinkled some of this outside my front and back door to help keep the bugs out...went out the next morning and there was quite a few dead on the doorstep.  We are a ton of inch/silk worms all over the porches and it kills them too.  I love that is safe for pets, I have sprinkled their beds to help keep the fleas under control, it is working great.  I would definitely recommend this.
B000FLV9H2 Safer Brand Ant And Crawling Insect Killer, like any insect killer, is not that safe for humans and pets. It's main ingredient is Silicon Dioxide. Should you squeeze this super fine powder anywhere in your home- just remember breathing this dust, even in small quantities, over time can lead to silicosis, bronchitis or cancer. Children, the elderly or anyone with lung issues should avoid this completely. This fine dust becomes lodged in your lungs and continually irritates them, reducing your lung capacities. If you don't know anything about Silicon Dioxide, it's used for making glass fiber strands, among other things, and depletes water upon contact- thus drying out and killing the insects.I personally would never spray this super fine dust in my home, as who wants any health problems that could arise from silicon breathed into your lungs?  I'm sure it's safer outdoors, but I prefer those little metal ant discs that work well. The ants go inside, take the bait to the nest,  feast and die. I have found over the years that sealing up my home as best I can and dumping buckets of soapy water around the house works wonders. I never waste anything- after we wash the cars, the sudsy water gets dumped around the house. Soap, especially ammonia- makes bugs very ill. It won't kill them, but they'll find a better place to live after getting sick enough times. If bugs are a real problem, I'll use a liquid killer over a powder, as I can always wash my hands, but I can't wash out my lungs. When I read the label saying Avoid Breathing Dust and Wear A Suitable Dust Mask, I knew this product is not suitable for indoors and definitely not for me.
B000FLV9H2 As with many of our neighbors, we get ants in our kitchen in the summer regardless of how clean we keep it. Since they think it IS now summer due to the incredible weather we've been getting here in the North East the blighters are already making an appearance.I selected the Safer Brand 5168 product specifically because I'd read it was safe for pets and we have three small dogs. Now on the bottle it does say 'Hazards for Humans and Domestic Animals' but the warnings are light; 'moderate eye irritation' for example. Nothing to imply a trip to the doggy emergency room would be needed if ingested. The manufacturer's website even states in more detail about the the product when it comes to domestic pets and seems very confident in the safety of it. Now my wife is a chemical analyst and she saw the product's description stating \"Diatomaceous Earth is made from a patented formula containing amorphous diatomaceous earth, known as silicon dioxide.\". Her reaction - 'That's sand!'.So surely sand wouldn't kill ants? Well let's find out. My first trial run was to find a plant pot on our deck that had a horde of ants under it and so I sprayed them. The product itself is a floury powder and puffs out in fairly uncontrollable clumps as you squeeze the bottle, but the moment it hit the ants they freaked out and basically immediately died. It was quite shocking at how effective it was and a home run for a first go. I waited a couple of days and we even had rain yet no more ants came back to the treated area.I then decided to treat the patio door on the inside of the house as that seemed to be where most of the ants were entering. After dumping several clumps against the entire rail of the doorway I used a small brush to even out the treatment neatly across the skirting board. As this is a heavily trafficked doggy door I kept an eye on the dogs to ensure they didn't mess with it and you know, they didn't pay it any attention at all. The few ants that were there reacted in exactly the same way as the ants under the pot; shuddering instant death. Since then there have been no more ants in that area.I'm frankly blown away by this product. Not the fact that it works, and it does really work well, but the fact that it's safe to use indoors. Of course the ants will almost certainly find another way in but in the meantime I'm going to squirt under the dishwasher, stove, fridge etc and then outside. Should any come elsewhere in I know I have a safe product that will deter them at every step.Brilliant item.
B000FLV9H2 I was disapointed to find that the reaction to this organic substance did not meet my needs.I have an ant problem in my house near where I keep my parrots.The population seemed to be less but the substance did not erraticate the ants.I am also concerned about pets that could injest poisons.Ironically a covering of table salt in the doorway and along the wall seems to confront the ants digestive symptoms and keep the pests more at bay.I used to use the typical ant traps with the poison that is spread to colony,but I am against chemicals that threaten my household pets.
B000FLV9H2 I dont know how it will work on killing bugs but I can say its not at all easy to apply. I mostly got clumps here and there. I guess I had hoped it would come out evenly. wear a mask when you apply it, it goes all over even when you try to be careful and slow. I hope its worth the work to apply.I will update later.
B000FLV9H2 We have an organic yard. No pesticides, herbicides, chemical fertilizers, etc. I have used food grade DE in the past with good results and this product is no exception. I specifically applied this products around the exterior of all doors and windows to the house (30 yr old house with plenty of openings for bugs) to help cut down on the number of ants that make it into the house interior. It worked beautifully and the interior ant problem was completely cleared within about 4 days after applying this product.My only gripe is the puffer applicator which tends to dump too much product at once. I just chased each puff with a small handbroom to disperse the product more evenly.I would buy again.Was this review helpful?
B000FS5YDA I don't have a ready source of hickory and I felt guilty at first for not finding some and making my own chips (saving a few bucks)! But, I ordered these anyway and I'm glad I did, 2 pounds is a lot of chips! These chips are small and relatively uniform. They work very well in my small smoker box. Properly soaked in water prior to grilling, they provide adaquate smoke for direct or indirect grilling on my propane grill.
B000FS5YDA I bought these hickory chips to use in my masterbuilt electric smoker. the chips work very well they give off a nice smoke and flavor. the chips are just the right size for my smoker & I'm happy with the results these chips give. there is not much else to say about these wood chips. they arrived dry there was no musty smell to them they cost more then our local store charges but they were sold out. would I buy this again probably not just because of the price of the 2 pound bag if it was a 3 pound bag then I would buy again.
B000FS5YDA I just got a new electric smoker that Iove. The only problem with these &#34;chips&#34; is that they are pretty big and barely fit in the bin.  More like small chunks to me.
B000FS5YDA good smoke taste
B000FS5YDA I've used these in my Masterbuilt electric smoker. Best if soaked for 30 minutes.  Easy to use; enjoy the flavor; glad I bought them.
B000FS5YDA These work very well and smell great. I will be interested to see how long the bag takes to go through. Use them in a very nice cast iron smoker box I bought on Amazon. So nice to have the added touch of the outdoors to my meat.
B000FS5YDA I figured all hickory chips are basically the same; these prove that they're unfortunately not.I used Kingsford hickory chips (green/tan paper bag) all last summer in my old Weber, and grilled up some of the best BBQ chicken I've ever had.I recently ran out of the Kingsford, and picked up these Charbroil chips at the hardware store.I used the same technique as usual (soaking chips, putting in tinfoil, placing on coals, let smoke for final 15 minutes) and the flavor just wasn't the same. Not bad, per se, but not nearly as tasty as the Kingsford. These chips imparted a slightly more bitter, smokey flavor, instead of the stronger hickory flavor of the Kingsford.Unless I just got a bad batch, I would say you should go with a different brand of chips; I recommend the Kingsford.Happy grilling!
B000FS5YDA Works great.  Pieces could be a little bigger, many of them are not much more than splinters, so they don't last long.  Soaked and then wrapped in foil helps.
B000FS5YDA If you like mesquite smoked meats then of course you need to make mesquite smoke. These chips do just that.
B000FS5YDA How do you rate chips of wood?  These are chips not chunks, which is what I wanted.  Chunks are available and are a different product.  They certainly produce smoke in my smoker, they certainly are hickory.
B000FS5YDA This is great!  Its just like a big old hickory tree, only in itty bitty pieces and in a bag!  They smoke, they flavor your food, what more could you ask for????
B000G0KAG8 After pricing over 20 benches, I landed on this one as my choice. It looked great online and the price was lower than smaller benches I'd seen in stores. Still, it's always a little iffy buying something online, so I was a bit skeptical.This bench is beautiful and strong.  Mine was packed really well: despite a corner of the box getting crushed, it came in without a scratch.  Easy to build: took me about 15 minutes and that was moving slow due to the heat. The bolt/cam construction is simple enough for a child to figure out. Very sturdy: easily could hold three adults weighing under 190 pounds each.All in all, it's a great find and I have no trouble giving this product 5 stars!
B000G0KAG8 This is an excellent value, with 2 caveats:- Actual bench is not as shiny and glossy as the Amazon photos. It has a light brown matte look to it, not the rich shiny orange look that's in the photo.- Wood slats for seating have no give, so they are quite hard on bony butts. If sitting for a prolonged period, you may wish to use a padded cushion for extra comfort.That's it for the negatives. The attractiveness and simple elegance of the design is what drew me to this bench. It looks great, even if it isn't as shiny and oiled up as the Amazon photos make it out to be. It is real, solid wood (scientific name: Dryobalanops, sold under the tradename \"Kapur\"; product origin: Vietnam), not veneer, laminate or MDF, so the $[...] price tag is reasonable.Assembly is somewhat painless, once you figure out the diagrams. There are no text instructions, and some of the drawings can be a bit confusing. It can be assembled by one person, although having an extra person hold the ends makes it a lot easier. If going at it alone, you just have to assemble it with the back resting on the floor. Sturdy and solid once all the bolts are tightened, it seats 3 people with room to spare.It looks nice in my TV room and I expect this bench to last me a long time.
B000G0KAG8 I really like this 3-Seater Bench. It will make a great addition to my patio and can't wait to sit back and relax on it once warm weather get here.The bench was very easy to assemble, (I'm not handy at all, usually attaching pieces backward or upside down and having to go back and repeat several steps to get the thing to come out right), and even I had this together in under an hour. I'm sure someone who knows their way around a screwdriver could slap this together in about 20 minutes.The bench come in 6 pieces, the seat, the back, the two arm rests (sides) and two support bars that the seat sets on. You get all of the tools needed to assemble the bench with the screws and bolts. While the printed instructions aren't great, there really aren't enough pieces to make assembly difficult.The bench is made out of a compressed, plastic like material. But that's not to say that it looks cheap, it looks great, almost like a distressed wooden finish. What I like about this material is that it will withstand the harsh winters and thunderstorms for years to come.The bench is very solid, but not too heavy, so that you can move it easily. It's also very comfortable, I think I may pick up some outdoor cushions at some point, but that's just personal preferance. If you want to add a nice piece to your patio or decks, I highly recommend picking up this bench.
B000G0KAG8 This bench looks amazing.  We've had it in our garden area and had to move it to our deck so it would be more pronounced visually - it's that rare piece of yard furniture/equipment that you actually want people to see!It's also quite comfortable - we're using it without any pads, and have had no complaints sitting on it for an hour stretch.Not much (anything) bad to say about this - it was very easy to put together (4 pieces that you screw together), and just as easy to take apart if you need to for winter storage.  Was shipped/padded nicely, no missing pieces...Would highly recommend, especially over those cheap wooden/iron slatted benches that you always find in home improvement stores for maybe half price that look bad and wobble/sway when you sit in them, and last about 1 season.  This one is built better, looks nicer, and is going to last much longer.
B000G0KAG8 I just purchased a second bench, after owning my first Strathwood three seater bench for almost a year. Our original bench sits outside on our deck in direct afternoon sun and is holding up very well (the bench is only slightly protected from rain by a bit of an overhanging eave).  The finish on the bench is very attractive, and the bench itself is so sturdy and easy to put together that we decided to buy a second bench to use inside our house in an enclosed walkway between our house and our garage.I also recommend the cushion for the Strathwood three seater bench (we bought the Pearwood color - a nice green - the first time around, but this time we're purchasing the less expensive Neutral color). The 20 inch accent cushions in Pearwood are also very nice, and while they seem tough enough for outdoor use, we only leave them out on weekends when they see the most use.  Important: Strathwood's price on this bench and the two seater bench have radically changed (up and down) over the span of a few months, so for the best deal track the price over the course of several weeks.  For instance, just before Christmas 2008 this bench was under 100, then after the holidays it jumped to nearly twice that (170, I think).  Right now, it's slightly above the Christmas price, which is why we're buying another one.  Recommended!
B000G0KAG8 After hemming and hawwing and comparing and studying, I decided to go for it.  There are a lot of choices online at all kinds of prices. I bought the Strathwood 3 seat bench on a Friday morning and Fedex delivered it to me within 22 hours, on a Saturday and at a $10.00 shipping charge.Assembly was simple for the two of us:  15 minutes and no tools required.  The finished product is attractive, comfortable, and quite sturdy.  What a perfect purchase!  Thank you Amazon, as usual.
B000GA7ZO8 Stops cabbage worms but you need to apply every 2 weeks or so to get the new eggs that are laid by the white devil moths.
B000GA7ZO8 so far i sprayed one evening and I don't see any caterpillars, but I'm sure I'll have to do it more than once.
B000GA7ZO8 I wouldn't recommend spraying this on everything - after all, caterpillars turn into the moths and butterflies that pollinate our gardens!But if you have a plant that's sustaining caterpillar damage, this is the most specific spray available to combat only that pest. In organic gardening, specific is better since you're only killing the pest that's a problem and not the bees and beneficials in the garden.I've been using Bt for years on roses and fruit trees with caterpillar issues. It's always preferable to just replace any susceptible plants with a sturdier variety, but if you have one or two that need help, this is the way to go.
B000GA7ZO8 I've used various Safer products for over a decade, generally with success, and this product is one of my favorites.I like this spray because BT (bacillus thuringiensis) works.  It kills  caterpillars and doesn't wreak havoc on the environment.  This is because the active mechanism -- the bacillus -- is found naturally in the great outdoors, and Safer only concentrates it.The way it works is that caterpillars eat the bacillus, and this causes them to lose their appetite.  Within a day or so they die.  I've always begun spraying a day or so before I expected my usual outbreaks of, let's say, tomato hornworms.  My plan was to be ready to 'poison' the small guys so that they'd never get to be the destructive big guys.  Worked exceedingly well.THE SKINNY:::Safer Brand Caterpillar spray works great.  It acts to stop the caterpillars from feeding and it doesn't harm beneficials, like bees!Though safer than most gardening products, do READ the instructions.One of the things you want to consider is that Bt breaks down in sunlight.  I therefore, always shook or sprayed in the evenings. (I think the caterpillars are nightowls anything)Do give this a try.
B000GA7ZO8 Works well for getting rid of those nasty tomato horn worms.  Kept them from destroying my tomato plants.  I sprayed them at the first sign of the pests.
B000GD3L0C This product is unnecessary when competitive products from the same company exist -- such as the Tomcat 34532 Mole and Gopher Liquid Repellent, 32-Ounce.Tomcat's bait pellets need to be administered directly into the tunnels of the creatures. You need to be aware of the environmental impact it might have on birds, and the fact that it will be lethal to other animals, especially birds and pets. As if that wasn't enough, caution should be exercised when handling the pellets since they are extremely toxic and poisonous.Why attempt to kill the creatures when it can backfire and cause harm to the humans and pets and other wildlife, when a successful repellent solution exists?
B000GD3L0C I've had a garden for the last couple of years at my current residence without any signs of moles or gophers until this year.  After noticing that a few of my bean stalks were beginning to die I began to investigate.  That's when I found a mole tunnel running around and in my garden near the bean stalks.  I had just received this mole & gopher bait  so I put it to the test.The directions are clear, although very small, and easy to follow.  Use the pointed end to poke a hole in an active trail and put about a tablespoonful of bait, cover and wait for it to work.  Well it's been two weeks now and I haven't found a dead mole or gopher but there are no new trails or dying plants in my garden.  Did the bait work or did the critter leave?  Not sure but I will use this again if I find another mole or gopher making trails through my yard or vegetable garden.
B000GD3L0C At the time of writing this, the product information is wrong on Amazon's product page.The following is said on Amazon's product page:Tomcat Mole and Gopher has a unique bottle design for easy applicationReady-to-use pelleted baitNot for sale in north Carolina or New HampshireActive ingredient Zinc PhosphatePelleted bait per bottleA mild laxative for the lubrication of the intestinal tract.For use on horses, cattle, sheep, swine, and dogs.MINERAL OIL - SIZE: 1 GALLONThe information about this product being a mild laxative for lubrication for horses, cattle sheep, swine and dogs is incorrect and for a completely different product. This product is a bait for moles and pocket gophers and will kill animals. Hopefully Amazon will change the information soon. I will update this as soon as the information is corrected.The Tomcat Mole & Gopher Bait is a Zinc Phosphide based bait and comes in a very handy application bottle. The shape of the bottle is intended for poking holes into the active burrows so you can a tsp. Amount of the bait into the hole. The bait looks like rat or mouse bait. These types of pelleted baits look like many feeds like our mini pig's so be sure and keep away from pets.
B000GD3L0C I cleared some drybrush and trees from the slope behind my backyard for fire prevention.  The gophers that were digging countless holes in the hard dirt of the slope decided to relocate to my backyard lawn.  It is &#34;ON&#34;, varmints!  I've tried gopher repellents, gas bombs, traps, solar spike deterrents, and baits, with varying results.  Why not give this Tomcat Mole and Gopher Bait a try?Dislikes:*Difficulty in locating lateral and main tunnels of gophers.  Lateral tunnels are plugged and concealed near the mounds while main tunnels branch out from the mounds.  Both types of tunnels can be founded with careful probing but my lawn's clay soil is too moist and usually just collapses rather than leaving a distinct tunnel.*Main ingredient is Castor oil.  The gophers I'm trying to eliminate are smart as hell and were not killed by this bait.*Unsafe for families with young children, pets.*Unsafe for the environment, e.g., wild predators such as skunks, coyotes, or hawks may eat the poisoned/dead gophers.Results:*I followed the instructions precisely and applied the bait to fresh lateral and main tunnels that I could find.  For the first two weeks, the gopher activity seemed to have ceased.*During the third week, gopher dug new bigger holes near the original mound (gloating that the bait didn't work).*There was a dead gopher found floating in my pool after the fourth week.  Uncertain whether it was killed by the gopher bait or just accidentally drowned while running across the backyard.Overall:Did halt the gophers for two weeks from digging holes near the original site but the damn critters simply branched out to other locations.  Uncertain on the effectiveness of the bait to kill these critters fast before they have another litter.  Now is the time to call a pro.
B000GD3L0C This product is designed to be user friendly once you have located and identified active burrows. According to the label, it is important to make sure that you put the bait underground and not topside in and around garden areas where food might become contaminated. The bait is useful for pocket gophers and moles only.I have a good sized backyard (about 1/2 acre) that is full of these critters and finding which burrows were active took a little bit of time. Once located, you use the pointed tip of the container to poke a hole into the tunnel (you can also use a rod or stick to get deep enough) and then, using a measuring device that you can discard, drop about a teaspoonful into it. I put a flat stone or piece of cardboard over the hole but I don't fill it in after putting in the bait. I always wear waterproof latex gloves whenever I'm using anything like this and you'll definitely want to use them if you find any dead moles.I've not seen measurable results yet from using the product on what I think are active tunnels, but will update with any new info.
B000GD3L0C I&#8217;ve got critter problems this year and moles tend to be a constant. And as a result I&#8217;m trying a few different things. My usual castor oil concoction is nothing like this and so I found myself checking out the ingredients. The main ingredient is zinc phosphide, a far cry from my inoffensive castor oil. I do want to drive them off the property, but what I don&#8217;t want is for other animals to ingest it.We do have other animals who trespass and I&#8217;m using other &#8220;stay away,&#8221; but natural methods. What I don&#8217;t want is for other animals to dig for this in hopes of a nice snack. Not that I like the presence of red squirrels or chipmunks when they invade my home or outbuildings, but don&#8217;t want to use this very toxic poison. Think I&#8217;ll take a pass on this one.
B000GD3L0C The container that is depicted is completely different in color and in the writing. Also, the contents do not look like the ones shown in the online version. However, the container I have does say it is mole and gopher bait. I have a lot of holes in my yard so I poured some of the contents of this bait into each hole. I have not seen any dead gophers or moles. Neither have I seen any new holes. So, I give this three stars for no new holes.
B000GD3L0C I have noticed a difference in the hills in my yard since I started using these. I have not seen any dead moles but I think that they might be dead under ground. Way less holes and hills.
B000GD3L0C Had several mole holes in front pasture.  Followed instructions and dumped some of this down some of the \"active\" holes.  Six days later, I have 14 new dirt mounds where the moles have come up.  Maybe I got one of them, but there are 13 others?  I'm guessing it just didn't work...As far as the description here goes...you might want to skip reading it.  For example, what exactly does \"For use on horses, cattle, sheep, swine, and dogs.\" mean?  If eaten, this would kill each of those animals...Didn't work here, maybe others will have better results.---------Update 6/10/2014-----------This stuff DOES work, as when walking around the front orchard, a dead mole was laying there in the yard.  So, perhaps not all the moles will eat the stuff (still have fresh looking dirt hills), but it at least one did, and is dead now.  Kind of feel bad for the little guy, though.  Lost its life for doing what it's supposed to do.  Won't be using this anymore, I'll hire the guy with \"Mole Trapping\" signs around town instead.
B000GD3L0C I tried this around the same time I tried to TomCat Mouse attractant. I had no luck with the mouse product so I didnt have high hopes for this. This actually worked a little better. It took a couple of days but it did get us a gopher. Unfortunately, it was just one and I know we have several more. The others haven't been as interested in the bait.
B000GD3L0C Well, I bought two of these and used as directed, and the moles just continued to destroy my yard.  Save your $10 after shipping and get rid of your yard's grubworms.
B000GD3L0C The problem with these products is that you can't ever really be sure it is working. We used it according to the directions and have not seen any new tracks on the ground. We assume that it is working but it is hard to tell for sure! As of today we haven't seen new activity since we put the bait into the mole holes, 3 weeks ago. I will continue to use this as long as we don't have new tracks, because I assume it is doing what it is supposed to do!It does not work on pesky chipmunks, we still have those running around wild, they ignore the bait.
B000GD3L0C I got this to help get rid of the gopher that are taking over my yard.  This product is very easy to use and seems to be working so far as the hills don't seem to be growing in number.  I hop that this is the case as it is hard to know if it is working at all.  That is the one problem I have with this is that you don't really know if it is working or not.
B000GD3L0C Gophers are a constant problem for us, and these baits help somewhat. However, over time the gophers seems to wise up and learn to avoid baits. I don't think anyone has come up with a surefire solution in our area.
B000GD3L0C The thing with moles and gophers is to try to prevent them before they get a foot hold in your yard or garden. I ordered this anticipating that we would use it as soon as one of those nasty little mounds appeared showing that we had visitors. But in the meantime, we've been using Scotts-Tomcat BL34784 4LB Mole Repellent and haven't had an issue so far this year, and we haven't put this stuff down because we don't want to attract the critters when we don't seem to be on their radar at present.What I can say about this product is that the bottle does, in fact, make it appear that this would be easy to apply to mole or gopher holes with a minimum of fuss. The product description does lead me to some confusion though. It indicates, under two separate bullet points that this product is, among other things, &#34;a mild laxative for the lubrication of the intestinal tract&#34; as well as &#34;for use on horses, cattle, sheep, swine, and dogs.&#34; I'm baffled as to how to interpret that except to say that I'm keeping it away from my pets.
B000GD3L0C These pellets are applied directly deep into the tunnels of moles (I don't have gophers).  Highly toxic, gloves should be worn during the application process.  You should also wear gloves when you remove any dead moles (or gophers) that come to the surface.  This product should never be used in a manner that other birds, wildlife or pets can get too it.  Nor should it be used in garden spaces or other spots where edible food is grown.Now, with all that said, if used as directed and placed deeply into the tunnels, no harm should happen to any creature other than the mole.  We put this into tunnels that were in high traffic foot paths (human) and it took about 3 days for the tunnels to begin to collapse.  They have not returned.All in all, this product works and works well.  Just follow the cautionary statements on the label and follow the instructions to the letter.
B000GD3L0C Recently I was the first time host to a nasty mole population, using Tomcat I ended their visit.Carefully read & follow the simple instructions and your pests will be gone as well.It's very simple, the pointed tip is handy for punching holes in burrows and the effective pellets are perfect for your visitors snack.Your Gophers will love this Tomcat treat too.Bye, Bye Gophers & Moles
B000GD3L0C The poison pellets are small enough to conceal in gopher-attracting baits, such as a stalkof celery.  I've learned over the years that slicing a stalk of celery length-wise, theninserting these pellets into the slit will attract, then kill the pesky rodents.The absolute best poison I ever used was corn kernels soaked in a greenish poison, but thisproduct was discontinued because dogs, cats, and birds were attracted to the corn.  This gave me theidea to attract gophers using celery or any tuber veggie.  Dogs and cats will ignore thisbait, but it sings dinner to gophers.I have no doubts that the plain pellets will kill gophers, but they sometimes will pass rightby  a pile of them.  They don't ignore veggies baited with poison.
B000GD3L0C This product works reliable, and I would have to say that that this has become of trustworthy brand.  I feel rather sorry for the moles and gophers, though, so....where avoidable, I will not be baiting them.
B000GD3L0C I was surprised by the 'Use Restrictions' so I decided to list some of them here ---------Directly from the package label:~~Must be applied directly into the burrow or tunnel systems.~~Do not apply in gardens & areas where food or feed may become contaminated.~~Any person who retrieves carcasses or unused bait following application of this product must wear waterproof gloves.~~Do not apply this product by the use of an artificial burrow builder.Do not refill this container.This product is extremely toxic to birds, fish & other wildlife. Wildlife feeding on treated bait may be killed. Dogs, cats & other predatory & scavenging  mammals & birds might be killed if they feed upon animals that have eaten this bait.--------As you can see this product is highly toxic. Strictly adhere to the instructions & do no be careless when using this product.The moles in our yard were very, very active last year. Thankfully, this year we haven't seen any active tunnels.  After reading this product's cautions, we won't be able to test its effectiveness. There are too many pets in our area.  I am sure this will kill moles, as long as you can get the product into active tunnels without causing damage to the structure.
B000GD3L0C This Tomcat product works well and easy to use. I didn't have any moles in my garden thus far.
B000GD3L0C We have moles.  This bait seems to be working... there haven't been any new mounds in a week so that's promising!  What I don't like is the applicator on this bottle, it collapses the tunnel too much, and we have to crouch down to use it (hubby has has back surgery, and I get dizzy if I kneel down and stand back up).  I do prefer the Yard Butler GBA-1 Gopher and Mole Bait Applicator because I can remain standing when using it.  But the Tomcat mole & gopher bait in the bottle, it seems to work!
B000GD3L0C This does work.  It's an easy product to use and the important thing is that it does work.  For now, the problem is gone and when it returns, I'll just use more of this.
B000GD3L0C Well it's a little hard to tell if this is working or not because how does a person know how many moles they have?  It is, however, very user friendly.  I like that the bottle has it's own spike to just plunge it into the ground and that I didn't have to get my hands dirty with either the ground or the pellets.
B000GD3L0C These are ready to use pellets that can be used directly on to the mounds dug out by moles and gophers. Lately there has been relatively significant traffic of moles under the soil in my yard. I have tried a wide variety of traps and poisons for moles, but not all of them have worked, but this one works if you follow the instructions correctly. I think some reviewers have expressed regrets over this product not working for them. The trick is that you have to plant these pellets where the pests can see, and generally in their traffic paths or tunnels actively used. I use a hard wooden stick or a metal rod to pierce a hole in the mound and detect the tunnel, and then drop a teaspoon full of pellets. Generally the holes are below the surface and the stick gives a reasonable measure of where the tunnel is. There are hits and misses, but you have to follow it up at least once a week to see if there is a new mounds in the yard. Apply there and wait for couple of days to see the results. Be persistent, it is a tiring procedure, but it works.On the lesser side of this mole \"poison\" is the product description on Amazon.com product page. It is a little confusing to read that this is a mild laxative and used for horses, cattle, sheep and dogs. Is this product (zinc phosphate) not poisonous? Then how is it killing moles and gophers? Why Zinc Phosphate is banned in the states of New Hampshire and North Carolina, if this Zinc Phosphate is the only active ingredient of this product?
B000GD3L0C This is easy to use and you just need to find the tunnel to place the bait. The hardest part is waiting to see if it works. So far no signs of gophers. We have tried a lot of other methods. I wish I could avoid poison but they are destroying the yard so I am trying whatever I can.
B000GD3L0C It is difficult to tell for sure if a poison bait works for underground pests...but we have had moles here for 25 years.  I have tried all type of traps both from Amazon and various other traps and poison worms etc.  This product seems to stop the mole runs from appearing so quickly in the spring.  I have baited mole runs in 5 different locations on all side of our house (we have sandy soil and shade trees and a jillion worms) and it seems to have slowed them down some.  The moles are not kind enough to come up to the surface to die so you can be certain, but judging by the ground broken by mole runs, it seems to have killed some of them, so am happy with the product, not sure why they would eat this since they feed on worms, but I don't care about the science, only to get rid of these earthworm eating pests.Price is low, application is easy, and much easier than traps.
B000GD3L0C I don't understand what's in this.  The bottle isn't very clear. Says it's Zinc Phosphate but is that toxic to gophers? I've avoided using gopher baits with strychnine as it can also kill birds, and other wildlife.It does seem to work but I would be more comfortable knowing what exactly the ingredients are.
B000GD3L0C You don't have to wait long to see this product work.  You put it near their holes and they come and get it very quickly.  After that, your problem will go away quickly and you don't have any new holes.  It is an effective, easy, and fast product.
B000GD3L0C I like the application of this bait, as it directly can be applied to burrows, tunnels and holes. I am hoping to squelch the activity that is taking a toll on my lawn! Time will tell.
B000GD3L0C At first I thought this product might be awesome -- the idea is that you find an active mole tunnel (the directions tell you how to determine that) then you use the pointy end to open a hole and then put some of the pellets into the tunnel so that the mole will eat it and die.However every time I used the product as instructed the moles never returned to that tunnel. I think this was for two reasons.First the test to find an active tunnel is to push said mounds done then check to see if they are back up the next day... the process of using the bottle's pointed end though also collapses part of the tunnel and if I were a mole and my tunnel had a collapsed section two days in a row, I'd find me a new tunnel (which is what they seemed to have done).Second the process of making said hole to pour the pellets into not only collapses the tunnel around it but actually blocks off the tunnel at that point.  Once more the moles just made a new tunnel.Very disappointing.
B000GD3L0C Moles generally breed in February and March and, within approximately 42 days, have 2 to 5 young that leave the nest in 30 to 45 days. Moreover, moles are quite hardy. This seems to be the crux of the problem and why they are so difficult to get rid of.According to Wikipedia, &#34;The mole runs are in reality 'worm traps'; the mole senses when a worm falls into the tunnel and quickly runs along to kill and eat it.&#34; This is the principle behind a number of mole-killing products. Where I live (the northeast), spring is finally here (as of April 11), and last year's traps have emerged from under the snow, though the ground is still frozen. Last year, I bought the Victor Out O'Sight Mole Trap, and later the Talpirid Mole Trap (both available from Amazon, though I bought them too late last year to be effective). Now I have this product in my arsenal. I also acquired Tomcat Mole Killer Worm Formula (which emulates their favorite food). I set one trap and will set the other and put out the bait as soon as the ground thaws a bit. It will be interesting to see which products are most effective this year; I will update this review with the results (and adjust the number of stars accordingly).We never had a mole problem until late last summer. I suspect the reason has to do with an infestation of white worms, which are grubs that live under lawns or other landscaping and become a type of moth. They brought skunks around the neighborhood to destry lawns, and now moles have arrived.It's too early in the year for me to say whether this product works, but I like the theory, and many of the comments from other users lead me to believe this will be an effective tool for getting rid of the moles. It was suggested to me, by the way, to use latex gloves when handling traps or especially a product such as this--for two reasons. The first is obvious: this is poison. The second is that moles have a sensitive sense of smell, and their &#34;food&#34; should not smell like people. This may be the reason that this product hasn't worked for some other users.No mole solution is 100%, but I feel optimistic about this product (this may be spring talking). I like the fact that it can be simply &#34;injected&#34; from the bottle into the mole runs. It's certainly a lot simpler than setting traps. I will update this review in a couple of months with the results.
B000GD3L0C My main goal with moles, gophers, voles is to keep them away from my hosta beds. I have some hostas that were getting big and quite lovely and they seem to attract these underground critters. I have tried many techniques - solar stakes, juicy fruit and all sorts of concoctions.The pellets that we put into the tunnels themselves seem to work the best. It doesn't necessarily keep them out of our property, but as long as it keeps them from damaging my hosta beds, I'll continue to be a happy camper.I have been reusing this bottle with the pointed tip with refill pellets - saving some money.
B000GD8M2E I purchased this folding table for my small deck, where I wanted to have a table but space is at a premium because I have a patio garden.  This table works quite well as it is easy to fold up and store in the corner of the deck when I don't need it.  The only negative is that if you want to move the table when it is in the open position it should not have anything on it. The table folds in the middle during any movement (see attached photo).  This is a bit inconvenient when I use it on the deck to put down a cup of coffee or a lunch plate. It would have been better if the table had a latch on the side to stabilize the top when it is in the open position.I am attaching a collage of 3 photos under customers photos to aid in this review.Photo #1 shows the table next to a ruler, the table top is at 20\" from the ground.  The table comes in a nice clay color. I put a piece of white paper on top of the table, so you can judge the color better.Photo #2 demonstrates the folding flaw I mentioned earlier. I just grabbed a side of the table to move it, and you see how it folds in the middle causing anything on top of it to slide or fall.Photo #3 shows how the table opens from the folded position: first lift the two side of the top and then slide them together. As they slide the legs automatically extend.This table works well when space is limited, and I have enjoyed using on my deck. If it had a latch to stabilize the open top position it would have been perfect. As it stands now it gets a 4 star rating: good but not perfect.Ali Julia review
B000GD8M2E Came all scratched up but its OK because we are using outside. You get what you pay for but I think this is only worth about $5.
B000GD8M2E This table was cheap enough to buy a few for a party outside. It didn't look too cheap and matched my rocking chairs. It's lightweight, so wouldn't use for anything heavy. It collapses very easily, maybe too easily, which is why I took 1 star off.
B000GD8M2E This is a nice little table, but a little to short for what I wanted it for.  I should have read the measurements.  I purchased it to go with the Adams Bistro table and chair set and wanted it to set beside the table to make the table set a little longer.  It is a nice side table though, but to go beside an outdoor chair or lounge.
B000GD8M2E Perfect small side table to use for cups and other lightweight items. It is short and it isn't the most sturdy table, but for the price you can't beat it. It gets the job done.
B000GD8M2E Wasted money. We bought a couple of these 10-12 years ago for $8 each and they were great tables! Haven't had to replace them until now as they do eventually degrade in the sun like all resin/plastics do.However, THE PICTURES SHOWN HERE ARE OF THE \"OLD\" MODEL!!! but what you get is a very cheap and flimsy newer model. The top of the old ones were smooth and of thicker plastic. The tops of these are so flimsy and thin you can see the ridges where the top is molded to the support brackets underneath.While it doesn't affect sturdiness (or lack thereof), the bottom supports shown do not extend beyond the legs. I mention this only to show you the difference between the \"really great\" tables and the newer \"really cheap and flimsy\" tables.STAY AWAY from these, especially if you're thinking you are getting the same quality tables as they used to be. These are nothing more than a cheap knock-off version of those old, very good tables - very sad. We're so disappointed. Considering these were $10 MORE than the old ones, I was really hoping to get the same quality stuff. Fooled us this time, won't fool us again. We're staying away from anything with this brand from now on.
B000GIIQFC Corona is my number one choice for quality gardening equipment that lasts and doesn't give out after just a little use.  I love my gardens and I enjoy working with good equipment, that gets the job done with little effort, time after time.
B000GIIQFC We have a 1 acre back yard with lots of trees and shrubs, and for a while I'd been thinking about getting a chain saw.  But when I started using this Corona saw, I realized that this will do just about ANY job.  I've cut through huge tree trunks with this thing in a couple minutes.  It throws the sawdust while the strokes take minimal effort.  This is a razor-force-multiplier and not your grandfather's \"traditional\" saw.  I also often used it like a machete for smaller branches.  Corona makes at least 3 models, and this one is sized in between.  I use this one most often, followed by the largest one with the wood handle, and then least often I use the small folding razor saw.  If you buy just one of them, then this is the best size to get for a quick grab-and-go tree trimming escapade.
B000GIIQFC I've used this Corona pruning saw fairly extensively.  It cuts faster and more easily than any other of my pruning saws with the possible exception of a Bahco bow saw.  But unlike the bow saw, the Corona fits in tight places, like when pruning deadwood that's inside a hedge.  The curved shape of the blade provides extra \"bite\" and is a good feature.  The cutting action is on the pulling stroke, which is highly effective and keeps the blade from kinking.  The handle is well-shaped to feel comfortable and secure.  In sum, this Corona saw works very well and is recommended.
B000GIIQFC This saw cuts through tree limbs so incredibly fast - it is unreal.  I have a ~35 fully size pine trees on my property, and I always reach for this saw when I need it.  I have small electric powered chainsaw too, but honestly this Corona hand-saw cuts through 3, 4, 5 and 6-inch diameter limbs so quickly with such a small amount of effort that I hardly ever reach for the chainsaw.  It cuts on both the push and pull strokes to double the cutting speed, and the curved action really helps the forward and back strokes \"catch\" even better.  On the forward stroke, the back part of the blade closest to the handle really digs in, and then on the backward stroke, the curve makes the front teeth on the blade really dig in.  I have had mine for about 4 years, and can't tell you how much use it has gotten all-the-while the blade seems as sharp as the day I got it, and I have done no maintenance to it whatsoever.  I've never sharpened the teeth, and I have given this thing a beating and it hasn't declined in performance at all!  Even with pine sap along the side of the blade, this thing hasn't had the slightest amount of rust anywhere on it.  It looks like I will probably get another 20 years out of this incredible saw, as it's holding up better than I could have ever imagined.Seriously, it's 20-seconds and probably 20 full strokes to rip through a 4-inch diameter limb.It travels so well too.  It is as light as just 1 pound probably.  I kept the cardboard blade cover.  You can grab this saw and walk around the yard with hardly even noticing that you're carrying it.  The shape makes it well balanced, and it isn't awkward at all while climbing ladders.I have used it cutting for hours straight, regularly just throwing it to the ground after a cut, and the red handle makes it so easy to find among the cut brush.
B000GIIQFC Zips right through limbs and makes a smooth cut every time.  Corona makes good tools.  I have had a pair of hedge clippers for about ten years made by Corona and they work well, too.
B000GIKXXU THis is the chainsaw that always starts!  I gave away my gas chainsaws. It was the first Black and Decker 18volt tool I purchased. I Love this because I can get a lot done trimming around the farm. I have the alligator lopper and some others that I have purchased so I have batteries for extended use but the chainsaw and I usually run down and need recharging at the same time so it works well. I highly recommend this because my friends are buying them for their husbands because they are always borrowing mine for cleaning up their property.
B000GIKXXU But in reality, for the price \"I got mine for $89.99\" it's hard to beat.It'll make 12-14 cuts in a 4-6\" oak branch before the battery gets low. Good enough for what I want.I have the later make as mine does not have the auto chain/bar oiler. Fine by me as again it's just made to trim and do small jobs so oiling the chain every 10-15 cuts is no big deal.Mine did not come with the allen wrench needed for the guide bar plate but no biggie here as I have tools from many different saws etc.
B000GIKXXU I have the B&D; 18V chainsaw-on-a-pole, which appears to be essentially this item on a long adjustable pole.  It is really good at trimming small to medium thickness branches from trees, then slicing up the branches to make them easier to haul off.  But the pole is so long (even when shortened as much as possible) that doing radical shrubbery pruning didn't seem like the right task for it.  I saw this item and thought it would be a better fit and besides, it came with a new 18V B&D; battery which I could use with my other B&D; 18V stuff.  So I bought it planning to seriously reshape some overgrown holly bushes... cut them down a good two feet, square off the tops, square the sides, neaten them up.  I thought this would go through them like warm butter.Wrong.  I guess it's the holly bushes that are the problem but this poor saw kicked back constantly as soon as it touched a branch (mature holly bushes have a lot - I mean a LOT -  of very sturdy branches embedded in them).  It didn't kick back enough to be dangerous, but enough to convince me that I had chosen the wrong tool for the job in, oh, thirty seconds or so.So I should give this a 5 for sawing through small limbs (I think I did that for the on-a-stick version) but if you have serious thick and mature hedges and you want to do major surgery on them, this may not be the best thing.  Since that's why I bought it, I gave it a 3.Apologies in advance: I've been taken to task on another review for downgrading a product because my expectations (hopes?) didn't match what the product did.  Just trying to convey my experience here, not trying to offend anybody.
B000GIKXXU This is an excellent, QUIET tool for yard clean-up and pruning. designed for branches in the 1 1/2\" - 2 range, also good on 3\" and 4\"ers.  Advertised as capable of 150 1-1/2\" cuts on a charge--and I believe it!--Have cut up to 6\" logs with no problem, although that does drain the battery quickly. A 6\"er is, by volume, the equivalent of at least 16 1-1/2\" cuts, and with the extra drag of cutting across a 6\"inch face, is probably more like 32 cuts. Use this tool for what it's designed for, and it won't disappoint! Why is that negative reviewer talking about cutting 2x4s? that's what your circular saw is four! do you also drive nails with your screwdriver?PRO:  Lightweight, no noise, no stink, no fuel!CON:  it does leak oil. minor irritation.
B000GIKXXU Got this primarily to cut branches about 4\" in diameter.  It gets it done but it takes a little time.  I've never used a chain saw before so don't really have much to compare it to but this just seems okay.  For brances 2-3\" or smaller I'd just use the long-handled branch cutter thing I bought at Home Depot, it just snaps them right off.  For bigger than 4\" I think this saw would struggle too much.  So that leaves a pretty small range of usefulness, in my opinion.  The main thing that got me to buy this was that I already have a bunch of the 18v B&D products and I need a couple extra batteries anyway.  I got this with the free-extra-battery promotion so got 2 and the saw for about the price just the two batteries would have cost me.  No real loss, and I will use the saw for those occasional 4\" branches so it's all good.
B000GIKXXU I wasn't sure about trying a battery chain saw but I'm glad that I did.  This machine holds it's own & has done quite a lot of work in my overgrown, tropical backyard.  It is easy to hold and use.  I like the safety mechanisms built in so there is no chance of injury.  Very happy with this chain saw.  Worth while for small yard use.
B000GIKXXU I rated this saw a 3 due to the battery life. Regardless, it is a handy thing to have for cutting stuff your lopping shears will not muscle through. I have been using this to cut firewood for my evening fires in my fireplace. I walk across to a vacant lot which has a bunch of fallen trees and I cut up a wheel barrow load if 4-8 inch logs. It runs out of juice about the time the wheel barrow is full. This is plenty of wood for an entire evening at the hearth. Make sure you push the chain lube button regularly.....this adds to battery and chain life. The really nice thing about this cute little tool is the absence the forest raping noise my Husky 460 gas powered saw would make....plus it is super light weight. I also strap this to the back of my dual sport motorcycle when exploring lesser used forest trails. It allows me to open up some otherwise impassable sections of the trail blocked by fallen trees. For the money...quite a bargain....but no match for even the smallest gas powered saw.
B000GIKXXU I'm changing my review as when I got the chain saw it wouldn't cut anything.  One of the viewers replied saying they thought the chain was on wrong.  It looked ok but I did as recommended and it worked.  Wasn't happy about a brand new saw right out of the box was set up wrong.  It's been cutting since the change
B000GIKXXU Black & Decker CCS818 18-Volt Cordless Electric Chain SawThis saw actually seems to exceed the normal B&D; build quality.  I found the saw well constructed and thoughtfully designed.  If you are planning on trimming off small branches it does a nice job on up to 2\" diameter branches.  If you plan on cutting anything larger you want to have a large number of charged batteries handy.My 12\" Remington electric chain saw, model LNT-2, died in the middle of a bush stump of roughly 7-8\" in diameter.  My initial annoyance abated when it occurred to me that I have had the little beast for possibly 20 years so it provided service well beyond what one could expect for such an inexpensive tool.  The overheated burning smell was some catastrophic failure.  (Yes I did have plenty of oil in it.)Ironically I now have 4-12\" chains, two of which are freshly sharpened and no chain saw on which to install them.I borrowed the B&D; saw from my son.  It worked fine but I again caution you that the battery life is truly dismal.  I had three batteries and all three ran out of juice well before the first one could recharge.  The stump was within the saw's rated capacity but it took 5 battery recharges to cut the whole way through.In summary, a good trimmer, very light, can easily be used one handed (although that is not ever recommended), very quiet and reasonably priced.  Do not expect that it is a useful replacement for even something as simplistic as my old Remington LNT-2.
B000GIO0NY I was really surprised at the quality of these clippers. Given the price, I was expecting a somewhat low-end product, but Corona really did a great job with this.The handles are steel and can be extended with a simple twist. They lock in at any spot with a positive click - very secure. The grip is very comfortable to hold using gloves or bare hands.The best part are the blades. They are forged rather than stamped, and come with a very sharp edge. After a fair amount of use the blades were still razor sharp. It also has a notch at the base of the blade for cutting larger stalks - handy for when you don't have hand pruners handy.The blade is straight and non-serrated, so it will be easy to re-sharpen when needed (I highly recommend the Istor sharpener). Has bumpers to minimize the jolt to your arms and shoulders when using it for long periods.I normally use a powered trimmer for my shrubs, but wanted a hand one for small jobs. This is so comfortable to use that I hardly use the powered one anymore!Now, this is a homeowner-grade model -- there's a reason why Felco or Bahco cost a lot more. But, unless you're a landscaper or have acres of shrubs, this will perform nearly as well as the pro brands at a fraction of the cost.Corona also makes other hand tools with the same locking extendable handles. I have the mini rake and find it to be an excellent performer as well. Note that Corona also makes a cheaper version of this with stamped blades. Spend the couple (and I do mean just a couple) of extra bucks and get this one - the blade will last much longer and hold an edge far better. I also looked at some of the Fiskcars (sp?) and found the build quality to be far inferior to this model - handles felt very flimsy, and not nearly as easy to use.Almost makes you look forward to cutting the hedges!
B000GIO0NY The landscaping in front of our house was terribly overgrown, so I popped down to Lowe's in search of a solution. Other than having no idea how to actually trim a hedge -- my wife says the result of my hard work this weekend belongs in a modern art museum -- these shears seem to be a pretty solid and useful tool. They're not too heavy and they powered through most everything I threw at it. I didn't have occasion to use the telescoping handles, but it's good that they are there in case I do ever need them.I looked at theFiskars 9178 Power Lever 10-Inch Steel Handle Hedge Shears, which were also available at Lowe's. These Corona shears open wider, which gives you more cutting power, but the Fiskars were less expensive. If you're looking to save a few bucks, the Fiskars will probably do a fine job.These shears are made in Taiwan.
B000GIO0NY If you're short, or even if you're not, trimming tall hedges can be a pain, because you have to get up and down off the ladder and re-position it every few minutes of work. The handles on these shears extend another foot and a half to keep you on solid ground and OFF the ladder.This is also helpful if you're gardening from a wheelchair or in a seated position.Now, a caveat - this pair of hedgers is for solving a very specific problem. These do not cut through thick branches or ornamental grasses easily like the Fiskars Powergear Hedgers I use in other situations. Nor are they the most lightweight hedger around.I ONLY recommend these for hedging leafy growth that is a little taller than you can ordinarily manage - for that, they do an excellent job and mine have lasted many years doing just that. For other tasks, my favorite is still theFiskars 9189 PowerGear 9-Inch Hedge Shears.
B000GIO0NY I used these to cut down some heavily overgrown ivy and it did so perfectly.  Easy to use and cut with.  I also like the fact that they are extendable, even though I haven't needed to extend them yet.  Overall, I'm happy with them and would buy them again.
B000GIO0NY I have used this product for a year, and it is still going strong. It needs to be cleaned after each use to prevent discoloration. I also sharpen it frequently to maintain its edge.
B000GIO0NY This thing chopped through my bushes and small tree branches like nothing. I love the extendable handles, although here and there they wouldn't stay locked in place so I had to relock them.  But other than that it's a great clipper and I love the fact that I can sharpen them if they ever get dull.
B000GIO0NY I bought these for my mom, who is an avid gardener.She seems to be happy with these and her yard continues to look immaculate.
B000GIO0NY The notch in blade for pruning is super - No shifting back and forth to prunersfo somewhat thicker branches/growthThey have had theirs for years - Length of blade is very good -Well worth the money -
B000GIO0NY I needed hand shears to trim some bushes around my house.  Because some of the bushes are hard to reach, I liked that these have extendable handles.  It takes a little more muscle to clip bushes when the handles are extended but the shears are sharp so it doesn't take much time to get the job done.  They don't clip real thick branches but are perfect for keeping up with unruly hedges and bushes. I like the manual shears because I feel I have more control over what I am cutting.  The extended handle is a bonus.
B000GXPDD0 I agree with another reviewer on here, D. Fowler, who acknowledges the usefulness of this product while questioning its value vs. just using a little bit of peanut butter. Trust me -- peanut butter works fine.However, I imagine there are situations in which you wouldn't want to use an edible foodstuff for the bait, and in these cases, this stuff might be the way to go.
B000GXPDD0 This works okay on top of the snap trap mouse traps, but one does wonder if this is necessary. Using peanut butter will yield you the same result, without the hassle of buying this product. I know that some other reviewers are reporting quicker catches with the attractant than without but I haven't seen any significant improvement in activity based on using the attractant vs the peanut butter.
B000GXPDD0 I'm not sure since I try to keep the pests out by placing1 Pack Dispos Bait Station, Mouse Bait Station 8 Ref and bagged pellets from the Co-op underneath my home and in sheds and places mice like to habitat.  The ever faithful wooden snap traps are my least favourite method of attracting and getting rid of mice.  I only use them as a last resort as I hate having to dispose of the catch.This mouse attractant is a green gel substance that is easy to place in traps where bait is normally placed and is relatively mess free.  I did attempt to smell of the substance but can't tell what, if anything, it smells like.  It's not offensive to my nose.  This is the first time I've used this type of product.  So far nothing has taken the bait but it is summertime and I don't usually see a lot of mouse activity in my home this time of the year since the warm weather outside is to their liking.
B000GXPDD0 As I write this review, I can hear little critters scurrying around between the floors above my office. I have also seen mouse droppings on my kitchen counter. I baited aTomcat Snap Trapand aVictor Electronic Trapwith this attractant, and placed one trap in each area. So far no mouse has taken the bait.Up to this point, I'd say this product is a dud.
B000GXPDD0 I used this with the Tomcat Spin Traps, which I received at the same time.  I'm not sure whether to blame the traps or the Motomco Gel Attractant.  There are mouse droppings in the areas where I placed the trap and I'm certain we have mice, but after almost two weeks I have yet to catch a mouse.
B000GXPDD0 We don't seem to have very many mice but we do get one every now and then. Maybe more than one, it's hard to know.  It's not easy getting them to enter our traps. Sometimes they come in after nuts, but I haven't had luck with cheese. In any case, I usually have several traps set and weeks go by without catching anything.I put a small amount of this gel in a live trap, which is basically a plastic box with a door that swings inward but not outward. (I am not terribly enthused about these traps so I also use old-fashioned wooden traps and some fancy electronic ones.) Anyway, a few nights later I heard a mouse scratching inside the trap. It was caught all right, so we transported it to a place on the other side of a lake... not that pleasant in the dark but at least we now have one less mouse.This is said to be non-toxic, a plus in a house with pets. The MSDS for this product shows that it is not toxic in all ways listed.
B000GXPDD0 I'm not sure what is the ingredient is in this mouse attractant but it claims that while it's irresistible to mice, it's non-toxic to children and pets which is important to me. I think peanut butter works great for mouse traps but you really don't want to sit out peanut butter in certain areas of your home like on carpet, etc. Then again, in those areas, I'm not sure I would want to set a mouse trap either. Peanut butter is effective and cheap but I can instances where I would prefer to use the Tomcat mouse attractant.It also states that it is a water-soluble gel won't stain carpets or clothing.  It's easy to use the squeeze bottle.
B000GXPDD0 I assume this smells like mouse pee to mice or some sort of mouse pheromone. It has no odor that I can perceive though I need to be careful since it is about the same size as a bottle of my nasal saline moisturizing spray.  In any case it is neat and easy to use and convenient for baiting my mouse traps.
B000GXPDD0 I&#8217;m not the person on mouse duty in my house or outbuilding.  My husband does the varmint control and does things like set the traps.  Emptying them is certainly not my cup of tea.  We rural and get a lot of field mice, especially in the barn where they tend to nest.The weapon of choice has always been simple traps, but every now and then when we get a lot, my husband has opted for poisons.  He tried this Tomcat Mouse Attractant, but still prefers the old peanut butter method.  Why?  It&#8217;s simply a lot less expensive and works equally well.
B000GXPDD0 When I first read the description I was excited that this was non-toxic, so that it would be safe around kids.  And then I remembered that peanut butter (unless your kid has a nut allergy) is probably much safer.  This does seem to be a bit more stable (doesn't dry out as quick) but it's pricey and it means keeping yet another thing around.  It doesn't seem to be any more effective in my experience.
B000GXPDD0 The wife saw a large mouse, thought it might be a small rat, but it was just a pregnant mouse.  I loaded 4 traps, 2 with the gel and two with peanut butter.  It took a week, and I thought the mouse must have headed for greener pastures, or was holed up with her babies, but last night we got mommy and daddy, one with the gel bait and one with the peanut butter.  The gel bait on the unsprung trap had dried, so the big gal must have had to work at it and finally sprung the trap.  The smaller mouse had stepped on the trigger.  See the vid I put on the trap review if you like, it's just for proof.
B000GXPDD0 not sure why this works, but it does. He just scored a little pea sized AB on your regular old fashion mouse trap and wait for it to attract mice. I used it to catch mice with.Wooden Mouse Trap (Set of 2)
B000GXPDD0 SInce I have watched a mouse run right past a trap baited with this gel, I don't think it works particularly well. I am still doing better with the traps baited with good old fashioned peanut butter.
B000GXPDD0 We used this next to a trap with peanut butter and it is already working better and you only need a small drop in the middle of the fake cheese square on the trap.
B000GXPDD0 You just squeeze this attractant on to your regular mouse trap.  It is used instead of peanut butter or cheese.  It is very easy to use and I have already caught a mouse so it seems to be working so far.  It did attract one mouse to the trap and the trap caught him.  I just used a small drop on the trap.
B000GXPDD0 The bait seems to work fine on one of Tomcat's mechanical snap traps, and had me catching mice shortly after deploying the traps. I'm not sure it's any more effective than peanut butter, which I've also used successfully in the past. It's a bit easier (quicker and cleaner) to get on the trap, but you can sure get peanut butter a lot less expensively.
B000GXPDD0 I have a number of traps in my garage and I put this on a few of the mechanical ones and I haven't caught any mice so I can't confirm if it works or not. So far based on the results I would say it doesn't, In the past I used to try peanut butter. This stuff doesn't smell to bad, it is non-toxic which is nice and very easy to apply. I will continue to try this to see if I catch any critters.
B000GXPDD0 I have two wooden mousetraps in my garage with peanut butter on them and have successfully caught over 100 mice with it. So for me, I don't see the need to purchase this product when peanut butter is something I always have on hand.
B000GXPDD0 I used this with both the wooden Tomcat mouse traps and with the Tomcat Rat trap.  It works.  Both species were attracted to the bait, and both species ended up dead in the trap.  You can't ask for more than that.  Their claim that it works better than cheese or peanut butter has been proven, at least in my case.
B000GXPDD0 We use a couple of different kinds of live mouse traps and have had great success with peanut butter on a cracker as bait. I recently saw the TOMCAT Mouse Attractant Gel and it seemed like a possible substitute for my time-tested favorite. This TOMCAT product is manufactured by Motomco in Madison, Wisconsin, only a two-hour drive from where we live. It comes premixed and ready to use in a 1-ounce (net weight) plastic squeeze bottle and you only need a small, pencil eraser-sized amount to bait a trap. It can be used with equal effectiveness in the vintage wooden traps, plastic snap traps and a variety of live traps.The following promise appears on the TOMCAT Mouse Attractant Gel packaging:\"TOMCAT Mouse Attractant can enhance the effectiveness of any mechanical trap. It has a desirable, gel-like consistency and `no-mess' spout making it the ideal alternative to cheese or peanut butter. PLUS, its taste is irresistible to mice and rats while being non-toxic to children and pets.\"Better than peanut butter! After putting this mouse attractant to the test against peanut butter on a small piece of cracker I came up with the following results: (1) The TOMCAT was easier and less messy to apply and (2) both baits were equally effective at attracting mice.Any bait that can match the effectiveness of peanut butter is a product I can recommend.
B000GXPDD0 I've used mostly peanut butter in mouse traps, with variable success. Sometimes it catches mice, sometimes they'd eat the peanut butter without setting off the trap. No such problem with this stuff- it really sucks the mice in and it's not something they can remove from the trap. I was amazed at how fast it worked. (My cats thought it was worth investigating, too, so don't use it on a snap type trap where cats can reach it!)
B000GXPDD0 This product works reliable, and I would have to say that that this has become of trustworthy brand.
B000GXPDD0 Certainly much easier to use than cheese or peanut butter and I've baited our two Motomco traps with it. However, we've yet to capture any mice so I cannot as yet attest to how effective it is. With Winter finally gone and much more animal activity there's a much better chance we'll have some little visitors and, if so, I'll update my review accordingly.
B000GXPDD0 I have had good success with peanut butter or almonds, but I rarely have either on hand.  This gel is shelf stable and very convenient.  It doesn't make a mess and sticks to the trap, so it is easy to load.  The color is dark green, which makes it easy to see if the trap still has bait.  I can't say that it works better than peanut butter, but I prefer using it.
B000GXPDD0 I normally use peanut butter in my Jaws traps.  This doesn't seem to attract any more mice than the peanut butter does.  It is more convenient to use - just add a couple of drops of the attractant rather than getting out a popsicle stick or something for the peanut butter. It does seem disappear from the traps, I assume by evaporation as the mice shouldn't be able to drink the liquid.  I have caught mice using it, but I also have just by putting empty Jaws traps along a wall I know they run alongside.  I will continue to use it, but doubt if I will buy another bottle.
B000GXPDD0 While I normally use peanut butter, I thought I would try this product out to see how it compares.  It is very easy to use as it is just a matter of squeezing the tube and the goo comes out to be placed on the trap.  So far, no mice have bitten the traps with the gel, but I am sure in time they will.  An old jar of peanut butter may be a lot cheaper, but using this one can keep his hands clean.
B000GXPDD0 I armed a trap that claimed to not need bait with this, and got no mice. I have no idea why... we only had one mouse that I saw, so it's possible the mouse went away. It's still out there waiting, just by my compost pile where the mice like to live. I have not seen the mouse so maybe it moved off????? Oh well, they will come back, we are by open fields, there are lots of mice out there.
B000GXPDD0 I put this in several traps in an area where I know rats are (my attic), but it didn't attract any rats. That's pretty much all there is to say.
B000GXPDD0 I live near a river and some woods as a result mice and other wildlife are abundant. Mice will often make it to my outdoor shed, my garage and my basement. My shed has also been home to larger rodents.I usually use peanut butter to bait traps but that can get messy. In addition I have had rodents eat the peanut butter and not set off the trap.  All you do is place a couple of drops on the trap.  The box says it is good for rats as well as mice. I am not sure how long it lasts on the trap before more need to be used.I used this in my shed and did catch a couple if mice with it using the old fashioned wood spring traps.
B000GXPDD0 While they are most active in the fall, I get field mice all year round.I've used about every type of trap except glue boards, which seem to be pretty inhumane. Never used a product like this, however.It is a dark green gel-paste that sticks to the bait cell of any trap that uses peanut butter or any other type of bait.To test it, I put out 2 snap traps, one with peanut butter, one with this gel. The peanut butter caught one sooner.Now, that isn't very telling, as it could just be the location of the PB trap.This is easier to use because you just squeeze out what you need. It isn't messy or runny.Maybe it isn't exactly crack for mice, but is is indeed a good product.
B000GXPDD0 This gel mouse attractant really attracts mice! No doubt about that. And it doesn't contain poison, so I don't have to worry if any of my other animals inadvertently get into it. A small amount the size of an eraser on the tip of a pencil is enough to bring them to the trap. The rest, of course, is the difficult part. Getting rid of the little critters from a live catch trap or disposing of the little dead bodies from a kill-type trap. Not fun no matter how you look at it, but unfortunately necessary. My only complaint is that the gel seems to be drying in the bottle and is increasingly hard to dispense each time I use it even though I keep it tightly closed between uses. So, 4 stars. I have learned a lot about directing mice to the trap, like covering the metal bottom and sides as much as possible, putting up barriers that funnel the mouse toward the entry to the trap. So my mouse-trapping skills have improved and along with Motomco's attractant I hope to be able to get the little critters out of my storage shed and chicken coop. Wish me luck!
B000GXPDD0 Our trap quickly caught a mouse when we used this attractant, but I have no reason to believe that it works any better than cheese or peanut butter which has also proven effective for us at attracting mice and larger pests.  In theory, it is cleaner and easier to apply this to your trap than to use real food, but in actual use, real food isn't that big of a deal.  Splitting an American cheese single four or six ways and baiting your traps is just as quick and easy as using this attractant.Bottom line: It works, but there is no compelling case for using this instead of what you were using before.
B000GXPDD0 A weeks worth of data comparing snap traps baited with this, and with peanut butter.Upside, dogs do not seem to be attracted to this, unlike peanut butter.  It seems to be harder for mice to remove from the trap.Six snap traps, 3 with peanut butter and 3 with this bait for 7 nights.  The peanut butter caught a total of 4 mice and the gel a total of 3.  This is not a statistically significant sample, but it does show that it works.This will be more expensive over the long run than generic peanut butter, and like the peanut butter you should store it someplace where the mice cannot get it (I use an old glass canning jar with a metal lid).People seem to have mixed results,  I wonder if it is the type of mice they have.Not sure why they are calling this &#8220;new&#8221; since the first review is from 6 years ago, maybe they have changed the formula?
B000H1PGYW I tried just about all the woods not and this one is probably my least favortie. There is nothing wrong with the quality of the product, it's just a little too harsh for my taste buds. But everything else about the product was ok.
B000H1PGYW If you shop around you will see that with prime this price is hard to beat.  I like using mesquite while smoking and when I want a little more tang in the smoke flavor.
B000H1PGYW While these chunks add a great hickory flavor, they are a little on the large side. They need to be sized, so you can maintain a more steady heat, otherwise they can get too hot and flare up in a hurry. Some were also too big to fit under my water tray. I was able to size them with a small hatchet quite easily.
B000H1PGYW Hickory not native to my area, but like smokey flavor from wood. Propane grills need larger pieces than charcoal grills so the hickory chunks are ideal.
B000H1PGYW The wood chunks worked great. and I have since found Pecan wood chips that work good on pork tenderloin. Yummy!
B000H1PGYW Some chunks are huge and some are more reasonable sized with one-inch dimensions. I found that when using charcoal lighter fluid to start the chunks, the smaller ones started quickly while the larger ones started on only one or two sides and never did ignite on all sides. For that reason, the smoke from the chunks was significantly reduced.I will not buy Char-Broil apple wood chunks again and will use apple wood chips and charcoal instead.
B000H1PGYW Have not use yet but looking forward to trying these in my new Acorn Kooker.  Great price and quantity on this product.
B000H1W8FC I love to cook and am in my kitchen hours upon hours everyday (I also have a cooking blog.) That said, I was intrigued when I first saw this product. It looked like a pretty serving tray, but it could be used for cooking too? I had to try it, and I love it! I made pancakes on it first and although I must admit, I was scared to try, they did not stick with or without butter.Its also useful for warming food up in the oven and since it's metal, it retains the heat after it comes out of the oven, and no need to change to a serving platter, because this griddle is a lovely serving tray too.Being a cook who has almost every kind of kitchen appliance, gadget and tool, I think this would be a great gift for such a cook, but also wonderful for the more average type cook. Highly recommended!
B000H1W8FC I've always admired the Wilton Armetale products when I would see them in stores. They are very attractive so I was excited to get this griddle and try it out.Upon receiving it, I first did a little research on the types of metal used in the production of this piece. I was a little concerned with the use of aluminum which I try to avoid for health concerns. I decided to try it out despite my concerns because I figured this would be used occasionally and not daily.It fit right on 2 of my burners. I made a couple of grilled cheese sandwiches using plenty of butter. They stuck horribly to the griddle. It was quite a job to remove the stuck on food. This was just the bread itself sticking too and not cheese which is odd, I've never had a problem with bread sticking to my pans, especially since I used butter. I also tried making saut&eacute;ed onions and peppers with plenty of oil. Again, horrible sticking and cleanup was a bear.I've decided between the use of aluminum in the product and the sticking that I'm going to use this as a large and very pretty trivet and tray. I've found it nice to place on the table and set dishes on. I also sit it on my counter and place a lit candle on it.Pricey for just a tray or trivet but it is quite attractive. I recommend using an old-fashioned cast iron griddle. You can't beat them.
B000H1W8FC This is lightweight and just the right size for our gas range. You need to be cautious when moving and watch what you sit it on but it is a very nice griddle. Big enough to cook for two or more but only takes up two burners.
B000H1W8FC We like to have a hot breakfast for the kids, and they often enjoy having scrambled eggs, omelettes, and pancakes.  Making these in frying pans can be time consuming, and there is just so much more you can do with a big griddle surface to cook on.  This Grillware griddle is a great solution that fits over 2 burners and enables you to be a short-order chef in no time.  The bottom of the griddle has an engraved pattern that I presume ensures the heat spreads out evenly on it, and the top has a nice cook surface with decorative edges.  It worked great on our gas burner.One note - the first time we used it was a disappointment.  Things didn't seem to cook well and it was just so-so.  What we found is that the more you use it, the better it becomes.  I knew you had to \"season\" cast iron, and it appears the same is true with aluminum as well.  You'll never get it 100% clean either, but once it's been used for a few meals, it becomes an awesome tool for those hot breakfasts.
B000H1W8FC This is a good additional serving platter for entertaining.  When I just put out some cheese and sausage to nibble on with crackers, I put the meant and cheese on this; it seems to at least give the impression that the food stays cooler (it is a chunk of metal).I haven't used it to cook with, because I don't want to mar the finish.  I'm not sure how it would work from stove to table -- it would burn the heck out of the table if you set it down, and the little feet are farther apart than any trivet I own.I cook on both a gas and glass stove; I don't believe this would conduct well with a glass stovetop.Overall, for serving it is recommended.  Not willing to take the risk and use it for a griddle; it is too nice for that and you couldn't take it to the table after griddling anyway!
B000H1W8FC I have tried using this griddle to prepare several different types of dishes, but I have yet to have a single dish that did not stick to the griddle and make a mess. And since you can only hand wash it, the mess is even more a problem to remove.As one of the other reviews said, this is better used as a serving dish or the keep food warm, I cannot recommend this griddle as cookware.
B000H1Y4EK This is all it's cracked up to be. On full, it is very powerful. Takes some practice herding the debris. I like it.
B000H1Y4EK I live in the desert and the windy days bring a lot of debris into the yard.  My yard is all rock and it's very tricky to clean the debris without getting down on your hands and knees and picking up each piece.  However, this baby picks up everything and my yard looks great.  You do have to take the time to learn how to pick up the leaves, etc. without picking up the rock but it works perfectly when you do.  Worth the money.
B000H1Y4EK While the unit is a bit clumsy, thus 4 stars, it works very well in either mode. Seems to have all the power needed. Does a great job of chopping up leaves in the fall that I use for mulch.
B000H1Y4EK This blower is really powerful. It pumps out 235 miles per hour worth of wind. It only weighs 7 pounds, but if you turn the adjustable speed dial all the way up, the force of the wind creates resistance to holding it, which is equal to some weight. My old Ryobi provided 140mph winds, and it was the most powerful in the store of the handhelds at the time. This Toro feels twice as strong.Now onto what bothers me. I had to buy a 100 foot extension cord, 14 gauge required, and that ran me $[...]. The consolation is now I have a general use extension cord that I can use for \"around\" the house. After dealing with the cord, having to move it around things, I realized that it was more work than the old gas model, with unlimited portability. So what I did was look up here on Amazon the top seller in gas models, and it was theFactory Reconditioned Homelite 26cc Gas Powered MightyLite Backpack Blower (Non-CARB Compliant) #ZR08580for only $[...]. They only get a limited number of the reconditioned ones, they ran out before, so I snagged one up. I always dreamed of having a backpack, now at that price it seemed possible. So I ordered one, after reading the 3 positive reviews. I will be reviewing that one once it arrives today.So what did I do with the Toro? I kept it. For such a little bit of money, how can you not have the best? I went and bought a 50 foot 14 gauge cord for 19 bucks. By wrapping it around the handle, and permanently attached it to the Toro with a plastic cable tie, I can control it with one hand.I plan on using the Toro for the garage and driveway, mid week, blow the leaves out type of job. The backpack will stay in the shed for when I cut the lawn, or want to use it for an extended time to blow leaves in the fall. Hey the Toro outperforms the backpack in that regard in 2 ways.1) It produces 235mph winds, as compared to 180mph with the backpack. 2) The Toro has metal blades, and the leaf mulching capacity, whereas the back pack says no mulching and bagging leaves. It simply does not do that. On the other hand the Toro not only does it, it purports to reduce leaf bulk with a 16:1 ratio. They even include a leafing bag. So all in all, I am keeping both. Hey if I get a friendly neighbor, in the fall, while I am back packing, they may want to join in with the more powerful electric. Two is always better than one. If you can get around the cord nuisance, this Toro is a no brainer. Besides it is way quieter then my old Ryobi gas model, so the neighbors are pleased. The cheapest price, for the best number one rated blower, makes this a no brainer.
B000H1Y4EK This has a very powerful blower with multiple speeds depending no what you want to blow.  Lower to medium speeds can get leaves out of rocks without moving the rocks much.  Metal blades are the best for bagging leaves and if something does get sucked up like a rock or stick it will not dent the blades.
B000H1Y4EK This machine is a back saver.  I've used it for everything it's intended for.  For the blower function the leaves, grass clippings, dirt and rocks go flying away without any issue and I don't even have it at its highest setting!  The vacuum takes on dry/damp leaves and twigs without issue.  It's so powerful that if I place it close to the ground it sticks.  Not once did it get jammed while vacuuming leaves.  The mulcher function does its job without issue as well.I can't see why there's so many negative reviews on this model.  If your machine broke after a one use then return it to Amazon for another one.  If your complaints are in regards to the vacuum getting jammed then that would be on the user.  Sticking this into a huge pile of leaves will obviously create a jam.  There's just too much debris going into the impeller too fast which will cause it to suffocate.  Simply hover it over the pile of leaves to take in a little at a time and your problems would be none to minimal.  As a blower this thing launches debris.  It's very powerful that it will launch small rocks.  The mulcher is great for reducing bagging.  The included bag for mulching/vacuuming comes with a strap to help hold the unit while working.  I've used this thing multiple times and saved on bags, time and energy.  My back never felt better after cleaning.  For $75, I can't see the issue here.  A little common sense will help get you through the job with ease.  I highly recommend this unit.
B000H1Y4EK This is more rant than review, so appreciate it for that, or not.Toro does not sell parts to fix these, nor for the previous 51598 model. The idea is to throw them away after a season or two (two in my case). This is not right and it is not appreciated at all and makes the device NOT RECOMMENDED even though it works well. I will check out a Sears blower because they have parts and nice parts diagrams. Maybe there are others.Mine was the usual smoking motor. Electrical motors have been around for a long time now and there is no excuse for making one that only lasts a few running hours. Simply just cheaply made junk. Don't blame the Mexicans who assembled it, they aren't responsible for the engineering or specifications and just put it together as well as anyone else could have.The CEO probably got a bonus for this. Let me do my little part to maybe prevent a couple of sales.This is disgusting and no amount of blowing power makes up for it if the company sucks.You have to wonder what other cute surprises this company has for you in their other products, even the big ticket stuff. You can assume this is an indication of what they chortle about around the boardroom table when they are passing out bonuses in a circle.Read all the reviews of those who have dealt with their service centers. There is a pattern there, one of essentially ripping off the customer and then treating them poorly. At least they should be gentle.I certainly suggest you keep looking and at least consider another brand.********************************* Update****************************I took the blower apart to see if I could fix this before I tossed it. The smoke was not coming from the switch as it appeared, and what others reported, but straight from the motor. I used light sandpaper to clean the armature and also the end of the brushes. It has since worked perfectly for many leaf-blowing sessions, even at full power. Maybe there was some sort of manufacturing debris or chemical on there that caused some sort of resistance or simply lit up. Anyway, not too hard and saves you some money and you don't have to throw it in the trash.
B000H1Y4EK I bought this to do vacuuming up of mango leaves.  I have no desire to blow things around so I wont assess that.  But for vacuuming, the suction isn't very impressive. Only small nearly dried out leaves get readily vacuumed in.  Larger leaves or leaves still freshly green are too heavy to be sucked into the tube.  So in the end, only about half to 2/3 of the leaves at any given time get sucked in.  Unless you like the unfinished look of only half your leaves being picked up, the rest you will have to rake.  What's the point of the machine if you still need to rake.  I do enjoy its feature of chopping up the leaves into fine particles so it saves on bag disposal and for that I may use it upside down just to feed large amounts of leaves into it for waste processing. But otherwise, the motor seems too weak for massive suction.  I realize the limitation on a 15amp circuit can only allow an electric motor so much power, but still this product seems way overrated to me.
B000H1Y4EK This electric blower is less disturbing than the other blowers and has plenty of push power for the big autumn leaf drop clean ups. Easy to store and no gas required to power it.
B000H1Y4EK Works very well...tons of power (I mean enough to blow heavy rocks all over the place).  Big leaves will get stuck in the mulcher from time to time and make you empty it, but other than that it's a great buy. I would purchase again.
B000H1Y4EK This bright red Toro blower reminds me of a Ferrari Formula 1 car. It's sleek, red and revs really high, has a collection bag with Toro in a similar font.I've had this blower for a few months now and it's really good. Since the Toro blower can be reversed to work as a vacuum cleaner, it comes with a large collection bag with a shoulder strap and zipper opening. It has several attachments: you can use the regular thin blower attachment or the two part vacuum attachment. It has two inlet attachments too. The blower inlet cover has a grate to stop your fingers getting near the magnesium blade. When set to vacuum, this becomes the sucking hose and the blower end has the collection bag attached.This model has a simple variable speed knob. So far I have used it to blow leaves which it does very well. For blowing across hard surfaces like the street or patio you can use any setting but for dry leaves the lowest setting is fine and very quiet. So you won't be irritating the neighbors.I use the blower for the roof and gutters and found the lowest setting is more than adequate for this.  You don't want to crank it up too high or you might risk dislodging a roof tile which could be bad.  For vacuuming leaves you need to turn the dial all the way up.  It sucks up piles of leaves, seeds and what have you scattered across the ground.The magnesium blade makes quick work of leaves, small twigs, moss and clumps of dirt, and the snap on grate that the hose attaches to prevents large stones and sticks going through. Everything is chopped very finely, so you can fit an awful  lot in your garden waste bin if you don't have old fashioned street pickup.One nice finishing touch is that the whole blower unit and accessories can be quickly dismantled and fits into the collection bag easily.  Another plus is that the collector bag strap makes it simple to store the blower by hanging it up in the garage or shed wall.The only negative is having to use a cable which requires an outlet, but without that you would not have the powerful motor and strong blowing power.  And, since this is a plug-in device, you don't need to keep your batteries charged or worry about it running out of juice.This blower works great if like me you have a largish yard with lots of outlets dotted around. I also used it to suck up sawdust when building my studio, which worked out very well too.
B000H1Y4EK There are already many excellent reviews for this blower, so I'll just point out that it's really a good one for us shorter people.  At 5'3\", I didn't want a big, heavy, hard to use blower.  My yard is small so an electric one seemed the way to go.I've used it on my graveled areas, mostly to clean leaves that are quite small(mesquite tree).  The vacuum did clog when I first started using it on these tiny leaves.  Like any blower, I'm sure, it takes a bit of practice to use it well, and since this is the first time I've used one, my job wasn't stellar but got better as I went along.The adjustable power is great, as is the metal impeller.  The power is more than sufficient for my needs.  It switches more easily from blower to vacuum mode than I thought it would be when I first read the instructions.  The bag was hard for me to keep on my shoulder and emptying it was somewhat awkward.  Sti
B000H1Y4EK Update 3/18/2010:So, I got my new one and it is working fine. I also discovered a new use for this. We recently had a ton of snow, but it was very light....so I had a thought, why not try to blow the snow off of my steps (I have about 20 steps leading to the front of my house) so I gave it a try and guess what....it worked! I blew all of the snow off of the steps! My neighbor thought I was nuts until he saw how easy it was, then he borrowed mine and did his own steps. A great new use and this one is holding up, so maybe the first was a fluke???I did drop it down a star, but if it continues to perform well I will bump it back up.Updated March 1, 2009**********************Well, the third time I used the blower was today, to clear out some small branches, etc., from a fallen tree. After about 5 seconds, the blower slowed, started to smoke and then stopped working. I am very surprised, because my other Toro products have worked perfectly. I will be contacting the company and see how they handle this and will post as soon as I hear from them. I would stay away from this blower. I leave my original review incase I get a replacement and it works flawlessly (I have my doubts). As cumbersome as it was, my ShopVac NEVER gave me a problem after using it over a dozen times to blow leaves.I used to use my ShopVac to blow the leaves, but that was a real pain. I hired landscapers and they were great for the first year. I was raking the leaves and it took forever, and then the handle snapped in two and hit me in the mouth. I bought this that same night. I was tempted to give it four stars, but then I realized this is as good as they get. There is no way that you will get the power of the blowers that you have to push. With that said, let me tell you that I have about half an acre with a lot of trees. The fall looks beautiful.....for a few weeks....and then, it's a killer. So, having this blower is very helpful. Blowing the leaves is very easy and this is relatively light, my 5 year old can hold it and walk around with it....he carries it for me when I am finished. I would not recommend letting a child use this, for multiple reasons. As far as blowing, well first thing, try blow dry leaves. If they get wet it will be harder to blow them as they pile up. Having said that, it is hard to blow even dry leaves when the pile is big. Keep in mind, however, that even the backpack gas blowers have their limitations and are not much better than this (you need a team of two people to really be effective). It takes me about two hours to blow all the leaves. Keep in mind that I am being followed by my five year old helper. So, why do I think you should purchase this over others....well, first, it's a Toro. They usually make a long lasting product, I have two other Toro products and they are awesome as well. The cost for this is really what makes it a great deal. Low cost, good function, solid reputation....these are the things that make an item not only a good buy, but also a great value. One note, as with any of these products, the cord can come off and you should ONLY use this on a GFCI.
B000H1Y4EK This review is for Toro Ultra 12 Amp Variable Speed Electric Blower/Vacuum with Metal Impeller Item #51599As most of the reviewers on Amazon have already shared their opinion on this product, I am just going to say \"They are all correct\" This Variable Speed Electric Blower is indeed a very nice product.Having a electric blower/Vac which starts instantly when the neighbor has the Gas type and seeing him having difficulty to start that rusty old thing gives me a great deal of confidence in the product.PROS:[+] The 12 Amp motor is powerful enough for any kind of job that needs a blower.[+]  Plastic construction makes this blower light weight but still feels solid to hold.[+] Uses Electricity and makes less pollution to the environment[+] Included accessories make this purchase worthwhile for its price.[+] The Metal Impeller is impressive for mulching jobCONS:[-] For gathering larger leaves and debris the suction power at times is not adequate[-] As the collection bag gets filled the suction power decreases.[-] The collection bag dangling on your shoulder[-] This unit does not come with an included extension cord.The power of Toro Ultra 12 Amp Variable Speed Electric Blower is unbeatable, I demonstrated this to my daughter by creating a \"Magic Flying carpet\" - Yes it is that powerful blowing action that it can displace a carpet off the ground by few inches! Easily!This is indeed a good buy, the sheer number of reviewers with 5 STAR rating is a clear indication of the quality of the product. Buy it with confidence, I am sure it will last long enough to prove it's price tag of $70.
B000H1Y4EK I just used it for the first time to suck up the Maple seed(helicoptors)...Pros,It does seem to have plenty of power.It definitly grinds well,Cons,1.) I don't know why these people can't make an extra tube attachment with a smaller size to get in corners and small places...2.) The zipper on the bag is on the side of the bag instead of the bottom.A zipper on the bottom makes it easier to transfer the debris to a trash bag.3.)It just does not feel comfortable,,,you would think they could design somthing that was easier to balance.
B000H1Y4EK I put off getting a leaf blower for years, not wanting yet another tool in the garage if it would just take up space more often than it was used. I finally broke down last fall and picked up this model at Sears on sale, figuring that it would be useful for mulching leaves and it would beat using my lawn mower to blow the grass off the driveway and road after mowing (which works better than you might think).I knew that I didn't want a wimpy blower, so I researched models for the most CFM and the best reviews for durability and performance. I knew that I wanted something with a metal impeller for mulching, as plastic impellers just didn't seem up to task, and a variable speed control was also important. I also wanted something with a decent warranty in case I had any troubles. That research led me to this model. It's a popular model in sale ads, so if you keep your eyes open, you can get it for less than sixty.I would have been quite happy to buy this unit here on Amazon, but Sears had it for the better price, and with some things, it's also nice to be able to walk into a store and pick it out. You also have a little easier time returning/exchanging it if there is an issue.That turned out to be a good choice, as I ran into trouble on the third time I used it. The variable speed controller malfunctioned, and it became the equivalent of an on/off button, as it was either off or on at full speed.After considering whether to call Toro to get it fixed/replaced under warranty, I figured I would give Sears a chance to take care of that for me. I brought everything in (including the box) with my receipt from two months previous, and they allowed me to exchange it for a brand new model off the shelf. That's the kind of customer service that keeps brick and mortar stores relevant!I've been using that replacement for nearly a year, and I've had no troubles with it, so I'm willing to chalk up that first unit to a random part failure and not an indictment of the product in general. It is something to keep in mind when you are selecting where to purchase such an item, however.From a performance standpoint, I'm very happy with how it functions as a blower. It makes easy work out of blowing the grass clippings back onto the lawn, and I even use it to sweep across clumped grass so that it doesn't dry in a large mass and kill the lawn beneath. There's a large volume of air that comes out of the nozzle at the highest speed setting, and this means that there's a large volume of air being sucked into the intake at the bottom. Be sure to keep loose clothing away from this inlet!Converting to vacuum operation is quite easy, and it works very well. The bag could be another color besides white, as mulched leaves will discolor the bag pretty quickly. If the leaves that you are cleaning up are even a little wet, that moisture is going to stain the bag and it's not going to look out-of-the-box new ever again. Not a big deal to most of us, but something to keep in mind and something for Toro to consider when sourcing this bag in the future.Overall, I'm very happy with this power tool. It does everything I expect it to do, and it's definitely much lighter than a gas-operated equivalent. While it does produce a fair bit of noise due to its funtion, it's not so annoying that I feel like I need earplugs when using it. It was money well spent!
B000H1Y4EK I was convinced I needed a strap-on gas blower for my large (over 1 acre) partially wooded yard.  This really does the trick quickly and without much hassle.  I put a few extension cords together and they really aren't that much of a problem.  The blower is much smaller than I would have thought, given the job it does moving large amounts of semi-wet leaves.  I found it very ergonomic.  I wasn't sore after using it and found it not the least bit cumbersome.  It was night and day from my last toro blower.  I havent used the leave vacuum because my lawn is just too big...I really see no cons to this other than I worry about getting fingers into the fan if the bottom grille isn't on. Not sure if there is a safety switch that prevents this.In short, I love this thing!!
B000H1Y4EK I recently purchased the Toro 51599 Variable-Speed Electric Blower/Vacuum and have been using it through the fall \"leaf season\".  Below are my pro's and con's.Pro's:-  The air blast from the blower and the suction while vacuuming/mulching is very strong, and the variable speed for the fan is a great feature.  I've found that I need a lot less air when blowing leafs from hard surfaces and more air when dealing with damp leaves, so the ability to variably adjust the fan speed is a strong point-  Its reasonably light weight and requires little to no maintenance when compared to a gas-powered blower-  As advertised, it converts from a blower to a vacuum/mulcher in a matter of seconds-  It's a very good mulcher, although the description is wrong when it says you can take 16 bags of leaves and mulch them into only 1 bag.  In typical conditions, you'll probably mulch what would have been 3 or 4 bags of leaves into 1 bag.  The metal impeller is a plus, too, as it's much less likely to shatter than plastic impellers on other units.Con's:-  Its loud, and when mulching dry leaves, throws off a fair amount of leaf dust.  Be sure to wear ear protection and a mask.  (Although this could be said of most, if not all blowers/vacs.)-  The leaf collection bag mounts directly onto the unit, so it's a bit uncomfortable/awkward when you put the bag's strap over your shoulders and mulch leaves.  A foot or two of hose would have made it a lot more comfortable to carry around.As an aside to the last point, I also bought the Toro 51500 Universal Leaf Collector with 8 Foot Hose and the Toro 29210 43-Gallon Gardening Spring Bucket, thinking that it would make leaf collecting and mulching even easier.  However, I found that the basic setup that comes with this unit works better for me than using the hose and bucket (I'm a man and can handle carrying the bag around when mulching).  If you plan on mulching you may want to buy just the blower/vacuum and give it a try before spending money on the hose and bucket like I did.Overall, the Toro 51599 Ultra 12 amp Variable-Speed Electric Blower/Vacuum with Metal Impeller worked very well, and when you consider the price, it's an outstanding value.  In general, I find it to be a very efficient and effective leaf blower and leaf mulcher.  While it won't completely eliminate having to rake flowerbeds and tight areas, you can greatly reduce your time and effort collecting leaves.
B000H1Y4EK I purchased this unit in February 2012, but just noticed that I forgot to review it. But over 1000 people have already told you how great it is.And I agree. The Toro 51599 is a beast. It's easy to use, and most importantly, it's powerful. It could blow itself out of your hands if you are not careful. It tends to my grass clippings, patio, driveway, and drying of my car with no problem. I have not had a single problem with the unit in the year I've had it. And the metal impeller looks like new.It is loud, and I do find it trying to suck my shirt into the intake every once in a while. But that all points back to the power of the unit.It can get a bit heavy after a long use, but for quick work, the form factor and weight are great.I do wish the unit had a multi-piece output tube, so it could be used with a shorter output. This would make using it for drying the car much more convenient. Instead, I have to buy an additional output tube and cut it down.Lastly, having to be tethered to a cord is a pain, but if you need a powerful blower/vacuum, then you should look no further.
B000H5R722 - Easy to install, spring needs to be snapped on, then attach to the main unit-Cheap, which it should be since it replaces a part that clearly doesn't last.- Glad to see the company providing the replacement part on Amazon so they must be aware of the issue and are addressing it.- Quick delivery as usual
B000H5R722 to have on hand in case the first one ever broke....so far so good. I always like to be ahead of the game when it comes to parts.
B000H5R722 I keep breaking this part for some reason so I got 3 of these, very cheap, instead of replacing my weed wacker, which is heavy duty and no long made.
B000H5R722 Tab broke my first one, but worked it pretty hard. Happy with this replacement, ordered two, and arrived on time while being very well packed. If needed, will order again
B000H5R722 I bought this as a gift to somebody and watched them install it in nothing flat when their old spool was empty.  Black and Decker makes darn good products in my opinion.  Not always the very best, but certainly good enough most of the time, and not surprisingly, the best solution fairly often.
B000H5R722 My electric weed eater goes through way to much string. I am hoping this helps the situation. Tired of buying string
B000H5R722 My son lost the spring when changing spools so it was so convenient to be able to order this from Amazon! It's also nice that Black & Decker makes parts that are almost universal in fit for their products.
B000H5R722 Bought this one as a spare. Have not an occasion to use it yet. But since it is made for my trimmer, thought is a good purchase for the price
B000H5R722 I have an old B&D; G400 Type 3 that finally gave up the ship on the cap, butAce had it in stock at less than $.20 cents more than Amazon, so I bought theAce cap and ordered a back up from Amazon.The caps ARE THICKER than the original, and they are still orange; not black!While you can replace the spool and cap on these, you cannot replace the housing,as it is part of the motor assembly, so you might as well buy a new one.If you do buy a new one, I would look at the GreenWorks 21212 which is a 13\" trimmerthat according to the reviews has actually figured out a way for the auto feed to ACTUALLY WORK.I have ordered one of these and will be reviewing it as soon as I get it in.I like these light weight trimmers over the heavy gas trimmers (I have a HomeLite 2 stroke that I had to fix to run right, and a Honda 4 stroke with brush blades for the heavy stuff), but most ofthe trimming I do, can be done with these light weight electric trimmers, and if they stop working,you spend $40.00 (Not $80.00 to $200.00) for a new one.
B000H5R722 I've had my B&D rechargeable for almost 5 years and use it constantly. This year this part wore completely away, from being used as a heavy duty whacker. I didn't really hold out much hope that B&D made parts for such a economically priced item, but this piece was exactly what the whacker needed. I was so pleased to be able to actually FIX something instead of throwing it away and buying a whole new unit. This part was cheap and exactly fit the bill.
B000H5R722 If you use your B&D; string trimmer long enough, this part is going to wear out, as is typically gets scraped up, worn down, or cracked, when it touches the ground spinning at high speeds.  There is no generic replacement for this part, so while it is certainly overpriced for a piece of molded plastic, there really are no other practical options.  Fortunately the part is pretty durable, and B&D;'s system for automatically feeding line works fairly well.  The spool does hold quite a bit of line, and you don't have to reload it that often.Since you will need this part sooner or later, it might be a good idea to buy it at the lowest price you can get, before you really need to replace it.  If you keep it on your wish list or price tracker, you might be able to get a good price and free shipping.
B000H5R722 I ordered this because the original cap on my trimmer did not have a spring, and I thought I had lost it in the process of removing the cap for the first time. Then I found out that cordless trimmers do not need the spring; my cap had never had one.Amazon told me I did not need to return it and gave me a refund anyway. Nice of them.
B000H5SD5C GOT THIS HOSE TO REPLACE MY HOSE I USE FOR MY BIRD BATH.THE 1/2INCH MAKES A STRONGER PSI TO SEND THE WATER.
B000H5SD5C After watering and draining hose it coils very nicely by hand. Removed hose from box, laid it on ground and walked away with one end in hand, no kinks or twists to block water. Feels heavy enough to stand up to the summer sun but we shall see. The hose that this replaced lasted two years and it was twice the money. Overall am happy with it.
B000H5SD5C Wraps up easy, nice and thick, hardy, no kink and no leaks so we are good to go! We've tried all sorts of different brands and types of hoses and had concluded that it was a hopeless cause. All of them were the same be it you spent 1$ or 100$ so when we got this and tried it we were just blown away!! Very happy with this purchase which means I would definitely buy again and recommend this great hose.
B000H5SD5C I have had Flexogen hoses in the past that lasted 15 years or more. These new hoses do not seem to be made of the same material and I really doubt that they will last \"forever\" as claimed. So far so good, but it's too soon to tell.
B000H5SD5C These (I bought two  50' and one 100&#34;)  are excellent!  They don't kink--or at least they haven't yet!  They screw into each other smoothly and tightly without having to have the strength of a large man--which is a real helpful thing for a woman with a bit of arthritis in my hands.
B000H5SD5C I probably should have gotten something a bit less heavy duty b/c all I do is wash the car, but that's my fault. This thing doesn't ever &#34;knot&#34; but it isn't super flexible either so dragging it out can be a bit of a workout. But I'll trade that for constantly untangling the hose or having to plug leaks.
B000H5SD5C My wife has been struggling with a 5/8\" 50 foot hose for a long time. I thought I'd surprise her with a lighter weight hose for her favorite gardening activity. On first use the hose kinked. We were both so disappointed. Now she is faced with either returning to the old heavy hose or dealing with the kink problem.
B000H5SD5C This hose costs almost thirty bucks locally.  Thankfully, we got ours for just over ten thanks to Warehouse Deals.  Sometimes people just don't like something or don't know what they're getting in the first place, so they send it back, and that's when I swoop in and get a great deal.  Keep an eye out for some good deals from Amazon Warehouse Deals.  We've gotten many things at a fraction of their original prices, and they're perfectly good items with nothing wrong with them.  This is a real nice quality hose, doesn't kink and seems quite durable.  Really happy we got it, and even happier that it was a third of the local cost.  Yaaaaay!
B000H5SD5C Bought this for one task only&#8212;to water my raised beds. Twenty-five feet was the perfect length . . . I had been using a fifty-footer but kept tripping over the extra coils. So far, this is the perfect solution.
B000H5SD5C Surprised at quality of this hose.. Will buy this brand from now on.  Wish I had gotten either a longer one or cppl.
B000H5SD5C Our lot is roughly 10,000 square feet, and this hose is just the right length - long enough to reach almost all our gardens/plants, but short enough that it's light and easy to carry around.It seems well made, doesn't kink too easily, and seems to have quality connections/o-rings (no leaks).Also a good price. Highly recommended.
B000H5SD5C Ok, I purchased this Hose on July 22, 2013.  I received it on Saturday 24, 2013.  Is light and it looked like it would last.  I liked that it has Lifetime.  The hose was leaking and bulging by August 18, 2013.  I always made sure I empty it after each use.  It does get partial Sun, not all day nor does it get Sun on the entire hose at any given time since we have two backyard trees.  Amazon was great and when I called them on August 19, 2013 they immediately shipped a replacement.  I figured, all manufactured good can have a percentage of products with factory defect, no harm done.  The second Hose arrived on August 20, 2013.  On September 4, 2013 the second one exhibit the exact issue.  Called Amazon and they refunded my money.  I don't think two defective Hose in such a short time is a fluke and I'm tired of packing a hose to ship back every month.  I will now go back to doing research. In the mean time I have to water 14 planters,10sq feet of garden area with two, 2 gallon watering cans, let the fun begin. Last, I thought of contacting Gilmore but, if this were to continue I would be out around 5 bucks every month to ship the ends to Gilmour not to mention the hassle.
B000H5SD5C I have owned nice hoses before and this is not one of them.  It kinks very easily, just like cheap hoses.  Its fittings are nice and it appears to be made to last, but for the money I have purchased much better hoses that do not kink.Update: I have owned this for a over a year now and have bumped it up to 3 stars from 2. Yes it does kink doing sharp turn maneuvers such as when washing a car back and forth it kinks sometimes when I am walking and turn 90 or 180 degrees and drag the hose. The reason for upping the star count is I have again experienced how bad a cheap hose kinks, and this one is not that bad. (I owned a really nice hose at my previous house that was left there, I purchased it at ACE Hardware, but can't remember the brand and haven't been back in to look for it. This hose is good enough to get the job done that I need) Given this hose is only $20, I give it 3 stars now.
B000H5SD5C I found this to be, like other Gilmour products I have owned, of high quality.  Later on, I bought a 5/8&#34; version (which I have reviewed), and found it, likewise, a well-made piece of lawn-care equipment.
B000H5SD5C I bought two of these after reading all the good reviews. But i don't know why people like it so much. They both LEAKED at the tip and i wish it was more flexible, very hard to move around with it.
B000H5SD5C The 8 ply Flexogen (5/8\") is a staple for me, I have one on the backyard hose reel and it's lasted many years.  So I decided to get another for the front yard. Since I was \"cheap\" I opted for the 1/2\" size; it doesn't have the pressure behind it that the 5/8\" has, so next time, if I ever replace it, I'll get the larger size. The 1/2\" size is fine for washing the car, watering plants and hosing off the walks, etc., but that's about all, I don't think it would be the best for pressure washing.
B000H5SZ1Y Put off getting these for a very long time simply because they seemed kind of silly when I have always used a rake upside down to basically scoop up the leaves/clippings. While that still work fairly well, I do find that these are easier to work with, especially if I am needed to scoop up piles in tighter areas - less are dropped etc. For the price, its a great addition to the tool shed and has helped with the annual leaf cleanup.
B000H5SZ1Y Everything is great about this product. Very light and yet firm enough to grab even wet leaves. I cannot clean my yard during the without using this. Great idea.
B000H5SZ1Y these thing work really great and are very useful to scoop up leaves in a hurry. have not broken my yet and have been pretty ruff on them
B000H5SZ1Y It cuts the job in half.  I can pick up two or three times as many leaves with these.  My back loves this the most.
B000H5SZ1Y The reason for ordering these wasn't because of a leaf problem. It was a peach problem. We were hit with winds strong enough to knock unripe peaches off the tree. A lot of peaches.* I'm retired and have a problem picking up stuff from the ground, especially when there is a lot to be picked up. I figured that these scoops were worth a try.Bottom line: they saved my back. It was still a chore and I felt it for days, but it was much easier than the alternatives (shovel, scoop, letting them rot and have the mower fling the seeds into windows - wouldn't have to bend over to replace the windows).The construction is of heavy enough plastic that they don't flex, even with the load being heavy peaches. The hand holes could be a little larger, but worked find. Those loops were formed by pushing out a slot from the scoops. The remaining rectangular openings left room for the partially rotted peaches to push through, and they would allow for sticks to push through into your hands. Duct tape on both sides of the holes solved that problem.I was amazed at how much I could pick up per effort of digging the scoops into the raked up piles of peaches, and can imagine how well they will work on leaves this fall.I have tried any number of clever products over the years and have, on average, been disappointed. These scoops are way above average in being useful.*A lot of peaches. What turned out to be enough to fill most of a 39 gallon trash bag. How I moved that to the trash can for pick-up is another story (and I didn't have a clever device to help with that).
B000H5SZ1Y This week I cleaned out some heavily packed (a few years worth) pine straw from around two hydrangeas to allow them some air.  These leaf scoops worked like a charm.  I had purchased these too late to use last fall on the leaves in the driveway which I ended up mulching with the lawn mower and just blowing away with the leaf blower.
B000H5SZ1Y I don't think I've every enjoyed scooping leaves as much as I have with the Gardex scooper. I was able to scoop and gigantic pile of leaves under 5 minutes!The scoop itself is very well made. High quality plastic, easy to use and handle. I have medium to large hands and had no problem fitting them into the scoopers.Simply put them, on, reach down and squeeze the leaves, hold firmly and pick up. THAT simple and yet so incredibly efficient. A MUST buy for any home owner.By the way, this item is made with pride in the U.S.A.
B000H5SZ1Y When cleaning the yard I've always used the method of raking things into a large pile, turning the rake over, and scooping leaves and debri between the rake and my hand. Things always fell between the rake tines and there were several smaller piles using this method.With the leaf scoops, you can attack any part of a leaf pile you want, and the remainder will be undisturbed. The best part, it gathers many of the smaller things often found in yards. With the rake I could not collect acorns. The scoops have no problem with them.So let's see, it takes less time and less effort, but costs more than if I stayed with my old way. Given how long I think these will last and how amazing they have performed already, I'd buy a second and third pair in a heartbeat!
B000H5SZ1Y I only wish that I had been the one who thought of these things!  I use those daily, it is amazing how much I can grab all at once.  Unconditionally recommended, get these for your fall cleanup!!!  And then thank me for having pushed you into getting them...
B000H5SZ1Y I was very skeptical of these scoops at first, but I have a lot of leaves to clean up, and figured they were worth a shot.After one afternoon of raking, I am sold. Everyone who has to rake up a lot of leaves each fall should have a set of these scoops!First of all, you can grab a lot more leaves with these than you can with the old hand+rake method. You also get a much better &#34;grip&#34; on the bunch leaves, which makes getting them into the bin easier, with fewer dropped leaves. It's also easier to scrape up those few straggler leaves that always get left behind. It's still a little tricky to get leaves into those brown paper bags (which I was hoping these scoops would help with), but if you just limit the amount of leaves you grab at once, it's still better than just using a rake.These aren't the most heavy-duty pieces of lawn equipment I've ever used... a stiffer/thicker plastic might have been more desirable. But, I think that if I treat them well, they should last a few years at least.In conclusion, if you're sick if cleaning up leaves, get a pair of these &#8211;it will really speed up your leaf clean-up!
B000H5SZ1Y Works well for my smaller front yard.  For a larger yard I would recommend a different method such as using a large rake with either another rake or a nice wide solid rake to use as a pusher.
B000H5SZ1Y I was initially skeptical of these when looking at this product. However, after using this product, I am very happy with the purchase. I am using these primarily for picking up piles of leaves, compost, or other yard trash. I can either bag easier or simply move the material to provide mulch for my yard.I find these are well constructed and thought out. These are my reasons:(1) Yellow color.  Won't be easily lost in a pile of leaves or your yard.(2) Size is right. Perfect for scoop to deposit in yard bags.(3) Grips are perfect for me. At first, I thought they were a little loose for my size, but since I normally wear garden gloves during my work, the size is perfect and fits snugly for use with my gloves. Consider this a plus.(4) There is a small hole in the top of the scoops which makes hanging them up in my utility room easy.(5) Rake like scoops on the bottom help with raking up the pile for pickup.Some reviewers complain that they would like them to have a handle so they wouldn't have to stoop over. Personally, I would find a handle to be a nuisance and in the way. I use a rake first and then clean up with these. I think trying to tightly grip these together by using a short handle would not work very well.
B000H5SZ1Y With two wooded acres on Spud Acres, we've got more leaves than a person can handle. Mostly I shred them with the lawnmower and then pick up to bag or compost. A lawn rake is bigger than one of these scoops, but my hand isn't, so not the entire pickup ends up in the bag.These handy scoops are as good as advertised,if not better. Using these yellow wonders I can make a large pile of leaves disappear quickly. I think they work more efficiently than a lawn rake or a couple pair of gloved hands. The scoops really shine when you get down to the bottom of the pile and can rake up every last bit with the tined teeth of the scoops.I've had my pair for several years and wouldn't want to be without them. The bright yellow color makes a misplaced scoop easy to find, especially one inadvertently left in a leaf bag.
B000H5SZ1Y How did I ever manage lifting leaves all those years with a rake?!  These are just like having super claws that grab your pile and keep it's hold until deposited into a canister. Great idea for any gardener. Great Father's Day present.
B000H5SZ1Y Makes handling of leaves, shrubbery, or any other garden item needed to be picked up and disposed an easy task. I use it to pick up leaves, branches and pine needles in my yard. I went from using a shovel and my hands to using these and it makes the task so much easier and shorter.They are made of plastic so long term use is a question, but as with any item if used properly and taken care of should last a long time. Also for the price you cant go wrong.
B000H6JJEA I got this for use with racoons and it works but is awkward and one must be very careful and wear really heavy gloves when allowing the animal out.It did help me get it out to the country and I was able to capture the rest of the family.It is far better thanothers that might  hurt the animal but as I said wear those protective gloves and if you have gardeners leather arm protectors wear them as well.  The first catch was the mother and the next was the two babies well more like older teens . They are now enscounced in an old dead tree on my upstate property and are still ransacking the garbage can but at least have more room in which to plunder.
B000H6JJEA It's Springtime and that means woodchuck/groundhogs are out in full force where I reside. I live in a very rural area so I have all kinds of wild animals living around us. Animals like deer, bears, bobcats, skunks, fox, rabbits, raccoons, stray cats, and of course good ole woodchucks just to name a few. I have a huge woodchuck that enjoys eating our scrubs, flower beds and digging up holes all over our lawn. He reminds me of the woodchuck in the movie \"Caddyshack\". He taunts us - I feel like he sits there laughing at us every time we try to scare it away.Havahart 1085 Cage Trap for Raccoons, Stray Cats and Woodchucks has been the answer to our prayers. The trap is easy to set and causes no harm to the animals. I was a little weary at first because I was scared that it would set off while I was setting it up. But to my surprise, I was able to set it up and carry it to the location with no problems. I placed some peanut butter trip plate for bait since it takes more effort to consume and what animal does not like peanut butter. We caught good ole Woody and was able to release him miles away in a wooded area. It took a couple of tries because besides the woodchuck, we also have raccoons that occasionally get in our trash if we leave it unattended. I found the trap overturned once with the spring door shut. The peanut butter was is there, so I assume a raccoon took hold of the trap and overturned which made the door close.Made in the USA. Constructed of galvanized steel to keep it from rusting.
B000H6JJEA I am very familiar with Havahart live traps.  We've used them in the past to remove pests--mostly squirrels.  We live in a neighborhood blessed with lots of pecan, oak and fruit trees.  We also feed birds.  All this combines to attract hoards of squirrels to our backyard and house.  We've had problems with them getting into the attic and infesting our lawns with fleas.  While some find squirrels to be cute and enjoy their presence, this would not be the case if you had over a dozen of them running around in your yard at one time, digging up planters, dropping hungry fleas, destroying ripening fruit and pecans or have them wake you at night building nests in your attic.  We've also had a few incidents of raccoons and possums finding their way into our backyard.  The solution was using a Havahart live trap to remove the pests.  The Havahart we used in the past was effective but you had to fiddle with the setting of the trap.  It wasn't hard to do once familiar with it.  This particular model has the \"Easy Set/Release\" mechanism.  It's outstanding.  All you do is pull a lever on the top of the trap and it locks the door.  As usual, a light touch on the spring release will let the door close, thereby trapping the pest so you can carry it to another location for release.  Preferably a location far away from your home, in an area with plenty of available forage.Like all Havahart traps I've been familiar with, this one has a guard around the top-mounted handle to prevent an angry animal from scratching or biting your hand while you lift the trap.  There are no sharp areas inside the trap that can harm the animal.  It's lightweight but pretty well built.  The only concern I have about this trap is the fact that the construction uses pop rivets in some areas.  While rivets are okay, the use of bolts that can be tightened is my preference.  That way you can easily repair loose fasteners.  But the trap is sturdy as is and an excellent choice for occasional homeowner use.  There's an information sheet enclosed that gives you information on what to use to bait different pests.The easy set/release trap is a great improvement on the original Havahart live trap.
B000H6JJEA Finally a trap thats easy to use and not to heavy to carry. Get one before you need it and you wont be sorry you have it.
B000H6JJEA I share my farm with many animals but every once in a while one shows up that is a nuisance. In this instance I would rather relocate than shoot one that is harmless. I had a large possum that took up residence in my barn and I thought perhaps his size was a result of helping himself to my cat food, well the cat's food. Anyway, after baiting the trap with food I caught several cats and then finally the biggest possum I had ever seen. It was a male so I took it eight miles away to a protected wildlife area and turned him loose. The female possums should be so impressed with this handsome individual and I do not have to worry about him transferring disease to my horses. This trap is so easy to use because you can quickly release an animal that you do not want caught and it is harmless to all. A great help to those of us in rural and not so rural areas.
B000H6JJEA ...is what you get.  It sets easily enough, but doesn't set itself.  It's sturdy enough to contain any animal that will fit in it.  I probably wouldn't recommend dropping it, b/c the mechanism is designed to work with the original shape of all right angles...if you're too rough on it, I would say it'll start to bind, but that's just prior experiences and common sense talking, not experience with *this* particular item.  I know FOR A FACT, however, that it'll trap a rather annoying possum, which is what I got it for.  Mission accomplished, none the worse for wear, I'm pleased beyond what I expected after seeing the Harbor Freight Tools versions of cage traps, and I didn't have to try to stalk and shoot the wiley opossum in the dark.  I only wish the mesh were tighter (smaller holes), so it would be good for squirrels.  For whatever reason, (probably because I don't like doing it...I used to hunt, but just hate to kill anything now) I also never seem to get around to shooting the squirrels that live in my barn roof either.
B000H6JJEA For the past couple of years, critters have taken a liking to my property. Last year I caught three possums and three skunks under my deck. This year, something dug a burrow and seems to be living under my tool barn, so I worked out a deal with the guy that has been getting rid of them: \"I'll provide the trap if you'll do the rest.\" He agreed and I got this trap. When he heard it was a Havahart, he was less than enthusiastic, saying he preferred another brand. But after he used it he said it was a nice trap. He particularly liked the one-hand set and release. The only improvement he said could be made would be to have the trip plate come up a bit higher.Based on his professional opinion, I would recommend this trap.
B000H6JJEA While this product has already helped out a lot in getting rid of a lot of the stray cats in my area along with what turned out to be a couple rabid other animals there is one aspect that I would like have had come with this product. Another solid panel to protect my leg ( I had one cat scratch my leg I was putting it in the back of the truck to take to the local shelter. It does however have a rather large panel around the handle that you pick it up from. which is great for protecting the all important hand...Since then I have been doing what I can to hold the cage out from me but some of these animals are not exactly light that I end up finding in the cage. I honestly don't know how some of them have fit in there or even willingly gone in something so small compared to them.Overall this product has proven quite useful in getting all these crazy stray cats that like to fight in the neighborhood in the middle of the night and keep me and my neighbors awake at random hours. I think I have now taken 20+ cats out of the area as a result and that's only in a couple months of only putting the trap out about 30 times, the other 10 times I got some other critters, 2 of which were rabid (confirmed by animal control).Build quality is pretty good but I wouldn't mind a little more sturdiness to it but it still does the job rather well. I have found that a simple cat food works well for attracting all kind of critters.If you are looking to trap something and keep it alive at the same time as having something to transport it in then this is a good choice. It works well and is build right.
B000H6JJEA I have a very old live animal trap that I use when the possums and/or ground hogs get to be too much of a problem and need to be relocated. It has worked well over the years, but setting it was always a problem - I didn't use it often enough to get enough practice, and always ended up fumbling about for a while.The trap setting procedure on this model is SO much easier. Just flip the handle back and you're done. That's it!  Perfect!! The only way to make it simpler is if you could get the animals you wanted to trap to line up in a nice, even row, and then walk single file into the trap. Barring that ever occurring, this is the next best thing.
B000H6JJEA After hearing about how my relatives in Missouri deal with their raccoon problems (usually involving a rifle), I decided that killing those pesky critters probably wasn't the nicest way to deal with them just doing what they naturally do, so I always wanted to try one of these traps instead.  You can very easily catch any small animal in here, and then release them miles away from your house where they can live a happy life away from your yard.  It's a quick and humane way to take care of your animal issues once and for all.
B000H6JJEA This trap is so much easier to set than any other and makes a great standby for quick setup with no training. No fiddling around with balancing posts against each other to get the trap to balance the step plate just right, no worries about it being so tight that it doesn't trip.However, the manufacturing of the trap seems to cut a few corners.Small soft plastic nubs on the end of pivot points came off in shipping and these are part of what holds the trap together. These should be threaded nuts to stay on securely or permanently attached with press on nuts.Also some of the metal pieces are a bit flimsy and I am concerned about long term functionality, especially after a few animals get trapped and try to get out. I use it to catch feral cats and have had no problems at all. But I can imaging a strong racoon casuing problems.I do recommend this trap for anyone that has had trouble setting traps in the past, or has never used one before. This is really easy to set and open to release.
B000H6JJEA I have several of these but the rabbits in my yard are just too smart for them.  I have tried  this and a \"rabbit sized\" one with no success at all, zero!  I wanted the to work, I live in the city so shotguns are out.  The pests eat my vegetation during the long winters and there is seemingly no solution to it.  These look like they would work, but I have not even seen a rabbit go near any of them.  They must work for other animals, but not with rabbits.  CHRAZY WABBITS!LATER 7/11 - I take it all back, they are not too smart.  It worked on day one with large fresh carrots.  I doubt I can catch them all, but will try.  This is one easy trap to set, the carry handle also loads and sets the trap.  How easy!
B000H6JJEA I had a feral male cat that nightly would come on my back porch and mark.This trap caught him the first night.I've only used it once but if I have any other pestsI'm sure it will come in handy.
B000H6JJEA This thing is fantastic. It can't get any easier to use and it's totally put together, just take it out of the box, pull the handle back and it's set. It's not so touchy that it goes off if you jar it a little while setting it in place. The extra solid plate at the top is wonderful too. I used it to catch some of the wild cats we have in town that don't belong to anyone but get into everything. I take them out to the farms around and then let them go. This is the first time I've ever used a trap and I'm 60 with weak hands from arthritis and I didn't know it would be so easy. This thng is very sturdy so you don't need to worry if you catch a big fat heavy coon in it. I'll be catching some of those too. I'm so happy that it works so well. The door opens easy too when you just push the handle forward to let what you caught go. You got to get one of these if you need a live trap, it's just great all around. That nice solid door keeps the animal from scratching you as well as the nice solid plate on top. I'm very happy with this, wish I had gotten one sooner.
B000H6JJEA We already own one of these, and when the Vine Program offered this I got another.  Over the last six years we've caught at least a dozen groundhogs as well as several skunks and cats and a raccoon.  My husband camouflages the trap with pine branches, spreads out some enticing food (apple, tuna--depending on what we're trying to catch) around & inside the trap, and without fail we get our uninvited animal.  Now we have one to loan out and one to use.  Recommend this product!!
B000H6JJEA This is a product Havahart really knows what they are doing.  They make them in a variety of sizes.  I had a chance to get this one which is the right size for me.  We live in a semi rural area and have our fair share of racoons, squirrels, rabbits, ans possums.  My only problem with these critters is when they wreak havoc on our garden, flower beds and sometimes in the attic.If you read the directions, bait and set it properly this trap is a sure thing.  We have learned to throw a old blanket over the trap after catching our rodent, it quiets them down and keeps them calm.  Our only problem at time is where to release where they will not become nuisance for someone else.I highly recommend this trap and will enjoy years of use.
B000H6JJEA I have used several sizes of these traps for various pests in our backyard. They have all been easy to setup and within days, with the proper bait, the pest has been captured. We used this trap to catch my parents' pesky groundhog. That little bugger has been terrorizing their yard for months now. My mom wasn't quite sure what to do with the animal once we caught it, but I told her I'd relocate it for her. ;) The trap is very easy to setup and is of solid construction. The trigger can be a little too sensitive at times, but with a little practice, you'll get better at setting it. Once the animal is caught, I had no worries about the cage being sufficient enough. Loaded the little furry pest in the back of my car (make sure to put a towel down - they tend to poop and pee when stressed/angry) and off we went.Releasing your little friend is easy and quick. I had the previous model and setting it up was a little cumbersome. This one is super easy to set and release. Getting your arm all the way back to the back of the cage to set the bait is a little tough - esp those of us with short arms. ;) The previous model had a little clips that held the \"back\" door on, so you could open it and get bait in there. This model does not. I still prefer this mo
B000H6JJEA This trap was requested to replace an older HAH trap that we had to constantly borrow from my father-in-law.  The older trap was heavy steel and was definitely much more sturdy, yet much harder to set.  The instructions dated it back to the 60s.  Two bars had to be lined up to set the trap, which was tedious to get those bars aligned properly.  This replacement is not as heavy and honestly, I had my doubts about it's sturdiness.  With an on going woodchuck problem, this trap was immediately put to the test.  We had set the trap in my neighbors back yard, since he sees the woodchuck every early morning while drinking his coffee while gazing out his deck doors.  Baited with some carrots & apples (not my preferred choice of bait) in the far end of the trap, and some grass clippings lining the way back it, the trap was put out.  The first 'victim' was a raccoon, and Lord, he was HUGE (I saw the video).  This raccoon had rolled the cage quite a few times (according to my neighbor) and did NOT manage to dislodge the trap door.  He let him go on his merry way, since we don't have raccoon issues (thankfully).  The trap was rebaited with a potted petunia (a woodchucks favorite meal in our area) and an opossum was caught.  Again, released immediately.  A few squirrels were also caught, and immediately released (talk about a 'what was I thinking?!?!?!' moment; I hate squirrels).  Finally, again baited with a potted petunia, the woodchuck was caught.  He was furious, growling/hissing and freaking out, but I threw a towel over the trap and lifted it over the fence.  Now, with the older trap, I was unable to do this.  That older trap was too heavy and with a large woodchuck in it, I couldn't manage walking with it so DH had to be called to the rescue.  The older trap also didn't have an easy release mechanism, so a few very long screwdrivers had to be brought along to let the animal go.  With this trap, the door is easy to open to release the animal.  I brought him to my workplace, away from homes and where plenty of other woodchucks roam, and released.  Another woodchuck had managed to worm it way back into my yard, occupying the previous woodchucks den under my deck.  It was also captured and released.I highly recommend this trap based on my own captures.  It's lightweight enough for me to handle.  It's easy to set.  It's easy to release.  All by my womanly self.
B000H6JJEA We had a feral cat in our backyard and wanted to take her to the vet to be spayed and treated. We put food at the far end of the trap and put the trap out in the early evening.  The cat was successfully trapped.  To calm her, we covered the trap with a large towel and then transported her to the vet. She got her shots and we discovered that she had already been spayed (a tiny notch in her ear identified her as having been spayed.  Male cats who are neutered by a vet will also have a tiny notch in the ear.  We brought the cat back home in the same Havahart trap and released her in our yard.  We feed her and have a shelter with heat for cold weather.This particular trap is large enough to trap a raccoon (if they bother you - they don't bother us) so the raccoon can be released in the wilderness. The trap sets with one hand and comes fully assembled, ready to use out of the box.  There are no sharp edges or parts so that any trapped creatures will not be harmed (they will be very frightened).  There is a reinforced plate where the release mechanism is placed so there in no danger that the user of the trap will be bitten.
B000H6JJEA .This is a review for the new model Havahart Trap with these dimensions: 32\" long - 10\" wide - 12\" highIMPROVED:SAFETY FOR YOU: Having used these traps from time to time over the years, I can safely say that the Easy set/release is a tremendous improvement. If you are using one of the older style traps I'm sure that you will appreciate the safety and convenience of this improved model.SAFETY FOR TRAPPED ANIMALS: Havahart seems to have done a good job on de-burring the interior of the trap in order to keep trapped animals from wounding themselves needlessly. As some animals get pretty frenetic when trapped, this is a humane improvement that is especially important if one plans to relocate/release the animal.PRO:Proven, reliable, durable design - now improved!New one-hand door mechanism is a great improvement.Widely available. [It's a Havahart]Good instructions included.Bait recommendations included.Lightweight.CON:I wish Havahart would put a small door on the bait side of the trap so that it isn't such a long reach to place the bait. As the trap is designed now; and has been previously, it is a long way to reach to place bait all the way at the other end of the trap from the door!POTENTIAL PROBLEM:Our trap arrived with two of the rubber caps that are on the ends of rods missing. I assume that they were jostled off in shipping and I hoped they were still in the box but they weren't. One was missing on the \"axle\" for the trap door; the other for one side of the connecting rod for the bait tray.IMO, this is a problem that Havahart would be wise to remedy - and that should be easily done by putting a small drop of some kind of appropriate adhesive onto the rod ends during assembly.CONCLUSION: I priced a similar-sized trap at the famous Asian tool importer and this improved design - with safe, one-hand handling and mostly burr-free interior - makes the traps there obsolete. This is the one to get for the long run.
B000H6JJEA Caught a raccoon in this the first night. This guy was getting really brazen and didn't seem to have any fear of people at all. In a neighborhood withlots of small kids it seemed like a good idea to catch it and move it to a less populated area. Animal Control came and checked it out as healthy and relocated it for me as well (for 75 bucks).  Easy to setup and sturdy.
B000H6JJEA Our Humane Society uses these, since they're easy to set and effective. Was thrilled to receive this, because we have feral cats living under our house. The trap is wonderful because:1. We have the cats spayed/neutered and vaccinated, then released, thereby reducing the feral cat population.2. Those who are injured (and many are, due to cat fighting) get a second chance.3. They stop spraying all around our property once they're released!4. No one gets hurt.5. Feral cats who are vaccinated and released cannot spread disease to domestic cats in the neighborhood.The trap is easy to bait and set. Even if you inadvertently trap someone else's pet, the animal is never harmed.We don't have a rodent problem, but for those who do, this fairly large trap is suitable for animals as small as gophers and as large as raccoons. Recommended.
B000H6JJEA This new Easy Set Havahart trap is so much simpler to set than the old models!  I've used older models in the past to catch small animals, but this was my first experience using a larger trap for nuisance animals in my yard.The trap arrived fully assembled in the box, and I had it set up in about 5 minutes with a bit of smelly cat food as bait in a china bowl set past the trigger plate.  Other Havaharts have required tedious fiddling with bars and levers, and one tiny move can set them off.  This trap is just so easy!  You pull back on the lever -- one simple step -- and the trap is set. It stays set, until an animal walks into the trap and triggers the door to close.If you're worried about human predators, you can use a length of chain or a bicycle lock to secure it to a tree or fence in your yard.I was trying to catch an animal who has been pestering my pets -- well, I've caught a raccoon, possum, and feral cat. The raccoon was so funny to see in the trap, napping gently, as if he had been busted a hundred times before in our semi-urban neighborhood, and was just waiting for bail.  All were released a good distance from my house, and my pets have not been bothered any more.
B000H6JJEA We have a major ferrel cat problem in out neighborhood and this has been a great trap for catching the varmints so they can be handed over to the local shelter.  Setting it is incredibly easy, most cats don't fear it and the trap is quite harmless and safe for both the cat and you.I do not see any flaw in the trap that could make it better.  It catches varmints you do not want like skunks, but it isn't like it could be made to only work for the critter you want.  And cat bait is cross, but tit isn't the trap's fault.I did find a way to make it more effective.  A wireless speaker making kitty noises draws the cats to it faster.  And closing the trap for the night cuts back on unwanted varmints like raccoons and skunks.There may be a better trap, but I haven't found it.
B000H6JJEA We've been using a smaller Havahart cage for years and it's served us well.  One of our cats, a gentle giant, likes nothing better than to \"invite\" his little furry friends into the house and let them run around.  He never seems to harm them but he's dedicated to catching them and bringing them home with him.  So many is the day when we encounter some poor terrified chipmunk or mouse racing around trying to get back outside to freedom.  We've found the easiest and most successful solution is to bait the Havahart trap with something like peanut butter and wait until the victim gets hungry enough to bite.  From then, it's a simple matter of taking the cage outside and releasing the animal.This new cage is the perfect size for larger animals like raccoons, skunks and possums, all of which frequent our yard upon occasion.  Our dog used to bark when he saw them which would usually deter them from hanging around.  Since he died last year, there's nothing to discourage the animals from making nuisances of themselves and that's where the Havahart comes in.The first thing I noticed, aside from the size, of course, is that the opening and closing mechanism has been greatly improved over the older one.  It really is one-handed and so simple that even a klutz like I am had no trouble operating it.  A big plus for me, it's structured so that the user is protected from unwanted contact with the animal who is more than likely angry, scared and in no mood to be trifled with.This is a solidly built, sturdy cage, well suited for its purpose which is to humanely trap and relocate unwanted animals.
B000H6JJEA This Easy Set trap really lives up to the name. I have a problem with armadillos digging up my hedges and plants in my yard. The first night I captured one right away, after a month I've caught 8 total. I have also caught 3 opossums, a stray cat, a rabbit and my friendly groundhog. After each capture I then transported all the animals(still inside the trap) with exception to the cat and groundhog, to a large wooded area many miles away.It is easy to carry, open and release. The price is very good for the durability, quality and ease of this innovative trap. This is no cheap Wallet Mart trap , which I have used before with great disappointment!
B000H6JJEA I prefer this catch and release method for taking care of nuisance critters. I have no desire to kill an animal foraging for food. Someday I might be out there foraging myself.It's highly recommended that you wear thick impenetrable gloves while handling this cage with a critter inside, as most critters have sharp teeth and claws and will be frightened and try to scratch at you when you go to pick this up. We lay an old sheet over the top of the cage to comfort the animal as we transport to a new location.Whatever you do, make sure you check your trap a couple times a day. Morning and evening. It's inhumane to leave an animal trapped for more than a half day in cold or hot weather.The trap itself works great and it's hard to imagine how a critter could get out, once trapped inside, but really tiny critters might not be heavy enough to engage the trap door and really big critters could just get stuck, but not contained. We've had no problems thus far and are relocating raccoons that have taken a liking to our veggie and fruit garden. I can't speak to whether or not the raccoons are enjoying their new homes by the lake, but we are enjoying our garden without the raccoons.
B000H6JJEA I have used several cage traps in my life and this one is the best one yet. Some old ones were so complicated I don't know if I ever set it right. This one? Just pull the hinged handle back and it is set.You bait the pressure plate, with the right bait. This is the most important point, you have to use the right bait for the right animal. The trap comes with a guide on what you should use. This model has a single door and that is the kind I prefer. Easier to catch and easier to release, and the fewer moving parts, the less that can break and yes after you catch something, it will do everything in its power to break out. So your trap has to be strong enough to hold what it catches and this one is.
B000H6JJEA I have an older HavahartHavahart 1045 36-by-10-by-12-Inch Two-Door Cage Trap for Raccoons, Stray Cats and Woodchucksthat I've been using for years to catch ground hogs (woodchucks).This trap is intended for use by beginners.  It is perfectly suited to that task because:1) It is fully assembled.2) It can deployed from the box in seconds.  Simply position the trap, toss in some bait and cock the handle to set.3) Setting/clearing the trap is a one-handed operation that requires virtually no skill whatsoever.3) The metal hand guard gives additional protection when carrying an animal.4) You can release the animal using the top handle (unlike earlier models)If you trying to trap smaller game, consider the 1083 as an alternative:Havahart 1083 Easy Set/Release One Door Cage Trap for Small Rabbits, Skunks and Squirrels 17-by-7-by-7-Inches.  The 1085 trap is much too large for smaller animals.To be honest, my older trap was built better and has no plastic parts but it is much harder to set.  TheHavahart 1085 32-by-10-by-12-Inch Easy Set/Release One-Door Cage Trap for Raccoons, Stray Cats and Woodchucksis set by pulling the handle back which takes under a second.The following comments are for existing Havahart trappers who want to know how this (more expensive) trap compares to its (less expensive) predecessors.  Similar to other reviewers, I noted the  following:1) The rolled metal used to hold the cage together and will have to be replaced with hog rings.2) The Plastic carrying handle is held onto the hand guard with 2 small rivets as is the cocking handle.3) The hand guard is attached to the cage with bent metal tabs only.4) The cage is constructed inconsistently.  Spacing of the bars it tighter towards the ends - strangely favoring the fully enclosed end with the most reinforcement and leaving the center of the cage the weakest and the door end coming in second.  Others have claimed that large cats/coons can hunch their backs and exploit the cage's weakness by bending it to release the door and escape.  I don't doubt this given their determination to escape.5) The trigger plate on the 1085 takes more pressure than on the 1045 to set it off.6) The coated steel cable that connects the cocking handle to the trap door is thin and does not appear to be adjustable nor user-serviceable.  If the cable stretches or breaks, this trap would still be easy enough to set.I trap woodchucks using a simple method.  I find one of their holes and position my trap along a fence line with NO BAIT.  My score is 5 chucks, a skunk, an opossum and no coons/cats.The 1085 only has one door so more advanced techniques are required.  No even the dumbest animal is going to walk into an un-baited single door trap.  For the 1085, I covered the top so it looked more like a tunnel.  I baited the track with melon and placed it along another fence line where I know at least 2 woodchucks live.  Got my first woodchuck today (day 2) in an unbaited trap at the end of a fence line.  I laid a few boards on the side leading up to the trap to funnel in the animal.  I didn't disguise the trap in any way because woodchucks aren't to smart.Bottom Line: Yes, I recommend this 1085 trap.  The 1085 (this trap) is hands-down the easiest trap I've ever set.  Havahart did a great job designing this trap and it looks like it will last pretty well.
B000H6JJEA Pros on this thing is, it's easy to set and caught a coon the first night out.I recommend this if you have a small/med animal problem.Raccoon was safely relocated, not animals were harmed during this trial.
B000H6JJEA While I haven't yet succeeded in trapping any prey with this, I'm extremely impressed with both the design and construction and am now certain that it lives up to all of the manufacturer's claims. It appears quite sturdy, is very easy to set up and once you've captured that pesky critter very safe to transport and release with endangering either yourself or the animal.
B000H6JJEA I have used an earlier version of this trap to help rid the condominium complex where I was living at the time of invasive raccoons and feral cats by trapping them and taking them to the animal shelter.  I liked it then, and I like it even better now.  The most important improvement over the earlier version is that there is a far larger solid metal shield around the handle, which should contribute greatly to peace of mind for anybody carrying off an angry raccoon in this trap.  It's also somewhat easier to set the trap.  I didn't find this to be difficult with the previous model, but the new mechanism is a small improvement.I'll note that the axle for the trap door got stuck in the side of the box in which the manufacturer packed the trap.  This resulted in difficulties in extracting the trap from the box and necessitated a tiny bit of work to put the axle back in place.
B000H6JJEA Easy to set. I bought this to catch the woodchucks that were trying to nest under my deck. Sturdy and it works.
B000H6JJEA It says this is for raccoons, stray cats, groundhogs, opossums, and armadillos, which is completely misleading. You would be lucky to get two decent size raccoons in here, or one armadillo and one groundhog. Tops.
B000H6JJEA I received the cage yesterday and at 7:30 AM today I caught the first squirrel. The cage is solid and well-made. The animal has to enter and step on the triggering mechanism to close the door cage. This is a good quality of cage because I have tested that even a light-weight animal such as a squirrel can trigger the door close. (I have another, smaller cage that can be easily triggered without stepping into the cage. It can be frustrating to find the door was shut with no animal inside). I submitted two photos under \"Pikmin\" name.
B000H6JJEA This product works pretty much as advertised. The mechanism that holds the door open, and then springs the trap when an animal is inside works properly. Overall, the product is well made.If you have, or if you are thinking about one of the old style live traps, this trap will feel flimsy and cheaply made. The cage is much less stout than the old style ones. I worry that if you threw this unit out in your barn when not in use, chances are when you came back to use it again, the cage would have become bent or dinged up, and would no longer function properly. Also, just looking at the design, I doubt that this cage hold a big raccoon. Raccoons are big and smart, and I have no doubt a big raccoon would get out by simply overpowering the cage.If you live in an urban area, are are dealing with a one time varmint issue, this trap might work. If you live in the country, and want something to use for years, I feel this unit is under-designed.I would suggest trying to buy some of the old style heavy duty ones used over this unit.
B000H6JJEA I had the last version of this trap, which had a door you had to open from below, and which had a little notch that the pressure plate attached to in order to trigger the trap. Every time it was triggered by accident, it would need to be re-set with this notch, and it was a cumbersome process (if you've ever used such a trap you will know what I'm talking about)Now if there was an animal in the trap, you'd have to reach over and open it from where the thing wants to rush out. This is a little disconcerting if the animal is at all agitated or aggressive.This new design  allows everything to be controlled via a latch on the top. If it triggers by accident, easy to reset. If there is an animal to release, you can stand behind the trap and open it - staying far away as it rushes into the distance.A nice update of an already effective product.My only concern is for this magical top lever to work, it's connected via a braided metal cable and pulley type system to the door. It seems like this is something that has a possibility of wearing out, as opposed to the old design which was entirely solid metal tubing. So time will tell.
B000H6JJEA The Havaheart 1085 is for larger animals such as racoons, stray cats, etc. with the idea of catching and releasing the animal.  The trap is so simple it comes with just a one-page manual and thankfully arrives pre-assembled.  The manual gives ideas on some of the best bait for luring various animals.  I've tested the trap trigger with my hand and food cans, and it triggered every time.I've read some of the other reviews here, and I can't understand why a small number of people having quality issues with the trap trigger mechanism or the quality of the trap.  I lightly shook the cage to simulate an animal jumping on it or rubbing against it, and the trap wasn't set off.  This cage is solid and well built.  Maybe others have an older version of this trap?I will be using this trap for some ground squirrels that are eating my mom's flowers.  I went with the larger trap thinking it could handle small and large critters, if the need ever arises.  Based on my tests, the trap would trigger a minimum with about 8-10oz food can on it.  Anything less wouldn't set it off.  I would think something like 4-6oz should be the default setting as that would work with big and small critters.  Since the squirrels distribute th
B000H6JJEA When this product arrived at my home, my spouse took one look and asked what I was going to try to catch in it since it is considerably larger than those we have had in the past.  My mind was on the destroyed squirrel-sized trap that a raccoon had demolished many years ago and on our two docile golden retrievers who would not stand up well in a confrontation with a raccoon. Should another appear, I wanted to be prepared with a larger trap. I was a bit concerned that I would not have a chance to try it out any time soon.  Enter my neighbor Sally.  An opossum was rendering her nights sleepless as her pug and beagle were regularly awakened by the critter poking around in their garbage cans. If you have ever lived with an insistent dog, you know exactly what Sally was going through. So, I went to her rescue. We set the trap with a a blueberry bagel generously smeared with  peanut butter and placed it behind the garbage containers next to the brick of her house. The first night passed uneventfully, but on the second we caught the midnight marauder.  The only problem is that this was a big opossum and he was suitably upset at being penned up. No playing possum for this guy. He hissed and moved around in the cage as we loaded it in the back of her SUV on a plastic tarp and took off to her parent's acreage out of town where we gladly released him.  He immediately ran into the woods, and I swear he flopped down to pretend death as soon as he was out of sight of us.  Needless to say the cage works and it was not too big at all.Havahart 1085 32-by-10-by-12-Inch Easy Set/Release One-Door Cage Trap for Raccoons, Stray Cats and Woodchucks
B000H6JJEA The no-kill cat shelter I volunteer for uses traps similar to this Havahart to trap stray and feral cats.  I've used a variety of traps and know the kind favored by the shelter volunteers who go out at all hours of the night checking the traps. I have used a trap in my own backyard to trap a stray that was then turned over to the shelter, so I got lots of experience and tips for what makes a good trap and how best to use it.On the plus side, the Havahart 1085 is indeed easy to set and release.  Significantly easier than the other traps I have used.  And it is a plus that there is a metal plate under the handle so as to reduce the chance of your being bitten or scratched by the trapped animal when you pick up the trap.  Most traps of this nature require a two-handed fiddly operation of setting the trip bar \"just-so\" in a notch and hoping it doesn't jostle loose when you put the trap into place.  With the Havahart, you just swing the lever up and over to set.  When it triggers, the handle flips over to the other side - to release the animal, just pull it back again.There are two minuses with this model that I note, however.  First is about that handle.  Often you want to place the trap under some brush or a shrub where it is not quite so noticeable by the animal.  But with the Havahart, you have to make sure that the handle has room to swing up and over and not get stuck on a branch or something else.  The other downside is that the end away from the door does not open, so when you bait it, you have to do it from the door end and it's a loooong way past the trip plate.  This may be a problem for people with short arms.Two tips from veteran cat trappers:  1) Put thin pieces of cardboard on the floor of the trap and up onto the trip plate, so that the animal doesn't feel cold metal.  Be careful not to put the cardboard so far up on the trip plate that it may interfere with the operation.  2) Use a paper, plastic or metal dish or bowl to hold the bait food, nothing breakable, as the trapped animal may thrash around.I note that the wire and metal is galvanized, which will inhibit rust, but I have seen other brands where the wire is all plastic-coated and this lasts longer.
B000H6JJEA Like many of the reviewers here, I grew up using an older version of the Havahart trap (the trap I grew up with is still handed about within my family).Ease of setting and trigger plate:This trap is brilliantly simply to set.  Fold a handle from one side to the other and DONE.  3 seconds.  I LOVE IT.  The older Havahart trap my favily owns was a pain, the plate had to be balanced just so on a pivot point.. and that would reset way to easily.  This is a vastly improved design (I expected a better design given that the trap is several decades old, though I am still surprised at how blindingly simple it is).Just one door:The older trap had 2 trap doors, which helped lure the animal in, but I've had problems with quick little critters (in this case, a not so little rat) be able to scoot out the trap of my old Havahart before the door in front of it dropped.  I think the one door is a better approach, the animal is facing away from the only door when the trap is sprung, so is much less likely to get out.Sturdiness:My older trap is made of much heavier gauge wire than this trap (the 1085)and the panel opposite the opening is held on by small wrapped pieces of metal which appear flimsy.  While being smaller gauge than old traps, nothing that is going to fit into that trap is going to break that wire.  Maybe bend the panels or break the wraps, not the wire.I tested the panel opposite the opening to see if there was any change a panicked animal could pry the wire wraps off, I was not at all gentle with it (I'm good at pushing things beyond their breaking point). I was impressed with how well the seemingly flimsy metal wraps held.Overall, I am very pleased to own this trap!
B000H6JJEA Got to love the Havahart traps...  So easy to set the trap.  I was recommended to try marshmallows to trap raccoons, and have had luck in the past using them.  But my new pest, (who moved into an old outhouse), arrived during the rainy season, which is hard on marshmallows, so we used tuna.  I removed the lid of a can of tuna, then squeezed the can until it was warped into oval that was almost closed.  You don't want it easy for the critter to reach through and get the prize, since raccoons are very very crafty...  Place the can in the center of the trap, and wait for morning.  Once you have your pest, you can safely use the handle to lift the cage and transport the animal to parts unknown, then simple roll the cage over, which allows the door to open and the animal to leave.  Good luck!
B000H6JJEA The trap is well constructed and ready to go out of the box. Made of heavy galvanized steel it will hold up to the elements.I managed to catch a groundhog and a bird. Plus my cat got into it twice. The beauty of the trap is it CAN catch things, and will not harm them.It is easy to set. Simply flip lever over and it is set. Unlike past incarnations of the have a heart where you have to move bars and set much like a mousetrap, this sets easier.Unfortunately making it set easier also makes it trip a little too easy. You can't move it once it's set or it will go off.Overall, though a great trap.
B000H6JJEA I got this a replacement for the one we used when we lived in the country and would try to catch stray cats to get them spade/neutered and adopted out. We most often would get possums, lots of possums. This trap is bigger than the one we had, and is really perfect for raccoons.  very pleased!
B000H6JJEA Havahart traps are pretty much -the- classic live trap.  I've used them off and on for decades.  They work, they are robust, and they don't break from being stored for years.  These traps are best, obviously, for catching nuisance animals in suburban areas.  Especially if that nuisance animal is your neighbor's cat.  The other good thing is that these traps are relatively child safe.  Try setting aconibearin the 'burbs and you're asking for trouble.The main point here is that these traps have been around for a long long time because the design is timeless and are very very good.  I've trapped a lot of cats (is this your cat?  It's been spraying my back door ...) and other animals with havahart traps.  The local animal control department uses them too.Please note that an unattended live trap turns fatal.  Animals can die of thirst in these things.  Check them at least daily.
B000H6JJEA Well this item is one I have used prior. But NOT as intended so my average review is based upon the fact I tried to use it for an animal NOT intended. It seemed like such a good idea at the time.....Now some will find it funny, but at the time it was anything BUT funny. We had a 30 foot redwood deck about 12 inches high around the side of our house as a patio area. Awhile back we found that every morning 5 or 6 baby skunks would be peeking in our plate glass window trying to play with our 2 22 pound older female cats (Lucy & Ethel).  It was great watching them play through that glass, teasing each other, and just having a blast. They NEVER smelled at all so I figured (like an IDIOT!!!!) that maybe they came from a mother skunk who had been unscented or whatever you call it and had been someones pet. Now give me a break cuz I was raised in the City and at age 62 all I ever saw up close were creatures from the sea from my lifetime of surfing. How would I know anything about skunks? And they were SO cute. It got so my wife & I would go out and play with them, they got to be like family.Then \"IT\" happened. Yeah, I let the cats out to play since they all seemed to be wanting to play together for a couple weeks now. Uh, MISTAKE! Lucy & Ethel go out and sniff the baby skunks. You can guess what happened? Yeah...The turn around and let us ALL have it. I guess they have some kind of inherent knowledge once they mature enough or who knows. In my entire like I never had a more disturbing moment. Not even in War. So because they had been so \"cute\" for weeks leading up to this, the wife wouldn't let me kill or poison the little stinkers....So that is where the trap comes in.Time for BAD PLAN #2. Maybe it was because I was still known for drinking a couple beers now & then back in those days? Maybe it was just because I USED to be really busy before I retired and never gave it much thought. It just pissed me off! So my plan? Oh yeah, my plan....I bought just one trap. Set it at the end of my deck where they would exit every night. BINGO! And what do I do that nexrt morning? You know, the one where I would now just pick up the cage & safely take it, put it in my truck & drive them off to a remote area? Yeah, THAT dumb ass plan. Why, Why oh WHY did I never even consider that just because one or 2 much less the 3 that I now find in my magic trap, were in fact IN that trap, that they couldn't still spray me????? Yep, the whole family got me again and point blank range this time. So this story ends with my new friends at Lloyd Pest Control coming out to \"dispose\" of our family of skunks. I think he spent 4 times longer laughing and actually falling down laughing at my ignorance (actually, I think the word he used was STUPDITY?), than he did removing all the skunks. He told me he would bring back my trap that afternoon. I told him to just keep it......So does this trap work. Oh yeah. Works great. But like My dear old Dad used to say, you can't fix STOOPID! First thing the pest control guy did was toss a tarp over that cage so he wouldn't get sprayed. So simple. And that is how I became the legendary SKUNK HUNTER in my neighborhood. How this trap works on it's intended victims, I can't tell you. But I wanted another one to give my best friend who is battling it's intended audience. Plus, he checks with Google before making a fool out of himself..........
B000H6JJEA If you buy this trap for the sole purpose of trapping small animals, then this is the trap for you.  By small, I mean, rabbits, squirrels, small cats, baby raccoons, small opossoms, groundhogs, etc..  If it's a BIG cat, the tail may get caught in the door.  If it's a BIG raccoon, it may not fit, or it may tear the trap apart.  This is ONLY for small critters.  With that in mind, this trap works very well and is as advertised.  It's easy to set the trap, catch the offending critter and then carry it off to release it or dispose of it at your will.  I would recommend this trap.
B000HCLLMM I really liked this grill cover when I got it. It was attractive and felt heavy duty. I used it gently to try and preserve it for more than a season, but unfortunately that didn't matter. I got a large tear on a corner within 1 summer, and a 2nd smaller rip by the second season. I garaged my grill from October-April 2 years in a row, so this never saw anything more then rain showers. I've patched the tears up with gorilla tape on the inside, but I'm really bummed that this didn't last longer, especially with one adult owner who tries to make things last.
B000HCLLMM The Good:  I use this to cover my Weber Spirit 3 burner grill and couldn't be happier.  After years of using the black cover that came with the grill, it had finally torn and disintegrated to the point where it was useless.  I bought this cover after reading review and I am very impressed.  The build quality is very high and the material feel like a professional expensive canvas as compared to the plastic feel of the stock cover.  It is truly waterproof, as opposed to the stock cover which always had condensation under it.  The size is perfect for my grill model and it has nice handles to aid in taking off and putting back on.  Overall, I highly recommend it, even if you don't need a cover right now.  Just the lack of condensation alone is worth it to me to buy since it will prolong the life of your grill.The Bad:  Nothing!
B000HCLLMM This is a well made grill cover.  It is also nice looking, however,I actually bought one size bigger than what the dimensions called for. I'm glad I did because width and depth of the larger size fit nicely however, it is too short.  It hangs about 8 inches from the bottom.  I kept it but would have given it 5 stars had it been longer.
B000HCLLMM Looking at the build quality of this cover makes you wonder just how much profit other companies are making for their poorly made ones which cost almost the exact same.  This is of high quality fabric and I'm actually very surprised it only cost $33.  The pockets are a nice touch and the pull string to keep it all together make for a nice outdoor cover.  Buy this one and you will be pleasantly surprised.
B000HCLLMM After reading many reviews and suggested sizes to choose from I decided to try the Medium size for my grill. I'm glad I did since it fit like a glove over my grill. It was not too tight nor was it too big. The click and lock clasps are awesome and the adjustable cord works great as well. I have my grill up in a corner on my deck where it is very windy. The cover doesn't budge once everything is tied down and secured. The built-in handles make removal and replacing the cover a cinch. It's well made and feels like it will last for a very long time.*UPDATE* - 7/29/135 stars to 3 stars. It's been a little over a year since I had this cover and it ripped in three separate places. Two rips were along the top side of the open vent and handle and the other was along the stitching at the bottom of the cover where the drawstring cord is embedded. All rips occurred while I was removing the cover using the handles. The bottom rip occurred when one of the plastic buckles became lodged between one of the front casters as I was taking it off. It ripped very easily so it was not like I was yanking it off. I guess after Hurricane Sandy, the winter and the summer elements have taken its toll on the fabric which became very frail. It's listed as having a 3 year manufacturer's warranty so I will be looking for a replacement from Amazon. I gave it 3 stars and not 1 due to it being very convenient and having all of the perks of this cover that others with triple the price don't have. I rather have a replacement then purchase another cover for more money especially that there's a 3 year warranty. Any other cover won't have all of the details and perks that this cover has for the price I paid of $29.*Update #2* - 7/31/13Amazon contacted me within a day. Since my 30 day window for returns have expired they informed me to contact the manufacturer. I was given their customer service email and phone number. I then contacted the manufacturer via email and within a day I received a reply. I was asked to fill out a \"Product Warranty Claim Form\" and to send a picture of the damage and I will then receive a new one by mail. I was glad I did not have to ship the cover to the manufacturer. So far everything seems to be going smoothly with the warranty. As soon as I receive my new cover I will raise my rating.*Update #3* - 8/14/13I received my new cover under the 3 year warranty. It arrived in just 10 days after I submitted my warranty form. You will need to get the model code placed under the cover on a tab, a copy of the purchase receipt from Amazon and have a picture sent along with the warranty form including the model code on the form sent to the vendor to receive your new cover. I paid $29 for the cover so getting this cover at that price along with the 3 yr warranty is definitely a bargain. You will have a headache requesting a replacement and having to go through the return process but it wasn't that bad doing so. This cover will last you a year before it begins to rot and fall apart. I will be doing this again August 2014 since I now know it won't last more than a year. Hopefully the replacement will be just as smooth next year. If not, I will update my review again. Upgraded my rating from 3 to 4 stars.
B000HCLLMM This is the best cover I'ver ever owned or even seen.  It's a heavy cover because it's made to be usesd in very heavy duty situations.  It completely covers the grill and has a draw cord on the bottom to seal it up.
B000HCLLMM This Grill Cover is both functional and good looking! We live in area that gets some fairly rough rough weather and this cover has held up well for over a full year now.Features-+ Quality; heavy material that has withstood high winds and a lot of snow+ Fit; the medium size fits my Webber grill with side burner just right+ Aesthetics; looks good on my porchThere really isn't anything that I don't like about this well made and reasonably priced cover!Highly Recommended!CFH
B000HCLLMM Love this Cover. I have had 2 OEM Weber covers for my 3 year old grill. I will not buy them again, they become brittle and crack within 12 months. This Veranda cover is awesome, better price, higher quality, and has awesome handles to lift it off and to assist putting back on over the grill. I have a 2011 Weber Genesis which measures 60 wide, I bought the 64&#34; Large Veranda and it fits beautifully with just enough play in the cover so it doesn't get snagged covering and uncovering, Fits just like in the picture shown. The 60&#34; weber I had, made specifically for my model grill was a bit too snug where it would actually rub against the knobs and turn on the gas while covering it up.
B000HCLLMM I bought this for my Weber Genesis Silver.  It fit perfectly over the grill.  Two things I really liked about this cover.  First, there were no vents like my old Weber cover.  Basically the vents defeated the purpose of a cover.  Dust would get in - especially during our dust storms out here in AZ.  Second, it's heavy and has an internal liner.  This keeps the bottom of the grill from flapping up and getting dust in that way.This is even cheaper than the Weber cover.
B000HCLLMM Wow what a great grill cover. This thing is HUGE and heavy duty. There is no way this is ever going to blow off my grill. The fabric this is made out of stays flexible all the time even in the deep cold - it doesn't feel cheap and nasty like Weber's covers.I have an ancient Weber gas grill and have always used Weber's custom made grill covers. They have held up over time, lasting around ten years each. That doesn't mean they look great or feel great, they just do their job covering my grill. Over time the vinyl has gotten hard. This grill cover is way cheaper than the Weber custom job, is made of heavier fabric, covers my grill better, and is more flexible.There are two side vents to let water escape from inside the grill. And there is a large zippered pouch on the front of the cover. The bottom is almost overkill it is so well built. There is an elastic cord to cinch the bottom tight around the grill. There are also two snap tie downs to attach the cover even better to the grill.What a great grill cover for an incredibly reasonable price.
B000HCLLMM This is incredibly well made for the cost.  I love the different cinches and clips.  I'd been planning on putting a rock on top so it wouldn't blow away, but it has clips you can wrap around the legs which is perfect for the windy area we live in.  The cover repels water well.  I couldn't be happier.
B000HCLLMM Well, as others have said this is a really nice cover.  It looks great, has clips to hold it in place, and does a nice job of protecting the grill.  But - just like anything else you leave outdoors all the time, it doesn't last forever.  I purchased mine in Feb 2011, and last week I went out to use the grill, and the cover ripped from dry rot as I was trying to remove it.  I just put a piece of brown duct tape on the outside and inside of the rip and kept using the cover.  It will last a while longer before I have to replace it.I'd buy it again, but just don't think of it as the last cover you'll every have to buy.
B000HCLLMM This *was* a well-made grill cover and though the smallest size was too big for our grill, it served us well for the first year. After the first summer, it started fading pretty badly; the bottom color is now a purple-ish color. After the 2nd summer, I noticed tears on the top, towards where the handles are. Now on our third year, there are multiple tears and the \"fabric\" has become brittle and tears easily. For what I paid for this item, it should have lasted longer. Each time we remove and replace the cover now, it tears a little more. So, expect to only get about two years out of this before it starts tearing (if you look at other reviews, you'll see they have the same issue, too).We do store our grill and cover in the garage 4-5 months out of the year, too.Would not recommend. Will post pics later today.
B000HCLLMM I didn't want the standard black plastic cover that came with my new grill so I ordered this one.  It is very heavy duty, extremely well made and looks really nice too!  I think you will be pleased with this cover if you are looking for something nicer.
B000HCLLMM This is such a NICE grill cover! Oh my gosh! Its thick, heavy, but easy to get on and off, and doesn't blow off, even without being secured and with all the wind we get (off the ocean). My neighbor's grill cover is the thinner black kind and it blows off daily, but never ours. I love this grill cover, and it just makes the whole patio look nicer!
B000HCLLMM Our grill sits outside all year. We live in Northern California, no snow but very windy and a winter full of cold rain. We were buying  a new grill cover every six months. You know, the $22 black plastic tablecloth-like ones, with the white fuzz on the inside. The last one got its first rip in only two weeks!Finally, we got smart and purchased this \"Class Accessories 73922 Veranda Cart-Style Barbeque Cover\".  Our BBQ measures 62 inches wide. We ordered the Large size of the cover, which the amazon page states is 64 inches wide. It fits our BBQ perfectly, not too big and not too tight, either. We live in a very windy area, so the ability to pull in the bottom hem a bit with the elastic cord is a big plus.We LOVE this sturdy and good looking cover. If we'd bought this two years ago, we would have saved ourselves some money!
B000HCLLMM The cover is priced right and I like the colors but when on the grill it does not conform as the picture shows. My cart grill is exactly as shown too but the edges are not custom looking as per the picture. For a proper look and fit you need to get the cover made by your grill company.
B000HCLLMM I tried several BBQ covers and this was the best by far.  My BBQ is 60\" wide and this cover fit well and seems very durable.
B000HCLLMM This was SO much cheaper than the cover that was made specifically for my grill.  Plus, it's nicer.  It fit well on the Charbroil 3 burner I have.  I LOVE the pockets on it.I did manage to tear it a bit but it hasn't frayed or weathered on the slice at all.  I will probably do a quick iron-on patch for it because I'm confident that it won't otherwise compromise the protection the product offers.
B000HCLLMM I purchased this to replace the cover that actually was made by the manufacturer to that fit my grill. I purchased the medium size to fit my Weber 320 unit. Perfit fit!Couldn't be happier. Only wish this product was made in the USA. For that I will only give it 4 stars. Sorry, but I believe we can manufacture this here just as well as China can.
B000HCLLMM It just arrived - and my first impression is I love it. Now that may change over time but for openers it gets 5 stars.This cover replaces the 2 year old Weber cover on Genesis E330 gas grill - the material is very supple and easy to handle while putting on and removing the cover. The fit is much more relaxed than the Weber making using it a snap. The Weber was very form fitting and in 2 years it became somewhat brittle and was very difficult getting it on and off.The two anchoring systems are a nice plus as well as the handles and vents.May 8th. Up-Date:I found a new feature that I like about this cover: the handles that you use to lift it off the grill also double as a convenient way to hang it up while grilling. I just slip the handles over a fence post - there is not need to fold or have lay on the ground. When it is time to put it back on the grill I jus lift it off the post and it properly oriented to put back on, no fumbling to find the font.My LIKE level is growing.
B000HCLLMM Just the perfect color, size and looks great. I don't know how I can get excited about a BBQ cover, but I have looked and looked for just the right one and this is it. Very well made to last many years. Worth the price.
B000HCLLMM So far, this is the best barbecue cover I've used. And the good thing is it's probably the least expensive. For what this is, they should and could charge twice what I paid here on Amazon. The materials are heavy and well put together. I'm very happy with this... and so is my wife.
B000HCLLMM This cover is so roomy that it more than covers my grill with attached side tables. Treated canvas-like material is very well made. I was having to buy a new grill cover every year but this one looks like it will hold up in the NC summer sun and rainy, cold winter.
B000HCLLMM The cover is made well and quite sturdy. The cover has a venting system for those of us in humid areas, and also should not fly off during a storm. I purchased this for a Weber e210 grill, and the cover has plenty of room to fit properly. There are also 2 adjustable ties on the bottom so the cover is not touching the ground.
B000HCLLMM This company makes all different sizes of covers for various sorts of outdoor furniture and appliances.  This particular one, the \"Large 64 inch\" grill cover, is clearly intended for Weber's line of gas grills.  It's really tough to know which grill cover goes with which grill.  After reading a few Amazon reviews, I bought the Large 64-inch to cover my new Weber Summit 470.  The prior reviews were correct: the cover fits perfectly in terms of shape, width, and depth.  However, in terms of height, it is about 6 inches too short to touch the ground.  That makes it tough - not impossible - to slip the hold-fast straps around the caster wheels; and it means that low spray (as from a lawn sprinkler, or a large amount of rain runoff) will be hitting your grill instead of the cover.  On the other hand, that means that air will be circulating in your grill's bottom compartment, where things like the drip pan live, and if you live in a mild climate that's probably a good thing.  When the covered grill gets rained on, the grill won't get wet, unless we're talking about a torrential downpour and gale-force winds; in which case, you'll want the deeper, XL-sized cover to prevent moisture entry in the bottom cabinet.The cover itself is made of a sturdy canvas-like cloth, quite tough, properly vented with rainproof vents, doesn't leak water, and is well fitted.  It has two handles, four holdfast straps to go around the casters, and the hem has an elastic drawstring.  It's easy to get on and off the grill even if you're doing it alone.  There is even a zippered pocket that goes across the top, although it's not clear to me what you'd want to keep in there - I don't use it.I'd buy this cover again, but I live in a very moderate climate in California.  If I lived in Green Bay, I'd send it back and exchange it for the XL sized cover.
B000HCLLMM Just go this to cover my Weber Genesis Platinum Grill. 100% better than the Weber cover, and easier to use. I love the two handles to lift off and it makes my patio look much nicer than the Weber black. In a heavy down pour of rain and wind this held up perfectly. I highly recommend these covers.  Going to get another one for my patio furniture and Weber Kettle Grill.
B000HCLLMM Initially, like many of the reviewers here, I was ecstatic with my grill cover.  The quality, features, and heft of this grill cover is impressive out of the box.  Unfortunately, you get about a year from this cover too -- two years if you are lucky.  And I've own two of these covers so I don't think it was a fluke.My environment though is more extreme when it comes to sun damage.  I live in the Phoenix, AZ area, and my grill sits in direct sunlight for about 75% of the daytime.  We don't get much rain here, and a few of the 2-star reviews felt that the rain caused the demise of their grill cover.  In my case, I think it was the brutal AZ sun.I also read a few other reviews where they noted their cover still looks good.  Well, other than some fading, so does mine but don't let that fool you.  You have to look up close and see that the interior water barrier is no longer holding and will make cracking sounds as you move the cover.  This may lead to water spots or rust on your grill of course.  The cover also weakened and will start to rip once it gets to this state.  Finally, and more concerning to me, there is a residue power all over the grill cover (both outside and inside) after two years.  I don't know what it is.  Does it have PVC in it from the PVC undercoating?  Is it getting in my food and in my lungs?  I don't want to risk it any longer so it is going in the trash.I can therefor only recommend this grill cover if it isn't in direct sun or direct rain for most of the time.
B000HCLLMM Two years old, still looks like newE320 gas grill.  We have used it for two winters now.  I just put it away for the spring, and was very pleased to see it still looks like new!This cover fits with rooms to spare.  The quality of the material is far superior to other grill covers I've owned, including the snapping straps.  The vented design keeps the cover from struggling to stay on in our North Texas winter windy storms.I love that the colors are light, rather than the usual black, making this look much more attractive when covered rather than looking like a big black hulk on the patio during the winter.Still happy I bought this cover, it is an excellent value for the money!
B000HCLLMM I have this on top of my Dyno-Glo gas grill great cover very well made and will last me a few years.  My weber plastic ones seems it will last me two years at best.  This one at least 3-5.
B000HCLLMM I've had this now for a while. It is heavy duty, stays in place, well made, stays pretty clean, easy to take on and off, well designed, good-looking. I have it on a Weber Summit.
B000HCLLMM This cover is super heavy duty, attractive, and fits nicely over our BBQ.  We keep our grill up on a covered veranda, so it is already protected somewhat, but it does get alot of wind.  We were suprized to find that this cover stays in place without the ties at the bottom being used.  When we get a blizzard coming, we'll fasten the bottoms and I have no doubt it will stay in place just fine.Side note:  This cover is hheeaavvvy!  Let husband take it on and off the grill. (It's his job to do the grilling anyway....Right?!)I only gave it four stars because I need to see how it does in the summer under our high mountain UV rays.
B000HCLLMM I almost bought a grill cover when I picked up my new grill.  They even included a 25% off coupon in the owners manual.  Luckily I checked here first, and hit on this model since it was clearly the favorite.  This grill cover is as good as the reviews claim.  Includes side-vents, handles, a zippered pocket...  A very well executed product for something as \"simple\" as a grill cover.  Highly recommended, I'll gladly join in on the 5 star reviews for this cover, well worth the price.
B000HCLLMM What a great cover for my grill and it has a matching one for my fire pit.  I couldn't be happier.  I have a chargrill with an extra burner on the right and an equivalent size shelf on the left and the large fits perfectly.  I was skeptical about ordering the size but I made the correct guess in ordering a large.
B000HCLLMM I bought this grill cover to replace one that had been destroyed by the sun over four years or so.  This cover is made with a heavy vinyl material, has side vents to prevent condensation, and has a drawstring bottom.  The Large fits my Kenmore 4-burner with side burner perfectly and is easy to get on and off.  I am pleased with this purchase and recommend it.
B000HCLLMM update, after one month of use, the top ripped, it was put on and off about 3 times. the top caught on part of the grill and ripped rather easily. I still like the look of the cover so I will patch it, but wish it were more sturdy. update again, I used a pool patch and fixed the tear, its holding really well. the patch sealed well to the fabric.my grill is a weber,its  64x24 inches. I was thinking the large size would fit too tight, as its is the same as the grill, so I went one size up to the 70x25 of the XL, I am glad I did, as the extra width makes getting this on and off very easy for me.  if your cover is too snug it will wear out as you tug to get it on and off.  this worked great, it hangs over a bit but not too much.  see the pix I attached.the bottom has clips to attach to the grill and each long end has elastic you can tighten up to really keep the wind from catching, which is important to me as my grill is on a second floor deck. each side has an upside down pocket with mesh so air can vent out but water won't get in.  in the front is a zippered pocket and that zipper has a flap over it so rain won't seep in the zipper tracks. the inside seams are all covered for more waterproofing and durability. its a nice heavy fabric and as you can see from the photos I posted, the rain just balls up on top and runs off. we had a nice rain the day after I put it on, so the test run was great. the underside stayed nice and dry. this also looks great on my deck.  my grill gets full hot sun most of the day so the  light cover should be nice. I will update at the end of the summer and as time goes on, as to how it holds up. so far we love this. and I would suggest to go a bit larger if the fit is too close, I am glad I did.
B000HCLLMM First I want to thank all the Weber owners who reviewed here.  This cover is fantastic.As others have alluded, the Weber covers are what best can be described as an afterthought.These Veranda covers are the exact opposite - High quality materials, high quality workmanship, functional design, attractive and durable.The only negative is that the large size (64in) is about 2 inches shorter than the OEM Summit series 400 cover.  Otherwise, it's perfect and I expect it to last as long as multiple Weber covers.  Happy grilling!
B000HCNEUY I love Classic Accessories items - we have a grill cover, patio chair covers, and a pontoon boat cover.  All are good quality and they look great.  They last a pretty long time, but the colors do fade, but for items which are out in the sun all the time, I guess that's to be expected.  I'm getting these for my daughter and son-in-law's chaise lounges so they won't have to take the cushions inside every day.
B000HCNEUY I have bought at least a half a dozen of Veranda Patio furniture covers.  They have made it through three harsh winters and still look good and retain their original qualities. I had to replace three tall chair covers not because there was anything wrong with them, but the squirrels liked the material so much they shredded some covers to use in their nests. They are not squirrel proof.
B000HCNEUY The Veranda has a very nice color and fit but like any other cover left outside they are only good for 1 year and then have to be replaced. Rain etc. takes its toll on the colors.
B000HCNEUY I'm Absolutely THRILLED with this purchase. This is the BEST MADE, BEST CONSTRUCTED AND from what I can tell, the LAST chaise covers I'll ever need to purchase. They REALLY stand up to the weather. Had a record 2\" rainfall yesterday..... I mean it poured. Water was laying on top of these covers in pools.  This morning I dumped off the standing water and checked the cushions. They were DRY AS A BONE.  If you need new covers........these are the ones to buy. They might be more expensive now, but in the long run, they'll save you money.  They'll last for MANY, MANY, MANY seasons to come. They're also stylish and dress up your patio when not in use. Vastly superior to those lousy old green or gray jobs you're probably using.  You'll absolutely fall in love with these..........9-10-2012 UPDATE...............These covers are STILL going strong and STILL is keeping my cushions bone dry after 2 full seasons of use.  Again, the best money I ever spent on covers..bar none.
B000HCNEUY I tried rubberized chair covers for my deck furniture and they began disintegrating almost immediately and barely made it through one season. I have had these on my furniture and after a season there is barely any sings of wear. Works well on my Patio Chaise.
B000HCNEW2 Got a brand new 36\" fire pit and wanted it protected.  Bought this cover and it's very well made and quite attractive.  The price is good and I'm sure I will be getting much more life out of my fire pit with it covered then if it were exposed to the weather.  Also bought the Cushion Storage Bag, the BBQ Kettle Cover and the Umbrella Cover.  Very pleased with everything.
B000HCNEW2 Perfect for my large Faulkner fire pit.  Seems extremely well made, high quality material, and fits real well.  Rain just beads up on it and rolls off.  Probably overkill, but better to have a higher quality cover than a piece of junk.
B000HCNEW2 As some reviewers have noted, this cover tends to run smaller than what is required to realistically cover a 44 inch fire pit.That being said, if you have one of the excellent Landmann 40 inch pits like we do this will work great for you and it is definitely priced right.
B000HCNEW2 Very heavy duty cover that will withstand the elements. The cover that came with my fire pit tore right away and I'm amazed how great this one looks with the matching one for my grill.  I couldn't be happier
B000HCNEW2 Nice cover for our 52&#34; built in fire pit perfectly.  It might be a bit too small for a 60&#34;.  Looks very durable and priced very reasonably.
B000HHHEF0 A friend of mine recommend this product when I was complaining about the squirrels getting into my feeder all the time and depriving the birds of their dinner. This really works well. It's easy to set up and easy to fill. The birds took to it right away -- I've actually seen them form a waiting line -- and my bird seed lasts a lot longer now that the squirrels can't get to it. I also wanted this to keep away the big bully birds like the grackles, and it seems to do the trick with them, too. The perches are very small, so the bigger birds really can't get on them. I have seen a grackle sitting on top of the feeder looking frustrated, so I consider this feeder a success. I really enjoying watching the birds chow down every day, and they often stick around and sing afterwards, so I get a nice concert. Good product!
B000HHHEF0 I love this product! It solved my squirrel problems immediately. Easy to use, and easy to keep clean.!
B000HHHEF0 This is one of three effective feeders I use that deter squirrels.  The birds love it and visit it often, but I no longer have problems with squirrels.  The feeder is easy to fill and hang, even on a fairly high pole, since the 'hanging' wire is semi-rigid.  With four ports from which the birds can get seeds it allows for plenty of aviary activity.  While a climbing squirrel could cause seeds to fall to the ground even though they couldn't eat directly from the feeder, a baffle on my pole makes access doubly tough.  It just isn't worth it to them, I guess, since they no longer come around.  The birds themselves drop plenty of seeds on the ground and it's the rare squirrel who tries to climb the pole anymore.  I like this feeder and would buy another if needed.  Of all my feeders, this is the birds' favorite.

B000HHHEF0 One of my bird feeders was constructed like a house with a porch in front and back. Birds trampling around on the porches were causing much of the seed to fall to the ground. I have had success with other Brome feeders so I decided to purchase the 1015 as a replacement. This is a superb feeder. Filling it is a simple and easy process. As soon as I filled it and hung it the birds headed for it just as soon as I walked away. The design of the feeder prevents excessive feed loss and also protects the feed from inclement weather. Squirrels hate the feeder because they cannot raid its contents. This is a great feeder and highly recommended.
B000HHHEF0 IT WORKS!  There's nothing more that I love to do than to watch the birds feed in my garden at this bird feeder, except maybe for watching the squirrels get foiled by this amazing squirrel-proof bird feeder!  No kidding!  I no sooner filled it with sunflower seeds that first time, hung it in the oak tree near my kitchen window and turned my back before the birds came (even varieties I hadn't seen before)...and so did those darn squirrels - but without any luck.  Those little piggies immediately assumed the WTF attitude with me!  I still laugh watching them get so flummoxed.This Brome bird feeder is ingenious and so well made!  It's also very easy to use.  What's more, it looks great.It may seem pricey but believe me it will pay for itself in what you save on all the birdseed that the squirrels can't access.
B000HHHEF0 The squirrels occasionally check it out. But get bored and jump off.The birds love it. The lighter Jays use it along with the lighter weight birds.Definitely worth the price and trouble to order it. It's been in service a little more than a year so far.
B000HHHEF0 I own two of these classics, and have for some time.  Let me tell you right off that unlike a lot of squirrel baffles that can cost as much as this entire feeder, this squirrel buster really does work.  The internal spring action system immediately closes the wire cage surrounding the feeder when a squirrel, (or anything else similarly weighted), attaches itself to it.  As anyone that is at war with squirrels in the bird feeding business knows, squirrels don't give up easily when trying to get at your bird seed.  They have spent hour after hour crawling all over this thing trying to get at the seed somehow, but so far I have never seen any varmint beat it.  The top of this unit is rounded, and the wire hanger is long, thus preventing the foothold at the top that is the Achilles heal of so many baffles and so called squirrel proof feeders.  The squirrels will definitely test every inch of this model, and as such will keep your birds away until the entire community of them is satisfied that there is no way in.  But eventually they give up and drop to the ground, and your feeder is now open for business for the clientele you intend it for.Now for the minuses.  Despite the effectiveness of this unit, it still has a cheap feel to it inside.  The actual tube that holds the seed is made of a very thin and light flexible plastic that will eventually come to be the first place this thing comes to fail you.  It will dry up and crack when used in places of extreme weather variations, (like in New England where I am).  My Busters are both over 3 years old and still working well, but the plastic tube is definitely drying out and wearing.  I would put the life expectancy of this feeder at sometime under 5 years.  Either reasonable or disappointing depending on your track record with other feeders. Also, I am not at all a fan of the wire hanger is uses.  If this hanger breaks or fails in any way, it would be difficult to replace, and also its design would make improvising something hard to manage as well.  To really distract squirrels from finding a foothold to hang from the top the wire hangs very long, so expect to adjust your present hanger or pole if you like it at the present level.  (It's important to keep it high enough off the ground to keep it away from jumping squirrels, and of course cats).In conclusion, the price of this model is most reasonable when compared to the very effective, but ghastly overpriced Yankee Flipper. It's easy to operate, easy to take apart and clean, and durable enough to last for about 5 years or so.  And lastly, it does what it says it does, disappoint your community of squirrels big time.  Despite its couple of flaws, I recommend it.  Enjoy...
B000HHHEF0 This works great.  I bought this version after buying the smallest one and being satisfied with its performance.  The birds really love it and have no problem eating off it.  It has done a good job of keeping the squirrels from eating all the seed.  I have seen the squirrels attempt to jump on it and although the cage slides down they do manage to knock out some of the seed.  But it still limits the loss to the squirrels.  I plan on purchasing more of these for the rest of my yard.
B000HHHEF0 I have all the different brome feeders they are all quality products , and they are sure nuff squrille proof !
B000HHHEF0 So the good news is that this feeder was empty 24 hours after I filled it. Not really Brome's \"fault\", since it's just a bird feeder and the birds...fed from it. At least it doesn't scare birds away, I guess? So it's got that going for it.The bad news is that the main selling point of this feeder - its ability to deter squirrels - is very hard to test. First of all, squirrels are surprisingly fast and even a full-coverage squirrel costume - made from real squirrel fur no less! - does not fool them in the least. I couldn't get within 20 feet of the little buggers without them racing up a tree.So I tried an air-rifle with knock-out darts, and all I can say is WOW, that knock-out drug is not messing around. Also, the trigger on my air-rifle is a bit touchy. It only took about 3 hours after I woke up for the headache to subside.I finally caught a squirrel using the tried-and-true tilted box-with-a-stick-tied-to-a-rope trap. The old ways always seem to work best. That led to my third lesson - squirrels have very sharp claws and teeth! They are so cute and chittery who would have guessed that they are actually razor-adorned murder machines on a par with the bunny rabbit from Monty Python and The Holy Grail? If you are approached by a squirrel and you are not wearing full body armor - RUN AWAY!Undaunted, and a few boxes of bandages later, I used welder's gloves to place the probably-rabid deathcritter onto the Squirrel Buster Classic. Sure enough, the outer bars dropped down, preventing the squirrel from getting to any of the bird food. Unfortunately, I don't think the squirrel noticed this amazing feat of modern engineering, as it immediately leaped from the feeder and onto my face eager to take vengeance for the ignominy of being manhandled. The doctor says that my eyes should heal in two to three weeks, but that I must continue the shots for another six.So I urge you - DO NOT attempt to test this feeder yourself, or you will end up dictating Amazon reviews to your significant other while your swollen eyelids heal from a right shredding. OK, dear now read that back.
B000HHHEF0 We needed to replace a regular bird feeder that we have had for years because of the influx of native squirrels that we have experienced over the past couple of years.  They could empty a feeder in two days that would take the birds two weeks to empty.  So, we looked around for a &#34;squirrel proof&#34; feeder not really expecting to find much.  Our native squirrels are rather small and do not have as much weight as the Eastern Squirrels do.We saw this feeder and decided to give it a try.  Here is what we liked about it:1.  Very well made!  Quite impressed by the design and attention to detail.  The top locks in place, which is a nice feature, yet it is easy to open to fill.2.  Nice color.  The unit just blends in with our trees so that when the birds are not on it, you barely notice it.3.  The mechanism is very simple (spring loaded outer cage that closes off the ports when there is too much weight on it, and it actually works to keep out our little squirrels!  The birds do not trip the unit closed, but the squirrels do.Here is what we did not particularly like:1.  The part that is not shown in the pictures is the long cable that comes out of the top to secure it to your pole or whatever with.  This cable is so long that it puts the feeder very close to our bushes.  The unit hangs down about 15 to 18 inches lower than feeders with a hook on it.Other than the long cable issue, we really like the feeder and would recommend it to anyone as long as they are aware of the extra length in the hanger.
B000HHHEF0 Squirrels are beyond crafty and will figure out ways to get to any feeder if they can. Brome is the least likely for them to figure out how to thief from.
B000HHHEF0 Update April, 2011:I originally gave this product 4 stars because of inadequate ventilation which caused the seeds to become moldy. To help resolve this problem I had to drill a bunch of large holes at the bottom.  Brome must have read my review (yeah, right) because the new ones I've received have a large number of great big holes at the bottom -- it's great.  Now I don't have to drill any holes.For whatever reason, birds preferentially go to the Brome feeders (maybe the green color?) first. I have other feeders that are similar but the birds cluster around the Brome feeders. I have to fill the Brome feeders much more frequently.Rating changed from 4 to 5. Original review follows.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------We own two of these (bought a year ago) and I'm going to buy two more.I love watching the totally frustrated squirrels going out of their minds as the cage closes shut when they jump onto the feeder.The reason why I gave the feeder only 4 stars is that the ventilation holes at the bottom aren't big enough and the seeds at the bottom become saturated and moldy. Whenever it rains, some water is going to wet the bottom.  Cleaning out the clumped moldy seeds is a major pain.The ventilation holes are easily clogged with small seeds.  This completely negates the chimney effect since there is no way for air to enter the bottom when the sun strikes the feeders.My solution was to drill out many much larger additional ventilation holes (about 1/4\").  I believe that they make the ventilation holes small because people would be afraid that some smaller seeds would fall through the holes and be wasted.The larger holes do not cause smaller seeds to fall through.I used to have to disassemble and clean out the moldy seeds from the bottom of the unit nearly each time I filled the feeder.Another recommendation is to have a plate at the bottom to collect the fallen seeds so the seeds don't fall to the ground.  I probably lose about half the seeds when the birds are pecking away.I have a cheap bird feeder from Home Depot that does have a plate and the birds like to sit on the plate and feed on the fallen seeds.  The plate didn't have any drain holes so I had to drill a number of holes.  The tube also didn't have any ventilation holes at all so I had to fix that too.Another popular and fairly expensive squirrel proof bird feeder has absolutely no drainage holes whatsoever.  I drilled out several dozen large holes which resolved the moldy seed problem.The moral of this story is that if it rains where you live and water falls on the bird feeder, you *will* have to deal with moldy seeds unless you're willing to take the time to drill LARGE holes to increase ventilation and water drainage.The birds are nuts about this bird feeder and has proved to be highly reliable and totally squirrel proof providing that you keep it about a 12\" away from other objects that the squirrel can hold onto with their rear feet.--------- Update Sept 24, 09 --------I bought two squirrel proof bird feeds that were of a different brand.  For whatever reason, the birds will only use the other brand when the seeds run out of the Brome 1015.  I have two Brome 1015 and two of the other brand in two locations.  The Bromes are emptied first.  I'd love to know why.
B000HHHEF0 This is my second purchase of this feeder; it most definitely prevents the squirrels from eating the bird seed; birds seem to like the feeder, even the big woodpeckers; Wild Birds Unlimited sells these feeders for a much higher price
B000HHHEF0 This is the most fantastic bird feeder I have ever had.  It really is squirrel proof.  I notice some reviews felt it was a little pricey, but hey folks, it's mostly made of metal.  The lid is metal, the cage is metal and the perches are metal.  Metal costs more than plastic.I hung it in a tree and had some good laughs the first day or so, but the squirrels have pretty much given up on it.  One squirrel crawled all around the cage, pushing up on the lid, but it twists on and just about drove that squirrel crazy.  I'm planning to buy the one that has the cardinal ring on it, as well.
B000HHLHK8 The feeder has a very attractive red finish, is very easy to fill, and its perch is large enough for multiple birds at the same time. The perch is also wide enough to hold seed that comes out of the feeder without much falling to the ground, except in the case of squirels. But then what feeder is completely immune to squirrels?  When not using, you can fold it flat to store easily. When you want to use it, just hold it upright by its handle and it immediately unfolds.  It is designed to hold larger seeds like sunflower seeds, so it is not for use with smaller seeds, as they will fall out.We have many different types of birds and bird feeders in our yard.  Although we have yet to see a cardinal, we have seen birds on this feeder, depsite other feeders being available.  We are hoping the word gets out to cardinals so they can join our menagerie of birds.  I think this feeder is a good buy.
B000HHLHK8 I buy wild bird seed in giant bags from Costco. The seed includes sunflower seeds but also a significant amount of millet. I decided to try it in the feeder before attempting to buy stand-alone sunflower seeds. It works well! My only advice is to load it with seed outside, because there are holes on the bottom of the feeder that allow the smaller millet to spill out. Once it's full, the seed stays in place. The feeder works well for all kinds of birds. It's on the larger side and looks great in the landscape. The No/No construction is solid and the easily removed lid prevents rain from entering the feeder. Overall this is a great feeder for all kinds of birds.
B000HHLHK8 I put this feeder up two days ago, and so far it only seems to have attracted smaller birds (sparrows and finches, mostly) - but it generally takes time for birds to find a new feeder around here.  It is proximate to another feeder I have that I mounted to the railing of our back deck.  I fill that one with safflower (to discourage squirrels and attract cardinals - they like feeding on a \"flat\"), and it's still doing a great business.  It routinely draws cardinals, doves, titmice, finches, chickadees, wrens (multiple types), and even a woodpecker or two.  The red feeder is filled with sunflower hearts, and they seem to be distributing just fine.  I'm hopeful that the allure of the sunflower will be enough to increase traffic to the new feeder, as I'd like to minimize hulls on the deck that fall from the safflower.  (I have to use safflower in the mounted feeder, as the squirrels don't like it).I really like the construction and appearance of this feeder.  It seems very sturdy; it's easy to fill; and the construction does a decent job of pushing the seeds to the outside rim to make feeding easier.  I'm hoping the addition of a different type of seed and feeder will draw a wider variety of birds to the garden.
B000HHLHK8 This is an attractive bird feeder, I really like the color. It matches my house nicely. I also like that it's all metal construction.It was very easy to set up and fill with seeds. The smaller seeds fill out into the bottom section fine but I noticed that larger seeds don't quite as well. I may be using the wrong seed mix for this though.The squirrels have not bothered it which is great. I can tell it will hold up well. However, it hasn't garnered much interest from any birds so far. I may have to move it to a different location.The only other thing is that it is quite heavy. You will need to have some place to hang it that can hold the weight.Update 6/3/13 - This really does attract cardinals! We see them eating at this feeder all the time now. It's impressive because we live in a semi-urban area. I bumped my rating up to five stars.
B000HHLHK8 TheNo/No Red Cardinal Bird Feeder  C00322is a well-constructed bird feeder.  It is all metal so that it can withstand the vicissitudes of weather and time.  The use of a mesh screen to hold the bird seed also it to collapse into a convenient flat disk for storage.  The access to loading the seed is by 2 clasps on the top, making it easy to load, yet secure to close.  There is plenty of room for birds to perch around the circumference of the bottom disk. And, despite its name, this feeder will attract all sorts of birds.This feeder is an attractive addition to our garden, allowing us to watch the comings and goings of the birds while we eat.
B000HHLHK8 The No/No Red Cardinal Bird Feeder is an excellent addition to our backyard patio.  I have only favorable things to say about it and no negatives. I'm sure if the birds that have come to feed from it -- and there have been many different kinds -- could talk, they would tell you the same positives I am now about to say.The feeder, with its red finish, is very attractive, is very easy to fill and its perch is large enough for multiple occupants to feed at the same time.  Further, the perch is also wide enough to hold seed that comes out of the feeder without much falling to the ground. And, of particular importance to me is that the feeder is well constructed -- being all in one piece. When not using, it folds virtually flat to store easily; and when you want to use it, just hold it upright by its large handle and it immediately unfolds to allow you to quickly and easily add up to 2 1/2 lbs of seed.Almost immediately after hanging the feeder on a shepherd's crook just off the patio we have been getting a variety of guests to enjoy the Wild Bird Seed mix we have provided, including cardinals, finches and bluejays.  So far, no squirrels have tried to invade the feeder (the openings are probably too small for them and they can't open the top) but they do enjoy the seeds the birds drop to the ground.All in all, it's an excellent feeder and one that I would highly recommend.
B000HHLHK8 No/No/ Red Cardinal Bird Feeder comes flat as a pancake, when you take hold of the handle the wire mesh expands to show the body of the feeder.  Bright red in color, and holds a mass of seeds, I found that the larger sunflower seeds (black) are better to place in the feeder than the smaller song bird seeds.The feeder hold a large amount of seeds.Even though the name of the feeder indicates Cardinals, all of the birds seem to love this feeder, It looks attractive and is extremely functional. It is well built and the top clicks into a locking position.Very pleased with this feeder. Recommend 5 stars.
B000HHLHK8 I was in search for an all red bird feeder.  This is beautiful and perfect for where I am going to hang it. I love that it is collapsible with no assembly. Perfect. I may buy another one!!
B000HHLHK8 I am really enjoying this bird feeder. It arrived in a flat package (it telescopes down when not suspended from the bail handle). It was easy to open by just clicking the sides of the plastic packaging open.The feeder itself is heavy duty, from the tray on the bottom to the wire mesh sides to the circular covering on the top that has two little levers that hold it in place. The red painting job is a quality job and should protect against the elements for years to come.I use Oil Sunflower Seeds and the seeds work fine in the feeder. We don't have cardinals in our area but the mourning doves and finches have enjoyed it so far.I hung it on a big branch in our mulberry tree using a large screw-in utility hook and it's working fine.The feeder is a little difficult to fill with one person because it telescopes down when empty and the filler hole is at the top. Trying to manhandle a 20 pound bag of seeds and manipulate the feeder can be trying. I just have my hubby help me.This is a quality product and I'm glad to have it.
B000HHLHK8 First of all.  There are no artificial birds as pictured - probably would scare away the wrens, and other smaller birds that stay here in Utah in the winter.  We are feeding about 60-100 of the birds - have several different types of feeders.  This one is the most difficult for them to actually get the seeds out.  Nice color - the flexible screen surrounds pops up to create the barrel.  Seems to be well-made.
B000HHLHK8 This feeder is useful for allowing a number of birds to feed at the same time. I used black oil sunflower seeds in this feeder.
B000HHLHK8 I have had this feeder about 6 weeks now and made several observations:1. It is well made, sturdy, tough, all metal zinc plated steel and will likely be very durable.2. Large capacity - holds 2.5 pounds black oil sunflower seeds requiring fewer refills.3. Easy to refill through large door on the top, without taking the feeder down.4. Cover or roof on top offers some protection from the rain (if it's not blowing).5. So far, not getting as much attention or use from the birds as my other feeders  but of course the birds are accustomed to the older feeders.6. Some reviewers complain the openings in the mesh are too small and birds can't get the seed out.  I am undecided about this but I doubt it is the case because if you shake the feeder some seed will fall out and through the mesh onto the platform.  I can say for sure there is less waste due to spillage of sunflower seeds compared to my other feeders- a big plus.7. I only wish it was available in a selection of colors.  I would prefer a more natural less gaudy color such as dark green, brown or black.  For me, the show is not the feeder, the show is the birds.
B000HHLHK8 Simple and well made.......Very happy ....pops open and zero time to put together...metal and sturdy...squirrels can and will sit on the edge...but so far unlike other bird feeders this one is still hanging and not on the ground!~
B000HHLHK8 I live in a very warm climate and very few of my bird feeders can make it through a summer here.  I am use to having to replace most of my feeders every summer because the heat destroys everything and breaks any plastic.Well, this feeder has now broken my yards world record!  It has lasted 4 years and is going strong.  The birds absolutely love this thing for some reason, and that makes me happy.I do see cardinals on this sometimes, but they seem to prefer the nuts and seed I put out for them on a wall, out in the open.  I think they feel safer that way, as they are a jumpy little bird.  :)I highly recommend this feeder for it's  excellent quality and because birds really love eating out of it.
B000HHLHK8 This all metal feeder is easy to fill. I used black sunflower seeds and the birds really enjoy this feeder. Most of the birds are cardinals but other varieties visit as well. Cardinals can put on a very interesting show. For example, yesterday a female was feeding when a male came along and chased her away. She flew down to the ground and apparently signaled to a friend perched in the magnolia tree because both of them flew together back to the feeder and the male chickened out against the two to one ratio and he flew away. Soon he was back with another male and the females decided they better leave. Bird watching can be entertaining and this feeder attracts many birds willing to put on a show in return for their feed. The bird feeder pole is squirrel proof so the squirrels get to eat only the small amount of sunflower seed that falls to the ground. This has been an enjoyable addition to my bird feeder collection and the price was reasonable.
B000HHLHK8 I love the \"The Red Cardinal Bird Feeder\" designed and manufactured by No/No to feed cardinals. It is a collapsible feeder that when not in use is less than an inch thick which makes it very easy to store - vertically or horizontally.When ready to use, simply pull up on the handle and the feeder draws itself up to full size. Move aside two small clips and a piece of round metal slides away so you can fill it with black oil sunflower seeds. There is a circular ridge extending around the feeder that collects smaller seed if you get a sunflower mixed blend so other birds can perch and feed off the smaller seed also. Its red color is attractive to hang in the back yard. The all-metal construction should provide a long life for this feeder. I found it very easy to use and before long birds were also taking advantage of \"The Red Cardinal Bird Feeder\" by No/No.The feeder holds 2  pounds of sunflower seeds, feeds 10-15 clinging and perching birds at one time, and the mesh design protects birds from disease.  The makers claim that the feeder is squirrel damage resistant which probably is true because of its all-metal construction but it is fairly easy for squirrels to maneuver around to feed off from.  On the second day of use, a young slim squirrel and an older stouter squirrel both shimmied up the feeder pole I used, climbed onto the roof of the feeder and worked themselves down to the skinny circular perch and began getting a fill of seed.Overall, this is my second favorite bird feeder and represents great value as my favorite feeder probably cost me four times as much.
B000HHLHK8 We love the cardinals to visit, and they seem to really enjoy this feeder.  We're expecting to see more as the summer progresses and with their \"memories\" hope to see them for a long time.  It works very well, and is easy to take care of, easy to load the seed.
B000HHLHK8 I like the idea of this feeder. It's design is especially handy for people with limited storage; if you want to store away the feeder for a while, it collapses easily to a very small size.I found it easy enough to fill. The trouble was it didn't work with our current 20# bags of shelled sunflower seed. They spilled out of the little holes.  I had planned to buy some other seeds but don't have room to store them until we run out of the current supply, and Amazon wants the review now.  I will update when I try it with other seeds.
B000HHLHK8 I was looking for a sturdy feeder, and this one fit the bill.  Much better than those flimsy plastic ones.  I also like the bright red color.  It looks colorful hanging in the tree.  Several birds can feed at the same time.  Shipping was quick, and it was very carefully packaged.  Overall, I was very pleased with this purchase.
B000HHLHK8 Years ago I read that the color red was supposed to attract Cardinals but I have not found that to be true in practice. We have pairs of Cardinals in our yard every year but I think they like our variety of bushes and trees and that we have 'stuff' in general to land on. Lots of statues and benches and things.Anyway, this feeder doesn't attract Cardinals any more than any of our other feeders but all of the Eastern PA birds in our yard seems to like this feeder just fine. I have a mix of black oil sunflower seeds with some millet in it. All kinds of birds have been eating from it.There are hooks on the lid that you move when you have to fill it. It's easy to do.
B000HHLHK8 .This is a pretty big feeder, it will hold about half the bag of PUBLIX CARDINAL MIX at one filling.The only glitch is that there is no lock-down mechanism to keep the inevitable Sciurus carolinensis intrusions from attempting entry by lifting the lid...BUT, the good news is, they can try all they want and, so far as I can see, no dice... [It's just annoying to see the lid slightly askew...]The cardinals, chickadees and tom tits absolutely love the thing and the circular design seems to keep squabbles to a minimum.Highly recommend if you really like the redbirds!PS--- There's a place called TRACTOR SUPPLY that has the best price on \"cardinal mix\" which is sunflower and safflower seed mixed about 75/25%. If you have been disappointed in your feeder action, try that stuff from either PUBLIX or TRACTOR SUPPLY, or buy the really big bags and mix your own.
B000HHLHK8 This feeder has everything.Pros:1. The size is juuuuust right. It holds a good quantity of seed (I'm going to estimate about 2 -3 pounds) but not so much that it can go bad before the birds finish it or so much as to make the feeder unduly heavy.2. It has small holes in the bottom so rain can't pool in the bottom.3. The construction is extremely strong, easy to clean and easy to fill.4. The perch also catches seed in the perch/trough so there isn't so much seed spillage.5. The perch is wide enough to make access easier for the medium-sized birds such as Cardinals and Bluejays.6. The top of the feeder is wider than the similar feeders this company has offered and it's an improvement. I have this one that is similar (No/No Bronze Original Bird Feeder  BZ00324) and I find that I like the size of the top of this Cardinal Bird Feeder much better.And, of course, it won't just feed Cardinals. I was watching it tonight for about 15 minutes. I had filled with a sunflower seed, nut and dried fruit mix and it was doing a fine job with Chickadees, Cardinals, a pair of Wrens, two Titmice and some Carolina Finches.There are no \"Cons\" to this feeder.I really love this feeder and so do my birds. I highly recommend it.
B000HHLHK8 We love Cardinals in our back yard, so when I saw this great looking Cardnal Feeder I had to try order it.  It works great, Squirrels can't get in it-the Cardinal adapted to it right away and everyone is happy.  Easy to fill and hang--I would recommend this for all of you Cardinal lovers out there!
B000HHLHK8 I'm not the only one who likes this bird feeder.......the birds do too!  It is very well made..no plastic or wood, all steel.  It will last forever.  I love wildlife, especially wild birds and I have many bird feeders.  This one is a great addition to my backyard.  Attractive, durable & the birds love it!  Can't ask for more than that.
B000HHLHK8 I just started using Oiled black sunflower seeds for my birds this Spring. I have a lot of Cardinals, finches and chickadees. This is so sturdy and and it is attractive. It can support a lot of birds at one time. It is easy to fill and thus the way it is made will be easy to keep clean. It is designed for the sunflower seeds the other seed would spill out too fast thru the mesh. It comes packed flat in an easy open plastic case at first I thought oh no clam shell but no, it is snap open thank you!!I look forward to years of pleasure watching and feeding the birds with this quality feeder. I am also into photography and getting a lot of good pictures of the birds this year having a nice feeder adds to the beauty of the pictures.It will hold about 2.5 pounds of seed. In my yard that is 1-2 days. :)
B000HHLHK8 This cheerful bright red feeder is for attracting cardinals to your yard.  It is so pretty.  We have added it to our garden area and can watch it from our deck.  We bought a huge bag of oiled black sunflower seeds and expect to go through it rather quickly.  Cardinals are one of my favorite birds and I am so excited to have this special feeder for them.  I love it so much I ordered another one for my sister for her birthday.  Recommend!
B000HHLHK8 I ordered this bird feeder mainly to attract cardinals. I recently moved back to Ohio after 20 years and the cardinal is the state bird, and one of my favorites. But when my wife and I hadn't seen a cardinal all summer, I decided to see if this bird feeder would do the trick.It ships flat -- and opens up when you hang it on something. It was a little tricky getting the sunflower seed (bird feed) into it as a result, but not too bad. Once it was full, I hung it on a tree branch visible from our dining room and it took about 5 days before we saw the first cardinal. So beautiful!We see all sorts of colorful birds (as well as the occasional pigeon), too. I added a couple of photos of a cardinal at our bird feeder under the product photo area. Two thumbs way up for this bird feeder.
B000HHLHK8 Bird feeders cans be a very personal item. Motivated squirrels and location challenges all effect how I can feel about a feeder. I personally like this one because it ships and stores flat. The mesh is a chain link that collapses if it is set down. It can be filled while still hanging in tree. I love the bright red color and it is definitely well made. The feeder is not squirrel proof. I hang my feeders from ropes on pulleys way far out on a branch with a baffle on top. It seems to do the trick for me. The color seemed to help the birds find it more quickly than the dark green one I have. I would definitely consider purchasing one of No/No 's other bird feeders based on the quality of this one.
B000HHLHK8 I have watched squirrels try to get into this and not once have they managed...it has very little swing to it so they can't dump a bunch off either..the birds are quite happy feeding and it is a relief to keep the squirrels from hogging the whole lot. It is a very substantial all metal feeder and the red seems to  attract like hummingbird feeders do. It is very easyto fill and hang in no time. I am very happy with this..if you are besieged by squirrels when trying to feed our feathered friends, this is the feeder for yo
B000HHLHK8 Never before have I had cardinals at my feeder, but shortly after putting this feeder up I had a pair come by and visit. Now they have a nest within 100 yards of the feeder! I love it because it worked to get them over here. They really prefer to hop around the flat surface along the bottom instead of perching on a rod or clinging to the mesh. I love it!The feeder is very strong made of metal, no wood or plastic, here! It stands up great to the wind and it doesn't lose seeds like my previous feeder did since it has such a wide bottom.Would highly recommend this feeder to anyone looking to draw these adorable songbirds to their window.
B000HHLHK8 This is basically the perfect feeder for me. Coming from thePerky-Pet 363 Birds and Berries Lantern Feeder, this is a real breath of fresh air. Whereas the lantern feeder would--without fail--be empty within 48 hours maximum because the birds love to just throw all the seed out and onto the ground, this one will be full for days and days. I filled it halfway on Saturday; it's now Thursday evening and there's still a good layer of seed in it. And this is when I've got several birds at once, and not just boring house finches, but also larger black-headed grosbeaks that like to swarm my backyard. The difference is that this has no big opening where seed can be taken or knocked out en masse. Instead seed can only be pulled out individually, which seriously controls the rate of consumption. The feeder is a cinch to fill and has nice little hooks on the lid to keep it in place; you can't open the lid unless you turn the hooks. It also flattens out when empty for a nice compact item. I was annoyed that it comes with a sticker across the top which left three big spots of sticker glue along the lid, but oh well.Overall a fantastic feeder that I'm glad I was able to get for free through Vine. My one concern would be that since the seed removal is much more controlled, this may not be the most Emberizid friendly feeder, or other birds that forage on the ground. My experience from watching the lantern feeder over the last seven months that I had it up is that California towhees, spotted towhees, and white-crowned sparrows loved to forage through the dropped seed under the feeder. White-crowns are already gone for the season, but I'm also just not seeing the towhees as reliably as I used to now since switching to this. This may be a coincidence, so I won't knock a star or anything. I may need to hang both up feeders up again or just make sure to try to occasionally scatter sunflower seeds underneath.
B000HHLHK8 UPDATE MAY 2014:  This winter the squirrels not only found out how to get around the baffle, but they regularly emptied this feeder.  They shimmied up the pole and leaped to the feeder, grabbing the metal mesh so tightly with their claws that they warped the mesh a little.  I still like it as a feeder and the birds are returning to Minnesota so perhaps they will get a chance to eat the seed and not have it all go to the squirrels.  And I will renew my efforts to keep the squirrels away from this feeder.I hadn't had a bird feeder in my yard for many years so I assumed it would take some time for the birds to discover this. I didn't expect that squirrels would find it the very next morning and be eating from it before the birds even knew it was there!I have my bird feeder hanging from a tall metal shepherd's hook.  The very first morning after I filled it with black oil sunflower seeds and hung it, I saw a squirrel shimmy up the hook and down onto the feeder.  At first it ate the seed out while hanging upside down over the top edge, but then it perched on the bottom edge and daintily picked out sunflower seeds with its teeth or claws.The good news is that the design doesn't allow the squirrels to dump a whole pile of seed on the ground or eat the seed really quickly. And they can't chew open the metal to destroy the bird feeder.I added a domed baffle to keep the squirrels away and so far that is working, but when winter comes and food is scarce, I suspect the squirrels will figure out how to get to the seed again.  In the mean time, Mr. & Mrs. Cardinal enjoy the seeds as well as some finches.This is easy to fill and the metal mesh design keeps the seed from falling out and messing up the ground beneath the feeder.  I like this bird feeder!
B000HHLHK8 In my experience, it always takes a few days before for the birds start eating from the newly hung feeder, and this feeder was no exception.  It is the second feeder in my front  yard, the first being a Brome.  And so far, the birds still prefer the Brome to the No/No feeder.  The No/No feeder has very little rain protection for the seeds, as the mesh part, where the seeds are, is completely open.Also, if purchasing this feeder, it does not include a hook to hang it in a tree, just the handle on top of the feeder.**Edit Oct 3, 2013 -- changing rating from 4 stars to 1.  The seeds stay piled up in the middle of the feeder and do not slide down to the tray or sides without help.  So I finally removed it from the tree as I find it to much work to keep shaking the seeds down.  And I really dislike the fact of taunting birds with seeds just out of reach.
B000HHLHK8 We live in a rural area in New England and feed birds through the fall, winter and spring.  This feeder is is easy to fill (holds a lot of seeds), easy to clean, easy to store because it folds flat, and looks very pretty (great red color) hanging up in the yard.  Many birds can perch or cling to the wire to feed.  We're really happy with this.
B000HHLHK8 Positives:Not \"squirrel proof\" but squirrel annoying.  The local Abert (tree dwelling squirrels) can and do get on this feeder but it is slow going for them to eat out of it.  They have to try to extract the seeds (with some success at the bottom, they are able to get more seed from this No No than from the Tiered one we also have).  But they cannot simply shovel them into their maws as the seed is slow to drop down onto the platform.  The Tiered version does appear to be more squirrel proof than this version.  The ground squirrels do not seem to have the brains or dexterity to plunder these feeders.Holds reasonable amount of seed.No wood or plastic means it holds up better against UV and pesky squirrels.It looks nice, very simple and elegant.  The paint job on this is very nice, seems almost baked on.It is actually listed as dishwasher safe.  Not brave enough to do that, but I found that it easily cleans by swishing in a bucket.Has an overhanging roof to protect from rain.  The Tiered model does not.  I like that about this version.Negatives:Filling it is tough, you really need a place to hang it while you fill it otherwise it collapses.  The top does not actually come all the way off, you sort of push it up and to the side.  I made myself a \"scoop\" out of an old vinegar  bottle which helps, but I still spill more seed filling this than feeders that are solid rather than mesh.Fewer types of birds in my local (New Mexico) seem to like this compared to the tiered model.  I think because there is less space to cling to it.  The jays do prefer it.
B000HHLHK8 I adore this feeder.  First off, the bright red color is striking and really adds to the look of my garden.  I wouldn't mind if it came in a variety of colors.  The quality construction stands out as soon as you open the box.  It is solidly made out of metal. It is easy to fill and hang.  The birds seem attracted to this feeder more than the others I have.  It makes for a nice feeder for black oil sunflower seeds.  I haven't noticed the birds having trouble getting the seeds out as others have stated.  I don't believe, however, that it will hold the 15-20 birds at once, as advertised. So far, I highly recommend this feeder.
B000HHLUDW I received this from Amazon Vine.I was super excited to try this out, as we're in the process of ripping up our yard and redesigning it and I was looking forward to having a cool little planter/flower box on the deck to add color to outside. I already had some plastic and ceramic inserts I could put into it.Well, the instructions are in French - it's pretty self-explanatory how to operate it though. But it's really light, bends easily, and fell off with a ceramic insert in it. I think it was because I had to expand to fit over the rails - and the more you expand, the less support it seems to have. My insert didn't break (figure the metal casing protected it), but I'd recommend using it for relatively thin rails and plastic flower boxes.
B000HHLUDW This expandable holder can hold 24 to 36 inch flower boxes, or multiple flower pots.  It has an L-shaped arm for 2 inch or 6 inch railings, depending on the orientation.  If you are familiar with the CobraCo family of pot holders, it is easy to assemble.  Otherwise the instructions in French were not very helpful as my high school French never covered this particular circumstance.  The support needs to rest against the railing.Also, it is much, much easier to hang this rack, and then put your flower box in.
B000HHLUDW This is a nicely made, sturdy flower boxholder.  However, it really doesn't fit all rail sizes, like for instance, the majority of my deck railing, which is 7.5 inches wide on top.  In reality, the top is adjustable using 2-6 included screws, to handle a railing 5-6 inches wide.Look very carefully at the second picture, and you'll see a bar jutting out on the backside, bottom.  That restricts your railing to 4 inches tall.  Also, that same bar will prevent you from mounting it on iron rails with close spindles.Other than that, it's a nice boxholder.  Everything came included, and there were no scratch nor rust marks.
B000HHLUDW CobraCo 24-Inch to 36-Inch Adjustable and Expandable Flower Box Holderby CobraCoEasy to install. Very practical and if you use your imagination more than one way to use it. Good value for a good product. Thank you Cobra!
B000HHLUDW The CobraCo metal frame flower box fairly sturdy & is made to hold a standard size plastic container (not included).It is adjustable & expandable within limits. Make sure your vertical rails are far enough apart to fit the back (stability bar) portion of the box frame (mine are not), otherwise you will have to make modifications or return the flower box.Had the flower box fit my railing, it would have added a nice touch to my front deck. It seems to be sturdy enough to hold a plastic container, potting soil & plants.  Just measure before ordering & there should be no surprise.
B000HHLUDW This is a serviceable wire plant holder made specifically for deck railings and such.  It is not built to hold extremely heavy pots or containers so when installed this should be kept in mind.I am instructionally challenged and with the directions that came with this thing I had a heck of a time putting the thing together.  In all fairness I will say that others may not have the same problems I had.I use a small light weight plastic tray in it with light and small plants of various species...all intended to attract butterflies and hummingbirds.  It need not be mounted near a water source as we use a watering can to water and feed the plants involved.I suppose that the bottom line here is that this one will work for some but not be the ideal rack for others.  I give it a strong three stars because once I got the thing together it does work for the purpose we have it for.Don BlankenshipThe Ozarks
B000HHLUDW Since we live in an area where the ground is hard packed clay that requires a lot of effort to make arable for flowers and vegetables, we are always looking for other solutions that will allow us to expand our deck-top garden. This seemed like it would fit the bill, and for the most part, it did. It arrived held together with zip ties, with a plastic laminated instruction card entirely in French also zip tied to it. (Although this thing is made in Pennsylvania USA, I guess they only hoped to sell it north of the border or overseas, unless PA has a hotbed French gardening community I don't know about.) We cut the ties, purchased a box for it (NOTE: box sold separately), and hung it on the porch railing. The design is simple enough that the instructions were not needed, and you don't even really need any tools, as the plastic nuts can be secured by hand-tightening. (That said, getting a screwdriver and pliers to tighten it is not a bad idea.) The brackets slide from about two inches to four and a half inches, and with a little cleverness and possibly some better fasteners, I think it could be made even wider than that. (I did not test my theory, so no guarantees.) Once we got the plants in, everything looked great. The minimal design doesn't make any decorative statements. It just holds a box of flowers. It isn't the sturdiest flower box holder on the planet, either, but it didn't fall, bend, break or lose stability while we were getting it set up or for weeks after planting. This is just a basic looking, average flower box holder, but because it functioned well with no issues, I bumped the rating up to three and a half stars.
B000HHLUDW It doesn't take a degree to put this thing together, but the instructional card that was attached was in French; 1 star removed.My decking is 1\" thick and 5\" wide.  Setting this to the largest setting, using one nut/bolt on each bracket, it was a perfect fit.  The support bumper rests perfectly against the slats on the deck, and the planter inserted is level.  I may have to insert a screw on each bracket to anchor it more securely to the decking, but I'm not too happy about having to do that on a older 1\" piece of wood.  The planter I put in was one of the smaller ones I own, that dries out quickly, and not too heavy when soaked, so I figured it would be a good first test.  I will experiment with heavier boxes down the line.  Honestly, I don't see this lasting too long, since it is less than sturdy.  But for now, it does it's job well.  Will upload pics.
B000HHLUDW I like to consider myself an educated woman, heck I build furniture in my spare time... but it took me the longest time to figure this thing out... and I ended up leaving it laying in the corner of my deck when all was said and done. First off do note that you're only getting the black wire/metal portion... you'll need to supply your own actual flower box, plan on something lightweight (like those plastic ones) and personally I'd keep it to the 24&#34;. This just isn't all that sturdy and even if you're lucky enough to have a railing it actually fits I feel like it wouldn't take much weight. We have an older wooden deck and the top portion is really thick, the only way I could make this would be to sort of bend it, maybe attatch extra bolts, I really just couldn't work my mind a way to attach it that looked & felt like it would work. In comparison I bought two of these last year CobraCo English Horse Trough http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002NKYWO0/ref=wms_ohs_product?ie=UTF8&psc=1 and they were super easy to install and even came with the liners so I didn't even need a box, I just had to add dirt and plant my flowers. They were left up all year and still look brand new. I'd recommend spending a bit more and going with something better. I think this will end up in the trash.
B000HHLUDW Parlez vous francais? (The instructions are - only - in French!)Once you figure it out, you are left with a wire extendable contraption that is quite flexible.  It struggled to not flex when I put in a ceramic window box - forget about filling it with heavy damp soil and plants!Note:  The flowerbox itself is not included - just the black wires shown.It is probably best for those cheap plastic window boxes you get at HD.  Not for higher end ceramic or heavy wood window boxes.
B000HHLUDW I was surprised when this arrived and it was only the metal support brackets.  From the original title, I was expecting a flower box with the adjustable brackets.  The directions included were useless to me, and the pictures weren't much help either.The completed project was a rather flimsy bracket that tips forward from a 4.5&#34; railing.I cannot imagine this bracket holding much weight.  Perhaps fake flowers, but not potting soil!
B000HHLUDW First of all, the instructions came in French from a company in Pennsylvania.  Go figure.This was very confusing to put together notwithstanding the french instructions and the pictures that didn't help at all.  Once I figured it out, it would NOT stay put on the deck railing.  Had to use fish wire to hold it flat.  Part of this brand new box showed signs of wear and was discolored.  It did the job with some 'fixing' on my part.This is a lot of money for something this poorly made and lacking any kind of quality control.
B000HHLUDW Parley-vous? All of the product info. is in French, which may be why it is temporarily unavailable. Perhaps they'll get a translator and reprint the instructions in English.Consequently, you pretty much need to guess how to use it, based on the illustrations. I was interested because it's supposed to hang over the deck railing, which it seems to do, but there are also screws and holes, which suggests that it may not be sturdy enough on its own. Since I picked it out specifically because I do NOT want to drill holes, this is not reassuring.The metal supports seem surprisingly flimsy. It's better than dollar-store quality but not by a whole lot. Yes, you can hang it, add a box (wouldn't it be great if the box could be included), fill it with soil, etc. but I just don't feel confident that it will hold up without bending out of position over time. I would suggest the lightest possible box and the lightest possible soils---perhaps even a bottom layer of foam packing peanuts just to fill up the space without adding weight. You would definitely want to make sure the box you choose has excellent drainage, because rain would also add more weight to this.Bonne chance.
B000HHLUDW Despite being &#34;adjustable&#34;, there is no good way for me to mount this on the rail surrounding my deck.  (In case it matters: I have a 2-by-6 horizontal top rail, with a horizontal 2-by-4 rail centered below and parallel to it, and 5.5 inches separating the top of one from the top of the other.)The thin metal rack has adjustable brackets to fit a variety of top rails, but then there is no good way to stabilize it...it just hangs loosely on that top rail.  The rack includes an extra metal section that seems to be for stability, but my railing is such that it won't actually connect to it.  Probably with some extra pieces of wood, and maybe some tools to bend some of the metal on the holder, I could make it more stable, but I would rather not go to these lengths for a flower box holder.Without some stability, this can barely hold anything except the lightest of flower boxes.I think CobraCo has some quality products (I have a copper fire pit from them that I really like), but I don't care for this at all.
B000HHLUDW This flower box holder expands to fit any number of oblong flower pots and will hold them fairly securely on a railing.  I did have some difficulty with the holder suddenly and unexpectedly expanding while I was assembling it, bu,t once attached to the railing, it held my pot securely.  It's a nice way to add color to a railing on stairs or edgng a gazebo.
B000HHLUDW This is a good product. Easy to install. Just make sure the container you have will fit inside. Looks good installed too.
B000HHLUDW My house has windows with outside window ledges.  The ledges come out 2 inches from the wall.  I could think of all kinds of ways to mount the box.  When I saw these at the big box store, I knew I had the ticket.  What I did was leave off the \"L\" shaped brackets.  The arms on the hanger where the brackets go slid over the ledge far enough that I could put 2 screws through each arm (arms already drilled.)  I screwed it down, and that was that.  The bottom \"U\" shaped piece touches against my wall to give stability.  If your ledge slopes more then a few degrees, or is farther away from the wall then mine, this might not work.  You could probably cobble something together with shims if you wanted to.Besides that, it looks pretty good, and is strong enough for my flowers.  This worked out great for me.  I added a photo above.
B000HHLUDW A great flower box that can be adjusted to meet your spacing needs.  Note that while the picture shows a plantar/flower box, the product is just the flower box holder.  Although the picture also shows a traditional, rectangular flower box, this product also works great with round pots (terra cotta, ceramic, or plastic).  It's versastile and durable.
B000HHLUDW I have three of the CobraCo Adjustable Flower Box Holders at this time. I bought the first one or two years ago and it has held up very well. I just leave them outside and take inside and store the plastic containers. As I have mentioned on another review, if the railing is very wide, (deck board width) some additional support such as screwing the metal holder to the railing might be needed. If you use the largest plastic container it is very heavy. With this latest  flower box holder, I will be putting the plantings in six round plastic pots instead of the plastic container made for the flower box holder. Overall they make very nice displays and work well.
B000HHLUDW There's really not a lot to this product.It's just an adjustable wire frame that can hold various lenghts of planter boxes.Whether you grow herbs for your kitchen or flowers to brighten up your window or patio is up to you.I would note that there is no planter box included.  Just the frame that holds a box.You might assume there is a box if you just went by the picture.Gathering out on the patio and doing a little BBQ is something that this product could improve with a few pretty flowers to provide a more festive atmosphere.Smell the flowers mixing in with the scent of the ribs or burgers...Time for a tequila sunrise or beer...  Review time is over....
B000HHO1RO This thing is great, it kept my plants alive while it was cold. I didn't use it on seedlings, I made a small greenhouse indoors and used this mat to keep the roots of the plant warm. The plant was about 8-9 inches tall at the time, and it did it's job. It kept the inside heated to 80, while the outside of the small greenhouse dropped to low as 69 degrees.So you're not just limited to the small lid they give you if you use your imagination! :)
B000HHO1RO I won't be able to rate the perfomance of this germination set yet but I can comment on its construction:  when I took it out of its box it reminded me of pulling a store-bought pie from the shelf.  That's what the flimsy plastic  this thing is made of reminds me.  I could probably save the next few pie containers from the local Safeway grocery store and get like results for a much cheaper price.  This is plastic that will not survive brutal handling and should be treated only tenderly.  I could get as effective a germination tray by buying a $3 aluminum try with clear plastic cover.However, the 9\"x19.5\" heating mat this thing comes with, of which a like model is sold separately by another company for much moreGrowers Supply Company GSHM 9-by-19-1/2-Inch Small Seedling Heat Matis perhaps worth the price of this germination set.  The tray measures 10\"x 20\" and the heating pad hugs the tray nicely.  It distributes heat evenly.  Seedlings sprout not so much from sunlight, but from warm soil and this heating mat helps maintain a soil temperature 10-20 degrees warmer than the air.  This is ideal for early spring growing.Otherwise this germination set seems to be working well.  Everything arrived as described in this set in new condition.  I had placed my tomato seeds one in each pocket, placed the clear flimsy hood on top, placed all that on the warmed mat and within minutes the frame began to sweat.I will report back when my tomato seedlings have sprouted.There is no \"Made in\" anywhere on the mat, the box or the plastic.  All I can find is the company headquarters of Petaluma, CA.Update 2/21/11 - The first sprouts have cut through the soil.Update 3/30/11 - I'm learning that getting the seedlings transplanted (removed from this device) is not easy.  I will use peet planters next time.  Only around six survived the last five weeks.  This is not a high percentage but I also know I was using seeds dated for 2008.
B000HHO1RO Perfect for starting my in home herb garden.  I'm growing everying I need fresh, and giving plants away as gifts.
B000HHO1RO I noticed that there were some complete novices who bought this for experimental reasons and had little idea of how to successfully make this work:DO NOT use regular soil. ESPECIALLY NOT dirt from your yard! I could not believe someone actually used dirt from outside. If you don't want to spend the money for jiffy pellets at least get a good seed starting soil or add a B-vitamin fertilizer to a traditional potting/garden soil to assist in healthy root development. If you use a traditional soil with fertilizers be sure to add a diluted plant fertilizer when sprouts appear. Seedlings burn easy, you do not want to over-fertilize them.Someone mentioned how quickly mold grew. Not to sound mean, but DUH! You're trapping moisture and applying heat. What do you expect? This is why commercial hydrofarmers use fungicides. Root rot is one of the most common killers of hydro grown plants. You can purchase a good fungicide for around $8. If you get a concentrated version be sure to follow the dilution directions exactly. More is NOT better.You should also be aware of your water quality if you are using tap. Some municipal supplies are highly chlorinated and/or not pH balanced. If you want fantastic results get a pH kit ($20, or you could even get test strips to make it easier/cheaper) and check your water before beginning any sort of hydrofarm.They do not mention all of these things because if they make it sound complicated they don't sell as much product. In fact it is all VERY simple. There are just a few extra steps one should take if they are serious about obtaining great results. My personal opinion, steer clear of Miracle-Gro, use Schultz NPK 10-15-10 ($ the one with the eyedropper, very cheap) or Fox Farm ($$$ if you want to spend money).
B000HHO1RO Ive wanted this for awhile and glad I have it.  The heat mat is great but you really need to get the digital thermostat too.  It works with the heat mat and keeps the temperature of your cuttings or seedlings close to constant. I say close to constant only because if the heat in the room exceeds the temp you set the heat mat at then you will have warmer seedlings.  The heat mat and thermostat work together to keep them from getting too cold.  I use a fan to cool them down. My seedlings are doing well now since I got this and increased their light.  This is important too.
B000HHO1RO I've always kept a few potted herbs in the house but this year instead of spending all my money at the Farmer's Market, I thought I'd try to grow some onions, tomatoes, peppers and the like so I could just pick them out of my own *potted garden.* I bought some huge pots to transplant the seedlings in for outside once they grow up.This heat mat and tray set are working wonders for someone like me who doesn't have a green thumb. I planted the seeds as directed and I've kept them under the plastic dome everyday and night for 8 days and I finally have green sprouty babies reaching for the sky. I'm totally psyched ! When we actually have a warm day, I take the tray outside and set it in the sun for several hours so they get a breath of fresh air and some ultraviolet light on their tender bodies. I look forward to transplanting, if and  when we finally warm up for good, and I highly recommend this product. Love it !
B000HHO1RO I find that convenience often outweighs the quality or even usability of the product.  The thought that you could just place your plants out of sight out of mind while some miraculous grow kit does the work for you is an ideal based on nonsense.  If it was that easy, there wouldn't be instructions.I have found that warmth assists in germination over 40 years of gardening.  But I don't buy a dedicated germination kit.  The standard seeding kits available for $3.00 are fine.  I have one I like for the windowsill, not because I love the brand or soil it contains, but because it FITS ON THE WINDOWSILL!!  That makes it convenient for me and agreeable to the wife.Heating pads are kind of silly.  The cost is ridiculous and, if you really want to heat your seedlings, then put an electric blanket or throw under them.  You can get a single blanket electric or throw for about $20 and you can sit like 6 of these starter trays on them and warm them all with a totally reusable unit.I did notice that when on the electric blanket, the seedlings start a bit earlier.  And if in a colder area (basement/attic) the blanket was essential to get them to kick into gear.  But the blanket is huge and you can cover a much wider starting area.  If you want a smaller area, fold the blanket.  Low temp is usually enough to keep my kit around 70, but your environment may be different.  Don't put either outside in 20 degree weather or you will get chilling results.At any rate, these warming seed starting kits are a waste of money.  If you have absolutely no sun exposure or are starting so many you can't keep them in the house on a window sill or near any window, then get a heating blanket and a grow light.  Much cheaper in the long run.
B000HHO1RO I bought this kit along with another unheated kit and I tried them side by side under the same grow lights and conditions. The plants in the heated kits started showing growth after only 3 days, whereas the unheated kit took about 7 days for anything to appear. If you're going to get this mat, you may as well buy the digital thermostat. The thermostat easily hooks into the mat and is very simple to program the heat and other settings.
B000HHO1RO Seeds sprouted in half the time indicated on the seed packet. The unit as a whole is good quality except the dome air vent. It came off right away but the unit functions just fine without it. The heat mat works great and I found I didn't need to purchase the optional thermostat. If you grow seeds I recommend this unit.
B000HHO1RO The heat pad worked great.  Plants emerged far sooner than expected so I lost the first plants that grew in 4 days (had the plastic cover over top of plant bed as instructed and this caused overheating resulting in mushrooms and lost plants).  That was 'my' fault.  Next planting worked great and the newly planted seeds have emerged and have 2 leaves on each.  I am hopefully optimistic that this will be great for my projects.  I am waiting to move them outdoors into my pop-up greenhouse.  I recommend it on price, quality and performance as a great buy.
B000HHO1RO this thing works too well.... good seeds that are supposed to germinate in 8-12 days come up in 2-3 days, I say &#34;good&#34; seeds because I'm getting quite a few packages of garden seeds locally that aren't germinating at all... if you want &#34;good&#34; seeds to come up fast I'd recommend this thing and put it on a piece of 1&#34; thick Styrofoam insulation to retain the heat above it.... works great.......
B000HHO1RO My first attempt with this setup was not good. My grow light was to high causing the seedlings to get tall, thin and fall over. I also had to much condensation that caused problems. On the second try, I lowered the light to 4 inches high and removed the top cover shortly after the first signs of sprouting. That worked good for me. The heat mat is excellent. Using the heat mat shortens the waiting time for germination to start.
B000HHO1RO First, when the package says it comes with an insert, that means the 72-cell tray you put potting mix in, not the potting mix itself.Second, you're supposed to take the clear plastic lid off once your plants germinate. That's why there's no room for the seedlings to grow under it. (Though the packaging does feature a tray full of robust seedlings under the lid, which may confuse people who can't be troubled to read the instructions.)With that out of the way, this product does exactly what it promises. The heat mat warms the tray a bit, but not too much. The tray's cells are the right size for tiny seedlings, the kind that need a heat pad, and soft enough that you can pop the seedlings out without much effort.The whole contraption fits perfectly under theHydrofarm JSV2 2-Foot Jump Start T5 Grow Light System. If you buy aHydrofarm TM01715D 7-Day Digital Program Timer, you can plug both the light and the heat mat into it to have the 14-hour light-warm/dark-cool cycle most seedlings enjoy. These three products together make a great indoor seed starting set-up.For a backyard farmer or gardener who needs to start a bunch of seeds at once, this will do the job.
B000HHO1RO Good product for your seed starts although the air exchange knob on top of the dome is not fixed onto the plastic, it is snapped on, and almost always comes off when adjusting.It's quite annoying so I just removed it entirely.
B000HHO8RW Last summer was the first that I used my Tanglefoot traps.  I set one in the front yard and one in the back.  Grossly, I think I captured a bazillion of them in just a month or so.  Each time I emptied the traps, I was amazed by the volume of the catch.  The trap is probably 6&#34; in diameter and 10&#34; or so tall, and they would be completely full of this little buggers (literally, little buggers).  This got me thinking that there isn't a lot of thinking that goes on inside the heads of Japanese beetles.  If you were out for a walk and saw a hole with about 10,000 people trapped in it, would you jump into it?  Of course not, but if you were a Japanese beetle, you'd think THE MORE THE MERRIER, and you would jump right in.  This trap provides yet another opportunity for parents to teach kids the hazards of doing what everybody else does, just because you were following the crowd.  One moment, you are flying around enjoying the world, the next minute you are stuck in a trap and you are too dumb to get out of it, even though it doesn't have a door or cover on it.So, in summary, this product works great, and it provides a great metaphor for life.
B000HHO8RW [...]This is my review of the Tangle Foot trapping system and includes the installation of the bate, also shows proper placement.I explain why this is my preferred bait and capture system.Please follow the You Tube link above.
B000HHO8RW I am changing my review of this product.  I wasn't using this product correctly.  Another purchaser kindly told me how to use it.  I had the lure in the trap upside down and it wasn't working well.  The rain we had washed most of the bait right out of it.  So last year the trap and lure didn't work very well for me in the beginning.  I do believe that one has to change the lure part way through the season, so it might be a good idea to purchase two of them.  I have purchased an additional one for this year.  I haven't put it out yet, because I haven't seen any beetles on my plants yet.  I will be using it soon though.
B000HHO8RW We've used the plastic bag traps in past years, with mixed results.  This year I decided to try this brand, and we're very happy with it.  The trap itself is built better than the other brand, and is reusable, but it's the lure that makes the trap so effective.The pleasant flower fragrance wafts over the yard, attracting the female beetles into the trap.  There's also a pheromone lure that attracts the males, but I can't detect that scent.  Both sexes fly into the trap, dying in the reservoir.  The lure is supposed to last all summer, but I'd be happy to replace them if it means that our roses and vegetable garden are free of damaging Japanese beetles!I'm going to stock up on these lures, for next year.  The packages are sealed and will store well.
B000HHO8RW this thing works great. It seemed to draw every beetle in my zip code. not sure it this was good or bad.
B000HHQ2JY BOUGHT THIS TO HOLD ALOT OF SUNFLOWER SEEDS AND I LOWERED TO THE GROUND BY A CHAIN SO THE DOVES COULD EAT NEXT TO THE GROUND
B000HHQ2JY I have many faded plastic birdfeeders in the past. This was a novel design that I was happy to try out. From the start I was impressed. The package is very easy to open, no knives or scissors needed. I like the metallic brown/purplish finish. Not exactly bronze but a nice color that contrasts well with foliage.And this holds A LOT. I use black oil sunflower seeds anyway. The mesh size is such that birds can easily pull them out. Which means they can cling anywhere and get at seeds. It also means that the seeds fall out easily when filling it. And you cannot take the top all the way off so filling is awkward.Also if you see from the pictures and video each of the three levels has a top and bottom, except the top most. Unless you fill it up all the way the seeds get stuck at certain points. For instance I don't have it all the way filled up and the seeds in the second level are on the top level further from the perch.I like to set my birdfeeder and forget it. So unless you like refilling it more often the multiple layers won't get used. But even half full like I have it now, birds get at the seeds in many different ways, perch, clinging, and it looks nice even half full.But aside from the filling issue this is very nice. Just BE SURE to fill it outside and preferably in an area where birds will eat seeds on the ground. Another review had a good idea. Use some sort of funnel or pitcher when filling it. And really the trade-off of messy filling and some falling out is also its good advantage, birds can get at seeds anywhere.
B000HHQ2JY This feeder is heavy and made very well.  The top latches clip snugly to hold the lid and mesh is heavy duty.  The bronze color is nice as well.My only complaint is the weight.  We don't have any mature trees so I had to devise a way of hanging it.  Can't really call it a complaint, but if you have small trees don't expect to hang it in them.
B000HHQ2JY The birds around my house aren't the smartest little things, apparently. We currently have 2 bird feeders outside(including this one). We've moved those things around several times and still haven't had any luck getting the birds to eat out of it. I've even scattered seeds around the feeders to lure the birds in. No luck. The last place we've tried is hanging them on our front porch. I watch birds ALL the time(even multiple birds at once) eating the dog's and cat's food just a short distance away from the feeder(it's hanging! no worries the cat will get them). They won't eat from or even the seed around the feeders. I'm truly afraid the little birds are going to choke on that dog food! Our animals have to eat, though. :S I plan on trying more types of seed and find one they don't turn their little beaks to.I'm not blaming all that on the feeders, though! This particular one is a beautiful edition to our outside decor, and if I could get those little birds to eat from actual feeders, I would gladly add more of these throughout our yard!When it first arrived, it came in such a small package, I was wondering how much work I was going to have to do to put the thing together. Just grab that handle, though, and it pulls right into place. No assembly required! That makes this feeder GREAT if it needs to go in storage. It doesn't take up much room at all. They are also super easy to fill!Overall, this is a great feeder. It's big, so there's lots of room for birds to congregate together.
B000HHQ2JY This bird feeder has a lot of things going for it. It's very attractive - the bronze finish looks very nice (and not chintzy) and it seems to be very well made. I like how it's all metal - no plastic for squirrels to gnaw on and destroy. It holds a lot of bird seed (it is designed to hold up to 5 lbs of seed.) I like how it folds up when it's not in use - it won't take up much storage space when not in use.On the negative side, the feeder is difficult and very messy to fill. While the top easily unlatches, you can't entirely remove it, which can make it a bit awkward to fill. Because it is collapsible, you need to hold it upright to fill it. Bottom layers are filled from the top down and I found it impossible to fill the entire feeder (I couldn't fill the very top tier to the brim). Also, because of the mesh, bird seed spills out everywhere as you're filling it - it's a mess. And while I don't mind filling this feeder outside in the spring, I can't imagine trying to fill this feeder outside in the winter. On top of that, you can't place this feeder up on a hook (or any place higher than eye level). The feeder is too flexible and the hanger keeps dropping.While I really like the look of this feeder, for me, the negatives outweigh the positives.
B000HHQ2JY This is a delight to own.  Very well constructed and like many of the other no no products, arrives flat as a pancake.  By lifting the handle the mesh expands toopen to five levels where the seeds are placed.  This is the largest bird feeders I have ever seen...and it holds around 6 pounds of seeds!  I fill this up about once and week, and the birds seem to love this one as well as the several other no no feeders available from Amazon.The little birds hang all over this feeder, as their are plenty of levels for all.There is a lot less seeds flying out as the little birds have to place capture each seed through the wires.  I am fascinated to watch the number of birds that can surround this feeder.The item color is listed as a green, but mine came in a metallic bronze color, very pleasing,The one best advantage is that seeds go a longer time and little is wasted ...fun to watch the birds take their time and not fight with each other.I am thinking about yet another one....  You will not be disappointed with this no no feeder.Highly recommend this unit.
B000HHQ2JY This is an interesting feeder.  We already have a Nyjer seed feeder, a squirrel-proof mixed seed tube feeder, and a suet feeder.  It took a few days for the birds to eat from this new feeder.  Gradually, it is attracting finches, nuthatches, cardinals, titmice, chickadees, and woodpeckers.  Today, I saw a red-bellied woodpecker clinging to it and eating the seed, just like it was on a tree.Filling the feeder is not easy because the top lifts, but does not come off, and the tiers collapse when not held open.  It's a messy job.  Since the feeder holds so much seed, five pounds, it doesn't have to be refilled very often.Normally, I avoid unshelled seeds because the mess below the feeder is a nuisance.  However, I used a pole mounted in the grass for the No/No Bronze Feeder, so the shells are hidden in the lawn.The only way this feeder is squirrel-proof is when used with a good baffle mounted on a pole.  Otherwise, I think that it would just be a playground equipment with treats for our squirrels. The filled feeder is long and heavy, so does requires a sturdy hanging system.Personally, I don't find the bronze tiered design very attractive, but it is functional.  The mesh allows the seed to dry, if damp, and the air circulation prevents seed from mildew and mold.A time-saving benefit is that the metal mesh means that the feeder doesn't require cleaning.If you have the proper setup for the No/No Feeder, it is a good purchase. The birds will like it, and this feeder is hygienic and should be quite durable.
B000HHQ2JY This is a large bird feeder but it ships flat (in a small box) because the feeder is collapsible. The bottom tray of the feeder is about 8\" in diameter. The height of the feeder is about 21\" (without the handle, about 26\" with the handle). In the collapsed state it is only about 3 \" high, so it is really compact for easy storage.It is made of all metal construction and is sturdy and well built. You fill the feeder from the top. You just move the two latches and the top lifts up and you can just move it over to the side and out of the way. Filling the feeder is a bit tricky because the mesh is not stiff. It's a whole lot easier if you have someone hold it up for you.This bird feeder takes 5 pounds of bird seed! That's a lot of seed! They recommend Black Oil Sunflower seeds.  I really like that many birds can feed from this feeder at once. I have several bird feeders but this one is my new favorite. I really like how it looks.
B000HHQ2JY This is a nice looking bird feeder.  It is collapsable in design which is an interesting feature.  I guess it could be useful if you needed to store the bird feeder, but it also makes filling the feeder a bit of a challenge and it means you have to have a place (shepherds hook or tree) to hang it.Please note that a standard millet mix will not work in this feeder.  The holes are too big and the seed falls out when filling.  You need to have a sunflower mix (bigger seeds).This is an attractive and durable bird feeder though.
B000HHQ2JY I must have very stupid birds, because in theory this is the perfect feeder.  I should be feeding both perching birds and clinging birds. So I really thought that this would be perfect for the flocks of Goldfinches I get as well as the titmice and others.  It also seemed like it would hold different types of food besides the Black Oil sunflower seed but it doesn't.Oh and do not attempt to fill this feeder in your home.  Big mistake -HUGE.  (don't ask, just trust me!)Well let me tell you, I used quality seed, placed this outside near another feeder  and - nothing.  after a few days I moved it to where my finch feeder was, and again - nothing.Oh the birds perch on it, they may even cling to it, but they don't seem to be EATING  anything out of it, unless you count the birds that are eating  what falls into the tray on the bottom.Oh squirrels love this feeder for sure.  They love the fact that they can sprawl on it full length, eat out of the tray and because of the feeders size I can't see the darn squirrel.If you have smarter birds than I do, you will most likely LOVE this feeder.  It is a little awkward to fill but once you get the hang of it it gets easier. It holds a lot of food, caters to different types of birds and looks very pretty.
B000HHQ2JY I know this isn't squirrel proof but I do have an effective pole and baffle system that prevents squirrels from getting to my feeders so I don't care.  It's definitely heavy when full but the birds are crazy about it.  I get woodpeckers, goldfinches, purple finches, titmice, just about anything that doesn't need a regular perch to eat.  The holes are large enough to use sunflower seeds in the hulls--I wouldn't use anything smaller because it will just pour out.I know some people complain that the lid isn't large enough to shelter the seed from the rain, but honestly, the seed doesn't stay in there long enough to be a problem because it's so well liked by the birds.It opens at the top with 2 clasps and is easy to fill if you use a scoop and hole the top with the other hand.  I would highly recommend this feeder.
B000HHQ2JY I did not read the fine print and from the photo I thought this feeder was more red but it's more brownish bronze colored. It looks nice and it's easy to fill. You do not need to fill it with 5 lbs of seed. You can partial fill and it still works fine.It seems to get as much action as the rest of our feeders. The birds seem happy with it.
B000HHQ2JY A good feeder for oil sunflower. Sturdy all metal, like another I own that has lasted over a decade. First bird arrived within a few hours. Often it takes a while for birds to get comfortable with a new feeder. This 5-tier was placed within a grove of 4 other feeders.No assembly required. Easy lift top filling. It holds enough to last for days and days.My other all metal sunflower seed feeder has no perch rings like this NO/NO brand feeder. Birds like to perch to eat. Even hummingbirds prefer that if available, but of course this feeder will attract no hummingbirds.Oil sunflower seed attracts finch, cardinal, woodpecker, jay, chickadee, redwing, bluebird, titmouse, nuthatch, and several, including doves, like to eat what's been dropped to the ground. Many of my birds first perch in the trees or bushes nearby and sing each time they feed, announcing to others of their kind of the windfall buffet. It's a grand life, being retired and watching birds. The patio swing is where I read all the books I review. God's flying critters offer bliss.My habitat includes a small pond, a water source is another bird draw. Running water is best. They say birds can hear water splash two miles away. I hand feeders near trees and bushes (birds like that) and use auto grease on the lower part of the shepherd's hooks to keep raiding (and feeder destroying) squirrels and raccoons from being able to climb.My bird feeding is serious. I feed year round and even write a column about wildlife in a small hometown newspaper. This feeder ranks high on quality and durability. With a 5 pound capacity, it means fewer trips for refilling, and more just sitting on the patio watching. This feeder is worthy of the investment in bird-watching delight.
B000HHQ2JY THis bird feeder is reasonably priced and has a lot of pros: holds 5lb of sunflower seed which means less trips outside in the winter, it won't rot like wood, or crack like plastic.  Attracts all sorts of birds though the blue jays don't fit well (which is good IMHO).  I've had downy and red-breasted woodpeckers, nuthatches, chickadees, cardinals, goldfinches, etc.  The one CON I've discerned:  it is not squirrel proof in the least.  SO, I am going to get a large dome baffle.  Still cheaper to get this and a baffle than to buy one of those expensive feeders that are billed as \"squirrel proof.\"  PS  I got the baffle and within a few weeks the squirells figured it out.  Though this is well built and holds a lot of seed, and attracts MANY birds, it is hard to keep the darn squirells off.  And I have got this on a wire between two trees which are 30 apart, it is also 20 ft from ground.  The squirells climb out the wire, around the large dome plastic baffle, and get to the feeder.  Ugg.
B000HHQ2JY I really like this feeder. It's pretty and it holds a lot of seed. The one thing I don't like is that it's collapsible and it requires two people to fill it. One to hold it up so it's expanded and the other pouring in the seed. The seed splatters out the holes and can make a mess so make sure you're outside in the grass when you pour the seed or you'll be sweeping up your front porch like me.Once it's full it's easy to twist the top back on and restore it to it's hanging place. I haven't seen as many birds on it as I have those pesky squirrels! Squirrel have plenty of placed to hang on and eat the seed up. This is NOT squirrel proof!
B000HHQ2JY I love this feeder. The slim and deep design make it easy to hang this feeder just about anywhere. I also like that the feeder is easy to fill. One fill in this five tier feeder will last for several days. The properties of this feeder will make owning this particular feeder easier due to the low maintenance. We have numerous birds that visit us on a daily basis, and they all seem to enjoy this feeder.
B000HHQ2JY Our No/No Bronze Five Tier Bird Feeder is a hit with the birds and looks like it will be around a long time. The accordion style, all medal construction make a really innovative design compared to other feeders we have owned. Our feeder hangs from a long, curved pole that extends out from our balcony and, so far, the squirrels seem only able to look at it from below and scavenge the occasional dropped seed. My only issues with the feeder were with filling it with seeds. Both issues are easy to overcome: One, it is infinitely easier to fill it once it is hanging. Two, using a scoop (like those for dry dog food) majorly reduces spillage. We bought a 20-Pound bag of Wagner's Four Season Oil Sunflower Seed and are already on a second fill in less than a week. I'm ordering a second feeder. That's how happy I am with the No/No Bronze Five Tier Bird Feeder.
B000HHQ2JY As advertised, this feeder is all metal and it feels like it.  It is the heaviest bird feeder I have ever seen that is made to be suspended from the top.  The feeder empty is over 3 pounds and can hold 5 pounds of sunflower seeds.  Doesn't sound like a lot but if you plan on hanging this from a tree limb it has to be a fairly strong one.  The color is a definite brown.  Nothing flashy.  Filling is a snap except that it is annoying having a seeds pop out of the mesh when moving back to hang.  I have had a tubelike feeder in my yard for years and the birds are just starting to realize there is a another \"restaurant\" on the block.  The birds are already all over this thing.  In addition, our local squirrels are taking generous dips in to seeds.  The mesh wire is a perfect means for them to hang on and eat right out of the bottom plate (check out the pic I posted).  I have moved the feeder to another tree on a smaller branch that is further away from the trunk.  I am a little concerned that if the squirrels launch themselves at this thing, as I have seen them do before, the impact and extra weight may knock this thing to the ground.  If this does happen I may end up retiring this feeder to the garage.  Otherwise, looks cools and the birds/animals like it.
B000HHQ2JY I had a saller one of these that lasted a good long time considering the wildlife we have here. I was glad to see a larger size. This will hold a lot of seed and the weight of it will keep the raccoons from trying to haul it off at night. Simple, basic construction with nothing to go wrong.
B000HHQ2JY This is a very attractive bird feeder that is high quality with superior workmanship. I was surprised at how heavy it felt when it arrived.This one deals with the squirrel problem by making it difficult to bite through by using what looks and feels like medieval chainmail. That's not to say that squirrels won't ultimately conquer it, but this design does prevent some of the squirrel nonsense.You pretty much can only use sunflower seeds in this one because of the design. We use a mix to attract a variety of birds to the back yard, but anything other than sunflower seeds easily come out of the small holes. This can result in major seed loss, especially when filling it.All in all, though, I'd have to say this is the one of the most attractive feeders I've owned.
B000HHQ2JY This feeder is really well made and sturdy.  It's made out of metal and collapses nicely if you want to store it(which I never do). The design is great for many birds to enjoy eating at the same time.  It holds a ton of seed--5 lbs (so you don't have to fill it frequently)!  This is great at long as it is not wet out or you can put it under some sort of cover.  I also found it irritating to fill.  It was hard to do by myself.The packaging says that you can use the black Oil Seeds or a seed mix.  I tried using the seed mix that has a ton of the black oil seeds in it thinking they would help it not to pour out of the holes easily.  It was ridiculous.  I would not recommend using anything other that the sunflower/black oil seeds.  This is a descent feeder but it is just not the best for my situation.  I will stick to the feeders that keep the see dry yet hold large amounts.
B000HHQ2JY No/No means no wood, no plastic, and therefore no squirrel DAMAGE -- not no squirrels!  I filled it with the black oil sunflower seeds, which fit through the metal mesh (somewhat), about 20% of what I poured in the top came out through the mesh, either into the tray at the bottom, or on to the ground.  Most feeders have a bit of a spillage factor, but this one is excessive.So I hung it up from the shepherds' hook in the yard.  For a day or two, I saw nothing, then a few small birds.  Third morning, the feeder is half-empty, and I can see why - squirrels are whacking it and seeds are spewing from all sides.  It's a squirrel pinata!!!  The squirrels keep returning; the birds, not so much.Probably a great, durable feeder, if you either like feeding the squirrels, or if they aren't a problem in your area.
B000HHQ2JY Let me say I am the LEAST mechanical person on the planet....and this was a piece of cake.Seems to have the squirrels unhappily confounded but keeps my grandson age 2 in hysterics as theyplot attack after attack...resulting in some seeds spilled but not the destruction experienced with other feeders.They perch on branches and take a flying leap, swing, and fly off...slim pickens!It will be easy to store in winter if it gets too icy...folds up like an accordion, so have found noflaws and it has been real entertainment! Get one and put it where you can watch...good forgreat laughs! It also attracts all sorts of beautiful birds!
B000HHQ2JY I decided on this feeder to replace myPerky-Pet 737 Garden Sip & Seed Feederthat's had a good run, 2 years now. But the plastic has been so beat by the wind that they're falling apart. In comes the No/No Bronze Five Tier!First, the dislikes. I'm short, I've put this up high. The feeder is collapsible. For the previous feeders I relied upon the structure of the bird feeder to help me out when attaching it to the hook it is hanging from. With this one it's impossible. I filled it to the brim with black oil sunflower seeds to give it some structure to get it up there, but when it's empty all bets are off. Looks like I'll need to invest in a stick with a hook on the end to get it off and on.As far as the likes go, birds were drawn to it *instantly,* including a cute little cardinal couple nesting a few hundred feet away. I have yet to see a bird hanging off the side, but they do use the perches and base to sit. There are no plastic or wood parts in this feeder (hence No/No) so it can easily get banged around and not be destroyed. I'm sure it's going to last years and years! Next... It's HUGE! I really didn't expect the size that I got. 20 inches long makes room for many, many birds. So far I've witnessed 5 on there at the same time, but I'm sure more can fit.I do love this feeder and would recommend it to someone who has a reachable place to hang it, or a stick with a hook on the end to move it around.
B000HHQ2JY This bird feeder is very attractive in the yard, but it is a little of a pain and messy to fill up. Once it's hung though, it looks great.  So far the birds haven't found it, but I will keep watching and update the review once they do. *Update* After a couple days, they definitely found it and they are loving it. I just looked out and there are 4 sitting on it.*Second Update*After about two weeks of having it up, the birds are going crazy for it.  I looked out today and there had to be at least 40 little ones trying to get to it.*Third Update*I ended up taking this feeder down. It was a pain to fill and a pain to keep clean.  It's fine in dry weather, but with the rain we get it just turned into a soggy mess.
B000HHQ2JY UPDATED... UPDATEDI am totally re-doing this review.  And it's all because this is now my FAVORITE feeder.  Why?  The birds just love it.Goldfinches! and other small birds --those red house sparrows, other finches, nuthatches, chickadees, and titmice-- all love it.Those lovely goldfinches tend to stay at the bottom tray, but everybody else will also hang from the sides.---------------OLDER NOTES:I really like the looks of this bird feeder, but for my location it isn't quite as useful as my old greenHeritage Farms Feeder.What I like about it is that it holds a lot of seed.  It's also very pretty.  The bronze looks nice, and best of all, the small birds like it(**see notes at the bottom) --although it initially took them some time to get used to it; and they tend to like eating from the tray, more than hanging from the wire frame.PROS--very attractive, and without the seed, is compact--holds a lot of seed--birds like itCONS--if you're like me and have nightly raccoon raids and like to bring in your feeder, you're going to have a mess on your hands.  Without a structure it collapses a bit and seed gets pressed out and ... it falls on the floorWhen the feeder comes it is very compact.  I think this is a nice feature for anyone who moves frequently.To load the feeder I undid the top and let the feeder naturally expand. Then I used a pitcher to scoop up sunflower seed and pour it in the opening.  The seed cascades down through the central holes on each level as the one above fills.  If your pitcher doesn't have a spout that helps with pouring, you might want to use a stiff paper to form a funnel.  But it's probably going to be messy however you do it, so I suggest you do what I did and take the whole operation outside.This is a pretty feeder that will hold a big bag of seed.  Birds like it, and while the squirrels were very curious about it at first, they don't seem to be attacking it now.Highly Recommend.  (Like most bird feeders, you'll have to try it with your local squirrel population)
B000HHQ2JY There are things I like about this feeder, and things I do not.  First the things I like.  It's big. It holds a lot of seed and it looks really well made and sturdy.  There are plenty of places for the birds to sit and eat.  It's also collapsible for storing.  However, the fact that it's collapsible also makes it really hard to fill and there ends up being a lot of spillage and waste.  Also, the squirrels love it because there are a lot of places for them to hold onto as well.
B000HHQ2JY This sunflower feeder is awesome! It's huge...holds five pounds of seeds and saves me trips to refill it. I love the look of it. It's interesting and not as boring as lots of the other feeders out there. It appears to be built ruggedly. It is not squirrel proof. Sorry. The only feeders that I've found to be squirrel proof are the ones with the weighted baffle-type \"door\" that shuts due to the weight of a squirrel. They are extremely expensive and I was fortunate enough to have one left here when we bought our home 13 years ago! That's the ONLY feeder in my yard that the squirrels don't bother with. That said, I have several feeders in my yard, so the squirrels aren't all over one feeder in particular. When they do get to this one, they don't seem to make as much of a mess as with others. They sort of cling on, pick their seeds, eat them and that's that. No tipping of the feeder, spilling out the sunflower seeds.There really isn't much of a protective covering on the top or sides (I guess that's why some of the boring looking feeders are more functional:), so the elements (rain, snow) will get to the seed. Not a terrible issue if the birds are feeding, which mine are!All in all, I really like this feeder!
B000HHQ2JY This is one of the nicest looking feeders I've ever had. The way it is built, allows the birds to get their food without the housing being accessible for wasps/hornets to decide they've found new nesting material for their babies. This feeder holds an entire 10lb bag of bird seed - so if you're going to hang this on a shepherd's crook, make sure it is securely anchored in the ground. It makes my crook bow ever-so-slightly from the weight - but as the birds consume the food, that's a short-term issue. The feeder definitely presents a challenge to the few squirrels we get. They can get so little at a time, it makes far more sense to them to go to our squirrel feeders where they can eat like kings without consuming ridiculous amounts of bird food. I really like this feeder, and the birds do, too! We get a lot of Tufted Titmice that love to hang upside down while feeding. They are quite comical on this feeder.
B000HHQ2JY This feeder will hold up to five (5) pounds of sunflower seeds, or a combination of sunflower seeds and wild bird seeds.  Its metal mesh walls allow sun and air in to help prevent mold.  With all five tiers deployed, this feeder is about three feet high.  The squirrels will take over the feeder unless it is hung high and on a thin wire or cable strong enough to hold 15 lbs--Yet something the squirrels cannot climb onto.  Since this feeder is metal, I doubt its effectiveness in extremely cold weather, and when snow blows into it.  I intend to use it from April to November.  Its ability to hold so much seed is perfect when I am away from home for a week, because I do not have to worry about the birds going hungry and leaving.
B000HHQ2JY First, the description is slightly misleading. It reads:\"Holds over 5 pounds of Black Oil Sunflower Seeds,  the most popular seed for wild birds\"That last part gave me the impression that it would allow for other types of seed. If by other type of seed you mean plural in the sense of 2, then this is spot on. Very clearly on the package it tells you to only use Black Oil Sunflower seed, or a mix of Black Oil with Safflower. That's about the variety you can fit in here without issue. I think smaller than Black Oil would work fine, but with the holes in the bottom (I guess it is there for drainage if it rains?), smaller seed will definitely fall right through, meaning birds will be eating off of the ground.In terms of setup, get a nice heavy duty to put this on. 5 lbs of sunflower seed will bend poles designed for smaller feeders (I know as I tried it for a test).Once it was setup, I was getting a lot of birds feeding at a time, from cardinals to chickadee sized birds.If you don't like Blue Jays and birds of that size, you will likely be happy with this feeder. The perches on the feeder are on the smaller range, meaning larger birds are unlikely to want to perch on them for long, if at all. Larger black birds have come and gone on this feeder, unlike the other feeder that they stand in and toss seeds to their minions.Recommended.
B000HHQ2JY This is a heavy duty little feeder.  It is made out of metal and you can tell when you pick up.  All the birds have gone straight to this feeder and do not touch my other \"squirrel proof\" feeders.  The way the metal mesh is designed the birds can sit at at lease 3 different levels and pick out the sunflower seeds.  I have had no trouble with squirrels getting into it and knocking all the seeds down either.  This is made to last and I couldn't be happier.
B000HHQ2JY I really like the all-in-one construction of this unit. It comes completely assembled in a clam-shell package, and unfolds like an accordion. The lid is attached with two spring-loaded latches, which keeps the lid secure, and prevents squirrels from being able to lift the lid and dive right in. It holds a total of five pounds of seed, which has been lasting about two weeks -- based on squirrel and bird usage. This feeder only works well with sunflower or sunflower/safflower mixes.Filling could be slightly easier. Because of the accordion design, you need to hold the unit completely upright with one hand (or hang it at a suitable level), so you can fill it. Otherwise, it will just collapse. There are no instructions, so I'm guessing when I fill it, so maybe there is an easier solution. The design allows each of the three main chambers to fill before the seed will spill completely into the lower chamber. This is actually a smart design, because it also prevents squirrels from emptying the entire unit easily. The lid cannot be completely removed, but it is cut in such a way that you can swing it completely off the top for easy access to filling.At the bottom of the unit, there is a tray that will collect the seed that exits several openings. You can also add additional seed to this tray as a \"starter\" for the visitors. In addition to the tray, there are two additional levels from which birds can perch to feed from the other two main chambers. I've seen birds actively using the feeder -- starlings and cardinals, for example. Mourning Doves are feeding from the seed spilled to the ground (as are the squirrels).Squirrels are able to latch themselves onto the mesh of the feeder. However, the design keeps them from draining the seed quickly. It seems they are only able to remove the seed from the tray -- and as they do, they seem to be in an awkward position that keeps them from doing it comfortably and effectively. They seem to have a really difficult time removing the seed from the mesh. Also, the internal design keeps at least half the seed in each of the lower two chambers from spilling over into the bottom tray, so the only way for squirrels to remove the seeds is through the mesh, which they seem to have a problem doing. Overall, I'd rate this design as a \"B\" for squirrel prevention.I like this because it is attracting birds, can't be easily emptied, and holds a decent amount of seed. It's sturdy and fashionable. I'd recommend this if you want to start attracting birds to your yard, and don't mind sharing some of the seed with squirrels.
B000HHQ2JY Positives:Not \"squirrel proof\" but squirrel annoying.  The local Abert (tree dwelling squirrels) can and do get on this feeder but it is slow going for them to eat out of it.  They have to try to extract the seeds (with some success at the bottom) and cannot simply shovel them into their maws.  The ground squirrels do not seem to have the brains or dexterity to plunder these feeders.Holds a lot of seed.  A lot.  Makes it heavy, be sure you have a sturdy place to hang it.No wood or plastic means it holds up better against UV and pesky squirrels.It looks nice, very simple and elegant.Different types of bird like it, some sit on the perches and the local nuthatches love to cling to it upside-down.It is actually listed as dishwasher safe.  Not brave enough to do that, but I found that it easily cleans by swishing in a bucket.It fell off the hook the first time (the hook could not hold the weight) and no damage occurred at all to the feeder.Negatives:Filling it is tough, you really need a place to hang it while you fill it otherwise it collapses.  The top does not actually come all the way off, you sort of push it up and to the side.  I made myself a \"scoop\" out of an old vinegar  bottle which helps, but I still spill more seed filling this than feeders that are solid rather than mesh.The seed gets wet when it rains.  It does dry off too since the mesh allows airflow but I would like a more overhanging \"roof\" on the top to protect the seed a bit.*UPDATE;A bear visited us, and this bird feeder was no match for him.  However, I contacted Perky Pet  and asked them about how to put it back together and they are sending me a new feeder free of charge (it has a one year warranty).
B000HHQ2JY The birds like it, but it's our squirrels that really love this thing.  They grasp the screen, hang upside down and have a grand old time.  Unfortunately, I really wanted a bird feeder.  Occasionally, I'll see blue jays and other larger birds on it, but they're not the primary users.  The squirrels, in turn, provide our dog with endless amusement.  Good thing she's too small to catch one...The feeder holds about five lbs. of black sunflower seed.  It's all metal and (unless the squirrels haul it off and bury it somewhere) looks like it'll last for years.Highly Recommended.
B000HHQ2JY This feeder is so big that it actually collapses for storage.  It is a well made feeder and not as heavy as you would expect considering it can hold 5 pounds of bird seed.  One thing to note this feeder is for sunflower seeds anything smaller will pour out of the large size holes.
B000HHQ2PI I was rather disappointed in the Bird Scare Tape.  Within two days I had birds trying to carry the tape off.  They would get it in their beak, then try and fly away.  It didn't provide much of a 'scare' to the birds.
B000HHQ2PI The Dalen holographic bird scare tape has worked for us.  We put up a couple strands outside some windows that birds had been flying into.  So far it has worked great because we haven't heard or seen any more birds flying into the glass.
B000HHQ2PI Stop the birds from breaking into your fruit trees. Use the holographic bird scare tape and enjoy more of your fresh fruit.  Scare those pesky squirrels as well.
B000HHQ2PI I use to nail up CD's on the side of the house (cedar shake siding) to keep the woodpeckers away.. but they only stayed away from those spots.  While it kind of looks tacky to have these long strips flying in the wind on the side of your house, it beats patching woodpecker holes.  So far the pests are staying way.
B000HHQ2PI we have a huge bird problem here. maybe it was just too many birds for this product to work? they were bathing in my pond, and pooping all over , rising the ammonia levels and skunking up the water.so I hung this around the pond, it did nothing to stop the birds. it did get the mourning doves off my deck where I hung one there. so maybe doves are easily spooked?  it does catch light and flashes around. it might send too much flashes of light in your windows and drive you away....  it did not stop the robbins from nesting under the deck, they have a nest right now, next to a strip of it. oh well. I eventually put bird netting over the pond, so at least that problem is taken care of. I think for the right bird in the right place, this works..... but the very determined bird, nothing will stop them.  maybe a cat.... :)
B000HHQ5X2 Wonderful bird house!  Bought 2 and just waiting for some tenants.  Easy to install, well made.  Have received complements for the neighbors.  Very happy with purchase.
B000HHQ5X2 I've been trying to lure bluebirds into my backyard, especially in nest boxes around the pool.  Hung this on a fence post and a wren immediated laid claim to it and built a nest and is raising a brood.  Hopefully the bluebirds will show some interest soon.  It's nicely made and easy to clean when necessary.
B000HHQ5X2 I bought this to add to my backyard that already has a much loved bird feeder (see other review), bird bath, and summer raspberry patch. A hung this on a young magnolia tree (trunk is only 4-6\" wide), and used and old phone cord to hang it through the roof holes securely to the trunk next to a branch that's about an inch thick. Within less than 10 minutes the resident chickadee pair that frequents the popular hanging feeder spotted it, but they ultimately did not move in....UPDATE as of 3 weeks later: A male sparrow was spotted trying to coax female sparrows to nest inside, but was unlucky. Finally, a male wren has been diligently adding twigs for weeks. I opened the box and he had woven a gorgeous thick twig burrow with a quarter-size entry, but lazy house sparrows came along and destroyed it! At nearly double the size as him, they collapsed his structure and wanted to nest on top of the 4 inches of twigs inside. I saw them bullying him and felt so bad for all of his work, so I \"hatched\" a plan to keep the sparrows away....I took a strong outdoor bumper sticker and cut a much smaller quarter-size 'wren' size hole in the middle....left the paper on the sticker except for 1/2\" of each edge, so that the wrens won't get 'stuck' to the sticker adhesive...i stuck this over the original entry hole to the box, leaving 1/4\" of the original wood entry hole exposed for gripping at the bottom. It worked! The sparrows could not fit into the hole and within a day have gone to the other neighbor's yard with the other feeders...The male wren is very happy now and has been re-building his nest inside and singing all day to attract females...I like that he is not territorial with the nest box like the chickadees that were chasing others from the nearby feeder when they thought they might move into the box....
B000HHQ5X2 We've been visited by a flock of Bluebirds for the past several years.  They hang around the house, probably eating unwanted bugs and stuff, and they are so curious, it's almost like they recognize us.  My wife and I decided to help with their propagation so we're putting up several bluebird houses for them.  Doing research, Bluebirds need some protection from other, more aggressive birds - we found out the size of the access hole is paramount in protecting the baby birds.  The birdhouse appears very sound, there's a few rough edges but the price is right.  I will be waterproofing them shortly, then put them out sometime in February in preparation for the bird's arrival.  What joy it will be to see the birds raising their young!
B000HHQ5X2 Well built, made in the USA - mounted and waiting for the Eastern Bluebirds to take up residence.  What I think is quite nice is the little lever on front.  Just slide it down and the front opens for easy cleaning.  Will try to get a photo when we get some activity. I have multiple products from Woodlink and each one is well made with quality materials.4-10-13 --- they're checking it out.  Def not a bluebird so I'll keep watching and see what makes a home.4-13-13 --- Bluebirds are in the house!4-19-14 --- a year has gone by.  We cleaned the houses in the fall.  No problem with that, twist the little latch and open up.  I now have the bluebirds back in the houses again this year!  I opted not to add any stain to the birdhouses because of the odor offending the birds - so they're getting that 'drab' look, but that's ok as I watch those blue marvels going in and out, building now and anticipate the feeding frenzy later!
B000HHQ5X2 I usually build my own bluebird houses, but time is at a premium lately, so I couldn't make them. I purchased two of these based on other user reviews. I wasn't disappointed. The houses arrived in a prompt manner and are well-built with a ventilation slit at the top of house. House opens at the front for both easy cleaning and viewing. I put them up just a few weeks ago, late in the season, so I don't anticipate seeing any visitors, but anything is possible. Just a couple of months ago, two pairs of blue birds set up housekeeping in our Purple Martin house, so, again, anything is possible.I plan on buying two more, as I want to set up a bluebird trail in the future. The price was more than I wanted to pay, but a lot less than some others up for sale.
B000HHQAQY I needed full flow valves such as these to supply water to pressure washers. The full flow ensures the pressure washer pump will not be starved for water.This hefty chunk of brass does exactly what it is supposed to do. The valve opens completely and closes securely. It is easy to operate the lever with one hand. It would be nice if these were not so expensive but at least the outlay does not seem like wasted money. I have no complaints at all. I purchased 3 and don't regret it.
B000HHQAQY Greased ball with teflon grease as well as the washer. Use this rather than the knob as it always leaked anyway. The grease made turning the lever simple, and greasing the washer makes it tighten leak-free to the faucet, even by hand. I removed the knob on the hose bib.
B000HHQAQY I really wanted to like this valve, it's made in the USA and the construction is much better than most of the Chinese counterparts. This valve seems to be made of high quality materials (machined brass mostly) and feels solid, but it has a few issues and a major design flaw.I had to return it because it would not work on any of the 4 hoses I tried.Pros:-------------------------+ Made in USA+ Brass Seems DurableCons:-------------------------- The female end of the valve has only a few threads, it will not fit on any of my standard hoses without leaking water everywhere. This is a major design flaw.- When the lever is in the \"On\" position, it extends out past the brass body and interferes with connecting this unit to anything other than a small diameter hose, such as hoses with padded handle areas or even Dramm's own quick connects.- There is a warning label that comes on this product which states it contains lead and chemicals which are known to cause cancer. It would be nice if Amazon included this information in their description.- Expensive compared to similar products. I don't mind this considering the construction and that it's made in the USA, if only the product would work properly.
B000HHQAQY This is the only shutoff valve I will buy for my hoses from now on. Dramm has the absolute best quality water control valves on the market. I would highly recommend this product to anyone with a hose. If i could give it 6 stars I would. This and a Gilmour 528T twist brass water nozzle is the best set up in my opinion.
B000HHQAQY The valve had a loose setting from the factory when I received these.  Simply tighten the nut on top just a tiny bit.  This will make it nice and firm so the handle doesn't flop around by gravity.  I love these valves!  My dog keeps turning on the hose bibs in the back yard so I need to put these on to keep him from causing a flood.  These valves are super high quality and the opening is nice and large so it doesn't restrict the water flow for those times when you need the high pressure.
B000HHQAQY Yeah this is pretty expensive for a shut off valve, but after being irritated by crappy Gilmour ones that last a year I was willing to pay up.  I bought a Gilmour shutoff valve from Lowes and paid about $10 for it.  I got the upgraded \"metal\" large flow model because \"hey metal will last!\".  After 2 months it failed to shut the water off completely when I would turn it.  After dealing with it for months I finally decided to take it apart and discovered that despite being advertised as \"Metal!\" the most important parts are all plastic.  The valve and more incredibly the interior parts that turn the valve were plastic and of course had cracked.  This explained why the valve no longer closed.  As I learned with hose reels, it pays in the long run to buy the good stuff.  So I bought this Dramm, and wow.  It's a solid hunk of brass that I'm certain will last.  The handle is really easy to turn and the valve is large enough that it doesn't restrict flow.  It's made in the USA, which is nice and rare to see.  There is nothing more irritating than your tools failing you when you need them the most, so sometimes you have to pay for the premium stuff.
B000HHQAQY I&#8217;ve had one of these shut-off valves in use for 2 years.  It is outdoors and connected to 100 feet of lifetime black rubber hose. I leave the water turned on and under pressure except when it is below freezing.  NO PROBLEMS!When sunlight hits the hose during the summer, the water in the hose gets scalding hot.  Still no leaks.If you coat the inside of the valve and the lever seal with a good quality plumber&#8217;s grease like Rectorseal, you&#8217;ll be fine.
B000HHQAQY So nice to find a quality, well made product. It is a very smooth movement and no dripping from this part of my hose. It even loos pretty. The shut off leaver is easy to access. Well worth the cost.
B000HHQAQY I bought this to help me change out fitting to wash the car. I added quick-connects to this and the combination is fantastic.  Nice to have something that works well and seems to be quality-made.
B000HHQAQY Another quality Dramm product. Heavy, heavy brass unit with solid shut off mechanism. This is something that, without too much daily abuse, should last a lifetime.
B000HHQAQY Never knew how useful this piece could be until I bought one some while ago.  Use this in conjunction the the Dramm solid brass nozle and you have an unbeatable combination. True, this item is not entirely necessary but attached to the hose with a quick disconnect, you can change heads Without spraying water all over yourself And without having to go back to the main shut-off at the house. It also acts as a limiter so you don't have to change the setting on the head. This item is solid brass, and at least for now, leak free.**EDIT** Had this one several months and it is still leak free. Liked it so well I bought another one for the front yard hose. And now, here comes winter....think I'd better shut off the water at the manifold and drain the hose.  Brass is relatively soft and I have found that brass fittings will crack (due to expansion of the water in the hose) if the hose is left presurized.**EDIT #2** Valve continues to perform flawlessly.  I wanted to address one reviewers complaint about the handle snapping off.  For those who drop or even throw their hose nozzles/valves around, and this includes myself, I think, (mind you I haven't done it yet), that the handle can be sawn off without any loss in functionality.  Just went out to play with it and the valve mechanism turns quite freely, (like a heavily greased ball bearing), without the use of the handle. See the triangular flanges on either side of the nut that attaches the handle?  These flanges provide plenty of space to grab on to for torqueing the valve open or closed. To be safe you could saw all but a nub off the handle that I don't think would ever break, (even if stepped on by a horse!  ;).
B000HHQAQY This valve works great and is super easy to use.  I have purchased a number of other similar valves.This is very, very easy to turn on and off with the control valve.  And it is made to last.  Yes, it is a bit more expensive, but your fingers will thank you and you will enjoy this super convenient valve at the end of your garden hose.Do not hesitate to buy this excellent product.
B000HHQAQY I bought this for my car foaming system so that I could switch attachments without having to continually run to the valve and close it, and it works great. Can't ask much more from a ball valve system, so it gets 5 stars.
B000HHQAQY Without question, the world's best real brass shut-off valve.The large internal diameter won't restrict the water flow which is important for pressure washers.Even with gloves, the long lever allows you to easily turn the valve on or off.I've been using this shut-off valve for over a year and I mercilessly dragged it countless times across the concrete driveway and through mud.  Yeah, it's all scratched up but it continues to work without problems.
B000HHQAQY These are the best shut off valves I have ever owned.What I like most about these is the long handle. I can more accurately control the amount of water running through them into my soaker hoses. With the plastic shut off valves I have to fumble around trying to find the shut off and even then they are hard to turn. The action on this one is smooth and easy.My shut off valves should last for years and years. They will eventually pay for themselves due to their longevity.
B000HHQAQY solid brass, heavy, made in usa, works as intend.should last for many more years, switch still have smooth action after couple of years.left outside, no issue but no snow or harsh weather here.
B000HHQAQY I'm really impressed with the quality.  I bought two and the fit and finish far exceeds any plastic or cast version I've used.  The action is smooth and in case you haven't read the fine print, this is almost a half pound of solid milled brass(!).  I doubt I'll have any problems in the short or long term, but I'll be sure to update this review if I do.
B000HHQNBG No big praise or real complaints for this row cover. I used it for some seedlings in a raised bed. I don't have anything to compare it to, to see how it stacks up against others. I had to raise the cover up every time I watered which wasn't ideal, and it seems like using some small supports to raise slightly off the ground could be useful. Quality is decent, and seemed to let enough light through for the seeds to germinate fine.
B000HHQNBG This year summer did not want to come for a long time and I had to use the cover to keep little seedlings warm. It worked just fine. Now my plats are so big, I can't cover them any more. I folded this blanket and will use it next season.
B000HHQNBG Purchased this item to improve germination chances for a patch of lawn seeded mid-October in Connecticut.  While customarily I would have used and preferred spreading Mainely Mulch, I decided against the bale of Mainely only because I sought to cover little more than 100 sq. ft and didn't want to store a barely used bale through the winter months.  I was skeptical that my little seeding operation would work, given the time of the year, however, lo and behold, thanks to some terrific grass seed, helpful weather conditions, and this Dalen Harvest Guard Row Cover, I actually produced a beautiful and full patch of lawn.  This cover assisted in saving the seeded area from roving birds (and the neighbors' chickens), minimally to raising the temperature of the soil, and to an extent keeping the seed moist.  I was genuinely impressed and fully satisfied with this purchase.
B000HHQNBG This seems to work quite well in covering my strawberries and making a tunnel cover for some cucumbers.  I am using it to keep the birds and bugs, out not to extend the harvest time, because it is garden season now.  It is somewhat thin and tears quite easily, so be careful in using it.  I hold it down with the garden staples I purchased at the same time.So it stays in place very well.  The only reason I gave it a 3 is because it tears so easily, and is only 5 ft wide.  You have to cut it quite a bit to cover any large rows of things.
B000HHQNBG Used this as a cover for my Green beans during beetle season to keep them pest free. Worked well. Would purchase again.
B000HHQNBG I grow fruit and veggies in my garden and found that the birds know just when the blueberries and strawberries are ready to be picked. They eat them before I can so I decided to cover the plants with this product and it worked perfectly. Great for frost protection as well.
B000HHQNBG I bought one of these for the first time this year.  I can't say enough about it.  Usually after a warm spell when it turns cold, my apple trees do not bear.  This year I covered my granny smith and it loved it!  It keep the frost/freeze off of the leaves and looks just like if we hadn't had one.  This is a wonderful product and is versitle.  It works well in the garden too since it is loose and you can secure it over and where you want.  Would definitely recommend this product.  wish I had used it sooner.
B000HI3I68 We are total newbies to charcoal cooking.  We bought this on the basis of great reviews and because it, along with the new Weber kettle we bought, cost about 1/2 what the Smokey Mountain smoker would have cost.  We also like the idea of not having to kneel down to tend it.First time, great results.  We ignored the suggestion of giving it a no-food run the first time and put some chicken pieces on, figuring we could always finish them in the oven if we failed with the charcoal.  No problem, the temperature stayed right around 225F.  Second time, our big pork roast took longer than the time we allowed, not the Smokenator's fault.  The Smokenator again performed exactly as the instructions predicted.  We just got hungry too soon.  Finished the meat in the microwave.Yes, we'd buy it again, but we probably won't have to.  It's very well constructed, and so is the Weber kettle.
B000HI3I68 Please see the photos I uploaded. I inaugurated my Smokenator 1000 the other day after getting my grill scrubbed clean and my applewood chunks soaked and all that. I used a commercial rub which I wouldn't advise doing, too salty. One other thing you want is a DRIP PAN, some kind of disposable aluminum pan to go underneath whatever you're smoking.The Smokenator 1000 arrived in four days, not the three weeks quoted as the outside delivery date, so that was great news. It's really sturdy. YOU OUGHT TO ORDER THE HOVERGRILL WITH IT. That's the \"upper deck\" grill that can greatly expand your grill's capacity. I had a Steve Raichlen Non-Stick Rib Rack so I used thatSteven Raichlen Best of Barbecue Nonstick Ultimate Rib Rack, and it worked great! I could have smoked two MORE racks if I'd been inclined!It took about four hours from when the coals were lit until the ribs came off the grill, then I rested them for an hour. They were outstanding! I've never tasted better! So much better than my earlier attempts at building and maintaining an offset fire to smoke ribs.I can hardly wait to try other cuts of meat and fish and chicken. If you own a Weber 22.5\" grill, you NEED one of these! A brilliant solution which works GREAT.One other thing you want to have is a GOOD thermometer or two! A $60 grill, a $70 smoker, $50 in thermometers.. it's worth it! I need to find a thermometer or two to use with this device. I like instrumentation. I want to know what's going on, and from what I've read you want a thermometer at about grill height, but a few inches away from the food itself.NO COMPLAINTS WHATSOEVER. You will not believe how good these ribs were. Amazing! I can hardly wait to try some salmon or a chicken....Regarding thermometers, my idea now is to buy a couple of $20 dial BBQ thermometers, drill a hole through the grill wall just above the charcoal grate and the food grate in order to be able to tell what the temperature is like at those two locations -- where the food is, not the dome!
B000HI3I68 It does the job, but I think there is too much maintenance. I hate refilling the water and I've tried so many methods, but I just can't keep the temps steady for long. I go outside every 15 minutes to adjust it. I'll probably just buy a WSM
B000HI3I68 I wanted to wait awhile and work with the Smokenator 1000 before I posted a review. I've had it ~ a month or so, and have smoked a salmon fillet, whole chickens, and a 16 lbs. turkey. All items have come out excellent. I'm a BBQ novice, and even more so when it comes to charcoal grills (I'm used to LP). I wanted to expand my repertoire of outdoor cooking, but didn't want to spend money on a dedicated smoker. And like other reviwers, I balked at spending that much on what I thought was just a glorified bent piece of sheet metal. I decided, after a lot of thought, to just bite the bullet and order it.I'm glad I did!Though simple in execution, the Smokentator 1000 comes with GREAT instructions - I mean, these things are written down to the point of being crazy! The creator of this thing (I think his name is Don) really made it fool proof (I know - I'm usually the fool!) He even posted a video on a popular free video website that starts with a 'Y' and ends with a 'tube' that shows how to get this puppy lit.I'm continually impressed with how well this device holds a temperature and for how long. And the results are just great - my family thought my grilling abilities were just a notch above mediocre, but they really dig the stuff this device produces.I guess whether you decide to spend the dough for sheet metal is up to you, but the amount of research this guy did into making it easy to use for anybody, for me, justifies the purchase price. I'm happy I've got it, bottom line.By the way - the instructions recommend doing a trial run without food to see how your kettle performs. Definitely do this! I discovered my lid was slightly warped and leaked smoke (nothing that a couple binder clips couldn't fix). It helps you know what to expect from your grill.That's my $0.02. I hope you found it helpful.Cheers!
B000HI3I68 My wife grew up in West Texas where mesquite is the smoking wood king, but we moved away more than 30 years ago and have missed that slow cooked mesquite flavor ever since.  Once mesquite is in your blood it is hard to fall in love with anything else.  One of my key philosophies is \"if someone else can do it, so can I.\"  Unfortunately, even with my philosophy, we were never able to duplicate the flavors and textures we enjoyed in West Texas.  We tried using the Weber Kettle with mesquite-infused charcoal, mesquite wood chips, indirect heat, water pans, etc, but we could never get the temperature control or the smoke we needed to match the West Texas mesquite flavor of slow smoked briskets, chickens, and turkeys we remembered.  We always thought of buying a smoker but never did because there were just too many options to choose from and friends I knew that had a smoker all had complaints.  Granted, we've tasted a lot of good smoked meats over the years, but nothing ever matched what we missed.That all changed with the Smokenator.  Some endeavors take a lot more education, experience, and money than I'm willing to devote, but that's not the case with the Smokenator.  You can have great smoked meats with very little education, experience, and money.  The directions are probably the best written \"how-to\" you can find.  The only change I made is I monitor temp at the cooking surface not the dome vent.  The Smokenator is ridiculously easy to load, control, and use with our Weber Kettle and a Maverick digital oven thermometer.  After the first use of the Smokenator loaded with Kingsford briquettes and mesquite wood chunks we felt like we found West Texas in our backyard and in our bellies once again.  After three decades away from the Lone Star state, the memories came flooding back with the first bite.  We LOVE our Smokenator!Update:  Bottom line, if you want to learn to smoke meat and already own a Weber Kettle, the Smokenator is the most inexpensive yet extremely effective accessory you can buy that will teach you everything you need to know about charcoal smokers, temperature control, patience, personal technique and recipes.  A wireless dual probe thermometer like the Maverick ET-732 or 733 is an absolute must for consistent results.  I measure temp at grill surface and only measure temp at the vent if I'm smoking a large or tall piece of meat like a turkey or beer can chicken, then I monitor both grill and vent temps!People always ask me what I can smoke with the Smokenator and a 22\" Weber Kettle?  I have smoked everything I can get my hands on that I enjoy; salmon, whole chickens, chicken breasts, chicken thighs, chicken leg quarters, chuck roasts, pork butts, pork shoulders, pork tenderloins, pork loins, St Louis Cut Spare Ribs, baby back ribs, beef ribs, peppers with cheese stuffing wrapped in bacon, whole turkeys up to 17 lbs, turkey breasts, and I've even made Canadian bacon.  I'm going to make pastrami in the next week or two with a corned beef round we have in the freezer.  Brisket is the only thing I haven't smoked yet and that's because I've been waiting to receive a vacuum sealer for Christmas so we can better save the meat once smoked. Trust me, with the experience I developed with the Smokenator I have absolutely no fear of slapping a 10-15 lbs brisket on the Weber knowing I'll get great results. BTW, I rarely use a water pan any longer but still pull it out with salmon.  I now have several sizes of water pans.The Smokenator is a great end in itself, but I now want to smoke in greater volume because with most smokes I do on the weekend the meat is gone by Tuesday or Wednesday.  My wife purchased a 22\" Weber Smokey Mountain (WSM) for me for Christmas.  The Kettle and the Smokenator will still get used quite a bit though because it is WAY more efficient than the 22\" WSM and great for quick smokes like salmon or chicken.  For example, today I made another batch of Canadian bacon on the Kettle.  There was enough leftover charcoal from my last smoke in the Smokenator that all I added were 18 hot Kingsford briquettes to the Smokenator and four pieces of apple wood.  I smoked the pork tenderloins for four hours at 215F-225F until they reached an internal temp of 160F. I added no more fuel to the Smokenator for the entire smoke.The Smokenator is one amazing accessory to the Weber Kettle.
B000HI3I68 Don, the man who makes and sells this product knows customer service. I ordered this on a Monday evening, and I had it in Fridays' mail. Also, I had one question, which I emailed him on a Sunday night, and he answered the same night.Now, about the product. This item is well built, and is pretty dummy proof. I did not know it, but the thermometer that I had recently installed from a major home improvement store was flaky. At times it reads 100 degrees higher than actual. Even so, following the directions and setting the vent as per the manual gave me great results. I have a bullet style water smoker already, and the smokenator is giving me better results. The results are also superior to just stacking up coals on the left and the right with a pan seperating them. For just a few bucks, you can get this with the hovergrill.  The hovergrill really gives you a lot more space if you ever smoke more than a couple of items at once.I recommend this to anyone. But it would be especially usesful if you can't afford, or have no desire to buy a dedicated smoker. Over all, I recommend this over any bullet smoker.
B000HI3I68 Quality product and easy to install.  The most important thing is it works. Try this with pork ribs to test it and it come out delicious and juicy.  Temperature is a lot more easy to control.  No more fussing with aluminum foil to line the grill every time and wasted fuel. The 60 briquets last a long time. Fire bricks are cheap but too heavy for the one-touch grill without the steel frame. The smokenator looks a lot neater and professional. Really glad someone create this and it is so very convenient.
B000HI9L78 LETEM EAT WORMS
B000HI9L78 Well the birds seem to enjoy this variety.The squirrels eat it up also,along with other folks.It comes shipped neatly in a box.
B000HI9L78 Chicks like this, but the Hagen Parakeet Budgie staple with its high millet content and more complete vitamin-mineral mix seems to be more nutritional for my chicks. BUT, they don't let this stuff go to waste either! ;)
B000HI9L78 This feed did not work well for me. It is more expensive than many others, at $2.40 a pound, but there was a lot of waste. It seems to be only Black Oil Sunflower, Cracked Corn, Millet and Milo. The Sunflower was eaten readily, but I could have bought that alone far cheaper. The snow in my yard is covered in what looks like teeny, tiny rabbit droppings...the Milo the birds have tossed off the platform feeder. There is also more corn than i like to see. It is not eaten by many of the birds, and I always worry about corn stored in plastic developing aflatoxins and killing the birds. I will not buy this again.
B000HI9L78 I've seen cardinals, chickadees, sparrows, wrens, robins, and some mystery birds since putting this in my new feeder. They all seem happy :)  I've also added red pepper flakes to keep squirrels away, and have suet cakes on the sides.  I'll reorder !
B000HI9L78 finally found a bird seed that is cheap yet has the good seed that my song birds enjoy. I guess you just cant go wrong when you buy Kaytee products!! Thanks guys!!!
B000HI9L78 Nice mixture of different seeds for year-round use & useable in many style of feeders.Like to mix one of the Kaytee styles/mixtures of w-bird feed with another cheaper brand of w-bird feed/seed.Reason for 3 star rating: the price otherwise all Kaytee styles of w-bird deserve 5 stars.
B000HJ7AIY By the time you see the annoying little buggers, it is too late. You must throw out any contaminated or potentially tainted foodstuffs, seal any entry points and scrub everything down. This product can help. It is easy to set up and contains a lure that is designed to attract and trap male moths. There is no discernible odor and it is non-toxic. However, I have had mixed luck with it. I used it in a shed where I store bird seed and dog and cat food. One bag of seed turned out to be buggy. So far this has captured two moths. I was hoping for more impressive results. A piece of fly paper was far more effective and I think removing the lure and affixing it to the fly paper might help.It is a conundrum. I learned from a manager of a  retailer that they spray their bags of pet food and bird seed  with insecticide. It may be effective but it is not acceptable. So I guess the only option is the occasional headache of pantry pest elimination. Again, this product seems to be somewhat helpful and therefore could serve as part of a removal strategy.
B000HJ7AIY July 19th. Finally ordered that second pack of these for the garage as stated later in the body of this review. Also threw out old traps bought in May, they were full. These are really a blessing they work so well! Now with summer here we are seeing more moths coming in the house when we open a door. I know now through the experience of using this extremely effective traps we will soon be moth free, most likely in less then 10 days.  I love that they trap the males so we don't have to worry about a whole new crop of moths. Bottom line this product is extremely effective, easy to use, and easy to place  and dispose of. As far as the reviews that say this product is not effective, I can only wonder if they are using it for the correct moth, because at our house these work even better than advertised.The portion of the below review is from first use of this product in May 2013:A dear person in our household, 2 years ago now, did not cover the bird food, we did not know this, until we discovered a partial bag crawling with worms, and then the light came on as to where all those darn little moths had been coming from.I was not even aware there was a trap for these kind of moths until I saw and ordered this one. They Work!  It has been about 2 weeks and we have noticed a huge difference already, and the traps are collecting moths about 2 per week, which may not sound like much, but I have not found any new  eggs laid.I cannot believe what a pest these moths are. We have been swatting them for 2 years and have not gotten ahead of them.  I ended up putting anything and everything in our freezer, all dry foods that interested them, what a pain.Then I would think we had the problem under control and would test my theory by putting a box of cereal in the pantry.  Pretty soon, we would see moths again. One day I totally took the whole pantry apart and got the surprise of my life, I had extra cleaning rags that I had not used in several years folded and put on the top shelf of the pantry. I pulled those down to clean behind them and inside the folded fabric there where dozens and dozens of eggs, some hatched and dried up, some fresh and yucky, gooey. So, all my efforts really had not mattered because they had a home ready made, how disgusting.I like the reviewers idea that suggested putting the 2 pheromone squares on a long fly paper trap, I am ordering another set of these for my garage, because we still have moths in the garage and the garage having much more square footage then the pantry, I think the fly trap having more sticky area may grab more moths quicker.From now on I will always have one or two of these in our home simply because the moth and larvae are so hard to find , catch and stop I am thinking an ounce of prevention in this case will definitely be worth a pound of cure.
B000HJ7AIY It just quietly sits there and nails the little devils. No odor, no mess. I find they're effective next to a fruit bowl in the summer for a couple of months. Have tried cheaper ones.
B000HJ7AIY I LOVE to cook and have a pantry that looks like a grocery store, so when these little moth invaders come unvited into my flour and chocolate products (yes~they attack CHOCOLATE!) I become unhinged!Safer Pantry Pest Traps are all you need to fix this problem. Open a packet, which contains a little pheremone patch, toss it inside the prefolded trap and place in your pantry. That's it. In a matter of hours, you will have the little pests fly into the sticky trap and soon, the males and females cannot mate, and your mothy guests are history.I recommended these traps to two friends who also used them, and had successful results too, so I HIGHLY recommend them if you are unfortunate enough to have pantry moths. Two thumbs up!!
B000HJ7AIY I don't understand how people can say this product doesn't work.  I plopped the bait through the top hole as directed, it stuck to the sticky stuff inside the triangle, and then placed the triangle right next to several bags of dried lentils.  The other triangle went next to several boxes of pasta.  Within 48 hours I had two and three small moths in each one.  These were small moths the size of house flies, but moths nonetheless.Since these triangles are very pliable I was able to squeeze either one in an already packed cupboard.  At the rate these are working I may have to replace these in a few weeks.
B000HJ7AIY I have used these traps for years now. You simply open the pheromone lure and drop it into the trap. They are pretty effective in luring the pantry moths, and once in the trap they stick to the adhesive. Although I have minimized my pantry moth problem greatly, I still have them appear every now and then, but to a much lesser degree. I don't know if it's possible to eradicate pantry moth infestations 100% but keep at it. I store any potential food sources for the moths in the freezer or in air-tight containers as much as possible.
B000HJ7AIY These Safer Brand Pantry Pest Traps far exceeded my expectations. We had suddenly become infested with small gray moths in our kitchen and pantry area. The problem got better after throwing away an open bag of flour that was improperly covered, cleaning the shelves, and putting all other flour, grain, and pasta products in Ziploc bags, but we still had several of the little pests fluttering around.We followed the package directions and placed the Pest Traps in the areas where the moths tended to be the worst. Sure enough, the first two traps literally filled with the moths within a week. Since then we have placed two more traps out and they have caught a few more, but we haven't seen any more flying in the house since.We are very pleased with the effectiveness of the Safer Brand Pantry Pest Traps - Highly Recommended
B000HJ7AIY Disclaimer: I am reviewing a box (2 traps) that I received for free through the Vine program.Revised review as of 9/17/2013: Wow, so these traps DO work, eventually. It took a few months (my original review, plus a revision a couple of months later, said that they weren't working)......  but they did finally catch a bunch of moths. So I'll be ordering some more now.
B000HJ7AIY Every spring for about 2 months I get an invasion of moths in my pantry.  I have tried many products and cedar planks but they still fly around my kitchen area.  I have no idea where they come from, but they arrive.  I got these traps and put them in my kitchen and pantry area - within 2 days, there was not a LIVE moth to be found!!!  The trap also took care of a few houseflies!  I am delighted with this product!  Been a couple of weeks and I have not seen a single moth!  I would highly recommend this product!!!
B000HJ7AIY I usually use the Catchmaster brand traps, but saw these in the store and thought I'd give them a try. While they have the same design as the Catchmaster (basically a cardboard triangle with a sticky interior and a scent lure to attract the male moths) they don't work nearly as well. In the same cabinet, the Catchmaster trapped over a dozen moths; the Safer only got one.I'll be sticking (sorry for the horrid pun) with the Catchmaster from now on.
B000HJ7AIY In April, at the height of our moth activity, I bought a box of these traps and placed one, per the instructions, underneath the cupboard. Three days later, all I'd found inside was a gray smudge where a moth apparently managed to free itself from the glue. I was frustrated and posted a 1-star review.Just over a month later I happened to look inside the trap, and I was stunned. Both sticky surfaces are now covered with moths and even a few flies. I haven't touched the trap, and I'm not sure what happened, but I've completely revised my opinion. You may now consider me very pleased with my purchase.
B000HJ7AIY The is just a tent shaped piece of cardboard with sticky on the inside. You place a very small square in the sticky area, this is the pheromone lure.This really works. I set it out my food storage and refrigerator in our garage and within 10 minutes, we had moths on the sticky section. You can tell that the lure works, most of the moths are gathered right by the lure.I think I will take the advice of using the lure with a regular fly strip, giving the moths a greater area to get stuck on.The kit includes 2 traps and 2 lures. Each trap lasts about 3 months.
B000HJ7AIY A few years ago, we opened a bag of Basmati rice, and were surprised and horrified to find small moths bumbling about inside. The rice had been stored in our pantry, along with other dried food. We threw out the rice, but soon discovered that other foods were affected by the moths. A few minutes of searching on the Web identified the critters as pantry moths. They have other names, not all of them printable. We called them \"Basmati Beasties\". They're found all over the world, wherever dried food is stored.Clearly, we needed to get rid of the little chaps, and equally clearly it wasn't a viable option to spray our pantry with insecticide.Our local hardware store recommended the Pantry Pest Trap.It's a simple device - no batteries, electronics or moving parts - just a hollow cardboard tube containing pheromone-based attractant, to lure the beasties to their doom, with a sticky surface on the inside, to ensure that they don't escape. It's simple, but very effective. In practice, we've found that one trap will protect our pantry for about three months. There's no insecticide involved, so no risk of contamination.
B000HJ7AIY For some reason, small moths love to congregate in my garage.  Before I discovered the Pantry Pest Trap, the moths would build their cocoons in the corners where the walls meet the ceilings.  I have 15' ceilings in my garage, so I was frequently climbing a ladder and swinging a broom at their little nests.  I discovered the Pantry Pest Traps a couple of years ago, and since then I haven't had a moth survive long enough to cocoon or fall into my dog's water dish.  They are attracted by the scented lure to the triangular, tent-like pest trap where they get stuck to the inside walls.  They smell the lure, but humans don't--there is no discernible odor to this product.  Each trap is effective for at least three months, and when it gets full, I exchange the one that is covered in moth bodies for a new one.  The trap is not large (5\"Lx2\"Wx3\"T) nor is it conspicuous.  I keep mine just out of sight on top of my forced air heat unit so I don't have to look at all the dead months on a daily basis, but the moths have no problem finding it. Each box comes with two traps & two lures. I make sure I am never without a spare.  This is a well-deserved 5-star product!
B000HJ7AIY Very disappointed in this product. Set it up according to instructions but I did not get a single moth!  I think that the pheromone lures were not strong enough and they just said forget it. Some of these \"Safer\" products are great for the environment but dont do the job well or at all.Pass on this-get a stronger scented trap system.
B000HJ7AIY So it is important to ascertain that you've got the right product for the species of insect that you are trying to eliminate.  Luckily, this product draws the moths that love to live in my kitchen.I've tried various products out in our gardens that lure insects by way of pheromones, and I can say, with experience, that if you've mis-identified your insect, the money you spent on the product will be wasted.  Don't guess.  Don't assume that because it's in the same family of insects it will work. It probably won't.  (I've taken a few entomology classes, but I'm no entomologist--so I could be wrong, but my experience is telling me I'm right.)  Buy this product for the specific moth indicated, or don't buy it.I place these traps on the top of my cabinets--the cabinets that the cats can't reach.  The traps are open-ended, tri-fold, paper cards.  I never put them into the cabinets where fingers can inadvertently touch the inside of them.  They are really sticky inside, kind of like glue traps.  (Watch out when you go to pull them from the carton.  You don't want to touch the inside...)
B000HJ7AIY Super easy to set up - open the pheromone baggie and drop the little scented square into the trap. The directions say to drop it through the hole, but I don't actually see the necessity of that - placing it anywhere on the sticky part should still serve as a lure.I don't have any moths yet after two weeks of use, but the real test is occurring right now - I put the traps in two food cabinets in my RV, both containing dried foods. This will sit alone all summer (in another state, even) - perfect conditions for an infestation. When I go back in the fall to check my RV, we'll see what the traps may have caught.RECOMMENDATION: Cheap and easy to use. Although the directions are almost nonexistent, it's not hard to work out the procedure. In the short time of my testing, there's been no action, but I imagine that living in the RV kept more vermin away. Now that the unit is sitting alone, this is the real test.I'd say, since the price is good, these are a good first defense option. Get these before shelling out the big bucks for an exterminator, or before personally spraying poison into your pantry.
B000HJ7AIY These traps work perfectly. Each is a triangular enclosure with a glue-covered interior surface. The kit includes two sealed packets, each containing a pheromone patch, which is dropped through the cutout hole on the trap for placement roughly in the middle of either of the glue surfaces.If moths make their way into the pantry, rest assured that The Pantry Pest Traps' glue patches will quickly draw them in. I have used this same brand for quite some time now, and I attest to their effectiveness. I highly recommend Safer brand moth traps, they work very well.
B000HJ7AIY I have used these traps before, mostly with good results.  But they have to be placed strategically and, as one other reviewer has mentioned, lose their stickiness sooner than I'd like.  I, too, have seen moths wiggle their way out of the trap again.  Still, they do the job, and for the price I can't complain.
B000HJ7AIY Having just cleaned absolutely everything inthe pantry due to pantry moths from a bulk food department, this is wonderful, stops them cold before  they get out of hand. Pantry moths can destroy a lot of food fast! if you buy bulk food you need this today!
B000HJ7AIY Grain moths plague my kitchen, especially in warmer weather. But putting toxins next to food is a no-go for me, which is why I love this pheromone-based trap. Within the first day, three moths had flown into one of the sticky traps. Best of all, I don't need to place this near food. I put it on top of my cabinets where I don't have to see it or think about it. Bye bye, nasty moths. Recommended.
B000HJ7AIY I've been a longtime fan of Safer products in my garden, so I was eager to try the Pantry Pest Trap indoors. Some nasty little moths had found a ride indoors, perhaps in a bag of pet food, and were lurking about the kitchen.The Pantry Pest Traps are set up in locations where I thought they might catch these pests, but so far I have seen no trapped moths. I'll continue to use these traps for a few more weeks, as there are few alternatives that are safe in the kitchen.
B000HJ7AIY In the ideal world I'd prefer to use a non-chemical solution to take care of a pest problem. Unfortunately, there are times when chemicals will eradicate a problem when a trap like this won't.I have used these traps several times. Yes, I catch many pantry moths in the traps. The traps do attract the male moths. However, the traps do not remove the problem permanently. I use the traps in conjunction with the Hot Shot No Pest Strip Unscented Hanging Vapor Insect Repellent. This is a pesticide that removes bugs. You will need to replace it every three or four months, but if you use this on a regular basis you won't need the traps.
B000HJ7AIY We put out these traps in 2007 or 2008 - a very long time ago.  They never caught anything, so I left them alone and simply checked every few months.  I knew they probably were \"dead\" and should be replaced, but just never got around to it. About a month ago, I found the trap and looked inside - inside three months (when I last checked), the trap went from no moths to a dozen or more captured!  And this is after years of just sitting with the phermone strip exposed to the air!  THANK YOU, SAFER!  I immediately replaced the traps with new ones, since the old ones were full.  Hope the new traps last 1/2 as long!  RECOMMENDED.
B000HJ7AIY I saw few moths flying and the trap came handy. It worked- the moths got trapped and I can no see any new one flying. So winner for me and will use in the future if problem will accure.
B000HJ7AIY I am a vegetarian. And one thing all veg-heads deal with sooner or later is the pantry moth. Beans, flours, grains, these things will find it. And once you have them, they are hard to get rid of. This product is the fix. Set the trap then walk away. My house is now 100% moth free in two weeks. That is amazing. There isn't much more to say about these things other than they work and work fast. They interrupt the breeding cycle by attracting the adults, which means no more eggs.
B000HJ7AIY ...they started to enter the trap!UPDATE, 9/1/13:This is a well-deserved upgrade from our initial 1-star review (which remains below this update so readers no the sequence.Fast-forward several months,where we discovered that the trap started to attract several (5 so far) moths. It seems that it just took some time for it to work.We also were able to trace the moths to our wool carpet, which we removed. And now we haven't seen a moth for a while now.So, we have to admit that we got it wrong with our initial review, and we hope our correction will encourage some potential customers to give it a try...just be patient!Thanks for reading!Original review:We were fortunate enough to have the opportunity to evaluate this \"Safer Brand 05140 The Pantry Pest Trap, 2 Moth Traps\" product for the Vine program...and just in time, because we had very recently noticed that we had some moths flying around our apartment. But the fortune soon faded.It was a complete fail. Maybe our moths weren't the ones that the pheromone compound was intended for, but the moths literally flew by the trap. Our cat did a better job, when they got close to her, she was able to bat them, but she didn't finish the job...we had to. We live in a sub-1000 SF apartment, and set up both traps, just to make sure we had adequate coverage. We've had them out for 4 weeks now; not one moth has deigned to enter.Also, the instructions that came with ours were not clear, nor consistent. Assuming \"Safer\" actually can get these to work better, I'd recommend they work on that department as well. But that is secondary to the failure of the product.I am considering contacting the company to see if the have different type pheromones that might work better. If I do, I will update.
B000HJ7AIY Update 5/10/14 - after using these traps alongsideCatchmaster Moth and Pantry Pest Trap: Three Packs of TwoI am seeing a huge difference in the number of moths trapped between the two brands. The Catchmaster does a much better job in a side by side comparison. Where I might have about 10 moths stuck to the Safer Brand, I have over 100 on the Catchmaster. I will be purchasing the Catchmaster Brand from now on.We had tiny little moths that seemed to come into our home from packaged grains that we purchased from the grocery store.  Once we had them, they just seemed to multiply.  I didn't want to use toxic sprays or cleaners in the pantry so I was happy to find these easy to use pantry pest traps.  All you have to do is fold the traps into a triangle with the sticky stuff inside and open the little dot with the pheromone (a scent that attracts the moths) and drop it into the trap so it sticks on the side.  Then just set the trap in an area where the moths are.  You won't be able to smell the lure, but the moths will.It takes a week or so to trap all the moths, and each trap lasts for up to 3 months.  I was surprised at how many moths it trapped.  We also used one in the garage near the bags of bird seed and thistle.  Moths seem to be attracted to that too and we caught a lot of them in there.  Two thumbs up for a safe and effective product.
B000HJ7AIY I have a porch  in which I keep food. I also keep some in a basement area.  I didn't think I had much of a moth problem until I tried these traps and noticed what they caught.I like the idea that these are pesticide free. I would not use any pesticide in my house an especially near food.The instructions on the traps are easy to follow.  The traps are not that noticeable  so if people stop by they won't be wondering if there is a pest infestation.These are safe, simple and work.
B000HJ7AIY I lived on the edge of a wilderness in my last apartment, and we were constantly having moth issues.  This product was the fix.The trap is a small triangle shaped box with openings for the moths to get in, but not exposing the sticky part of the trap to your hands or accidental contact.The setup is incredibly easy.  Tear the packet and drop the lure on the sticky flypaper interior.  Put it on a shelf in the trouble spots and just wait.It fixed my moth situation, and it will fix yours.  And at a very reasonable price.
B000HJ7AIY I've used Pantry Pest traps for years. I always have enough rice, flour, barley, etc., to last a few years. Therefore, moth traps are always in the storage area.These are slightly different than my last batch, which had a cone shaped lure and black stripes on the inside.Usually, after putting a trap out, at least 3 or 4 get caught within a few weeks. This time, only 1.They are still effective, obviously. Perhaps I simply have fewer pests.
B000HJ7AIY These work very well at attracting the moths, but aren't as good as they could be at actually trapping them.  They catch about half of the moths that they attract, so we augmented these traps with some fly paper.  That combination worked great.  I recommend them, but wish the manufacturer would improve the stickiness of them.  They should also increase the surface area of them.
B000HJ7AIY My parents have been having problems with moths for months. My Dad didn't think they were really a problem, but every time I was over, we were killing moths left and right. It wasn't until I got these that I was able to actually show them they DO have a problem.We put these traps down near the open dog food (where the moth issue likely came from) on Thursday night. By Friday morning, there were about 20 moths caught in the trap. My Dad now realizes they definitely have a moth problem.The way this works is through pheromone. You put the pheromone in the center of the trap then fold the edges to build a triangle. On the sides of the trap is sticky glue. The males are caught by this trap so the females won't be able to lay more fertilized eggs.Looking at the 1 star reviews, I can only assume that the company has reformulated the traps again, as these most definitely did work. My parents plan on purchasing one more set when these are full (shouldn't be long) to ensure the cycle is broken.They also plan to put a dog food can with an airtight lid in place instead of what they have that has openings.
B000HJ7AIY I have used pantry moth traps before, but never this brand.  It could be that the moths have gotten smarter (there is so much room for that), but these traps are more resistible/less effective.
B000HJ7AIY Every few years, we seem to get a mealy moth infestation in our home. The solution of choice for me has been \"Safer Brand Pantry Pest Trap\". For me, it's been effective at luring and trapping the moths. I have small children, and I also like that this trap does not contain any toxic chemicals or pesticides. It works by releasing a pheromone to attract and trap males. You need to put it relatively close to the moth's food source (typically your pantry or wherever you store food products). Provided that you do, this product works. Four stars.
B000HMBJ74 very good buy you could always used spray bottles all over the house for all kind of stuff worth the buy
B000HMBJ74 LOVE THIS  GREAT DEAL CAME FASTTHESEBOTTLES ARE HIGH QUALITY NOT THE GARBAGE ONES FORM THE DOLLAR STORE . I USE THEM FOR EACH PLANT . I GOT MINE THAT WERE DIFFERENT COLORS THAT REALLY HELPED SO THAT ONE HAS WATER , ONE HAS FERTILIZER VITAMINS AND SO ONE
B000HMBJ74 These work great as expected! The only improvement I can think of:  You can only twist it to turn the spray off, or on. You can't twist it to a stream-- I'd love to be able to focus the stream of water or cleaner into one spot. Other than that, these work great and are very well made.
B000HMBJ74 They're spray bottles - they hold liquids, and then the liquids come out in a mist or stream (your choice!) when you squeeze the lever.  That's about all you could hope for in a spray bottle.
B000HMBJ74 I use these to mist plants with water and they seem to work great. I did use one for bleach and water mixture for cleaning things and it works great for that too. If I needed more I'd come back and get another set but 3 seem to fill my current needs.
B000HMBJ74 I read the other reviews and did not believe that so simple of a product could be so bad. This is a laughably bad product. It falls apart after one or two uses. If I owned a store I would be embarrased to sell it. If I manufactured it, Iwould do so under an assumed name.
B000HX2DGE Love this fire pit! Was looking for something large and this was the largest I could find short of custom building a fire pit into the ground (which may come later). Think of this as the equivalent of a portable bonfire - it holds a large amount of wood that can easily burn for several hours. It gives off a good deal of heat but not so much that you can't enjoy sitting around the pit and roasting marshmallows. The copper is beautiful but as others have noted, that changes as soon as you use it for the first time (it is a fire pit after all). I'm actually glad about that since there has been a huge increase in copper thefts in the area where I live so I'm more comfortable with this being used and not screaming &#34;Take me, I'm copper!&#34; My only complaint is that for the price, it should include a poker, as some other pits do. But the pit itself is awesome. Pricier than others but well worth it.
B000HX2DGE I jumped for joy when this hand hammered copper pit arrived. Had planned for it and had kindling and a stack of wood waiting so immediately put this gorgeous piece to work outdoors. It looks amazing and can blend into so many settings with rustic elegance that I considered using it alternatively as a table by putting a glass top on it or storing things decoratively in it too. However I used it for what its meant for...a good fire in a safe pit that looks great while it does the job. I recommend this firepit.. if I had anything to say I might wish for the legs to be slightly higher on it but for where I have it sitting the area below is not getting too hot and is in no way a fire hazard. This is a beautiful piece to own and enjoy. The copper will discolor but that is to be expected when you use any copper item with heat. It looks beautiful and accents the garden environment its set in on a concrete/sand floor in a wonderful way.
B000HX2DGE This copper 'kettle' fireplace is perfect size for our patio.  I have been thinking of building a brick or stone fireplace on the patio, but I like being able to move this one when I want.  It holds plenty of wood for a decent sized fire and seems sturdy enough (and the copper is thick enough) to handle the weight of the wood.  There are just a couple things you should be aware of:1) There are no drain holes in the bottom of it, so when you are not using it, you will either need to keep it covered (with the supplied vinyl cover) or moved under a roof to keep it from filling up with rain/snow.2) It is recommended to put about 1\" of sand in the bottom before you burn anything, to distribute the heat evenly.3) The nice 'copper' color you see in the pictures will never be seen again once you start using it.  Heat will change the color of the copper, as well as normal oxidation -- so you will end up with a brownish-green color as it ages.Regarding #1... I am thinking that this may also be a nice, small little 'patio pond' I could fill with water and put some lily pads and goldfish in.  Some sand or gravel on the bottom would anchor the plants, or just leave in their pots.  The only issue would be if you live in a cold climate, the fish and plants would have to be relocated if the water could freeze solid.
B000HX2DGE For the most part, I really like this fire pit, but there were a few drawbacks.Pros:1. Assembly was really non-existent.  The copper bowl just sits in the legs and, viola, it's assembled!  I have another fire pit that required legs to be screwed on, handles to be put on, was missing screws, etc., so this is a big bonus.2. The hammered bowl is beautiful.  I didn't have any issues with dents in mine at all.3. The entire fire pit is bigger than I thought it would be.  For some reason, I expected something smaller in diameter and was thrilled when it arrived and was bigger.4. LOVE the cover.  It has thick elastic and it big enough to tightly cover the entire copper bowl.  If take care of, this will eliminate the water getting into the bowl which is a big problem I've had with other fire pits.5. It is heavy, in my opinion, which makes moving it around hard, but will also keep it in place when the wind blows.  I'd rather have it stay in place!Cons:1. I agree with those who said the screen didn't fit perfectly.  It's almost like either it or the bowl aren't completely round.  I can make the screen pop into place, but for the price, this should be an exact fit.  I read the other reviews complaining that the screen rusted.  I haven't had the pit long enough to see if that is an issue for me or not, but I'll update if it is.2. I wish I had come with a poker.  Again, for the price, the user shouldn't have to buy an extra accessory to tend to the fire.Overall, it is a very beautiful fire pit and would be a great addition to any patio.EDITED 6/9/2013I changed this from four stars down to three.  The weather finally got good and I was able to actually use this pit for a fire.  While it worked perfectly, it is no longer a pretty fire pit.  At first, I thought all the discoloration was because it needed to be cleaned out, but after a thorough scrubbing, it looks awful on the inside and outside.  I added a photo for you to see, but it's in the main photo lineup.
B000HX2DGE This is the fourth fire pit we've owned over the past several years and by far, our favorite. First and foremost - NO SETUP! You simply take out three pieces (bowl, cover, stand) and you're done. Thought it doesn't seem like a fire pit would require much time/effort to assemble, the last one drove us nuts since it had poor instructions.The bowl on this pit is HUGE and deep. We like it! The hammered copper is beautiful, though a little thinner than I expected. The fire pit sits low to the ground. Don't know if that matters or not, but it's worth mentioning. We always put an inch or so of sand in the bottom to help prolong fire pit's longevity.Other reviewers have mentioned the mesh cover melts/rusts, but we never use ours when a fire is burning - only when it's smoldering or when we're covering it up. I don't know why you'd put the mesh top on while the fire is raging. Maybe I'm missing something there. Our lid fits just fine. The cover is nice, esp since it has elastic. Like most covers, I don't see it lasting long. We never have any cover last more than 2-3 years in the hot Iowa summers.So far, we're very pleased and this is our favorite fire pit out of all the four we've owned. We hope to have it for many years!
B000HX2DGE This fire pit looks very nice. I haven't got a lot of use out of it yet, but as the weather gets nicer and we spend more time outside around this fire pit I will update the review. We have not had this very long so I can not comment on any wear so far. It is nice to look at though and I am very pleased with it so far.
B000HX2DGE Can't say how much I love this fire pit.  It's beautiful and durable and comes with a nice fire screen.  The bowl is deep and the copper is quite nice.  It makes a lovely accent piece in any backyard, deck, and/or patio.  The cover is convenient to have in case you're in an area that doesn't allow open fires because it contains it without distracting from the design.  Really nice addition.  Almost gave it away as a gift...glad I didn't.
B000HX2DGE As other reviewers have stated, assembly on this fire pit is extremely easy. Base, copper bowl, and cover, that is all there is to it. As far as the aesthetic aspect of the fire pit, it goes very well with all different kinds of brick patios, and looks absolutely amazing on our reddish hued brick patio. In terms of functionality, the fire pit itself works great and the bowl is very deep, allowing you to fill it with a great deal of firewood to keep the flames burning for quite some time. The cover fits nicely, and as other reviewers have stated, should only be put on when the fire is smoldering or completely out. If you are looking for a stylish fire pit and are willing to spend a bit extra for aesthetic purposes, this is a great fire pit to pick up as it really stands out and makes a fine decorative piece for our brick patio.
B000HX2DGE This is beautiful!  Everyone loved it. We were blessed with a cool night and we were able to use it.The bowl holds plenty of wood to make a decent size fire.  One big enough to actually put out some warmth and help keep the mosquitoes down.The bowl does sit kind of low to the ground. I thought it would heat and damage the cement by the pool but it was fine.The mesh cover is nice to keep the sparks down but it does discolor once it gets hot.  I would suggest not using it while you have really big flames.Love the cover to keep the water out when it's raining.  Better than hauling it out or having to dump it when it rains.
B000HX2DGE This fire pit is not only beautifully rustic but incredibly useful. We immediately had a fire after it arrived and as the colors on the copper started to change it was fun to watch. The fire pit did arrive dented and the box was fairly worn looking, but the dent popped right out and it looks fine. It sits really low to the ground so we did place ours on a pallet to raise it just a bit, to more appropriate height for our needs. The cover is really nice, it has elastic around the edge so you can secure it to the fire pit, and it is fairly thick. My husband liked the size of this pit since you can use larger logs and still cover it with the screen, and we also burned some cardboard in it so we didn't have to try to fit it in a can for trash pick up. Over all we love this fire pit and would recommend it to everyone.
B000HX2DGE Up front, I want to note that this \"portable fire pit\" will do what it says it will do. However, it could have been designed infinitely better.After having spent a lifetime at camping in the outdoors all over the country, and having earned my college degree in Parks and Recreation (which includes maintenance and design), and serving for 25 years as a park ranger/park manager, I can honestly say that I actually know a great deal about every sort of fire device which has ever been contrived. In fact, I have designed several myself.Here we have a solid copper bowl, a steel three-legged support, a wire cover/screen, and a vinyl rain cover for when the unit is cool and not in use. The idea here is to build a fire in the bowl so that folks can sit around it, roast a few marshmallows or hot dogs on a stick, and enjoy the evening. You can do that. The company recommends that you put sand in the bottom of the bowl and I wholly agree with that. Here are my issues:1. The copper is too thin. A really hot fire could potentially weaken the walls and possibly melt through over time (hence the sand in the bowl helps to alleviate this problem but I still would much limit the size/heat of the fire.)2. The feet on the tripod support are entirely too small at the base. If you have the weight of sand and firewood in the bowl and the ground is soft, this thing is going to sink. If it sinks on one side only, this could cause some difficulties, depending upon how you are using the unit. I think it's also too flimsy. So you're probably going to need to set this up on some thin bricks if you plan to use this in your yard, (especially if you plan to use the same spot all the time.)3. There are no air vents in the bowl. (This may have been an intentional design feature to keep the fire from getting too hot.)4. Cleaning out the ashes, (without taking your sand with it), is somewhat of a hassle, a very slow and dirty project. This, I might add, is a problem with almost all campfire rings and fire pits. You MUST remove ashes after use because they are caustic and, (especially if water gets in the bowl), the bowl will deteriorate.There are other minor issues but those are the four chief drawbacks as I see them. I would characterize the u
B000HX2DGE I have not had my fire pit long enough to know whether it will stand the test of time, but here's what I can say.1) The box says that some assembly is required. The \"assembly\" consists of putting the three-legged base on the ground, putting the copper bowl into it, and putting the grate on top of the bowl. Easy. There's also a tarp with an elastic band to put over the cover. It fits snugly.2) This is a solid and heavy set. The base appears to be cast iron, and the copper bowl is sturdy. Granted, years of use might weaken the bowl, but for now, it's good.3) The height of the top of the bowl, once it's in the stand, is about 12 inches. The diameter is about 2 1/2 feet, and the depth is around ten inches. (Thus, the bottom of the bowl is only about two inches above the ground.)I don't plan to use this often, and I therefore expect it to last quite a while. Still, having looked at other reviews, I'm aware that some have claimed that the screen wears out quickly. I don't know that I'd use the screen over the fire all of the time. The lowness of the base of the bowl and the fact that the rim of the bowl is only a foot off the ground suggest that it would not be wise to leave this unattended for long around anything that can burn. With a low fire, though, and observation, I think there isn't a need to keep the screen on at all times.For now, I am thrilled with this.
B000HX2DGE This hammered copper fire pit really looks nice. I am sure as it ages it will develop the classic copper patina. I really like how deep the pot is. I can put a lot of wood in it and it burns for hours. The copper will not rust, just develop a dark patina. It should last for a very long time. I suggest that every season, you wire brush the screen lid, then spray paint it with high heat resistant black grill paint. I do this with my other fire pit and the lids last for at least 5 years.
B000HX2DGE The fire pit's pretty nice. It arrived quickly and safely with no damage.  Unpacked and was ready for a fire in minutes.  It's deep and well built and it does have the screen.  However ~  be advised that the screen that comes with it will rust and rust very quickly.  I have a black fire pit with this same type screen and the screen is long gone because of rust.  In addition, the copper looks great NOW...but if you're really going to use it as intended (and not an an ornament) it won't be long and you'll loose the pristine look.Another selling point is that it's portable.  I'm not sure I know anyone that will want to transport a used firepit in their car.  Maybe if you have a truck...and portability does make it easier to empty but there is no \"quick\" cover for this thing.  At night, should it start rainging and you need to leave the fire - you can't very well put the tarp cover over it and there is no solid lid so the rain mixes with your burnt offerings and you have a mess.If you really want a fire pit that useful and long lasting - build one.  If you're in the country and fortunate enough to have large rocks at your fingertips, use them and stack to make a pit.  If not, you can use brick or cinder blocks.  Sure they aren't as pretty as a shiny copper penny but neither will this pit after a short time.$250 bucks can get you a sturdy, stable pit for backyard parties (it just doesn't come out of a box).
B000HX2DGE Right out of the box you can tell this is a quality fire pit with a nice copper finish that will add to any decor.  It is easy to set up, just take the tub and put it into the frame and you are ready for use.  It even comes with its own screen and a cover to protect it from weather when it is not in use.  This pit is deep and wide which will allow you to fill it up and let the fire go awhile without worrying about putting a new log in.  The pit is a bit low to the grown but I have not noticed any damage to the ground underneath it yet.  This fire pit was everything I had hoped for.
B000HX2DGE We put a fire in this pit for the first time last night-- the temp dipped down to 18 degrees and it was nice to enjoy a clear night but stay warm.The copper pit is extremely attractive and the frame that holds it is both attractive and stable. We burned the fire for about 45 minutes and then decide to move it farther away from a nearby tree and found we could pick it up by the wrought iron if we used kitchen mitts. It does get pretty hot so you'd definitely want to keep it on brick or sand.The lid fit snugly and was a nice safety feature with the pitchy wood we burned throwing off tons of sparks. The fact that the handle is directly above the flame might not be the handiest design, but I'm not sure where else they could have put it.This unit looks nice just sitting out on my brick patio but it looked really great with a fire burning.After the first fire the outside of the copper tub has turned the most beautiful oranges, yellows and reds. It really does look beautiful just sitting out on the patio.
B000HX2DGE CobraCo's hand-hammered copper fire pit will be an attractive addition to nearly any outdoor setting. The copper color of the fire tub is warm and inviting. It's hand-hammered and uncoated, which gives the tub a rustic appearance that fits with the outdoors. As a result, the tub will discolor and weather naturally over time. After just our first fire it lost the copper color and took on a darker appearance with some spots of copper showing through. Also, after only the first use, the screen cover started rusting - a natural process I'm sure, but thought buyers would want to know.As a family who enjoys frequently roasting marshmallows, reading stories, talking, and entertaining around an outdoor fire, this fire pit is a great addition for gathering people around an outdoor hearth. The pit's design and look will complement most any decor. The pit is deep enough to hold a good amount of wood.No assembly is required. The pit must be used over a non-flammable surface such as slate, tile, brick, or stone. It measures 30 inches wide by 19 inches high with the cover. The set includes a sturdy stand, the fire pit, a screen cover, and a protective vinyl cover.
B000I1BX7U All of the local birds I've been feeding for years seem to like this seed.  Mixed with additional sunflower seed keeps the feeders active.
B000I1BX7U The birds and squirrels love this food. I had a variety of animals coming up to eat the food. It is exactly as described.
B000I1BX7U The seed has a lot of filler.  Not sure it's worth the money.
B000I1BX7U Some time ago I wrote a glowing review about this seed but the last batch was sub-par at best. There was almost no sunflower in the mix and the sunflower seeds that were there were small and dried up. The main ingredient was millet. I'm very disappointed.
B000I1BX7U I have been using this product for years.  There are products out there that some birds like a bit better, but this product seems to keep them coming back.  I like the price as compared to other products.  I have found it to about the same price as I have found at other large box stores in my local area, but with free shipping, it has saved me the trip and hassle.
B000I1BX7U Almost before we could walk away from the feeders, the birds came and feasted on them. The convenience of having these heavy bags of seeds delivered to our door is a true blessing. The bags are heavy. The seed assortment is great and have attracted mourning doves, cardinals, finches, and other birds we have yet to identify. The feders give pleasure to the birds and provide us with nature's entertainment.
B000I1BX7U This must be about 75% brown seeds, which for some reason our wild birds wont eat. So the price is great if your birds like this stuff but unfortunately ours don't and it just gets thrown out of the feeder.
B000I1BX7U Great value!  All types of birds enjoy this mixture.
B000I1BX7U No complaints !  The birds like it- I've seen cardinals, chickadees, wrens, sparrows, doves, and a chipmunk on the ground taking leftovers. Everybody is happy.  The only problem is the hawk that comes along, trying to eat the birds :/
B000I1BX7U I was wary about buying bird seed online because I was worried it wouldn't be fresh and  was unsure if the birds would like it.  I took the chance and am glad that I did.  The birds have loved the seed and it has helped attract them to our yard.  It is also a great value for the price and amount.  I stored this in an air tight container I bought on amazon and it has stayed fresh and been great.
B000I1BX7U I chose this 5 star rating because a little birdie said he and all his feathered friends really like it.
B000I1BX7U my backyard birds are picky about the grain in this mix and no birds touch the sunflower seeds which seem to be most of the mix in this bag of seeds. I have to dump out the feeder to toss the sunflower seeds and will not buy it again as it does not work for my needs to feed my wild birds.
B000I1BX7U I do not buy fancy bird food - sunflower seeds and generic seed and mealworms. I usually get it at the grocery store for around this price but with one snowstorm on top of another it was hard to get to the store so I ordered it from Amazon (I have Prime - thank Somebody). I have about 14 regular doves, several bluejays, a couple of pairs of cardinals, a small flock of starlings and innumerable junkos, sparrows and finches and one practically tame robin who gets the mealworms. Keep in mind, everything is still covered in snow, ice really, and they do not eat this.So this one star review is from my birds and who have given this feed The Bird.
B000I1BX7U I just put some out and already got a beautiful American yellow finch, and a few bluejays.  Am anxious to see what else gets here. And of course the sparrows love it.
B000I1BX7U The seed looks to be of superior quality.  I did not find any stems or other non edible items.  The price is very reasonable for 40 pounds of bird seed and the birds love it.
B000I1BX7U This food was sort of ok. The birds brushed alot of it aside.I now buy Wagner's 62059 Greatest Variety Blend - it's more expensive but better quality and the birds clearly prefer it.
B000I1BX7U As long as the birds are happy with it.Seems to be a little heavy with millet though it makes a good addition with a Kaytee style brand of w-bird feed,like finch-food mixture for example.
B000I2Z5C8 I opened the box to find a cart that wasn't likely to carry much more than a \"Town and Country\" children's riding wagon.I was hoping for something bigger. Oh well, I thought--this is probably all the garden wagon I can expect to get for under a hundred dollars.But I'm liking it more and more now that it's assembled and in use.As I unpacked it I realized the running gear--frame, wheels, tow bar--are very beefy. If the plastic tub ever splits or cracks to a point where I can't use it anymore, I'm sure I could build an even bigger tub out of plywood and reuse all the rest of the parts. In fact the wagon may be worth the purchase price just to get all those parts.Assembly was a bit difficult. It wasn't that it was complicated. It's just that many of the bolts had very shallow heads and very shallow standard screwdriver slots to match. I couldn't seem to find a screwdriver that would stay securely in the slots while I tightened the nuts. I wound up using the edge of a bricklaying trowel to hold some of them.Even with that little annoyance I had the cart together with tires inflated and ready to roll in under two hours.I use a 6-foot ratcheting tie-down strap to expand the wagon's load capacity. I stack branches and sticks in lengthwise in the wagon tub and pile them as high as I can. Then I wrap the strap around sticks, tub, and all, and tighten it down--just enough to snug the load.The wagon rides very well over our uneven property. And because of the long tow handle and steering front wheels it tracks extremely well behind our riding mower. It's like it's following on rails. It doesn't cut corners and run over things when making turns close to something.The swing-away handles on the tow bar are a real nice addition for those times when you'd rather pull the cart around by hand instead of hooking it to a mower or yard tractor. The cart's dumping feature works very well also.What I thought would be disappointing turned out to be something I'm very happy with. It may be a light duty wagon, but I'm certain I'll get a lot of use out of it.
B000I2Z5C8 High quality cart.  I've moved many loads of dirt, rocks, bricks & mulch with this cart and it hasn't yet suffered any damage and continues to function well.  That kind of surprised me as the plastic container at first appeared fragile, but that hasn't proven to be the case.  Moving everything I've moved with a wheel barrow would have been a much bigger chore.The cart also works as a great child mover, i.e. my little son loves taking a ride in it.Two nits, one is when you dump a load, it still leaves about 5% of the load in the cart, so you have to pick up the cart in order to get it \"all\" out.The second is a small joke and that is the cart is well made lacks a back up beeping function, similar to what you'd hear from a large truck.  :-)
B000I2Z5C8 Three years later this cart is going strong. I have used it to haul mulch, garden waste, etc. It is an essential component to my garden.
B000I2Z5C8 While I'd never put 600 lbs into this cart, it's a wonderful cart for about 100 lbs.  The four wheels maneuver easily, and pulling the cart around is a breeze.With the way that the handle is situated, you can easily pull it with both hands behind you.  Or one hand, whichever you prefer.  Unlike a standard wheelbarrow, the four wheels support a lot of the weight.I use my cart to clean horse stalls, so the plastic bin is perfect.  It's been left out in the rain countless times and nothing is rusting.I've had this cart for a few months now and am extremely pleased with it. I would have liked flat-free tires, but for the price, it's a great little unit.Based on the daily use it gets, I think that this cart will easily last me a year--maybe two.
B000I2Z5C8 I use this cart a lot more than I thought I would.  I typically buy a lot of products at a nationwide wholesale club (Sams), and I use this cart to wheel all the food and etc in from the driveway to the kitchen.  It works great.I also posted a picture of us using the cart during an extensive shower repair, and it hauled broken concrete just fine.I had my doubts about the dumping mechanism, but it works well. The back wheels \"scoot\" forward, and I was worried that they would not when I was using it on uneven terrain.  But it works fine.I have played with the reversible handle, but haven't actually used it.  its an interesting design, the handle is on a pivot and spins.  At the top you pull it by hand, remove 2 cotter pins and spin it 180 and it can be towed.  Haven't actually used that feature.The only thing I would add is something that kept the handle \"up\" because it falls too readily.I have used this cart in more ways than the average person (hauling goods, construction, and gardening).  And I can tell you that its really quite good.  Maybe its not perfect for you, but it will be good enough for most people.  Well worth the money.
B000I2Z5C8 Although I could have gotten this for about 20.00 less at a local store, I'd have had no way to get it home, so I ordered it from Amazon. Within days it was delivered to my door and a short time later it was out of the box and assembled without difficulty.I do a lot of yard work, about 100 square feet worth of vegetable 'square foot gardening' as well as my large flower garden, and various improvement projects. I wanted some sort of wagon to help with hauling stepping stones, tree clippings, loads of freshly mixed planting soil and so on. This gorilla cart has been a fabulous work mate! It's sturdy and strong, the wheels roll easily over uneven ground, they turn on a dime for excellent maneuverability, and best of all is the dump feature!!Oh how I love that dump feature! Just pull the leaver in front and lift up a bit on the bed. The back wheels fold inward allowing you to dump the load exactly where you want it. What a marvelous design! Why didn't someone think of that sooner?!This cart has made yard work sooooo much easier! When I need to replant any of my many many large pots, I just carry them in the cart over to the potting table rather than in my arms.Large bag of trash or yard clipping to go out? Save your back and just tote it in your cart just as easy as you please.Putting in a new walkway with pavers? Unload the stones from your trunk into the cart and transport them to the yard easily with no sore muscles afterwards.Don't scratch your arms all over while moving trimmed tree branches, just load them on your Gorilla Cart and haul them away.I even use my cart to haul things from the house to the shed and vice-versa.This cart has a 600 pound capacity, good sized tires that run easily over rough terrain, slick and easy dump ability, and for those who have a lawn tractor this carts handle converts to connect for towing. This is such a fabulous idea, it's tough, it's versatile, very functional, and fun! My Gorilla cart has quickly become my favorite yard tool! I Love It!
B000IGGFEQ I bought these suet cakes for winter feeding.  A few of the songbirds will feed on it but the woodpeckers don't seem to care for it. The deer love it.
B000IGGFEQ The winged ones as well as the un really enjoy these cakes.These are eaten up a lot quicker than those grocery store ones.
B000IGGFEQ I was hoping that I had found an inexpensive alternative to the more expensive suet cakes available locally but these are just not very well made. They are mushy and flaky. Also they don't seem to attract the birds as well as other suet cakes that I have purchased in the past.
B000IGGFEQ Great suet.  Birds seem to love it and it's easy to open.  A good price for what you get.
B000IGGFEQ Perhaps these are a little smaller than some suet cakes but the quality of this product seems to be very high. These cakes attract so many birds to my feeder I feel like my backyard is now a scene from Animal Planet. I keep my binoculars on the table to enjoy the endless viewing and activity at the feeder. It's like having bird TV! I have learned that the packages are a little difficult to peel off so simply keep a sharp knife or box cutter handy when opening the protective top layer. Then sit back and enjoy the show.
B000IGGFEQ I was surprised when I opened a cake to smell artificial blueberry. I don't like it but the birds don't seem to mind! However, the jays and blackbirds figured out how to land on the cage feeder, scaring away the nuthatches and titmice, so I took it down for awhile to see if I could break them of the habit (or wait out the season).Nov 2013: I've put it back up for winter. True the cakes weigh less than other brands, but the thinner cakes will allow me to force-fit two at a time into my single feed cage. That means I need to fill it less often too!
B000IGGFEQ My rating is based on the opinions of assorted birds.  They never leave a crumb of this stuff in the suet holder on the bird feeder.  Must be good !!
B000IGGFEQ We have a suet holder which can handle four cakes at once.  We put four in, about six weeks ago, and they are not even half-gone yet.  Is it that the birds don't like this suet?  Is it because it's not yet true winter and they don't need it?  I can't tell.  I'll come back and review this at the end of December to see whether they've eaten any more.
B000IGGFEQ I keep these out for the birds year round, I feel like it's only fair to feed them since our species has taken so much territory away from the wildlife.  I've had some they seem to eat faster, but they're on it daily and I need a new one out about every two weeks.
B000IGGFEQ These suet cakes are a good deal for the money.  I use several per week as I live in the woods and have 4 different types of woodpeckers who just love this stuff.  Other birds visit the suet feeders as well.
B000JF8LSY I love very simple products that just works.  This laundry hamper is very practical, ingenious, and very easy to use.  It is tall enough that it can carry a lot of laundry.  The outside is made of strong canvass-like fabric while inside is a smooth blue liner that is easy to clean.When you don't need it, it is easy to fold and stash in very little space.Absolutely love it.  I will buy three more if it goes down again to how much I paid it for (under ten bucks).
B000JF8LSY This was a great find! A hamper that holds a full load, wipes out easily, and folds flat for storage. I paid $13 on Amazon, but found it cheaper at a local store for $8 after I placed my order.This item  placed in a bathroom for towels would be perfect, as it has a nylon liner that would resist mildew and can be sprayed with Lysol and/or wiped out with disinfecting wipes. I could also see carrying one in your car for multiple uses such as carrying the kids' sports gear, taking cans to the recycler's,  winter road trip supplies, or carrying several bags of groceries in from the car after a trip to the market.The product seems sturdy, but I'd not put more than 25-30 pounds max in it as the whole container is made of canvas.Narrow enough to use in tight spaces, but also tall enough to have good capacity. I will be buying more of these foldable laundry hampers and suggest you buy them too!
B000JF8LSY You know I've actually spent the last 30 years using a black hamper, so it's a bit of a shock to the system (seriously!) that I'm now using a white one!  This one is a lot heavier than my older one, and a little taller, but the good news is that it holds more clothes.  Not that it matters in the least- I'm not the kind of person to wait until it's completely full to wash my clothes anyway.  Not my style.  I highly recommend it.
B000JF8LSY recommended, sturdy and at a good price point. Looks fairly nice, I would get another one. this is a nice hamper.
B000JF8LSY These are great hampers.  I do not use them to carry clothes up and down the stairs to the washer.  I bought three of them and pre-sort the clothes as they get dirty.  There is a little corner of the room where they sit, and they don't look half bad.  I love them!
B000JF8LSY I am a single guy who goes to the gym 6 to 7 days a week. This hamper is great! I put my many sweat towels in there as well as gym clothes. It's durable but lightweight so you can just take all of the clothes to the washing machine easily (open handles on two sides). It comes with a square blue portion to lay on the bottom to add stability. This thing fits great in my walk-in closet and is a bargain for this price. I do recommend these to anyone. I may get another one for additional clothes now.
B000JF8LSY My last, mostly cloth hamper disintegrated after less than two years. With this item, I immediately noticed it was of better contruction and I expect it to last a while.What I like about it is that it feels solid (in whatever way a hamper can!). It appears it is constructed of a pressed paper-board with a cloth covering. The handles and edges have a nice lining on them that will inhibit fraying over time. Overall, it looks and feels like it will retain it's shape for a while.Sure, these things will not last forever, but this particular item seems to have better construction than others I have had.
B000JF8LSY I like my laundry hampers to be easily accessible, which means I need them to be 'out' and not in a closet. I have 2 kids and need them to be sturdy and easy to carry.This hamper does it all. The canvas colored outside is simple, not flashy and sleek. The blue vinyl-type inside adds just a splash of color, is easily wiped down and prevents leakage should I have a damp cloth in there.There are handles cut out of the sides that can become a bit uncomfortable if the hamper becomes too heavy. But the handles are also sturdy. The flexibility makes it easy to put as much in it as I need, since it isn't rigid.I love that they collapse, should I not need all 3 that I bought at any given time. Thus far, they are rating 5 stars!I will fully admit to being a little nervous about their longevity. The sides are seemingly made of heavy duty cardboard covered with canvas. For now, there is no indication that they will fall apart. But for the price, I can't say that its not worth it.
B000JF8LSY Nice hamper fore nice price. Love that it folds to put away when empty. Better quality than expected and easy to clean.
B000JF8LSY We destroy laundry hampers in this house. Literally, destroy. this one is holding up very well. It is very sturdy and attractive. It has a large capacity and at capacity (slightly overflowing =D) will fill 3 washloads. It pops open and is held open by the bottom piece which you slide in the hamper and fit in place. It isn't machine washable but I have wiped it down with a washcloth, no problem. The inside gets a spray of Lysol when emptied. No more fumbling with bags or hampers that fall apart. This is sturdy and my kids no longer have a problem getting clothes in the basket. Perfect hamper.
B000JF8LSY We purchased two of these to use as laundry hampers in bedrooms, and they do the job very well. They have a small enough footprint so as not to take up too much room, and their height works well to store a week's worth of laundry easily.The handles make it easy to carry and for those that have to transport them to a Laundromat or laundry room in a dorm or apartment building, the foldability is a nice feature as well.
B000JF8LSY I own four of these,all purchased from Amazon over the past 3 years. They are great foldables, probably the best out there, and offer superb value for the price but they are not without room for improvement. Comments below:PROS- Heavyweight, sturdy design- Inner lining is perfect waterproof nylon- Completely foldable so they lay flat- Really good value for the priceCONS- Outer canvas shell is off-white color, very hard to clean- Outer canvas shell is canvas material, very hard to clean- Outer bottom is also canvas white, gets dirty very quicklyBottom line, this would have been the perfect product had Rubbermaid used a synthetic, easier to clean material for the out shell and added some nylon or rubber reinforcements to the bottom so it doesn't get dirty so quick and can withstand for wear such as getting dragged around the floor. Small changes would have yielded big results.
B000JF8LSY Holds tons of laundry, and isn't heavy.  Important as our laundry is a block away from where we stash our dirty clothes.
B000JF8LSY I ordered these hampers after reading the reviews and being lucky enough to catch them on a deal of the day for nearly 8 a piece.  They are NOT 61 inches as the description states, rather 24 inches high and a perfect square shape; or atleast I assume.They are foldable into a flat board and easily stored away into a closet, under a bed, or behind a couch.  The cream/beige color is visually appealing and can fit into many decor types.  I like the fact that the inside is a waterproof, wipe-down surface.  I would say the best feature would have to be the handle cut-outs on the side making them a cinch to carry out from the bathroom to the kitchen for laundry day.We are a family of five and I happy very pleased to report that these hold our whole load, where laundry bags wouldn't.  We use the other one to hold all the various toys thrown throughout our apartment.We like the fact that they can bend because we have placed ours behind our bathroom door.  There is no fear of hearing that \"THUMP\" sound everytime some slams the door into it because it is soft and bends.Wonderful purchase... just not at the higher price point.
B000JRDX8U I can't imagine an easier way to plant and grow just about anything. I bought 4 Earth boxes and they are all doing well.Even though it isn't necessary, I soaked the seeds and then planted them in a heated, self-watering seed tray. I believe they would have done well if I had just tossed them in the Earthbox and added water. LOL.After my seeds sprouted I transferred them to the Earth Box, trying very hard to follow the instructions carefully. The instructions say not to deviate from what they advise, so I tried hard to do it their way.  Amazingly, everything is growing beautifully! The tomatoes, lettuce, carrots, radishes or radish, because I think I was skeptical and only planted one, but it grew and I harvested it. &lt;grin> I also have squash and cucumbers that are growing happily.These can be used outside or inside, or both since they are on wheels. They do get heavy when full of soil and water though, so even though they are portable, that portability is limited.My creative tendency came out and even though I followed the instructions to the best of my ability, I wanted to push the limits. I enclosed my porch with plexiglass and turned it into a greenhouse so I can grow things in months they aren't supposed to grow. My Earthboxes are in the greenhouse, FULL of growing plants, and it's one of the coldest, iciest Winters Oklahoma City has ever had on record. So, I had to learn how to pollinate some of these plants. Time will tell if the squash responded to my first attempt at pollinating with a soft brush, as I read you are supposed to do when there are no bees available. I'm extremely happy with my Earthboxes. I may buy more. I plan to put them outside when the weather allows. Then I'll try to follow the more \"traditional\" rules that sane gardeners follow.  :)Edited to say that I have bought more. They are full of healthy growing plants and I may even get more Earthboxes for my collection. Some will go out as soon as Winter is over.
B000JRDX8U I have quite a few earthboxes and I'm always ready to add more.  Many years ago, before I discovered Earthboxes, I purchased a couple of simiar, but different planters from another source.  Those original planters used a heavy capillary mat to wick water into the soil.  The capilary mat support eventually collapsed, but the planters are still being used today by my neighbor.  I rigged up a support by poking holes in an inverted inexpensive litter tray and placing a brick under the center to support the weight of the soil and plants.I've found Earthboxes to be superior to those original planters and would be lost in our hot, unforgiving summers without them.  Although I have a few raised beds, they never produce as well as veggies I grow in earthboxes.We still have many of the older ones without casters that are difficult to move, but the newer ones with casters are a dream come true.  Now I can roll the maters under some shelter from the scorching sun or position plants as needed to assist nature.Being able to fill the reservior instead of time-consuming, labor intesive watering duty cuts down on stress the plants experience and saves me time.Not having to weed endlessly makes gardening a pleasure.My neighbor and I have both found many methods to replace the elastic covers instead of endlessly purchasing them.You can purchase dolomite or lime from any garden center, look for deals on good granular plant food and use trash bags or other methods to cover the planters when the covers wear out.The planters keep right on going, year after year.Periodically replacing or refreshing the potting soil is beneficial, but aside from the original purchase, the cost of gardening with them goes down over time.The fact that it makes it easier and more pleasant to grow more of your own fresh veggies is reason enough to consider them.  Some people build supports to hold them off the ground making it easier to tend.Note on homemade EBs.  Been there, done that.  Several years ago, we put together quite a few homemade earthboxes using instructions on the internet.  We used large tote boxes and they worked fine for a couple of seasons.The materials just don't hold up.  After a couple of years of baking in the sun, they began to crack if you tried to move them.  Then they would crack or crumble if you bumped them.  We had to toss all of the homemade EBs and clean up the mess.  They were cheaper than purchasing new EBs, but not so cheap in the long run because they don't last.Some of my earthboxes are quite a few years old and holding up just fine.I wish too that they were less expensive, but considering how durable they are, they're still worth it.
B000JRDX8U First time I have ever planted anything, I bought 3 Earthboxes. So far after 5 weeks I have had good results. In the first box I have planted 2 tomatoes (one indeterminate, and one determinate variety) the Indeterminant (Early Girl) plant has at least 40 tomatoes in various sizes, it is already over 5 feet tall and is extremely healthy appearing. The determinate plant (Container's Choice) is also very healthy appearing, I have about six visible tomatoes but I expect many more will be appearing soon at the same time as is typical for determinates. Of note the tomatoes that I have grown in normal pots have not done as well. The second box I planted cucumbers they have grown extremely quickly, not too much fruit yet although I think that is because I didn't not properly plan for a trellis. The last box I mixed a squash plant (I have already harvested 2 squash which was great), and peppers plants which have not grown that well but that is probably my fault since the squash plant has blocked sunlight.Overall impressed with the earthbox system, I was able to hook up a 1/4 inch drip irrigation tubing line to the fill holes of the Earthboxes, so twice a day they are filled automatically. I will likely be buying more boxes next season.
B000JRDX8U I have five EB now. I really like them for veggies, esp tomatoes. One box holds one big tomatoe, not two. The EB website forum gets a bit nasty about following the directions perfectly, but I have found them to be guidelines.Hint one, the box can use potting soil,not just soilless mixtures.Two, the fertilizer included may not be enough, extra food can be added after a month or so, tomatoes are big eaters.Three, the plastic cover is not necessary, it just molds here in the NW.Occasional top water & food will not ruin the system.The water tank holds two gallons, and for precise indoor gardening, you will need to make a dip stick.( this number is no where on the website, I hand measured, because I do feed some plants liquied food in the resovir)My one wish is the boxes could be deeper for deep rooted plants.One box has a loose wheel I should have complained about right away. On the subject of wheels, play with all the wheels and make sure the box rolls right before adding weight, I move mine a lot and wish I had fussed with rolling first. Shipping was amazon super speed, and the amazon price hovers around 55 -65$, with shipping and wheels, which is cheaper than the EB website.Happy gardening.
B000JRDX8U Earthbox is design and technology, and they've worked the bugs out.  If you have the desire to grow things, and maybe in an area with limited space, Earthbox will make it happen for you.  Here's some of the pros and cons of the system as I've found it in use:1)  It's relatively expensive.  If what you really want is organic vegetables, don't use an Earthbox.  Go to your local organic grocery and buy organic vegetables.  If what you want is the pleasure of gardening and eating something you grew yourself, and cost is only secondary, Earthbox gets this done with a minimum of hassle.  If you want to grow plants and cost is a primary issue, this isn't the right way either.  Do it in dirt, or hit the Internet and find the free plans for the so-called EarthTainer.2)  Earthbox is a design system for a semi-hydroponic way of growing plants.  Water sits in the bottom of the plastic container in reservoirs, is 'wicked up' by the growing medium, grabs on to dolomite lime and fertilizer (placed in during the assembly of the box) on the way up, and then hits the plant roots, which absorb it.  This leads to a few simple principles:2a)  Your growing medium must love water (i.e., be hygroscopic).  The right thing to use is Canadian sphagnum peat moss.  This is expensive and gets more so if you have the Earthbox company ship it to you; try your local garden supply store.  Coconut coir is another option that replaces, and is significantly cheaper than, sphagnum peat; I haven't tried it.2b)  Your growing medium must allow enough air to get at the roots.  Roots have to breathe.  Therefore, I roll my own growing medium of 2 parts sphagnum to 1 part perlite.  I do not use vermiculite because I have no wish to breathe asbestos, which you pretty much have to do if you empty out a bag of vermiculite.2c)  Plants need nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium to grow properly, as well as miniscule amounts of trace minerals.  They also like a certain pH, and to get that you need dolomite lime.  Any non-soluble fertilizer will do; try not to pay a lot of money for it.  Also, soluble fertilizers, while not recommended, will work, because, remember, this semi-hydroponic system is all about moving water to the roots.  Use of soluble fertilizers removes the idiot proofing, because soluble fertilizers can burn roots or leaves if you get the concentrations wrong.3)  The replaceable covers are actually a pretty important part of the system.  They reflect light, keep an even soil temperature both daytime and night, keep bugs out of the growing medium, stop water from transpiring off the surface of the medium, and are treated with fabric softener sheets against static cling.  All those things are important.  They smell like Bounce.  If you live in a warm area, white side up; in a cooler place, black side up.4)  The casters are a nice touch because the box is a two-person job to move once it's full and wet.  You don't have to buy them from Earthbox; you can get a set of casters cheap at any hardware store.5)  If the kind of plant you're growing isn't listed, compare the average size of your mature plant to the recommended list of plants.  Large leafy plants are best approximated by tomatoes; Earthbox recommends two to a plant.6)  Although backyard and patio are the recommended uses, I've also found these boxes great for greenhouses and growlight conditions.  Yields are pretty high.7)  The fill pipe fits a 5/8\" hose perfectly, which is a nice touch.  You can make a simple system out of a wine cork and painted baling wire to tell you how full your Earthbox is today.  This involves taking a straight 18\" of baling wire, impaling a wine cork with it, and putting the cork down the pipe until it floats.  Labeling the wire with paint or tape is left as an exercise for the reader!In short, if you want to do semi-hydroponic container gardening and have success right out of the box, get an Earthbox.
B000JRDX8U I can kill a plant by driving past the nursery. Even mint shrivels when I cast my one good eye upon it.  Until I discovered the Earthbox, the only thing growing on my patio was some kind of nasty looking grayish bump that I am praying does not house wasps.  It's small, dark gray, about the size of a hand and in the corner of the overhang. If you know what this is and if it is home to a dangerous insect, please speak up. Now. But to return to the Earthbox.It's not foolproof, you have to put it together and it's not, shall we say, structurally elegant. And after you've put it together, the wheels will fall right off if you lift the box. Getting them back on once you've planted the box requires lots of yelling and a stiff drink.  However, when it comes to growing plants, Boy Howdy, it's a winner.  I planted tomatoes, scotch bonnet peppers and a small anaheim-stye chile in one box.  The other I filled with lavendar, rosemary, basil (also lemon basil and pineapple basil), dill, chives. garlic and oregano.  And almost everything thrived.  The dill got squooshy and just disappeared one day. I think the Oregano ate it. It has that kind of look, the Oregano does.The Earthbox is self-watering and self-feeding, a trick children and houseguests might learn. The boxes are compact and take up very little room. After minimal labor and minimal attention (mostly snipping back the herbs and staking the tomato plants) I harvested tomatoes and peppers all summer long, and the peppers are still going strong. Can I tell you how Mother Earthy it makes you feel to serve a Caprese salad with your own basil and tomatoes! Now I want my own buffalo so I can make the mozarella too! Best of all are the herbs. The lavendar and rosemary scent the air and make sitting on the patio like being in a spa. Well, without the facials, the pedi and the massage. And no fancy robe. Okay, it's not like a spa at all. Get off my back.I'm thinking about adding another two or three Earthboxes and dreaming eggplant, beets, carrots, Sugar snaps, English peas, and pumpkin dreams.  No zucchini though.  You do know that Zucchini is not food. It is a vegetable prank. Anyway, next time you're in Southern California, drop by and say howdy. We're friendy, we are, us country folk.Free tip: Refill a plastic bottle with water, shove the opening (at  about a 45 degree angle) into a large pot or planter. Presto, instant watering system.
B000JRDX8U Last year (2013), I had issues growing 2 Tomato plants in my Earthbox.  The plants were very tall,  healthy looking yet, few tomatoes and most had end-rot.  I watched an Earthbox video on Youtube and they recommended a one time solution for BER.  The solution offered was/is to add Pickling Lime, basically the same as Horticultural Hydrated Lime, /watch?v=6uObcfRWdK0.  It partially worked for me. I think the reason the video says one time fix is because the Lime can change the PH of your soil.  I found myself watering twice a day in the middle of the summer.  If I were to grow Tomato again I would just plant one.  The rectangular shape makes it easy for the wind to knock it over.  At the end of the season I decided to cleaned it out and add new soil. I had between 1/4 to 1/2 inch of roots sitting at the bottom of the water reservoir, it looked like a root carpet.  This year 2014 I'll try Cucumbers instead of Tomatoes and only 2 plants not 4 as recommended. I might as well make use of the trellis I purchase.Alternatives & a little more:  This year I spent 53 bucks out the door for a pre-Manufactured 10.5&#34; Cedar raised bed at Home Depot.  I think that if you have the space it's a much better alternative.  Try to find out if your city has free Compost and take advantage of it to fill your raised bed cheaply.  My personal opinion is that an Earthbox is not a must nor will it necessarily make your life that much easier.  It is nice that you have the watering tube since it can help prevent deceases but, if your careful you can prevent diseases without an Earthbox.  I add mulch to all my Self-watering planters and it helps prevent deceases.  I realize that there might be very special situation where the Earthbox would work best.  For example, if you need a trellis the Earthbox is easy and convenient to setup a trellis but, I'll cost ya' extra.  A good  Earthbox replacement could be as easy as buying a couple of Walmart Mainstays 16.7 inch planter for just $9.97 a piece, they work great.  Another example could be 5 gallon buckets for 2 to 3 bucks a bucket. There are instructions online on how to make Self-watering 5 gallon buckets.  I'm personally using an 18 gallon tote with a 1&#34; hole on the side 3&#34; from the bottom and it work just fine.  I have grown Tomato, onion, Cilantro, Lacinato Kale, Carrots, Marigolds and Lettuce in my Tote. Filled with soil, Coconut Coir, Compost, Vermiculite and it was ready to go. I paid 5.50 for the tote at BigLots.  You can choose the color to adjust for your climate.  It's difficult to get any cheaper, you can even use the lid as a Saucer.  Just make sure you use Food grade plastic 1, 2, 4, and 5.  The Earthbox is tempting cause it looks easy and it's all in one neat package.  My suggestion, fight the temptation and try alternatives first, I wish I had. Happy Gardening!
B000JRDX8U I have an in ground garden area, but it seemed to be hit or miss if my plants grew. And soil preparation and weeding was very time consuming  I read reviews on the Earth box and decided to start with two to see how they would work.  They were easy to set up just by following the short instructions.  I liked that the boxes came with wheels so I could move them as the sun got hotter over the summer.I planted plum tomatoes in one box and bush green beans in the other.  I started both from seeds and when they got big enough, i transplanted them into the boxes.  I put 6 tomatoe plants in one box and 7 bean plants in the other.  You cut a hole in the plastic cover and gently pull the plants through.  That was a little tricky.  I watered every other day by just using the hose to fill the plastic pipe fill hole.  There is a drain in the bottom center so you can tell when it is full.I had more green beans than I have ever grown before.  Although I live in hot Texas, the plum tomatoes are still producing and there are plenty of blossoms.  Normally by this time of the year, my garden is almost dead.  I am thrilled with the yields I have gotten and decided to purchase 2 more boxes and start a fall garden.  These Earthboxes are a great and easy way to garden.  I doubt that I will go back to my in-ground garden.
B000JRDX8U I went all in with 12 boxes my first year using these, mostly for tomatoes. I'm no expert gardener by any means, and last year was the first time I really made an effort at planting a vegetable garden - mostly in overcrowded, regular containers that required constant watering and produced meagerly, but what it did produce had me raving in my own mind about the absolute superiority of home-grown heirloom tomatoes. I thought it would be a step up this year growing in the Earthbox, but flavor-wise, I found it's a step back from even the worst growing conditions in regular soil with regular watering.I readily admit, the plants in my Earthbox have absolutely outgrown anything I put in the ground or regular pot. I planted tomatoes & eggplant in the Earthbox and the ground at the same time, and both Earthbox tomatoes and eggplant are at least four times as large as the ground plants. That is not an overexaggeration (possibly underexaggerating). Fruit-wise, again, the Earthbox plants definitely outproduce the ground plants. The thing is, even though the fruits in the Earthbox are beautiful and big, it tastes watery & weak compared to anything out of the ground. There is a certain earthiness in the flavor of fruits out of the ground that is just not there with the Earthbox. While I was raving about the superiority of home-grown fruits last year with the fruits out of my poorly taken care of containers, this year's fruit out of the Earthbox has me shrugging my shoulders thinking \"at least it's as good as the supermarket stuff\". This may be because the Earthbox plants have unlimited access to water 24/7 so the plants get bloated and watered down. In nature, plants don't drink all the time, and perhaps that's for the best. Unfortunately there's no way to tell a plant to stop absorbing water and concentrate on flavor. If I'm taking the trouble to garden at home, I don't want it to be only \"as good as the supermarket\", I want to be raving about the superiority as I was the year before with the regularly grown stuff, even if the production is less.I'm not throwing out my boxes because of this, nor will I stop growing in them. It's just I wouldn't necessarily recommend this product as the first choice in growing method for crops in which you really want to appreciate the robust taste or subtle flavor differences in various varieties of the plant. I would more recommend this for crops in which depth and subtleness of flavor are not as important (in my case peppers & cucumber), or flowers & other plants you're not growing to eat.All said, this product is still great for producing a large quantity of produce in a small area, as well as allowing novices at gardening to grow plants well, and for that I am grateful.
B000JRDX8U I got my earth box when I moved into my house, the old neighbors left it behind.  I thought it was ugly and was going to chuck it.  I am so glad I did not.  First of all the las vegas soil is more like baked brick and it is near impossible to grow things in the ground. The ground is so hard that I pay someone to dig my holes.  Than you have to water 4 times a day in summer.  The Earth Box is awsome, I fill it with quality soil and plant my tomatoes or peppers, fill it with water and everything just takes off.  In winter I fill it up once a month or so with water and am able to grow things like crazy.  No one believes when I tell them I have tomatoes in my backyard.  As far as quality goes this is a strong plus.  The Vegas summers are brutal and just about everything will get sun fade and crack or melt. My earth box has lasted at least 4 summers and still looks like new.  I am a huge fan of the product and have told everyone that I know to invest in one.  Yes it looks like a cheap plastic box and its appearnce suggests you should pay a couple of bucks for it but believe me it is worth the $50 that it costs.
B000KDZ1VA Now this is a great Injector!  The previous one I bought did not work very well but I really recommend this one.  Made my smoked turkey taste great!
B000KDZ1VA My boyfriend had an injector that he used all the time when making roast chicken. Then, it fell to the bottom of the dishwasher and melted on the heating elements. So for last Christmas, I thought a new one was in order, and picked this one because it's unmeltable!It's easy to use, easy to clean. Heavy duty which is great. Fool proof kitchen gadget that adds so much flavor without adding a lot of fat. We both use it, and I would pick this particular injector all over again if given the choice.
B000KDZ1VA Anybody serious about grilling or smoking should own one of these. One tip is for a liquid such as broth and what not. The other is for a more minced type of marinade. They both work excellent.
B000KDZ1VA this wiill last a very long time it is stainless steel and a very good quality. I will not have to buy another. I am sure we will use it alot
B000KDZ1VA I like to inject pork butt before I cook it so I purchased the Bayou Classic based on the reviews and price. On the whole, it's a well-built device that should last a long time. My only gripe is trying to fill it. The normal way to get the liquid into the device would be the same way you'd fill a medical syringe. However, you need something pretty deep to hold the liquid because the needle has holes that go pretty far up and make loading the injection liquid a bit tough unless all the holes are covered.I got around it by pouring my liquid mix into a deep mixing cup, but I still found it a bit of a pain. Once the liquid is loaded, however, the injection process is excellent. The side holes make this easy to hold and use. The stainless-steel casing keeps it looking good and easy to clean.All in all, it's a good device, but filling it can be a bit of a challenge.
B000KDZ1VA this is a well made heavy duty stainless steal meat injector. this is so much better then the cheap plastic injectors I've been using wished I bought this years ago. the needles are 6\" long & work very well. I don't see any problems with cross threading when putting together like one reviewer have stated I guess it could happen if your not careful. this injector works great just remember to keep the rubber seal oiled I use vegetable oil that way the seal won't roll up and come off. I think this was worth the money I would buy this again.
B000KDZ1VA This injector has not worked for me at all.  I find that it is only really useful for liquid injection and even then, it is difficult to assemble (the parts aren't mechanically perfect) and injecting it into meat such as a chicken breast results in a lot of projectile splatter of the marinade.  Hurray, salmonella on the walls and ceiling!I'm giving it two stars (instead of one) because I hold hope that someone with greater skill could make this thing work wonders for them.  For me, it's a wasted $20.
B000KDZ1VA This seasoning injector was really better than I expected. It is of sturby construction and has a nice \"heft\" to it. I have injected both dry and wet seasonings with it and it has worked flawlessly every time. The needles are nice and long so you can get the seasoning where it needs to go. Clean up is pretty easy as the needles unscrew as shown in the picture. Not worth a start subtraction but worth noting that if your hands are on the small side it may be a little cumbersome, my girlfriend has rather small hands and has noted that this isnt the most comfortable thing to use.
B000KDZ1VA Very sturdy injector.  All metal and no plastic parts!  Easy to clean and use.  I store it in a regular sized ziplock sandwich bag.  Exploded some chicken skin on the first try but it is easy to get the hang of.  Really helps the flavor of chicken when injecting herbs and seasonings under the skin.  Great to use while smoking meats too!  I had no doubt this will last for years to come.  I wouldn't roast a chicken again with out.
B000KDZ1VA works good wit the roasts and birds
B000KDZ1VA I bought this to inject meat that I smoke.It is stainless steel and comes with 2 &#34;needles&#34;.One has 9 small holes, 3 every 120 degrees for injecting liquids.The other is a tube with a tapered point, it is used for chunkier marinades.It is also used for &#34;larding&#34; leaner cuts of meat.Everything comes apart for easy cleanup, but I would not suggest putting the plunger in the dishwasher.The heat will damage the o-ring around the plunger.I will suggest &#34;oiling&#34; the plunger before storing and before use.Coat the o-ring with olive or other cooking oil to keep it supple.Before use, coat the plunger and the inside of the cylinder for smoother operation.Try it &#34;dry&#34; first, then try it oiled and you will see what I'm talking about.
B000KDZ1VA Looking for lasting kitchen tools, this stainless steel injector appears to meet the bill - heavy stock stainless.  I love bbq beef brisket and can now inject the meat and never worry about dryness again.
B000KDZ1VA This is great for injecting liquids into stuff you are going to grill or smoke. It works well, is well made, durable and easy to clean. It also looks impressive.
B000KDZ1VA Adds great flavor to any piece of meat you plan on marinating.  Our family has used it on chicken, beef and planning on pork and turkey.  To use with our smoker outside.
B000KDZ1VA This seasoning injector makes it easy to put in my special marinade into the butt roast that I prepare every year for Little Christmas, now it is so easy, I'll probably make my roast several times a year! It also makes it easy to clean!! Great Item.
B000KL18I2 We have two nyjer socks out and they are packed almost all day long with a dozen of these charming finches.  This 2 pound bag fills up each sock with a little left over.  We find the smaller quantity offered by Wagner gives higher opportunity for this oily seed not to go rancid while in storage.  All the seed goes straight from bag to finch's beak with little waste.
B000KL18I2 2-day delivery speed when my local big-box store was all out made this worth it to me. The seed is okay, but not noticeably better than what I usually buy there for less.
B000KL18I2 But even at this price the finches and pine siskins will eat you out of house and home. 10 lbs lasts maby 3 weeks for us.
B000KL18I2 Best bargain for the money and I feed hundreds of finches during the winter and have problems finding it in the stores as winter progresses
B000KL18I2 I guess I'll just continue buying this from our local Home Depot, since Amazon cannot ship it to California.  Seems silly, since most hardware/feed stores here carry it, so it's not a banned product or anything.The finches love, love, love this stuff and it leaves much less mess than oil sunflower seeds.
B000KL18I2 I am in love with the quality of Wagner's seeds! This Nyjer is a perfect example. It's SO superior to the Nyjer (Niger) I bought at my local feed store. That seed contained lots of stems and trash, as well as clouds of choking red dust! There's some of it left in one feeder and the birds aren't touching it. The Wagner seed is plump and fresh smelling, and as clean as any seed I've ever seen. I don't want to poison my wild birds with aflatoxins, or feed them clay instead of seed, etc., so I just search for &#34;Wagner's&#34; seed now.
B000KL18I2 The finches gobble this thistle seed up...THEY REALLY LOVE IT, but after using another brand from Amazon, I think this thistle is MESSY!.  I fill the feeders on the kitchen counter and there is always \"seed dust\" left all over the counter when I'm done. The other brand claimed their seed was pure with no waste and they were right, but that did cost extra money.  I'm sure I will soon realize that the benefit of this seed is greater due to the cost savings, but I'm not there just yet.  I'm spoiled.....
B000KL18I2 Promptly delivered, good clean looking (as well as we could determine, it would be hard to find 'foreign' stuff mixed in a bad of Nyger seed).  WE have three nyger feeders and this bag topped them all off with plenty to spare.  I would imagine we're set for at least another year.  Better price than locally as well.
B000KL18I2 So nice and clean, it makes my birds happy to eat  this brand I have had many brands and nothing compares to Wagners Seed
B000KL18I2 Go buy on this food and it came quickly and the birds ate it up. I will order again and again.
B000KL18I2 This is the best price I have seen for quality seed. Birds like it.  I would buy this product again.
B000KL6T18 I have several bird feeders out during the winter months.  I bought this seed on Amazon to give it a try.  The birds, squirrels and even the deer seem to love it.
B000KL6T18 Well I see Jose and Mary out there all the time enjoying their feast.Ya  the Cardinals are a fine couple. THEY mix a lot of time with Theodore n Rocky n all.
B000KL6T18 We feed many types of birds. Woodpecker bluejays cardinals quail sparrow Mexican parrots and they are enjoying this blend I of seeds and feed
B000KL6T18 Decent seed but lots of filler that most birds don't eat.  It does not last long because the birds will push the stuff they don't like out of the feeder to get to the seeds that are in the mix.  Too expensive for what it is.
B000KL6T18 Contrary to many different feeds that we've tried, this particular mix wasn't a success at all with our local bird population.  While our (rather popular) feeders customarily need to be- and are refilled every 3 days, this mix stayed in the feeders for the longest time.  So, if the objective would have been to save money, it would constitute a hit.  However, given the priority our bird feeding activity gets in the family, it came across as little more than an appetizer to our 'regulars.'  We will not buy it again.
B000KL6T18 I have a great variety of birds lining up for this seed. I have Blue Grosbeek, Blue Jays, Indigo Buntings, painted bunting, doves, redbellied woodpecker, cardinals, Towhee, chickadees, goldfinch, titmouse and more. It is a hit they eat this more than the feeder with just black oil sunflower seed in it.
B000KL6T18 This is a very good mix of seeds that attracst a huge variety of birds. The seeds themselves are plump, clean and fresh-smelling. No mustiness or dirt/dust,like so many others. YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR, in bird seed as in so many things. I believe I actually save money buying Wagner's seeds, because there's so little waste.PS Just ran out of this, before the next shipment came. (AMAZON. WHY CAN'T THIS GO ON 'SUBSCRIBE AND SAVE\"?) I had to buy Lyric Supreme locally. That's the closest they had to this Wagner's seed, and it cost a LOT more. It doesn't seem to be as good, either. Yes, there are peanuts and safflower, but there are also LOTS of little yellow seeds under the feeder, tossed there by the birds. The Beagles will get them, but I'm buying seed for the wild birds, not the Beagles!
B000KL6T18 So I planted some of this so-called \"wild bird seed\" because my girlfriend likes wild birds and I thought it would be nice to grow some. Well, we didn't get ANY wild birds - what we got were sunflowers and safflowers and some red thing I don't know what it was. What is it with seed manufacturers? Are they pulling some kind of prank? Last year I bought Wild Flower Seed and I got wild flowers from it. This year I buy Wild Bird Seed and I get...wild flowers from it. Ha ha very funny.I did notice, however, that a few birds showed up to EAT the seeds, which at first horrified me because cannibalism, but after a few hours to think about it and some searching on Amazon I figured out how I could make use of the failed \"Wild Bird Seed\" to get birds for my girlfriend. I bought a \"bird feeder\", which by the way is ALSO a letdown - it doesn't *feed* the birds at all! No robotic arms, no little animated bird chef - the birds have to come to the \"feeder\" and feed themselves, like at Old Country Buffet only with fewer mobility scooters. The entire backyard bird industry seems built on a foundation of lies and deceit.Anyway, LOTS of birds came to our Bird Country Buffet, and my girlfriend is happy, which means everyone is happy.Helpful tip #1 - If you don't want wild flowers growing up under your feeder, take a microwave-safe plate or glass baking dish and spread out seed about 1\" deep or less. Microwave on high for about 2 minutes. Let cool for several minutes, add garnish, and serve. (Seriously, this works to sterilize the seeds and doesn't affect nutrition for the birds.)Helpful tip #2 - Do not discuss \"bird cannibalism\" with your bird-loving girlfriend, no matter how convinced you are that you just witnessed it. You will feel very stupid, even though the misunderstanding was obviously caused by the misleading product name.
B000KL6T18 While the squirrels also seem to love it; the birds are very happy with it. I get a great variety of birds at that feeder.
B000KL6T18 This is the most popular premixed blend that I have found. It's what our birds prefer, and it attracts the greatest variety. We live in the mid-atlantic region and have cardinals, grossbeaks, nuthatches, chickadees, carolina wrens, blue jays, and other species.The only blend that's better is when is when I buy separate bags of sunflower seed, cracked corn, and other seeds and blend it myself.
B000L0CPPM We have a lot of &#34;stuff&#34; that need to be stored outside and this fits the bill perfectly.  Rubbermaid products have always done right by myself and my bride.  Easy to assembly.
B000L0CPPM If you live in a deed-restricted community, you might have a covenant (agreement) that states you cannot set up a garden shed in your backyard.  But even with a garage or a walk-out basement, you still may want a shed outdoors to store tools near the garden, especially if your basement or garage doesn't open up onto the back yard. So this is kind of a substitute for a garden shed, and can go against a wall or somewhere that doesn't violate your covenant. And you will still have an outdoor shelter for tools, etc.This shed holds 17 cubic feet, which isn't a whole lot, but it does hold a rake, hoe, spade, limb pruner, weed whacker, weed puller, maybe some garden chemicals and the like. Not big enough for a mower or a tractor, of course. Which is why people like big sheds. But if you have a small place or a restricted deed, this can move the outdoor tools into a convenient place of your choosing, say, under a deck or against a wall.If you put this on the ground, you need to weight it down with sandbags or blocks. One solution is masonry bricks, they are not expensive and can make a floor of sorts. This isn't the ultimate in sheds, but it solved an irritation for me, which was garden stuff inside where I didn't want it. For what it is, it's fine. Can also be used in garages as a tool and incidentals storage, but I'd be wary of solvents or oils as they are sometimes incompatible with polyethylene, the material this shed is made of. However, polyethylene doesn't RUST, so it's nice in an area that gets damp.You can get up to four shelves in here but they are extra, not included. Summary, good for garage or garden, with the limitations I mentioned and a star knocked off for not even ONE shelf.
B000L0CPPM Purchased this shed recently at Home Depot as it was a little cheaper even with tax. Went together fairly easy. It is very light so I lined the floor with cement stepping stones which made it very secure. Cut shelving to fit and it was good to go. I use it to store my Weber rotisserie, all other barbecue gear and a lot of garden products. For a small storage shed its perfect for me and it frees up space in my garage!
B000L0CPPM Plenty of room for all the shovels and rakes and what have you for the garden. Often these LOOK tall but aren't; this one really is tall.You can hose it out easily if you get it too dirty.  This is our second one.  The first lasted for years before the pin in the top broke off.
B000L0CPPM This literally took me 5 minutes to slide all the pieces together.  SO FREAKING EASY!!!  I LOVE IT!!Holds a fair amount of yard implements as well.  I didn't want shelves, but you could just cut some out of OSB or plywood and insert them if you did.Looks good too!
B000L0CPPM It's okay but since it's not weather-proof, water and debris get inside during wind and rain storms. It will blow over during high winds.  I thought it would be too heavy to tip over but not so. The base collects water and spiders love to live in all the hollowed areas inside and underneath.  I had to have someone make custom shelves to fit inside because I couldn't find anything readymade to fit the grooves. It does hold a fair amount of garden hand tools and supplies after I put shelves in so I gave it 3 stars.  I had bought two. The one in which I didn't add shelves holds a few shovels and brooms.
B000L0CPPM Yes, it goes together very easily. The only difficulty concerned the instructions which I could not find in the box. Got them on the Rubbermaid website, put the shed together, and the instructions fell on the floor as I was clearing up the packing material. They were in the box all the time, but secreted between two sides of a cardboard bracing device.Rubbermaid could very easily do a better job with this.Re the shelves; I made a cardboard cutout using the dimensions (instructions again), took it down to Home Depot when they weren't busy, and they cut the shelves for me using 10 inch fir boards, which are the perfect size for the depth of the shelves. Total cost: just over $18. Felt very pleased with the shed, and myself!The shed is designed quite cleverly, the shelves taking up the back portion, just over half the depth, of the shed, leaving the front for tall items such as shovel, rake, etc. It would have very limited usefulness without the shelves.
B000LL4PXQ I am not certain when the term peat pot became generic to incorporate various types of recycled fiber, but these are a fiber similar to egg cartons.I picked these up to start my sweet peas this autumn and was pleasantly surprised by them. Like the actual peat, you plant them intact and they are organic. However, during the time you are growing them in the pots, they hold up well, and allow your seeds and seedlings to remain well watered and healthy.These worked very nice for my purpose, and I will be buying more for my spring planting.
B000LL4PXQ I ordered this Plantation FS110 Square Peat Pots, 50 pots to start a few tomatoes.  Next I do a couple of herbs and flower starts.  The allow you to drop in some starter soil or peat and water and cover.  Easy and relatively cost effective.
B000LL4PXQ First of all, I thought they were going to be bigger, but I can work with them.  They are about the. size of a 72 cell Jiffy planter.  I'll use them this spring to start seeds for the garden.
B000LL4PXQ These are ok!I thought they would be a little bigger but the descriptions did not specify and I probably should have asked how big these were gonna be!  If you are trying to grown things that should not be transplanted like I was you have to transplant very quickly if they get too big too quick!  Also you will want to punch a whole at the bottom and that helps the peat pots brake down quicker in your soil and helps the roots get through a little more quicker!  The hole does not have to be so big just enough to get the roots out so if you can fit your finger in it then it is big enough!
B000LL4PXQ I used these and they work fine.  The problem that _I_ had with them was transferring them directly to the soil.  That didn't turn out so well (plant didn't grow any further), and I ended up not using these anymore.  (I probably didn't use them right.)  I believe that I may have been able to fix any mistake I made when using these, but I ended up simply planting my seeds in fertilized soil, which turned out fine.
B000LNRVXK These appear to be good quality. I did unroll it and leave it under the hot sun as some reviewers recommended. Easy to bend shape once you do that.
B000LNRVXK This is very nice edging but if you buy it here or at Walmart.com,  you don't get the 10 stakes.  Home Depot sells the same edging WITH the 10 stakes for the same price.Update - November 2013 - I've now installed 8 rolls of this edging in my yard.  It's easy to install, and looks great.
B000LNRVXK Only in the ground for a couple months.  Like everyone says, lay it out in the sun for 30 minutes or so and it will get a lot softer adn easier to work with.  I will have to update later in teh year but from the quality this stuff looks pretty tough.  Much better than the ugly black stuff that you see everywhere.
B000LNRVXK Very easy to use. The border can be placed above the ground or set-in 2 inches like I did. I bordered a Tangelo, Manadarin, Lemon, and Grapefruit trees with these. Make sure you get enough stakes. The border needs 1 stake for every 2 feet.Compared to that junky black border in Homey Depot or Lowe's this border is wonderful. Very stout and should last a long time.
B000LNRVXK I purchased.. I'm not even sure. Eight of these? And they have all done the trick. They are lining both my garden and my fence. The fence is to keep weeds out of the garden, and keep some toads out of our yard (as much as possible).I have had no issues with these, although I did lay them out flat (with heavy objects on each end) the day before. This made them MUCH easier to work with. I saw the suggestion in another review.For anyone interested, these also cut easily with saws. I used a 5 inch electric to cut to fit certain areas.
B000LNRVXK Easy to install, holds back dirt. This is second purchase of this item: now have three. Recycled material, seems to be durable.John
B000LNRVXK I unrolled the coil overnight by putting weights on each end then on the next day, I let the coil bake in the broiling heat so that the coil was completely relaxed.I bought a dozen of the long metal pegs from HD ($2.93 each). I put the coil around the raised bed but I couldn't get the coil to stand up straight -- it undulated.  No matter how many pegs I added, the coil would not stand up straight in some places. The ground was flat. I was utterly perplexed. After about 30 minutes of working in the broiling heat, I gave up. I'll use the Master Mark landscaping coil in an area that's totally straight.I bought 60' of black (I preferred the brown) \"professional\" landscaping coil from HD for 35 dollars that has a tube.
B000LNRVXK I HAVE USED SEVERAL DIFFERENT EDGING PRODUCTS AND THIS IS BY FAR THE EASIEST TO USE AND INSTALL! I PURCHASED 7 ROLLS. IT IS STURDY AND I THINK WELL MADE. I FOUND THE EASIEST WAY TO UNROLL AND MAKE FLAT WAS TO WALK ON IT AS YOU UN ROLL IT AND IT FLATENS QUICKLY AND STAYS FLAT.  THE ONLY THING I CHANGED WAS PUTTING THE STAKES ON THE INSIDE  AND NOT OUTSIDE ONLY BECAUSE I LIKED THE WAY IT LOOKED . I PUT DOWN 16 CUBIC YARDS OF MULCH AND THE 5 INCH WORKS GREAT FOR HOLDING IT IN PLACE.  THE PRICE IS VERY REASONABLE,AFFORDABLE. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND!
B000LNWIVU We hung the Victor Poison-Free Fly Magnet Disposable Fly Trap within a partially screened patio area, after removing the packing stuff, pulling the string and filling the unit to the water line with warm water.  The description indicates \"It contains a highly attractive bait formula to trap house, barn and bottle flies. No cutting or assembly required and the hanging mechanism is included\".  Within an hour several flies were trapped.  The disposable fly tray is very attractive, unlike others we have used.  Obviously, it is not full, however, when the trap becomes full, instructions read to snap the top onto trap to seal and place in trash. \"It's that convenient and that easy\".  The fly traps are reasonably priced with free Amazon prime shipping.  A real must item here in Arizona 365 days a year.  Recommended.Manufacturer's Tips:* Hang trap from trees or stakes* Keep water level at fill line at all times* May take several hours for bait to fully activate* Flies prefer warm, bright calm areas* Eliminating one female fly can reduce population by 150-500 flies per year* Flies are dormant until temperatures reach 65 degrees F.* Flies search for food at low sources. Traps are most effective when placed 24 inches or less from the ground.
B000LNWIVU THIS IS AN EDITED - REVIEWORIGINAL - Maybe I have the wrong kind of flies, but after a solid week, I captured a total of three flies and one moth while this hung in my back yard. Meanwhile, in the other part of the yard, they annoyed the heck out of us. The flies were not attracted or killed, and I had to hold my nose anytime I got near it.NEW - Since my original review we have had several rainstorms and lots of activity in our back yard. This week I went out to take down the Fly Trap and dispose of it and was stunned.First of all, either time or the rainstorm has dissipated the odor that was so objectionable. But second, in spite of the fact that I couldn't smell a thing, flies were buzzing around this, and it was filled with flies, drowned flies, buzzing flies, and flies crawling in to enjoy the feast with the rest of them.I don't know what the difference was, but a couple of weeks or so after I hung it up, it did finally work.I placed my star rating at 4, because the original odor was so bad and it did not work for awhile. But it does work.
B000LNWIVU Since our neighbors acquired a couple of horses, we have seen an uptake in the fly population. I thought this product might be the answer, but unfortunately, it's performance has been less than impressive. Toxin free, the trap has an attractive appearance and is easy to set up. You must add water and place somewhere two feet or less from the ground. I secure it at the perimeter of our property in a sunny spot and waited. The unpleasant bait smell grew stronger but although flies buzzed around, none were trapped. By the end of the week, there were three flies. Granted the last few days were unseasonably cool with intermittent rain, but I was expecting  better results. I will leave it for a few more weeks and will update my review if there is any substantial improvement.
B000LNWIVU I just put this up a few days ago so I can't really say how well it is working so far. It doesn't smell too bad. Obviously flies like smelly stuff so I figure any bait will have an odor. I will report back when I have some flies!  :o) Update: Fly season is in full swing and I trapped lots of flies. It seems to work better the longer it sits.End of summer update: This thing definitely catches flies. If you get within 15 feet or so you can occasionally catch a whiff of malodorous bait but that is to be expected. My solution was to just move it 15 feet further away (the flies don't mind flying the distance to get trapped). The odor tends to get worse as the flies accumulate. But the upshot is it works. Our fly population was greatly reduced. We will definitely get another one of these next summer.
B000LNWIVU By stinks, I don't mean that it doesn't work. I mean it really stinks. We had it hanging near out patio table, and my husband couldn't stand it, so we moved it closer to our trash cans. It was completely empty for about three days, but when I checked back after a week, I had about 20 really tiny flies floating dead in the water and two more that were just flying around inside the trap. If I'm getting rid of 100 flies later in the summer for every one of them that I manage to kill now, I'm feeling pretty good about the 20 I've snatched in the first week. I understand that the stinky stench is what attracts the flies, but I just wish it didn't smell so awful!
B000LNWIVU I don't understand how anyone has trouble getting this trap to work. I followed the directions by filling this up to the water line with warm water, placed it in a warm, quiet place and within a few minutes had two flies swimming in the concoction. A few hours later and I have quite a few more. This one is flying off our back porch and only gets early morning sunlight.I have a few others hanging in the same general area as this one, all made by Rescue. The concept is the same: a disposable bag with water-activated fecal material is what lures the flies into the bag via several one-way entrances.This bag doesn't smell as bad as the Rescue brand though. The outside is decorated with green leaves and the dead flies are visible. At least on the Rescue brand one doesn't see the dead flies. Regardless, the one I have flying above our north-facing back porch is working great on its first day of use. We won't be getting the onslaught of flies we had last June because this year we started setting up our fly traps a little earlier.
B000LNWIVU This is an outdoor fly trap. Although it is not toxic, do not even consider on using it indoors. This trap smells nasty! I could smell it as soon as I opened the outside box, before even opening the plastic wrapped trap. Once you fill it with some water then watch out, it really stinks.  I hung the trap as far away from the house as possible. The bait attracts the flies and traps them inside. Once filled you just snap the lid on and throw it out. It took quite a while before this trap started attracting and killing flies, but once they found the trap it filled up quickly with flies.
B000LNWIVU If you get this be prepared for a very smelly experience! The bait smells pretty bad at first (sort of a rotted meat/rotten egg smell) but really amps up the smell when you add water. It is definitely something you don't want to hang anywhere near where people are.Granted, the bait has to be smelly to attract flies, but this really packs a punch in the smell department.I found it to be moderately effective. It did trap some flies, but not nearly as many as I was hoping for. It is easy to use (basically just unfold, add water and hang it up) but given the smell, it's almost a trade-off - it would have to trap a lot more flies to make it worth putting up with the smell.
B000LNWIVU Fly's are disgusting and annoying creatures and I would love to get rid of a few of them around our house. During the summer they can be bad in our garage, especially around the trash cans. These traps are made for outdoors but I decided to hang it in our garage to hopefully eliminate the fly problem in there. It was easy enough to set up. First you remove the plastic wrapper and pull the trap open. Then you fill it to the line with warm water and set the lid to the correct position and hang it up. It suggests that for best results you should hang it no more than 2 feet off the ground. As soon as you fill it with water and the bait gets wet it will stink to high heaven. I knew that fly's like stinky stuff and thought maybe it would work. And when I say stinky I mean really stinky. I could hardly stand to to go into our garage for about 4 days because the smell was so strong. I am sad to say that even after tolerating that smell for an entire week there is not a single dead fly in the trap. I will continue using this trap and will update my review if it starts working but so far it doesn't seem to be very effective to me.
B000LNWIVU This excellent POISON FREE fly magnet/fly trap was very easy to setup and hang. This was installed on the back porch near the front door where flies seem to congregate when we sit outside. So far, this has done a excellent job of both attracting flies and killing them. (They are drawn into the device and cannot get out and die). Just a few hours after installation, there were many dead flies in it. So I highly recommend this. And I recommend you hanging this on a porch, carport, deck or wherever you have a fly problem. My favorite thing is I could not smell any odors and the fact that it is POISON FREE! Now we can barbeque outside with no more fly problem!Thank you for reading this review and I hope it has been helpful for you.
B000LNWIVU We hung our Fly Magnet next to where we keep our garbage cans and we got our first fly within hours and in days, the trap was filled with not only flies but other insects like bees and moths.You fill the trap with water and hang it away from your home because it does lure the flies in so you don't want to hang this where you and your family hang out at because you would probably end up with more flies in the area. It is recommended that you hang it within a couple feet of the ground, which we did.While it does work, I have to take in consideration the price. I'm not sure if it's worth the price for a few dozen less flies. But as the manufacturer points out if you eliminate female flies then you are really eliminating maybe hundreds of flies. I think you have to take in consideration your fly problem versus the price.Update to my review:After another week or so, I checked on our fly magnet. A raccoon or some animal had gotten into the bag chewing at it. I think it was attracted by the smell. It has a fishy smell from the attractant that is included in it. The animal had chewed through and all the water had run out and live flies were hovering all over the ground where the water had run out. I was surprised at how many dead flies were left in the now emptied of water bag. We had a good 2 inches full of flies.My thoughts was that the bag really did work and I wanted to get more but I would not hang them close to the ground as is instructed. I will definitely hang up out of the reach of animals and hope for as good of results again as we got with it when we had it closer to the ground.
B000LNWIVU We always start getting flies around our garbage cans in late April and early May once it starts getting hot again.  This has been a very hot and dry season for us, so the flies are out in full force.I have used traps like this one in the past with moderate success.  They're full of stinky bait that apparently smells yummy to flies.  The traps quickly fill up with flies and become even more disgusting.  I usually end up replacing them and having more than one trap per season, because the traps become more annoying than the flies.This trap caught my attention right away.  First of all, it smells as bad or worse than the others I've used.  Secondly, it's much bigger and has room for even more insect mayhem.  And finally, the design of the lid looks like it should actually help contain things inside better.The setup and installation was simple.  I just added water to the fill line and then hung it where I always do.And that's where the action stopped.  Completely.This trap has been hanging above my trash cans for two weeks now.  Nothing.  Not one single fly.On the other hand, I don't have any flies around the trash cans anymore either.  I can't figure it out.  I don't seem to have a fly problem anymore, but it doesn't appear to be any thanks to this trap.  I don't know if there's some different environmental change this season or not, but I don't seem to have flies by the garbage cans.  I see them other places, when we go for walks, out in the yard, etc.  But there aren't any by the trash cans.  Maybe this trap disintegrates them.  Who knows?
B000LNWIVU The bait smells terrible but it catches hundreds of flies! I highly recommend this for your outdoor fly problems around the barn, kennel or anywhere else you have flies. It's super easy to set up and use and easy to dispose of.
B000LNWIVU This Victor Fly Magnet did NOT solve the FLY problem on our patio and throughout the back yard. In fact, we don't usually have a fly problem, but this trap brought them to our yard in huge hoards - some flies found their way into the trap - but most just hung around the patio, rushing inside every time we used the door. Finally got rid of the fly problem by getting rid of the Victor Fly Magnet! NOT recommended.
B000LNWIVU Our fly season is just beginning, so they are not bothersome yet.  However, I received this trap through the Amazon Vine Program and must write a timely review, so I needed to put out the trap very early -- so early in the year, that I was afraid I would not be able to fairly evaluate its effectiveness.  Was I ever wrong!  The trap is pretty stinky, which flies must find irresistible.  It smelled bad before I added water, and got really rank once the water mixed with the bait in the bottom of the bag. I think there might be a dissolvable cover over the bait in an attempt to inhibit the stink before water is added, but make no mistake -- the smell is foul. In spite of there being very few flies in the yard, within a couple days there were flies floating in the bag's liquid.  Yesterday we had a garage sale, and a few flies found their way into the garage, where they circled around, not showing any intention of leaving.  As soon as the sale was over, I closed the garage doors, brought in the fly trap and they entered it while I was still holding it!  So I took it right back outside, rehung it and am ordering a couple more to have on hand when this one fills up.  Don't hang this fly trap on your porch or too close to where company gathers, because the smell is disgustingly potent and repels people while it attracts flies.  Hang it someplace else and the flies will find it.  This product really works!
B000LNWIVU I live in the country and in the summer flies are a huge aggravation.  This fly trap is the easiest one to use so far.  It does have a slight odor, so place it far enough away from where you are, so it draws the flies AWAY from you.  I would recommend it.
B000LNWIVU The worst part of this is the awful nasty smell.  Do not hang it near your house or if you plan on eating outside put it far far away.  I hung it outside of my garage-I just could not stand the smell. I went and checked it several times every hour or so to see how it was doing and it was doing great.  I had several dozen flys/bugs in it after just a few hours.Great smelling if you are a fly!  Lol
B000LNWIVU This fly trap is simple to use: open the package, unfold the bag, add water, and hang near flies.The bait is a bit stinky, since flies are attracted to...well...you know. But the flies go in through the slits in the top, get trapped, and eventually drown in the water.It's not messy or sticky like those tape traps. It's kind of big, and the water makes it heavy to hang. You need to have a place in mind to hang this, preferably NOT near where you are spending time. If all you have is an apartment with a balcony, I don't think this is the product for you because 1. of the smell, and 2. because you are actually attracting flies to the area you hang it.Recommended for people with a yard, or around stables/livestock where flies are bad.
B000LNWIVU It takes a while, but at this point, my Victor Poison Free M530 Fly Magnet is filled with flies, either buzzing about inside, or drown in the smelly, murky lure within.The first thing you'll notice is that this thing reeks! I received mine in a bubble shipping envelope, and once I tore it open I immediately noticed the smell. The smell directly from the product is not so heavy, but with time it really works up an odor. If for some reason you decide to try one of these, I highly recommend you put it to use, and avoid storing it. If left in the garage, or even worse in the house, eventually these locations will smell just as bad as the inside of my envelope did.Setup is simple. The plastic shield at the top lifts out of the way so that the bag can be filled with warm water to the fill line - the warm water, after time, is supposed to fully activate the stink pouch floating around in the bag. Once filled, the plastic shield's three legs can be mounted atop three posts on the bag's lid, creating a narrow covered structure for the flies to sneak their way inside.I recommend this trap for anyone willing to invest the money, and a few days of sweltering heat, to draw the flies in. Perhaps it needs a customer or two to start things off with all the \"buzz,\" and looking at it now, there are numerous trapped flies that will be unable to multiply. It would be better with less expensive bait refills that could be put into the trap for additional value, though, as the price seems high to kill the seemingly endless supply of flies.
B000LNWIVU This was really easy to set up and doesn't take up a lot of space. It arrives flat and pops open. Once you add water, the bait inside starts to expand. It smells like rotting meat but doesn't smell if you stand nearby.The flies have been going in and having a great time - for just a little while - until they can't get out and drown. The big question is, does it make a difference? We live in the country, surrounded by woods and millions of bugs so it's hard to tell. But one less fly getting around is one less fly creating more.I think it might actually be good in our basement/garage where we get bugs flying around. I hate seeing fly strips hanging down so this is more appealing and seems to work well.
B000LNWIVU The black fly is the state bird here in West Virginia.  They get into my house beginning about the end of February. I put this Fly Magnet up a week ago and thus far it has only caught five flies.  Not so good...  I put up a Tractors Supply fly trap at the same time and it has killed at least 100.  I did put this trap up down at the horse barn, so it might be in a more \"target rich\" environment.UPDATE: The flies discovered the front porch.  When I checked yesterday there were at leas 5 gazillion dead flys floating in the bottle.  Suspect there hadn't enough warm weather to get a good hatch when I first reviewed this item.  Definitely recommend now!
B000LNWIVU Here's the summer and my toddler doesn't always get the screen door idea to keep fly away. I use the fly magnet in the tree nearby our deck and I can see one fly occasionally in the house (3-4 before with the door open).The trap smells like rotten orchid flower mixed with poo;) It's gross but obviously attracts flies. I could only smell it when I was setting it up, I can not smell it when I'm like 3 feet (a meter) away from it. I can see dead flies in the water..so yeah, fly magnet works!
B000LNWIVU This thing kind of blew my entire family away on the first day!  Let me explain. We have just moved into our home in the woods. It's on an acre of land and there are plenty of lifeforms out here. The previous family was NOT CLEAN by any means with 3 children and a pregnant mom, I can't blame them but it was a fly haven.I did my version of professional cleaning from ripping out all the appliances, to new flooring and TONS OF DISINFECTANTS but we could not stop 4 to 5 flies showing up in the window.  When the fly magnet came, I couldn't wait to fill the thing with water and put it up.  And that's really all you do, Lift the Yellow Lid (which is attached to string, and fill the bottom part with water to the \"Fill Line\" and hang it up.So out to the deck, by the door by the windows with the flies.  Okay, GONE! In what I think was SECONDs the (Really stinky) attractant is potent and flies flew from our house towards it and the flies outside go to it.I can't rave enough about it. And you know how long it lasts by the return of the flies inside, that's how powerful it is. So put it away from the door that is open the most. This lasted about 6 weeks and it was PACKED to the brim with flies (gross, I know) but you press the lid back on and TOSS it.Very Satisfied and you will be too.
B000LNWIVU I live out in the country. There aren't any houses around me, just a big, huge, cornfield. The farm that the field belongs to is about 1/4 - 1/2 mile away. So, between us is just this big huge field that starts next to the opposite side of my driveway. We get a lot of flies from time to time, and it can get worse during various stages of the farming/treating of that field. I thought this Victor Fly magnet would be a good product to help make our time out on the patio a bit more enjoyable. It didn't turn out to be very useful though.It is super easy to use - you just open it, fill it with water and hang it up. So, no problem there. You do want to be sure to hang it a very good distance away from any area that you will be using, because this thing STINKS. Even if you have it placed pretty far away, if the wind blows right, you still get a nice whiff of it and your face will instantly curl up.I have had it outside for a month now. There's maybe about 10 flies max in there. I have moved it twice to try to get the stench further away from us. The flies do not flock to it and they do not seem to be enticed by it or drawn to it at all. More so it seems they just end up in there by happenstance and not because they purposely went in there due to being specifically attracted to it.I will leave it up and see what happens. Maybe once there are more flies in there, it will attract even more flies...or something? As of now though, I wouldn't recommend it especially if you were hoping for it to help on your patio area etc because you cannot actually place directly on or near your patio due to the horrid stench. You have to place it so far away that it will basically (in theory) control the fly population in that other area - that's if they actually go into the trap.The idea of this thing is that even if it catches just a few flies, it he
B000LNWIVU Open it up, fill it with water up to the line, pop in the bait pouch. It dissolves into the water.  Stinks.  Very earthy smell.  A bouquet of manure and hints of rot.  Not repulsive but fairly unpleasant.  To me at least.Put it outside.  No flies the first day. No flies the second day. Getting disappointing.  Third day. Flies.  A week and a half later, or so, flies inside, flies flying about the top.No poison. Just water and a bit of stink. The stink draws them in, the water keeps them there, as soon as they stop flitting about the sides.  Have to keep the water up to the line inside, that's the only upkeep.  I guess the stink will dissipate more after a while.  While the flies still gather on it rather than me, I'm happy.ADDED: Lowered to 4 stars String broke after a couple of weeks.  No idea what caused it, but it was on the ground, punctured, stink in the air.  So, you might want to secure it with something a bit more durable and secure it somewhere more protected.Of course, I'm back on this page to order another one, as there are a number of flies again.  So that's a good sign.
B000LNWIVU When I began using manure in my garden I noticed a lot of flies were attracted, not too surprisingly.  While they look much like the classic house fly, they're much smaller.  I thought the Victor trap would be just the ticket, but it hasn't been.I brought the shrink-wrapped trap home in my car and could smell it through whatever tiny holes existed in the plastic.  In fact, after a while the smell began to make me nauseous, and I'm not the queasy type. The bait supposedly is not poisonous, however, and I believe it's made of rotten eggs.The trap was very easy to construct.  Just take off the plastic wrapping, pull the string from which the unit hangs, pour warm water into the plastic bag that contains the bait, orient the yellow plastic top properly over the bag, and you're good to go--just hang it near the flies.  However, I would never use one of these traps in a house, because you will definitely smell it and it isn't pleasant.I hung it outside and didn't have any problem with the smell.  However, with the exception of a single house fly, which is very unusual in my area, it hasn't caught anything in the week it's been hanging.  I'm guessing that the smaller flies in my yard simply aren't attracted to the bait. To be fair, the Victor trap is advertised to attract \"house, barn and bottle flies,\" but be aware that not all flies fit that description. So if you've got standard house flies, I would certainly give this a try, but if you don't, it may be useless.
B000LNWIVU This isn't a time of the year for heavy flies, but we do have a few around outdoors and would like them to keep them from coming indoors. This fly trap caught a few but it smells really nasty.  We could smell it all over the yard, even 30 or 40 feet away from the trap.  I guess it's necessary to have something to bait the flies, but after listening to my husband complain about the smell, we finally threw it out after a week or so.It was easy to use, just open and add water and hang it in an area where flies congregate.  We hung it in the back of the house, not far from the garbage cans.  Since the cans are plastic, and we keep them closed, we don't notice much odor from them. I like that the trap is non-toxic and doesn't contain poisons. The air has been really still since we hung it and perhaps that contributed to the smell hanging around the yard.  Had it been windy it may have just blown through, hopefully attracting the flies without annoying us.
B000LNWIVU I hung this up close to the back of the house and boy did it stink of that smell exclusive to rotting trash. Because of that, I was sure that this would work, but it's been out there for weeks now and only has about five flies in it. I find this strange, given that I had the open trash can sitting quite near it while we had work done inside the home and there were large families of flies hovering above for days.The trap is easy enough to put together--fill it with water up to the line and make sure the lid is sitting on it right so that there is room for the flies to fly in. The string it hangs on it long enough to put on a branch.I think the sticky fly strips work better than this.
B000LNWIVU When it gets warm I seem to get a lot of flies near my back door.  When the door is opened some come in my house.I put a trap about seven feet away from my back door door.  At the end of the day I started noticing flies.  These traps work.  I have been noticing less flies in my house and near my back door. I assume the bait is more attractive than my house.I like the design of the traps.  They are green so they blend in with my bushes and are not overly noticeable.I did notice a slight smell but it was not a big deal. It is not that noticeable.I like that fact that these are not toxic. I don't like anything toxic near my house.This works well. I will be getting another for my front yard.Update:We have had really warm weather lately. It has been in the mid to high 90's during the day.  I am amazed how many flies are in the trap. I may actually have to get a new one soon because of the amount of flies in the trap and it has been out less than a month.
B000LNWIVU Early spring means daily new hatching's of house and deer flies in my area (WI). I have always disliked having to hang repellants and traps near the doors and places we all have to pass during the day and these traps provided the best help yet.Hanging one in a bush several feet from my back door has kept the porch fly free right from it's first day out. One added advantage is that it seems to be attracting a large number of the small gnats that show up and can usually walk right thru screening. Whatever the bait is it seems to lure them in happily and I don't have to watch it happen.
B000LNWIVU UPDATE: The Victor fly trap has been up for 3 weeks and is now attracting flies. During that time, it spent 5 days without a fly, 3 days with 5 flies, and then began to draw in flies rapidly around the 9th day. During that same time, the 2 Rescue brand fly traps filled with flies and had to be removed because they couldn't hold any more. I then put up 3rd and 4th Rescue fly traps and they too filled before this one got going strong. I have read that different breeds of flies are attracted to different odors. Looks like this one just took a long time to get going, so I've upgraded my rating to 3 stars. I also wonder if the flies were attracted to the odor produced by the bodies of the dead flies. My future purchases will be the Rescue brand.ORIGINAL REVIEW: Don't know why the flies aren't attracted to this fly trap. I certainly find the odor to be overwhelming and unpleasant. But the flies are not attracted to it. The Rescue Fly Traps that are on each side of the Victor trap were put up at the same time and are full. Another Rescue Fly Trap that I placed a few yards away is already attracting and killing flies, but the Victor Fly Trap remains untouched by flies. If it doesn't attract flies within a week, I'm going to throw it away because the odor is so bad. The Rescue traps also have a bad odor, but it doesn't seem to carry as far as the Victor's odor. If I get any flies, I will update this review. If there is no UPDATE, you can be sure the Victor Fly Magnet Disposable Fly Trap never caught a fly on my property. If you're wondering why I have so many flies, it's because I free-range lots of chickens and the coop area can become a magnet and breeding ground for flies unless I attack them aggressively each spring.
B000LNWIVU We live in a rural area, surrounded by Amish farms.  Although we have no animals on our property, there is an overabundance of flies during the late summer and fall.  The south exposure of the house seems to attract the most flies, so we set up the Victor Fly Magnet just about 10 foot away from that part of the house.  Since we don't exit on that side, we aren't near the trap, so the scent isn't particularly objectionable.  After two weeks, we realized that the trap was literally full.  I think we need to have several set up to accommodate the clouds of nasty flies around here.
B000LNWIVU Please be aware of the fact that this Fly Trap is beyond Stinky.  Ideally you're going to want it far enough out that you don't smell it every time you walk out the door or sit outside but close enough that it'll be drawing the flies away.  If it were that easy and it worked then that'd be great.  My problem is that I don't notice very many flies being attracted to this thing and although I've seen a fly or two inside the trap, They seem to disappear.  We've had the trap up for over a month now.  I was hoping to notice a difference in our pesty flies but that hasn't been the case so far.I know when I've set traps out for gnats before that I've seen them go into my liquid and float.  30 minutes later I'll look and they'll be gone.  I realized then that the gnats were evidently dissolving.  Maybe that's what happening with the flies.  I'm not real sure.Since I'm not truly positive that this trap is actually doing anything, I would only give it 2 1/2 stars and I don't think I'd recommend it.
B000LNWIVU This fly trap is excellent for me because I don't have to snap open any vials of that stinky bait to empty in to the trap!  It's in a water soluble little bag that dissolves in warm water.  The trap itself is not bad looking w/green leaves printed on the plastic trap..what that does for flies, I have no idea!  Anyway, it was all so easy to assemble and hang up.  I like the fact that it also has a yellow rain shield or whatever it is, to keep debris and water out.  Poison free, disposable, easy baiting and gets rid of tons of flies..yes, I definitely will be using this product repeatedly by my chicken coop area and on fenceline to draw any flies away from the pool area.
B000LNWIVU Great fly trap that works as advertised.  It is very stinky, even before taking off the plastic wrap.  I took the plastic wrap while walking out to my backyard and flies were already flying all over it trying to get in.  They were definitely attracted to the smell, even before I had put any water in it.  It is also really easy to set up.  Just take off the plastic wrap, pull up the lid and reposition it so it stays open, then fill with water and hang.  It fills up with flies in just a few days and you have to keep water in it at all times.  Be sure to close lid and toss as soon as it's full or it can get really gross in there very quickly.  The pretty design on the bag is a nice distraction to the gross-ness brewing in there, but it's great to be able to trap and get rid of all those nasty flies.  I think it's a good size too.  If it were larger, it could trap more flies...but then there'd be too much gross-ness to get rid of at the end.  I think it's better to have this smaller size and just have more of them so you can start fresh sooner.  Great product, would recommend.
B000LNWIVU Works amazingly well in catching flies. I buy a few every year.The only problem is that plastic develops leaks after it is half-full of flies (which is a lot). Designed obsolescence, I suppose. But then you simply toss in the garbage. Great in controlling fly population.
B000LNX06C I had high hopes for this one, but it failed to deliver. Living in the country we are plagued with mice(gotta get a cat) so we gave this gizmo every chance to do it's stuff. No matter where we placed it, with fresh peanut butter, they never went near it. An old fashioned snap trap caught one the next day in the same spots. This would have been much kinder and pleasanter to use. Unfortunately, it just did not work.Update: 4 weeks later, it caught a large rat in the tool shed. So the thing does work. We have plenty of rats and mice, the compost pile is a rodent magnet, but so far only one rat has fried.I have added a star to my review, but I still would not buy this thing.
B000LNX06C The short of it is that this trap was used for at least 2 months using peanut butter as bait and it did not catch a single mouse or rat.  I've read that others have had far more success, but it didn't work for us.The batteries are nearly impossible to get into the unit and there the switch does not tell you if the unit is on or off.  Because it's not clear whether or not the unit is powered up, it's potentially dangerous, as you could shock yourself.Because this unit did not work for us, I cannot recommend it.
B000LNX06C Rat and mouse traps always fell to the husband to deal with prior to getting this little hummer.  Now even *I* will take a dead critter still in the trap over to the garbage can, upend it and bye-bye dead critter.I think this is probably one of the more humane ways to deal with rodents - zapping them most likely kills them very quickly.We found the best way to bait this was to poke two parallel holes in a plastic bottle cap (like from a plastic soda bottle), thread a long twisty tie through both holes from inside the cap, fill the cap with peanut butter, slide it into the unit with the ends of the twisty tie coming out through 2 adjacent holes, then twist them down to retain the filled cap.  Before we did this, some crafty critter actually made off with a cup of peanut butter!!Be sure to check it often though, because a dead critter in there gets raunchy very fast.  Do not ask me how I know this.I have another brand electronic rat zapper as well, and one thing it offers that Victor doesn't is a little LED device on a long cord which plugs into the main unit and then can be hung on a door or whatever to signal when the trap has been sprung.  This is a nice feature for my shed - I have the LED strung out through the door and I can see at a glance when the LEDs (which are pretty bright) are blinking, alerting me to something dead in there.  I'd love it if Victor came up with something similar!
B000LNX06C Erm, people, exercise some common sense with this thing. Don't stick your hand in it when it's on. Be careful to only handle it by the plastic when it's off. Switch it off before you bait it. DON'T TOUCH THE METAL.So, I had a rat problem. The little beasts were getting so they'd climb up the screen outside the window at the end of the couch where I was watching tv. Very acrobatic. They had to go.I tried the cheap solution. Glue traps: useless. Mouse traps: too small. Rat traps: worked once in a while. Modernized rat traps: useless. Poison: ever smelled a two week dead mouse in your garage?So I found this electronic trap. Set it up and 20 minutes later there's a dead rodent in it. So I emptied rodents out a couple of times each evening.Well, I left it on after the last one and next afternoon there was a squirrel half in and half out and dead as a dodo. This is not a toy.
B000LNX06C I'd rather not target squirrels. As destructive as they can be, they are cute and quite entertaining. Our indoor cats are glued to the \"cat TV\" for hours, watching them from their window perches.Unfortunately, squirrels are scampering about the outside of our house as the temperatures outside drop and the squirrels are looking for winter quarters. Several neighbors have had their houses penetrated, now the squirrels have taken a liking to ours. Having grown tired of the squirrels climbing up and down our home in search of food and/or an entry point, I set this trap on our porch, covered it with a layer of plastic wrap (to keep moisture out) and baited the unit with peanut butter. 12 hours later the first squirrel expired. Disposal was trivial, the squirrel slid easily into the trash bag. The unit is back in operation, awaiting the its next customer.I hope the squirrels stay off our house. But if they choose not to, this trap is probably the most humane way to dispose of them (catch and release is not allowed in my state).EDIT: Three squirrels in four days... The only downside to this unit is it's lack of environmental protection - it would be great to be able to safely / easily use it outside also. I guess I would use a plastic tote with a hole like the folks at RatZapper...Later Edit: More customers... and I finally figured out why some squirrels escaped: In their attempt to get at the bait without going into the tunnel, some squirrels will rotate the trap - I had thought it had been the 'throes of electric passion' when I found the trap upturned (envisioning a electricity-proof squirrel mutation). But once the plates are no longer on the bottom, the trap is safe to enter. Moral of the story: secure the trap so it stays upright.Even later edit: One of the electrodes came loose, as the earlier manhandling by squirrels (when the trap was not installed rigidly) had broken one of the pins holding the bottom of the tunnel to the body. I used 5 minute epoxy to glue the bottom back onto the body and glued the middle and back plates on too - they were just held with double-sided tape. Trap's back out... ready for additional customers.
B000LNX06C To repeat what others have said, the battery compartment is terrible!The curved top has grip ridges that are useless, I had to pry the top off.Once inside the battery holder defies imagination, curved plastic meant to hold the batteries impede the insertion of the batteries which barely fit in the plastic holder that isn't even the same piece of plastic of the \"trap\".This really does look like a hobbled together prototype!Following the prototype model, wires inside the trap are exposed, if a rat found this device unarmed, I would expect it to be disabled due to chewing on the exposed wires which are connected to the shock plates.The trap entrance is quite large, an adult can easily insert their hand, perhaps making it easy to clean, but also seemingly dangerous if there is enough of a shock here to kill a rat. However, this seems like it would be effective for chipmunks or squirrels as well..There is no bait holder, you simply smear some through the large holes on the opposite side. These holes are actually large enough to allow a mouse in which could explain why some user report bait loss with no kill.It is also not very apparent that the trap has been triggered. tiny, dim blinking led? Great idea, so I have to get into the small area to check or pull it out daily?Opportunities for improvement:1) Battery cover2) Battery holder3) exposed wires in the rodent area4) I would make the shock plates removable for cleaning, with wires hidden under the plates soldered to something that would make contact with the plate when installed.5) Needs a removable bait holder for easier cleaning6) Smaller grid on non entry side ( or bait in center with dual entry )7) Personally I would add flap doors to each side that would make the apparent entry smaller, rodents are more curious about entering enclosed spaces with the smell of food inside, the large open end is not ideal.8) Audible beep, like a low battery smoke alarm, should be used to identify either low battery or after the device has been triggered and needs to be checked.
B000LNX06C My two chickens share a coop with my neighbor's eleven chickens. We've had a lot of trouble with rats getting into the coop and eating lots of feed, but they are crafty devils and my neighbor has not been able to catch or kill them. I got this trap thinking it was worth a try in the coop, but he was doubtful it would work. (So was the DH.)I read all the reviews here, and we followed the advice to keep the trap away from moisture, position it in a corner so the rats could not get at the peanut butter from the back side of the trap, made sure our chickens couldn't get to it at all, etc. Last night my neighbor set the trap in the coop on a high storage shelf, under a sloping cover designed to keep the chickens from roosting up there. We'd seen evidence of rats there, so we knew they could climb up there.This afternoon, I wish you could have seen the look on my neighbor's face. He said \"I got one already! This morning this big old rat was lying there dead and he hadn't even made it all the way to the peanut butter!\" I wish you could have seen my neighbor's face. He was lit up like a candle, grinning from ear to ear, just delighted.I mentioned to him that one reviewer said the trap only seems to work once on each set of batteries. He said he reset the trap and the light came on, so he thought it would probably still work. (Tomorrow morning, I guess we'll see.) If I don't come back here and post otherwise, assume the trap has continued to work like it's supposed to.I'm pleasantly surprised. It's so nice when something works and is truly useful.UPDATE: Got two more!UPDATE AGAIN: Okay, we zapped six big rats before the batteries gave out. One day I want to see how well this trap will work with rechargeable batteries. If anyone has tried them with it, please comment!
B000LNX06C To call this a trap is being very generous. It arrived in a fairly thick cardboad sleeve which turned out to be of much higher quality than the trap. Included were 4 \"C\" cells and a packet of Jif Peanut Butter. The top of the unit has a curved plate with several shallow ridges which presumably are intended to assist in removing the plate to insert batteries. The plate defied removal since the surface is slippery and the ridges are not deep enough to enable a firm grip. With the use of a miniture pry bar the plate was eventually removed. Out of curiosity, the plate was reattached and removal was attempted again. No luck to do so without the assistance of the tool. Apparently the intended method of removal is to squeeze the sides of the plate and it would just lift off. That did not work with this unit nor did any other method that was tried. None of the other reviews mentioned this problem. Interestingly, the bottom of this worthless item falls off very easily.Anyway, back to the top. Inserting the batteries was not the normal simple task because the design of this unit is to make battery insertion a chore. After completing the battery insertion task it was time to try out this alleged trap. Recently I had the crawl space encapsulated and the workers removed two dead rats who met their demise due to some rat strips I had placed previously. I thought that it would be better not to have to touch the dead rats by using this trap. I placed the peanut butter into the trap, turned it on to check the green light blink, held the bottom from falling off and located it where the dead rats were found. When I later checked on the trap I noticed that the peanut butter was gone and the trap was empty. I had some jars of peanut butter in  the kitchen so I reloaded the trap. I did this for several days with the same results.This trap is nothing more than a feeder for whatever type of rodent or other creature has a fondness for peanut butter.
B000LNX06C My review title name comes from a verse in a Syd Barrett song called \"Rats\".Well, any rat that goes inside this baby is gonna get \"the rat's version of the electric chair\"I put this contraption in my shed and cought some big nasty rats (7 so far!)Just bait it up w/ some punut butter, cheese, or even dry dog kibble, flip on the switch and wait, when you see a blinking light, old rat-tat-tooie should be fried and ready to dispose of!Very recommended for anyone with rat problems.
B000LNX06C I followed the directions to a tee and I have yet to catch a single critter.The idea behind this trap is great! Allows for fast and easy trapping with little to no mess. A true \"No Touch\" design. Just dump the critter out and you're done.The issue seems to be that the rodents don't like it/completely avoid it. Not a single nibble on the peanut butter or ANY of the baits I tried.So I either have no mice or unwanted rodents (doubtful since the TomCat bait I set out gets nibbled on) or this thing is a complete waste of time, effort, and money.
B000LNX06C Prior to getting this from Amazon I'd gotten one before at Home Depot... the one Amazon sent me included batteries and peanut butter bait, which I wasn't expecting and was pleasantly surprised to see. These traps are designed to electrocute any heat emitting life-form that comes in after the bait. It's for indoor use and you need to be sure no pet you own could get to it. The size of the trap is ideal for rats, not too wide yet not too narrow for larger rats to get in. There's an indicator light that blinks once when you turn the trap on and which will have a sustained blink after the trap has been set off by something.There are times when my telepathic directives for rats to stay out of my home get ignored [and occasionally a rat will get through an entry point that can't be covered], and when that's occured I've tried a few different types of traps. The glue traps didn't work well as strong resourceful rats can break free of them and the glue loses effectiveness over time. Spring traps work better but they can miss their mark sometimes and they leave a messy sight when they do kill a rat. This electric trap has worked fine when used as directed and the bloodless dead rats are easy to dispose of. I also believe this is a more humane way to eliminate rats than other common trap designs or using rat poison bait.
B000LNX06C I have to admit that I was really looking forward to receiving this contraption.  I have a lot of suet and bird seed stored in a shed in my yard that mice have been continuously getting the better of.  I have used a lot of the old fashioned traps that work ok most of the time.  But the idea of zapping the little buggers and then just dumping them out quick and easy like appealed to me.  Unfortunately this new space age take on an old theme leaves a lot to be desired.  I have to start by mentioning the horrible battery compartment that other reviewers here have well verified as being,...Well, just horrible. It fools you at first look that it will be easy for its right on top of the unit.  However once you start trying to insert the 4 c batteries included, you will find it a total exercise in frustration.  I had to eventually use a screwdriver, as well as in the end ask for the aid of my son in holding down the batteries already inserted in order to get them all secured.  Its horribly tight, cheaply made, and I challenge anyone to get the batteries in this thing without using some very colorful metaphors.  Once armed and hot, the instructions are pretty simple. Load bait, place, dump the dead rat.  The first night that I used it, I caught a mouse, and continued too on and off for several hours.  I would say that about one time in three either the trap failed to work, or some scholarly mouse found a way to get to the peanut butter bait from behind without entering.  But this traps lack of a total kill ratio is not my major complaint with it.  I think its a great idea that this model merely represents an early prototype of.  First up is the electric shock that some other reviewers here re portably got while loading the batteries. That didn't happen to me, but the fact that it happened at all to anyone else is totally unacceptable.  I have used tasers and stun guns of all kinds in the past, and have never once suffered an accidental shock while just handling the batteries, or the outside of the unit.  This trap is very cheaply constructed, and the fact that some reviewers got a shock from it shows that either it is poorly insula
B000LNX06C Here are the two keys to this thang working properly for you: one is to load it up with cheese and peanut butter a few days ahead of zapping, then put in the batteries. Get the critters used to it and you'll get them easier. The second is to use the strongest alkaline batteries you can; rats etc are still living beings and deserve to become non-living as quickly and painlessly as possible. Plus which, weak normal batteries might not even kill them. And who wants an angry, half-zapped rat knocking on her bedroom door at four a.m.?Just pre-bait and use fresh, strong batteries, and this trap will do your dirty work for you.I doubt Rube Goldberg would approve, though: far too simple!
B000LNX06C UPDATE--After a few weeks, we hadn't caught anything, and the 4 C batteries were dead. Put in fresh batteries and tried it again. Two weeks later, the batteries are dead again, the food bait is gone, and I give up on this contraption. Great idea, but it just doesn't seem to work.Whether you live in the country, suburbs, or city, eventually you will be faced with a rodent problem. We've had issues in our crawl space. We first used cheap traps. Unfortunately, they were difficult to set and sometimes only maimed the poor critters. We then purchased a scary looking trap that did the job. However, it was so gross we ended up throwing out the trap and all.We are now using this device in the crawl space. We haven't caught anything yet, but we are sold on the idea that we don't ever have to touch the rat. Although expensive, this seems to be the best solution.
B000LNX06C We tested 7 different products over 9 months, and came out with a clear winner (traditional Victor trap).We didn't catch a single rat in the Victor Electronic trap - but I suspect it's because we were catching Norway rats that are pretty big, and we suspect the electronic trap is too small for them. There are many reports here of this trap working - we wonder if users would have caught their rats faster using the traditional Victor, & also we wish the other users would say what kind/size rats they are trapping.We baited all the traps the same (the Victor web site has great advice if you need more information on baiting & identifying the type & quantity of rats you have). Also, we rotated all the traps, so the rats had an equal chance at each trap. Additionally, the Victor Electronic successfully trapped/killed crickets, so we know the basic principle works.Results:*Victor Old Fashioned Rat Trap- 8 Norway Rats (caught 8 of 9)*Tomcat Rat Snap- 1 Norway Rat (caught 1 of 9, but did NOT kill it - maimed it, and left a bloody mess everywhere. This one gets an extremely reluctant recommendation, only if your rats are trap-shy around wood traps)*Victor Multi-Kill Electronic Mouse Trap- Zero (O)* D-Con Baitbits - Uncertain - They ate this but later were caught by a trap. These take 3-10 days to take effect, but then the carcass can wind up in a wall, under a floor, etc. Uncertain how much of a dose is necessary to kill a large rat such as a Norway. Probably would have worked by itself, but traps are preferred so you can measure effectiveness & dispose of carcass properly.*Tomcat Block Bait- Zero (0)* D-Con Rat Glue Traps - Zero (0) - This might work for mice, but an awful idea for rats. Just makes a mess - avoid!*Tomcat Old Fashioned Wood Trap- Zero (0), but the rat steals the bait every time. Tomcats do NOT snap. Just like a real Tomcat we once adopted - he would find rodents and play with them, tease them ... but not kill them. I even whacked the trap with a broom handle and it still didn't snap. Makes you wonder if the rat designed this one!Hope this helps - thanks!
B000LNX06C I got this rat trap hoping to use it to rid my yard of the voles (or something similar) that make tunnels all over the place each year.  Alas, the instructions say not to use it outside.  Upon further inspection, I see that \"For indoor use\" is part of the Amazon listing, but it is certainly not prominent.As I don't have any problem with little critters inside, I may go ahead and try it as I intended - if it shorts and/or self-destructs somehow, no great loss since it isn't doing me any good now.
B000LNX06C Back when I worked at a hardware store, we sold birdseed, grass seed, and all kinds of animal food. Of course the animals we fed the most were mice and rats.Being a retail store, regular mouse traps were out of the question, some idiot would stick their finger in one just to see what would happen. Mostly we used glue traps, but they can be messy and are only good once or twice at most. When these first came on the market, I tried one out for the store and caught over two dozen mice in one week.They are very effective, the only maintenance is checking it for mice or rats and changing the batteries as needed. You can bait them with peanut butter or a little birdseed, I prefer a bit of both myself. Each set of batteries is good for one to two dozen mice and rats, your mileage may vary.It is much quicker in killing the mice & rats than traditional methods; basic traps can be very messy and can wound instead of kill, glue traps suffocate when the glue covers their nose and mouth, but this can take a while, and poison takes a while to kick in ( basically they die from internal bleeding). and unlike those disposable traps coming on the market, you can use this one over and over again.
B000LNX06C I have been testing this unit for two months, and I am afraid nothing has happened.  I actually heard and seen critters in the area it is at, and not even a bug has been caught.  It's quite possible that I got a non-working unit, but I have no idea how to verify it's doing anything.  There is a switch on top that has an LED light that blinks a couple times with a slight buzz, then silent. No indicator light after that.  Supposedly the light will go back on when something is caught.Please note that this item does NOT come with batteries and peanut butter as some people are mentioning. Those items were provided to product testers only.  You will need to use your own bait and batteries.  With that said, I was given a small cup of Jif peanut butter.  It is messy to apply on the unit's back panel, as you have to smear into the holes. I am not too impressed with the baiting method.I was getting no response for a few weeks, so I put a whole cup of peanut butter inside, as well as Reese's corn puff cereal. Rodents love corn and nuts, so adding a corn product usually helps.  I am virtually offering them a buffet, and not one taken.  I suppose if the food was gone, and I have no terminated creature, then the unit would clearly be defective.It seems to be made well, however, I am afraid of touching the metal parts. It is supposed to be safe, but I'm still not putting my hand in there when it's \"on\".  Getting the batteries in the compartment was crazy hard.  Some design issues need to be addressed, as the placement method of baiting is just strange.  I would suggest a removable cup, or something we can place in it.I will continue to rotate the unit and place in areas where I know they would be. Primarily in my basement. If I ever catch one, I will edit this review.
B000LNX06C The Victor M240 Electronic Rat Trap is very effective in getting rid of rats. The Victor Electronic Rat Trap is very easy to use. It zaps the rats with an electronic charge and kills them instantely. I have used this for some time and it has been very effective.
B000LNX06C This unit works very well, and does so for mice as well. Slight nit-picking in that that LED only notifies for a 24 hour period of a kill. I keep this in my garage, and might not go in for 2-3 days. If there was a kill on the day after I was in, I wouldn't see the light blinking if it was a couple days later. It would've been just as easy to design this with a longer blinking \"Kill\" light. After all LED consumption is very minimal. But this doesn't affect the effectiveness, so it still gets 4 stars!Safe for kids it says on the site here. I guess it is safe in the sense that there are no poisons. The included instructions say to keep away from kids and pets. I imagine it would give a bit of a jolt if they stuck their hand/paw into the trap.
B000LNX06C Editing this review as it finally did catch one mouse and one rat after a month of use.  Poison worked faster and better.  However, it seems the shock can cause some of the animals to urinate thus it making it hard to clean and reset.The device itself needs improvement just to set up.  It took my husband's strength to get the batteries in and I can't even imagine trying to replace them.  He fumbled with it for about 5 minutes before finally getting them forced in.  The battery compartment just doesn't allow enough room for the batteries to line up and fit inside without extreme effort.Cleaning out the bait (peanut butter) to keep it fresh is also something that should be redesigned. You have to stick your hand in the enclosed trap itself to do that.  It would have made more sense if they had given it a door on the other end that opened for cleaning.Overall, it really needs some way to drain out urine if the animal urinates and maybe a bigger opening so they aren't afraid to go inside.
B000LNX06C The Victor zapped a mouse and then rearmed itself. We didn't discover the mouse until it started to rot.I'm not sure it will still work, since it now contains eau de decomposing vermin, but we'll see.
B000LNX06C This product was easy to set up and bait.I placed this trap in a place rats used to frequent in my garage.  Often in the past the snap traps would have sprung and the bait would be gone.  So far no false alarms (ie green light flashing but no rat) and the bait is still in place.The hardest part of this set up was getting the batteries properly placed.  It was a very tight fit.
B000LNX06C The reviews for this seem to indicate that people either love it or hate it.I've had bait stolen out of this trap so many times, and not one dead mouse/rat.  I've changed the batteries, moved it around, tried different bait, etc.  Nothing.I love the concept of this trap, but the quality/efficacy seems to be hit or miss.
B000LNX06C We used this rat trap and another at the same time and had greater results with the other brand.  This trap did work, we caught one in it.  But the product is pretty cheaply made and getting batteries in was annoying.The trick that worked for us is to put some dry dog food down in the area that you are going to put the trap.  Wait until the rats eat it.  Then put the trap in that area with dry dog food in it, do not turn it on.  Put a couple pieces outside the trap too.  Once that is gone, bait it again and this time turn it on.
B000LNX06C I've trapped a lot of rats, unfortunately for me, and for the rats. I've used a lot of different types of traps to do it, including snap traps, live traps, and glue traps.  Almost all of them work.  This one does, too--I promise.  But it does have some down sides.This type of trap has the advantage of being clean and reliable: bait it, flip the switch, and forget about it until the light flashes.  When a rat is killed, you don't have to touch it to dispose of it.  Just dump it, add some more bait, flip the switch, and you're good to go again.  Also, unlike a snap trap, it doesn't often need to be reset after having been triggered unsuccessfully--if the rat goes it, chances are pretty good it's going to be zapped, and if not, not much will cause the trap to need attention.  (There are exceptions.  See below.)But it has several disadvantages.  First, for the price, you can buy a lot of traditional snap traps, or several of the black plastic snap traps (such as the Tom Cat or Ortho) that are easier to bait and more weather resistant than the wood and metal type.  If you can deal with the snap traps, you're more likely to catch rats using three or four of them than one of these, and you'll still be saving money.Second, it's designed to be used only indoors; I haven't tried it outside but I suspect it won't take getting wet.  I prefer to catch rats before they get in my house.Third, with snap traps, I often hear when they're triggered, or if not, I can easily see if a rat's been caught.  With this trap, you have to look for the flashing green light to know if there's a rat inside. Worse, I had one experience where a rat apparently was killed, but managed to wander a few inches outside the trap before it died.  I didn't see any flashing light, and I noticed the rat only after it began to smell, leaving a real mess to clean up.On the whole, this is a good device for people who can afford it and don't want to mess around with unsanitary, trigger-happy snap traps and can use it indoors.  For most, though, I would suggest one of the other alternatives.
B000LNX06C I was able to use this trap successfully and trapped a rat within 24 hours. One of the kids in my family wiped it with a wet rag and we could not get the trap to work again, even after drying it for several days. It came with minimal instructions on cleaning and so I do not know if that is our fault. At forty bucks, it is fairly expensive and I am not really sure about its longevity and reliability.
B000LNX06C I have tried dozens of different options for rat killing in my attic. First of all, forget dealing with \"live catch\" traps. Rats are too smart for them, and you have to then drive the rat at least 3 miles away from your house to let them go or they will find their way back. Glue traps are one of the most effective for catching rats, but they are incredibly inhumane and even though they're just rats, I hate to think of them suffering like that. Then there is the old standard - the spring-loaded bar trap which everyone has seen. First, the majority of these are designed for mice and arent strong enough for rats. You have to buy a special one for rats that is about three times as big, and needs to be nailed into the floor to prevent a false release. That leaves only one real option - the electronic trap, which kills rats by shocking them with several thousands of volts of electricity once they step onto a trigger plate.The Victor M240 is the second electronic rat trap I've used (the first being the Agri Zap RZU001 Rat Zapper Ultra). One of the keys to using this trap is placement. It needs to be against a wall (which is how rats like to travel, they never run out into the open) and preferably in an area with rat activity. I also recommend wearing gloves when handling it so you don't get your scent on it (rats are incredibly wary about traps and will avoid it if they smell you). I baited mine by putting some peanut butter in a bottle cap and putting it in the back of the trap, and then putting a few pieces of dog food randomly right before the trap and in the safe area of it.The trapped worked very well, at first. I caught 4 rats with it within two weeks. However on the fourth rat, the trap just stopped working. This is actually the same exact problem I had with the Rat Zapper Ultra. I have no idea what was wrong, and everything appeared fine, but it wouldn't charge. It seems like these devices are not really meant to last, and I think maybe with all of the sudden charges, it sometimes just decides to give out.So the trap worked great while it lasted, but it didn't last long enough to justify the price. Additionally, if you decide to buy one of these, make sure you check it often, as leaving a dead rat inside it for a few days to rot will leave for an extremely unpleasant cleanup, and could easily cause the unit to stop functioning as the rat's fluids seep into the delicate electrical parts of the trap.
B000LNX06C At first I thought this would never be used. It literally took hours to try and get the batteries in. The space was too tight until I really forced them in. Then I turned it on, and a green light goes on, then goes off. I had no idea if the unit was a dud, or if it was working. PLEASE NOTE: Even though the light is out, it IS on, so be careful! I smeared a bit of peanut butter on it, and less than a day later this trap did the job on a mouse. Once again, a problem with the battery chamber.Rodents scare the beegeebers out of me. I put on industrial rubber gloves and steeled my nerves so as to pick up the trap and slide the critter out into a waiting bag. Terrified and only half certain that it mice do not 'play possum', I picked up the trap and nearly lost my grip as the battery cover nearly came off. I had split second flashes of an impossible possibility....trap exploding and a mouse flying up in the air and landing in my hair as I scream and flail my arms wildly in the air.As you can imagine, I was able to keep the unit intact and critter was deposited into it's final resting place without incident. I even took a photo to immortalize the event as no one would ever believe that mouse-a-phobe me slayed the beast, armed only with a Victor trap. I'll upload it later when my heart stops pounding.Sooooo.....I wish the box had stated that the unit is still working without the light on, and I wish the batteries went in smoothly. That being said, this is certainly more humane than a slow death with poison. It's also nice that it can be used over and over without winding up in a landfill. For a rat or mouse problem, I would 100% recommend it, it just needs a better battery chamber.EDIT: Yes, that is MY MOUSE in the photo I just uploaded, YIKES! And, 2 more caught without changing the battery. I am very happy with this trap.EDIT MAY 26th 2011: Having a problem and can not find a way to troubleshoot online. REALLY wish it had a manual. It had been off for a while, I reloaded it with peanut butter, and turned it on. It goes 'click click click' and the light flashes. Cleaned it, still doing it. GGgggrrrrrrr.
B000LNX06C We have an intermittent rat problem in my neighborhood. It's partly intermittent because one of the neighbors puts down a lot of poison.  As we have pets, this is not an option.We tried this trap on numerous occasions. The set- up is pretty easy.  We never caught a rat or anything else in here.  Could be they were too smart or could be the neighbor got them all... but it didn't work for us.
B000LNX06C This really is a great way to catch those nasty critters!Cleanup is easy and simple.There is one this that I would like to see changed and that is the COLOR of the little light - it would be better if it were red!!!!
B000LNX06C Executive Summary:  Worth owning even if it never zaps anything.  I'll edit this review as results roll in.This trap is precious from the first quizzical expressions of those seeing and reading the box until you impatiently wait for the sound that must come.  That sound of something rat size spiritually exiting the property.  Eventually, it'll happen.  YesssssNow, for the first time ever, I regret my lack of squalor and the associated pestilence.  So, the trap sits on the roof baited with hen scratch.  After one full day, no flying verminous victims.  Yet.  I know those pigeons will be back when they need to take a dump.  Patience.  If it does nail a pigeon, then a gas station owning friend will likely borrow it for a while.This is one of those things that becomes a man cave treasure.  It'll be an endless subject of conversation, dares, and gambling.So, who do I know with a rat problem...
B000LNX06C looks like it will work... came with batteries... came with a little bit of peanut butter... the 'blinken light' came on when turned on... but, but...after careful placement in line with an observed path, not a single rat after several days of hope for giving a single rattus rattus the chair!on the other hand, my three $2 glue traps nailed five over two nights, with two two-fers!those dirty rats! they must have known what what waiting for them!
B000LNY4C6 I used these with my Weber Smokey Mountain 22.5 and enjoyed the smoke flavor.  I think it could have been even more but still worked out very well!
B000LNY4C6 We used these chunks with chicken and with ribs. We did not have to refill while smoking since they were big enough and burned evenly.  Both meats had fantastic flavor and turned out delicious.
B000LNY4C6 These chunks work well for a smaller smoker.  No need to soak them as it has been proved that it does no good.
B000LNY4C6 Anybody serious about smoking needs to get some of these chunks. For the cost it's worth experimenting with different woods until you find the one that best suits you.So far cherry and apple are my favorite!
B000LNY4C6 bought these for my daily BBQ , but haven't use them yet thats why only 4 stars  there larger then expected but that's good should give a good smoke thanks 9/8/13
B000LNY4C6 I own a medium sized Big Green Egg and prefer to use wood chucks instead of chips. I am always surprised how expensive bags of wood are from Home Depot, by local BGE dealer or at my local supermarket. I'm somewhat amazed, but this bag actually cost a bit less than what I can buy locally and as an Amazon Prime member, I got free two day shipping. You just can't beat it!The chunks are exactly the right size and the wood appears to have been well aged. Also, at least as far as I can see, no pieces of bark are included. (Bark makes for a bitter taste in whatever you smoke.)By my thinking, this is why I shop at Amazon: good prices and ease of shopping. It sure is easier to have UPS lug wood to my door than for me to lug it from the store.
B000LNY4C6 There's not much to say about wood chunks, but, I've purchased 3-4 bags of different chunks of Weber brand and am happy with very minimal bark on the chunks.  the only reason I gave this a &#34;four star&#34; was that about 1/2 of the chunks are too big to fit into the Weber Summit Grill Smoke cage.  I end up splitting them with a hammer and chisel.  I purchased a different brand and had the same issue, but the other brand also had more bark on the chunks than the weber brand.
B000LNY4C6 You may find these cheaper but you'll get a mixed bag of chips/chunks. You can always trust the weber brand to be great quality.
B000LNY4C6 These are good size medium chunks and my husband using them for our smoker.  They worked and the smell was nice.  They seem to be over priced, we found similar wood at a local store and they were much cheaper and seem to do just as good of job.  Great for ease of delivery, but shop around to see what you can find at home first.
B000LNY4C6 I was pleased to see applewood offered by Weber. You might want to split some of these chunks if you're using a home smoker (I use a Weber 22.5\") -- these are manly-sized chunks. Too much hardwood smoke over a long period can impart more flavor than you might want, so tread lightly. Make sure to soak these for an hour or two beforehand. A bag will last you quite some time.
B000LNY4C6 Having recently received a smoker for Christmas, I knew I would have to get some wood to smoke with. After doing research, I learned that wood chunks are MUCH better than wood chips because chips require soaking and burn up quickly. Wood chunks do not require soaking and smoke a good amount. Also with that research, I learned of which type of wood provides specific flavoring. I made my selections based on the following description from a well known BBQ site:Apple: Slightly sweet but denser, fruity smoke flavor. The strongest flavor of all the fruitwoods. Beef, poultry, game birds, pork (particularly ham)Pecan: Sweet and mild with a flavor similar to hickory  but not as strong. Tasty with a subtle character an all-around superior smoking wood.  Good for most things including poultry, beef,  pork and cheese. Pecan is the best for that beautiful golden-brown turkey.With that said, I decided on apple wood and pecan wood. After shopping around locally (and comparing to Amazon while shopping), I found that the wood chunks were cheaper than my local stores.Unlike other reviewers, both bags of wood (apple and pecan 5-pounders) that I received were nice sized chunks and nowhere near the size of \"chips\" like they stated. Of course those reviews were back in 2010 and 2011. So maybe Weber improved the quality of their content over time.Highly recommended.
B000LNY4C6 For the price or for any reason really, this stuff works great. I like to get it started with some smaller wood chips and I'll explain how.In a small bucket filled with water, I put in enough chunks to cover the bottom of my smoking tray. I also put it about the same surface area of chips. This soaks for around 20 minutes. I may even throw in the chunks 10 minutes soon for a total of a 30 minute soak. After my smoker and water tray is good and warm, I'll put some dry chips, the wet chips and the chunks. The dry chips get to smoking first and let the soaked chips start a little sooner. Then you aren't wasting fuel waiting for them to catch a smoke. I can really start smoking with the dry chips in less than 20 minutes at 215 degrees and then when they burn out, the soaked chips are going, and soon after the chunks.At 210 on my camp chef, the smoke starts to die down after a few hours. Usually about 2. If it were hotter they'd just keep pouring smoke, but I don't want that. I just want my smoke to last a couple hours and then lightly smoke. Some would remove the chips altogether, but I find that I don't have to and thats just one less time opening the door for me and my food.On a small note, I do have to chop these up so they'll fit under my water tray. A small hatchet works just fine or even a claw hammer.
B000LNY4C6 these wood chunks added a much needed flavor to my ribs.The smoky sweet taste works well with the tangy sauce i usually use on my ribs.All in all happy bellies = happy family,
B000LNY4C6 These chips worked very well and lasted a few hours. I have not used many other chips so these are the est so far for me. Pork shoulder came out with a great taste.
B000LNY4C6 These arrived on time and as described. I am a BBQ fanatic, but this product didn't seem to excel over any other brand of Apple wood I have tried. It performed as expected by producing some great flavors in the food.
B000LNY4C6 I bought this apple wood chunks to smoke pork tenderloin and they worked great. I have since found some pecan wood chips that leave a nutty flavor on smoked chicken.
B000LNY4C6 First time using wood chunks and love it. I only have to throw a three chunks on the coals and works great. I need to order more.
B000LNY4C6 Nice apple smoky flavor. What else can you say. Used them last month when smoking a pork butt. Did the job.
B000LNY4C6 I use these apple chunks with the Charcoal Companion Stainless Steel V-Shape Smoker Box and it is perfect.  Whether you soak the chunks (longer smoke time) or not (maybe 20 minutes of smoke with 2-3 chunks) they will give your food that perfect kiss of smoke.  I have used with fish, chicken and even veggies like brussels sprouts and the apple is just the right amount of smoke.
B000LNY4C6 Love the flavor these pieces give your smoked meats.  Good price and quantity on these apple wood chunks.  Great value.
B000LNY4C6 The wood chunks were of a good size.  The bag included some smaller pieces, but was mostly good size chunks.
B000LNY4C6 Good product.  Quality wood at a great price.  Don't waste time or money....  This is a good way to go.
B000LNY4C6 You just never know what Apple Tree this came from, I love the fact when it comes from a yellow or green apple tree because it leaves such a unique smoked color finish and layer on the meat  that it was smoked in; nothing against red apple trees but there's a difference and that's what makes it all fun! You can almost always tell what apple tree it hailed from by looking at the core part of the chunk, for Reds would be darker, Greens always leaves a greenish hues; while Yellows are nearly almost very light in color. There's a difference in taste as well; Reds always have that rich &#34;apple&#34; flavor, and Greens leaves a greenish hue which is awesome on a Turkey and has a &#34;fruity&#34; overtone and while Yellows has both an Apple and Fruity overtone and leaves the flesh of the meat quite rich in golden in color. With beef or pork, Yellows brings a nice spin and a change of pace in BBQ and Smoking which is just great. I have used some Cherry Wood with Green Apple wood  for an all round tropical flavor using tropical or Caribbean Jerk or fruity BBQ (which can be mild to as hot as you want it to be) - so Smoking with Apple wood is quite fun indeed as much as it is the fact I love surprises; for I do not want to know what kind of Apple wood is coming until the day it arrives! bringing this Professional Grill Chef up for a challenge and yes I have had several bags with a mix of variety of apple wood - the more surprises for me. I'm all up for the challenge!
B000LO4FFG The Good:  I got this to work on my potted outdoor plants, but it took a lot of fiddling and its not as neat as I would have hoped.  I can now say all of my potted plants (7) are watered daily and the system is doing what it was designed to do, but again, it was a struggle.The Bad: The brown tubing is the main problem.  It is very inflexible and you cannot snake it where you need it without upsetting everything you worked on previous.  The precut holes are too big and when you insert a secondary tube, the connection is not secure and there is a lot of leakage.  Overall, this was a lot more trouble than it was worth and I would not recommend it.
B000LO4FFG I purchased this Rain Bird GRDNER-KIT Landscape Drip-line System Gardener-Foots Drip Starter Kit to set up my garden for drip irrigation and hopefully stay ahead of the summer heat in Mississippi.  Considering the individual prices of the components, it is a good buy for the $24.97 spent and the Amazon Prime Two-Day Shipping is free.
B000LO4FFG If you get a package in the mail and it's missing an item, Rain Bird will not help you, so just send it all back.  My package was missing the pressure regulator and calling Rain Bird doesn't help.
B000LO4FFG Every kit has a irrigation plan, the closer you are to liking their plan the more money you might save.  I can't imagine this kit will supply all your needs that is why it is called starter. Plan on spending much more if you are irrigating a large garden.  The 50' feet of blank 1/2&#34; hosing only supplied 1/3 of my needs. Some fittings I needed a lot more of and some I will not use. Rain Bird is usually high quality stuff so that is not a problem.If you do not know how to install an irrigation system, the term &#34;Starter&#34; might be confusing. This is not a kit for beginners. It will not teach you how to install a drip system.  Since I moved and had to create a new garden, this was the start or the beginning of the things I might need to complete the drip system. It save me the time and effort to get-together some of the needed drip system items together.  It has an excellent start-up to hooking the drip system into the standard hose connection. This kit was worth it to me but I can see it would be worthless to others. A feed-backer was kind and generous to provide a list of what came with the kit. Make sure you read it and understand what you are getting.There are great online irrigation courses, It really not that hard to install. The hardest part is pressing this stuff together.  Good Luck
B000LO4FFG Ok So far so good!  Receieved it rather quickly which is good because we cannot wait to get started with hooking it up!Also it is a little bigger then we thought!  Even though it showed a picture of what was coming we ordered two kits because we did not think we were gonna have enough materials for our whole garden area!  Actually we probably only need half of the other kit to complete our garden area in our back yard and we were gonna order only one for the front!  After doing some measuring we will only need one and a half kits to complete the front but we will need more 1/4&#34; inch parts!  For those who feel they need to have something like this because if you are like us where my husband works all day, and I am disabled so by the time he gets home to water we are watering at night and that is not good as it promotes mold to do it that way!  Now we are awaiting the timer we bought so between this setup and the timer we won't even have to think of watering!  I have tried Dripline watering in the past and only using the 1/4&#34; is great but we needed a lot of it!  Now with the assistance of the 1/2&#34; hose we won't have to have so much 1/4&#34; hose and attachments!Also for those who are new to this when it starts to change season and cold whether is approaching you will want to actually take it all apart and bring it indoors as the system can freeze and brake apart!  Water can and does get trapped in the hoses and if that happens water when it freezes expands and will rupture!  You will loose parts in cold whether and or they can become damaged!  The 1/4&#34; accessories like sprayers and misters and so on are great but because how small they are, are very fragile!  They can become loose from the hoses also and can become lost and so on!  It is just best that you make sure the hoses are completely drained prior to putting them away and you might want a case for all of the attatchments so this way they do not get lost in the shuffle!If you are looking for a good system this is the one to go with especially if you need to either start all over or if you are only just starting out!  I do not know why we waited so long to get into micro irrigation!  If we would have known about this sooner then 3 years ago we would have been involved way sooner!As for how it shipped, Amazon you should be ashamed of yourselves!  How could you place these two boxes in such a large box?  And by the way the UPS delivery man said to me it was taped so poorly that he almost lost the contents out in the street!  The man managed to get it up to my door with box boxes in there, but hey you should try to consider using more tape!  What is it?  You can afford to buy more tape for your employees to use?  Or is it that you can't afford to use good tape that will actually stick?  Bad move Amazon, because if anything was missing you would have had to hear my mouth and I would have considered returning what ever was left to you guys getting a refund and never ordering from you again!  I swear its like hit or miss with you people!  You are 99% of the time sending items in boxes that are way to big taking a big risk with the items inside with getting destroyed and then having to replace or refund customers!  It's a mystery how you guys are still in business with how much money you must waste in replacing items that are destroyed from your poor packaging!
B000LO4FFG Love it! This was my first drip irrigation installation and it was very simple to install. Really wish I would have done it sooner. I paired it with a Melnor Aqua Timer and it's working like a charm. Matches brown mulch fairly well, but I do plan to cover it up with more mulch.I thought the kit had quite a good assortment for a starter kit. I personally needed more than one end cap and a few more galvanized stakes to curve around shrubbery as the tubing is kind of stiff (small pruning shears will cut the tubing, maybe even scissors). The great thing is that all of the Rain Bird items did arrive in only one Amazon box.The 1 GPH emitters make it easy to give more water to plants that like it wet if you have plants with various watering needs, and the tool makes those very easy to pop into the side of the tubing. A real \"whew..this is going to be a breeze\" moment on the very first one. My small front yard took a little less than 30 minutes.I am back to buy more parts and another kit today for the back yard to go up through greenhouse containers and back though a vegetable garden. Easy to get carried away with this stuff :)
B000LO4FFG This is a great starter kit.  It's really for a small size garden or landscaping project.  You'll need more for anything larger.  There simply isn't enough bubblier or heads to accommodate anything larger.  The lines are easy to cut using a box cutter or utility knife.  One nice thing about that stakes is that is is deeper that the general garden stake and holds the hose in place better.  Unfortunately I can't find anything that deep at my local hardware store.
B000MISU5W One of my friends bought the Black and Decker chainsaw for her husband because he was always borrowing mine. So I bought this chain as an accessory for a birthday present! Something I know he will use
B000MISU5W I have both the 8 inch B&D; chain saw and the pole version.  The new chain is easy to install (B&D; has PDFs of the users' manuals at their site if you can't find the one that came with the saw). I like having an extra chain so I can swap them out when they get dull, and sharpen the dull one when I have the time.  Beats having to stop working because of a dull chain.The B&D; products, while very portable and handy for small pruning jobs, are not all that powerful even with a fresh battery charge.  A sharp chain makes all the difference in getting the pruning done quickly even if the battery charge lags a bit.For some reason, it's hard to find this at a store.  Amazon comes through again!
B000MISU5W To be honest have only used this a couple times since I installed it on my saw but so far just as good as original equipment chain
B000MISU5W quality chain and well designed..cuts very fast and clean..this chain makes the tool..teeth on chain is very aggressive and that's whats makes this chain outstanding
B000MISU5W What do you say about a chain for a chain saw?  They look good and if they fit my saw when I make my first change they will be fine.  The saw only came with one chain installed so thought it wise to have a couple on hand.
B000MISU5W I installed the replacement chain on my Black & Decker pole saw and it fit perfectly.The chain cuts just as good as the original one it came with and it was a good price.
B000MISU5W These chains are inexpensive. I have so many trees and bushes that I have to buy one of these chains every year but the B&D tool is so handy and easy to use I don't know how I'd get along without it. The chain is easy to install and rejuvenates my pole saw.
B000MISU5W Using this on my 18volt cordless chain saw, it's a low kick back saw, and cordless chain saw are low rpm to begin with, so I guess that \" MADE IN CHINA\" part doesn't bother me, keep it well lube, before during and after each use, put ptfe dri-film on it befor putting on new sets, for around the house maintance, not a professional saw for sure. And remember to clean it up, it do get stuck easily when batteries are low.
B000MISU5W The little Black and Decker saw wasn't sawing as well as it used to so I finally got around to putting on the new chain. It feels like having a new saw now. Installing the new B&D; chain was easy; in an ambitious mood I also changed the chain on a 16\" electric saw and found the Black and Decker change much easier.I have noticed that the new chain needs to be retightened more often than an old chain. This is a small price to pay for the added sharpness and ease of cutting.With the recent spate of high winds, I've got lots of fallen limbs to cut, and the cordless chainsaw is perfect for the job.For those of you who are handier and more patient than I am, it would be cheaper to just sharpen your chain, but that's a job I've never tackled with any success.
B000MOIWWM Good size and deep enough to grab a lot.  That's what you want and that's what you get.  Built rugged and think will hold up to hot sun and pool chemicals
B000MOIWWM I do my own pool care and I use this to get rocks out of the pool so they don't get stuck in the vacuum.  Have left outside in the AZ for a while in the summer and it didn't immediately fall apart but I try to keep it out of the sun when I remember.
B000MOIWWM I have a lot of leaves falling into the pool for my water fountain, and this makes it much easier to clean the pool, so I clean more often, which also makes the job easier and the water cleaner.
B000MOIWWM I have a shallow net that I purchased last year that I was hoping would have a little more net.  So I purchased this.  It is great for scooping leaves and I like it very much.  Worth the price.
B000MOIWWM I have not used as much as I thought because I don't have as many leave as I thought I would. But, it is a sturdy good product. After i purchased the &#34;Water Tech Pool Blaster Max&#34; it's hard to go back to manual...
B000MOIWWM Love this pool bag...it is perfect for scooping leaves out of my pool.  It is flat on the front and fits right up to the side of the pool.  This is the BEST bag I have ever used.  It also holds a lot of leaves.
B000MOIWWM replaced my old one that began to tear. these are very reasonably priced and work well. well manufactured for what I need
B000MOIWWM This is not nearly as big as I though it would be, but it does do the job. Seems to be made well enough to last a while
B000MOIWWM Tried this out this week and was happy with the results but wish the bag was a little longer to keep the leaf catch in the bag when it gets pretty full. Really like the scooper/shovel front lip -- that truly does an excellent job on even the silt on the bottom. Will see how this works over the summer in the height of the season. More later . . .
B000MOIWWM Being a new pool owner I don't have anything to compare this to, but it seems to do the job.  It collects all the leaves and bugs that float on the surface of the pool as well as some of the leaves that fall to the bottom.  It scoops up the leaves at the bottom quite easily actually.  One thing that would improve this would be to note which side is up (maybe change the color of the up side?) because if you try to scoop anything from the wrong side it won't work.Update:  I purchased this in mid April and by early August noticed the seam at the bottom of the net has come out.  Too late to return it now!  I'm going to have to break out with my sewing kit to fix this.  I had hoped this would be the only net/rake I would need but now I'm thinking it will probably need to be replaced annually if not sooner.
B000MOIWWM This pool rake is sorry quality and doesn't last.  It did not last even one pool season.  In fact it broke after 2 months of use.  The netting is OK but the plastic frame is weak and broke rendering the tool useless.  Don't waste your money!
B000MOIWWM I opened my pool for the season and there were leaves all over the place. After running the pool for a few hours, the leaves were grouped in several piles on the bottom. I put the on the end of my pole (fits perfectly!) and within a few minutes, the piles of leaves were gone. I'll use the skimmer to grab the stragglers.This thing has a big mouth so although it picks up the leaves quickly, it's also hard to move fast. Not a big deal since I only needed to use it for a short period of time.
B000MOIWWM I've used this a few times now in an 18' above ground pool. I am able to clean the pool well enough with this pool rake. If held just right, it does a decent job of picking up the settled debris. I do not have any trees close to my pool so I don't have many heavy leaves to contend with as most pool owners do. However, even with my smaller-sized pool and only light debris to pick up, I will be amazed if I can get through one season with this pool rake. It is very flimsy and the net is not attached well to the frame. It's cheaper than many pool rakes but I've had better rakes in the past which cost less. This pool rake doesn't begin to come close to being a professional type pool rake or resemble anything near being heavy duty. I am having to be overly slow and gentle moving this rake through the water.
B000MOIWWM Apparently, it is very difficult to find a deep water leaf bag that has tightly woven mesh.  All of our local pool stores had mesh with way too wide of openings and would let too much debris through.  This was exactly what we were looking for.So far, this product has met expectations and appears to be constructed as well as our old one that lasted several years.  I would recommend this to anyone looking for a deep water leaf bag.  Just be sure it fits your pole.
B000MOIWWM I've been needing a new skimmer for quite some time but could never remember to go by a pool supply store.  I finally decided to check out Amazon and was pleased to find I could get one here - Prime even!  My current skimmer is a basket style which is really nice when you are picking up lots of leaves, but I found it a problem when a turtle was found swimming around.  It scooped it up nicely, but folded over on itself when I tried to drop the turtle over the fence (there is a field behind me).  So, my decision was to get this one for leaves as well asHydrotools 8039 Professional Heavy Duty Leaf Skimmerfor when I am picking up turtles or anything else I want to send over the fence.As has been noted, the frame is plastic and the net seems to be a plastic mesh.  They have been fused together.  I'm not sure how long it will be for there to be a separation, but I don't have high expectations for any of these nets.  Fortunately, it is reasonably priced, even if it makes it through only one season.
B000MOIWWM This little net holds alot of debris without having to empty. I can do my whole pool and only empty when I get done. Plus I can get the stuff off the bottom as well
B000MOM7KK This is a nice little skimmer net.  I hit a large number of whiffle practice golf balls in my above ground pool and this is perfect for retrieving them.
B000MOM7KK This is an ok quality skimmer. Like several have said, not quite what it used to be. New versions won't last longer than two seasons most likely. Mine has developed a hole in the mesh. It just get kind of brittle while the old version which looks pretty much the same just better materials stayed flexible. You can still scoop lots of leaves with ease.
B000MOM7KK I get quite a bit of debris in my pool so use this on a weekly basis. The frame is very sturdy plastic and looks like it will last a long time, ditto for the mesh. The design of the frame is such that scraping leaves on the bottom of the pool is pretty easy. Somehow the taper on the front of the frame makes it easy to get under the leaves. Not sure why it works so well but it does. Good investment over the cheapo skimmers you usually see at the pool supply stores.
B000MOM7KK I use this for my back yard pond. The main reason I like this is that it allows my to scoop leaves and algae without getting my fish lost in the netting. I bought it with their telescopic pole and it attaches great.
B000MOM7KK Nice Size & Quality. Happy with shipping and price. I hope to have a long time. Everything i have purchased form &#34;Hydro Tools&#34; has been pretty good.
B000MOM7KK I do my own pool care and the filter gets most of the stuff but this is good for getting rocks off the bottom of the pool etc.
B000MOM7KK I will admit that I returned this already, but potential purchasers should know it wasn't because of the quality of the construction. It's got a nice lip, and wide mouth. It didn't concern me that it was all plastic even. But the mesh is not fine enough to use as a surface skimmer, which is why I needed this.
B000MOM7KK I've been needing a new skimmer for quite some time but could never remember to go by a pool supply store.

B000MOM7KK This is much heavier and bigger then the one that came with our pool.  It does not come with a handle but the old one that broke handle fit this one just fine.
B000MOM7KK So, my story is that I get frogs in my pool...its irritating and I cant do much to get rid of the darn things.  I have tried everything.  That being said we need a leaf skimmer to grab em and get em out of the pool.  (great writing eh...is em in the dictionary, hahaha).  Any how, we were buying one of these a year at the local pool store and it cost about $[...] - for a smaller size.  I finally figured I would try Amazon...I am switching to Amazon for almost everything we need regularly.  Voila...great product, arrived quickly, LARGER size, and a better value.  I do however have a strange feeling that this will last longer and we may not  need to replace it next year..it is of commercial quality.5/5
B000MOM7KK I have been using a bag-type skimmer ever since we got the in-ground pool.  I thought this style would be handier; I could scoop up some leaves, swing around, and deposit them outside the pool area.  Not so.  The skimmer doesn't capture many leaves, or anything else, at all.  Maybe I don't really know how to use it correctly, but it doesn't work for me.
B000MR6WRG I'd been looking at these for natural pest control for a while, and then when the price dropped, I bought two containers. They may or may not help with my plants that are being devoured by mystery bugs, but that's not really why I bought them. I bought them because my 4-year-old son loves ladybugs (and what kid doesn't?), and I thought it would be fun to let him have a whole mess of 'em. I was right. He was very excited about them, and wanted to keep them all in the container. (As I write this, there are still several in the container on the coffee table, feeding on raisins. New hobby, here we come.) I've blown way more money on a lot less entertainment. And if some annoying pests get devoured in the process, all the better.They appeared to have arrived mostly alive; I put both containers in the fridge on Monday and released one batch on Wednesday night. I didn't notice any dead bugs at all. The second batch, which we took out on Saturday, had about a 66% survival rate. I'm not sure what \"1,500 count\" refers to, unless it's legs or spots; I'd estimate the count at closer to 500 bugs at best. However, some people who know math way better than I do estimate that one 500ml container will hold upwards of 7,000 ladybugs, so...what do I know?
B000MR6WRG My lady bugs all arrived in great condition. I only had 5 or 6 dead ones upon arrival. I released them in accordance with the instructions about a month ago. Though they have spread out in my garden I still see a few here and there. This is so much better than spraying toxic poisons where my dogs play.
B000MR6WRG Well, the price is OK, but while I expected some of the ladybugs to be DOA, it looked to me that out of 1500 about 300-400 came dead.  I will look for local suppliers in the future.
B000MR6WRG My package arrived with almost all of the bugs alive and well, even with economy shipping. I am not sure if they are \"adults\", as they are only between 4-5mm long. The container has food inside, but I don't know how long these ladybugs can last without water.Little ladybugs love crawling around, so as soon as the cover is taken off, they are all over the edge. This at first presents a difficulty when I try to put the cover back on, but I eventually figure out that I should tap the side continuously so that most of the bugs fall back inside while a few escapees drop onto the target plant.The count may or may not be accurate. My best guess is about 1000, enough for most home gardens. Mine has periodical infestations of spider mites, and I don't want to use pesticides. I hope these ladybugs will help.
B000MR6WRG I received the package late, the package was dumped upside down next to the door, and after refrigerating them for a day, i found the majority of them were dead. I would say under 100 actually survived to be released. Not very happy with this at all.After doing a little research (a little too late, but whatever, i found you can order them directly from High Sierra, which you can find online. Again, that is High ?@@#$# Sierra). Most of the distributors apparently purchase from them first, so why not avoid the middle man? I will be (no shipping costs either).
B000MR6WRG I had a lot of aphids everywhere.  Almost all of the ladybugs were alive when they arrived.  They did the job beautifully :)
B000MR6WRG I hate to gripe about this purchase as I enjoyed releasing the few ladybugs that I did receive. Suffice it to say that I hand-released most of these little ladies and was done in under an hour. There were a number of ladybug corpses, but still only about 100 or so. I don't know what this company is doing when it comes to parceling out these bugs, but they need to find a new method.As for what the bugs did after they were released, well that isn't the company's fault. They do tend to wander off. Still, I keep seeing ladybugs near the release location and there were only about 100 of them to begin with. I feel like the few bugs hanging aroundI'd make a stink about being ripped off if I thought 10 bucks was worth the aggro. Still, this is definitely a case of \"buyer beware\". Go try your local nursery for bugs if you need them, that way you'll be able to see what you're getting before you shell out the money.
B000MR6WRG Ladybugs hatch and are quite active in the spring and early summer, lay their eggs and migrate away in the fall.  So its preferable to buy them early in the season if you want them to finish off the aphids on your roses, but okay to buy them late in the season if you want hatching ladybugs the following year.  I've tended to buy some early and release them once the first frosts are over, and again when they're on sale in the fall.This has worked out well for me.  This year I dont think I need to buy any, as its hard to pick out a square foot of flowers or ivy in my yard that doesnt have at least 4-5 ladybugs on it, feasting away on the nuisance bugs.
B000MRD5JO I bought this for my lawn to help fight fleas and other insects. I followed the directions and applied it to my lawn this past summer. It was hard to tell if it reduced the number of insects in my yard, because their population seems to vary at different times of the summer depending on the rainfall and how often I cut my lawn. I definitely did not see a drastic reduction or elimination.
B000MRD5JO I used this product around my cabbage planted in spring 13.  I had usually grown cabbage in the fall with bad worm/slug infestation.I had some but not as many slugs and worms but not as many.  Not sure if it was due to this product or different season.  Should have tried on a different crop.
B000MRD5JO Product arrived quickly and in good shape. I honestly don't remember if they had a cold pack or not, but I do remember they were out of the original box for some reason (original box was included thankfully, because it has the instructions on it). I ordered during a cool period here in the PNW, so I wasn't too concerned about temperatures at the time. I plan to order more in the spring, so I'll update that info then since I know it's one of the things people like to know about this product. The nematodes were inside a small plastic tupperware sort of thing, akin to a small sour cream container. Inside that was little chunks of a spongy looking sort of thing which, as I understand it, serve as a carrier for the nematodes themselves.Before use, I did a cursory check for viability using 60x magnification. I'm no scientist, but I absolutely did see little squirmy worms in there. It actually took me a minute but once I figured out what I was looking at/for, they were all over the place. Break for a little happy dance, and we're back to the show...As I said, the box has instructions printed on the side. Seems pretty easy to understand (and it is), but there are some options to choose from depending on your specific use. I'm doing a small container garden indoors,  as I'm sure some of you are too. So here's what I did...The instructions say something about soaking the nematodes in water for 5 minutes (something like that, just read the box). I was only using a portion of the quantity ordered, so I transferred that portion to another container and adjusted my water amount accordingly.I then prepared some peat moss. I prefer 100% peat to pro-mix or similar, so I used 100% sphagnum peat moss (~$12/3cu.ft. at Home Depot)  and I think some lime to buffer ph, but check what ph these nematodes like to be sure you get it the way you want it. I forget if I added any, sorry about that. When I make another batch, I will update this review. Otherwise just use Pro-Mix or Sunshine #4 or whatever makes you feel good, it's not that big a deal. I used about half a 5 gallon bucket for my application.So then I took my prepared nematodes, along with a good bit of extra water (get a couple gallons, use what you need), to a roughly half-filled 5 gallon bucket and mixed lovingly to make something of a slurry.I promptly top dressed my container garden with this slurry and watered it in well.Points to mention:I allowed my containers to somewhat dry out before application. This is for a couple of reasons...fungus gnats don't like that, and this application process involves a good bit of watering.I added the slurry right before &#34;lights out&#34;. While I would normally advocate for watering container plants at &#34;lights on&#34;, this is an exception because these little nematodes are like ninjas, or Spec Op assassins, which ever you prefer. Point being they prefer the cover of darkness to make their entry.I have a suspicion that a good EWC/compost tea will do the same as these nematodes (only &#34;better&#34; for my purpose), but I don't have anything to back that up. Experiments are ongoing, but I'm currently out of fungus gnats.Summary:If you have (or would like not to have) fungus gnats in your container garden, this product, used correctly, is what you need. I found it easy to use and, as near as I can tell, absolutely effective (read: no more fungus gnats).
B000MRD5JO I was pretty skeptical, I will admit.  I used this in my houseplants because somewhere along the way I got house gnats / fungus gnats.  My biggest issue is they would swarm my Kindle at night when I'm trying to read!  But they were also just piles of them by the windows where they tried to fly away, I guess?So I mixed it up according to the directions (not the spray directions, the other directions where you mix it into the soil with water).  It's about 2 weeks later and I haven't seen any in a few days now and if there are any left, there has been a near-extinction event for them!  I was pretty skeptical whether or not this would work, especially inside houseplants, but I'll say it did a great job.  I'm a little concerned about what the little buggers are going to eat now though, if they've run out of food!It seems to have worked in my carnivorous plants sitting in wet spaghum moss, cactus sand/soil, peat, and various mixtures of soils.  It even worked in the plants that use a bark mix, like my orchids.  I think my collection of sundews might miss all the meals they were getting, but we'll manage somehow.  :-)
B000MRD5JO We had gotten the dreaded fungus gnats in our greenhouse. We tried mosquito dunks and that didn't work (read online the same bacteria in that kills FG larvae) but it didn't seem to work. Bought these, mixed them in water and basically watered them in. I thought it worked pretty fast and supposedly the effect lasts up to two years.
B000MRD5JO I bought this for my lawn to help with grubs and wood boring insects.  I arrived quickly.  These are tiny things (microscopic) that you can not see.  It is like a powder in a small plastic bag.  It comes with instructions on how to mix it with water and use either a sprayer or watering can.I followed the instructions and used a watering can.  Here is a youtube video showing how small the nematodes are and how they work:[...]
B000MRD5JO When mixing the product it did gross my wife out, don't ask me why. This is the first time I've used it, so we will have to wait until next spring to see how well it works.
B000MU2MJA We enjoy leaving the back door open in good weather, and sometimes a few persistent flies get in. my wife despises regular fly swatters because they 'splat' fly guts everywhere.This device fries the fly in flight, leaving little residue, along with a satisfying 'snap'.  This also works on larger insects, such as wasps.I used to think flies were annoying.  Now they are target fodder.
B000MU2MJA I have had \"The Executioner\" for a few months and love it. No matter how well I try to keep them out, flies inevitably make it into my home to my despair. Now when I see a fly I jump up and take it down quickly without leaving a mess to wipe off the wall, floor, counter, or worse yet the table. Ever find yourself swinging a traditional fly swatter wildy and not know if you actually got it or not? The bright blue spark and loud pop provides instant feedback that I got the fly in mid air! No more wondering if I got it or not. Works great, great price, no mess, cannot go wrong here.+ Price+ Effectiveness (though rarely the fly will and not die on the first zap)+ ON button must be held to operate (can set it down and not worry about it being left on for the cat to step on)+ No Mess+ Blue spark and \"pop\"+ Works on other insects- Occasionally does not totally kill a fly but usually leaves them incapacitated and unable to fly_Bottom Line_ Yes, I would recommend this to a friend looking to get rid of flys without having to clean up a mess. The only thing that could be better is having one in each hand! Works great! I use \"The Exectioner\" and then just a quick vacuum attachement to get them off the floor. Super easy and clean.
B000MU2MJA This swatter has thick wires which should be durable.  There is no outer screen so the insect is sure to contact them.  My wife said it made a sound like a bomb going off when the fly contacted it.  The fly died quickly.
B000MU2MJA Item arrived fine, worked great out of the box.  Difficult to get the smaller bugs as they seemed to fly through the racket, or get pushed by the breeze created from swinging it.  Seemed better to let them fly into it than try and hit them.  Worked great for about a week.  Then dead.  No reason for it to be dead, just dead one day.  Changed the batteries - wasn't the batteries.  It either shorted itself out or the internal wiring came loose.  Really wish it had held up, but poor quality turned it into an expensive toy for a short life span.
B000MU2MJA We had a couple of the smaller, cheaper zappers. The last one was dropped and all the wires popped out so we were looking for a new one. Found the Executioner and this works great! Better made and easier to use than the last one we had! This one only has 1 button you need to push and the grip makes it easy to hold and control. The battery compartment is simple and easy to access...and they give you your 1st set of batteries too!I mainly use these on the spiders that get into the house. Black and now the brown widows are very common in our area. Sometimes there is no one around to come get them for me so having one of these zappers is wonderful! Quickly takes care of spiders and any fly that happens to sneak into the house with no mess.
B000MU2MJA The Executioner is a sort of heavy-duty version of the electric swatters you can find in any hardware or camping store. Instead of a fine mesh of wires sandwiched in an outer metal grid, The Executioner has heavy-gauge metal bars strung horizontally. There is no protective grid and when the button is pressed the bars are energized. It's not going to kill anyone, but don't go swatting the cat with it.Seriously, don't do that, cats REALLY do not like getting zapped. On the scale below, cats are like level 50 if they're declawed and level 100+ if not*. It's your funeral, buddy.The Executioner is effective at killing insects, but I quickly found that not all insects are created equal. Some go down with the first zap and others need extra attention. For certain types of people (I've heard the word &#34;twisted&#34; used, but don't label me, bro) this adds an element of...um...science!...to frying pests around the house. Or while camping. Or while seated at a restaurant's outdoor patio.Note: I do not recommend performing Executioner-related science while at a restaurant's outdoor patio, unless you are keen to meet the manager and/or the local constabulary.Without further ado, I present my findings: The Definitive Insect** Power Rankings. Bugs are ranked from level 1 (explodes on zapping) to level 10 (nearly impossible to kill without using 120v AC power).Level 1 (insta-death, may explode) - Common mosquito, gnats, no-see-ums (you do get to see um when they flash)Level 2 (near-instant death, may twitch) - House fly, tiger mosquito, small moths, common black antLevel 3 (certain death, always twitches) - Horse fly, medium moths, house spiders, large antsLevel 4 (probable death, may require second zap) - Large moths, medium-large spidersLevel 5 (50/50 on dying, 50/50 requires 2nd zap) - HornetsLevel 6 (rarely dies on 1st zap; usually finished on 2nd) - CricketsLevel 7 (always requires 2nd zap; usually dies after that) - Small wasps, large spidersLevel 8 (always requires 2nd zap, may require 3rd) - Medium waspsLevel 9 (always requires multiple zaps, may survive long enough to escape) - Large waspsLevel 10 (multiple zaps, frequent escapes) - Great Black Wasp (Sphex pensylvanicus)Wait, this goes to 11:Level 11 (multiple zaps, rarely dies, escapes and ALERTS OTHERS) - Cicada Killer (Sphecius speciosus)Note that a &#34;zap&#34; is a one-time touch by The Executioner. If you hold the bug down and keep the button pressed, nothing except Cicada Killers will survive that. In fact, Cicada Killers will only get stronger, and oh by the way they alerted all their friends while you were holding them down and tickling them with The Executioner. And they all think your name is 'Cicada.'If you see Cicada Killers in your yard, reach for the flame thrower, not The Executioner.*I never touched any cats with The Executioner. This is only a joke.**Yes I know that spiders are not insects.
B000MU2MJA This racket turns the annoyance of summer bugs into pure sport. I do wish that it had a little more power since some of the larger bugs are stunned by it, and left writhing on the floor (to my fiancee's horror). But, I choose to count her horror as a side-benefit and carry on. It does do its job as intended - greeting the bugs with a satisfying *THWAK* and a flash of blue spark. I would not want to be on the receiving end of this thing, though my friends have indicated it's not too bad. I've found that the feel of the racket is improved greatly with a little tennis grip tape. Now I am thinking about upgrading to the bigger brother to see if it might do a better job of vaporizing the bugs, so that I don't have to keep running around with a vacuum to pick up little carcasses.
B000MU2MJA Looks like a tennis racket. Kills like lightning.I didn't find it 'flimsy' at all. Pea sized mosquitoes are not too small to get zapped.It's fun!
B000MU2MJA I was out using this today. Millions of wasps under the boat tarp! With the executioner in one hand and a knife to cut the lined in the other I launched myself into the fray! I have seen a few knock offs of these but none of them look as nice or are built like a badminton racquet like this one. It ain't cheap and it does not look cheap.Robs report: Well worth the money. Have fun. Get it.
B000MU2MJA I had my first chance to try this today, killing a wasp that got in the house. A bit of delicate task, considering we're allergic. The Executioner failed miserably and definitely didn't live up to its name. It didn't even stun or slow down the little bugger, let alone injure or kill it, despite multiple direct hits. In the end, a rolled up magazine combined with a squish under a shoe took care of the wasp.But further investigation showed the \"Executioner\" to be totally useless. I tentatively touched it myself and felt nothing. Full hand on the metal; still nothing. Changed batteries. Again, nothing. The only thing this does, as far as a I can tell, is turn on a little red light in the handle to make you think it's working. Big, fat waste of money.
B000MV5V6A I am trying to protect my garden this year without hurting any wildlife. This trap is humane, easy to use and light to carry. When using this, make sure to use the appropriate bait. If you are going to relocate an animal, try to be sure you haven't separated a mother from her babies. Rabbits usually leave their kits out in the open and they are easy enough to scoop up with a hat and relocate. I use this mostly for small feral cats, but it should work for rabbits, squirrels and other little critters. Opening and closing the trap door is a cinch, but this comes with instructions in case you need them. Overall, a nice, humane, made in the USA trap. I have left it out in the rain, and it hasn't rusted.
B000MV5V6A This trap appears to be built to last. It arrived quickly and we baited the trap and set it out. The pull back handle works well to set the trap and there is another handle to carry the trap. Don't know what we'll do if we catch a skunk? Maybe throw a blanket over the trap? We have all kinds of raccoon, rabbits, chipmunk, oppossum and other rodent type animals and this will do the trick.
B000MV5V6A This trap has a very clever design that results in flipping one handle to set the trap.  The door close is fast, but gentle when tripped.  The size of the model that I got is stated to be correct for rabbits.  The size is 7\" X 7\" X 24\" and is great for cottontails and large squirrels.  Chipmunks don't weigh enough to trip it.  I haven't tried it on skunks yet, but the trap is a bit small for many on the skunks around here.  The trap also has a plate under the carrying handle so that the animal can't get at your hand.  Highly recommended.
B000MV5V6A We have had problems with unwanted critters off and on, including red squirrels and skunks.  I was hoping that we'd catch one of the former, who now inhabits our barn, but caught a gray squirrel instead.  The set up is very easy and to entice him I put some peanuts (on a napkin) in the cage.  He had his little feast, but was none too happy when I went to release him.  I actually started to capture him on a video, but decided that even though he enjoyed his little feast, he'd much rather be doing something else and I let him go instead of filming.He was able to turn easily and scamper out of the cage. Make that a mad dash I'd suggest that unless you have smaller rabbits in your area, you might want to try the larger Havahart, smaller if you're trying to catch mice or rats.  When the squirrel spotted me he was a bit panicked.  I'd also recommend having a cover ready if you are going to transport to another location.  Does it work?  It sure does and fast.  I didn't catch the critter I was hoping for, but this squirrel had a nice snack and was not harmed in the process.
B000MV5V6A This trap is a snap to set up.  You place the trap where the rodents in question are suspected or known to be, place bait in the back, and pull the handle on top to set it.  Then you check it every 12 hours or so to see either a) a small animal trapped inside or b) nothing (not even the bait).My first experience with trapping (not with this device, mind you) was rats in the attic.  There was a bit of trial and error with snap-trap bait and placement before any rats were caught.  I had a similar experience with squirrel and small opossum catching with this device.I think some animals crawl into the cage to get the bait, encounter something (e.g. the trip plate) that looks different (maybe they think its a branch [?]), and then hop over it.  They then eat the bait, hop over the trip plate again, and then exit the cage.My best success came from spreading dirt and dry leaves on the bottom of the cage to \"hide\" the features of the cage and trip plate.  Hiding a little bait under the trip plate also seems to have helped.All in all, a great trap that requires some experimentation to be effective.  Comes with a sheet of recommended baits for specific animals.
B000MV5V6A Like the title says, most people use Havahart as if it is the word for \"humane trap for small critters\", no matter the brand. 20 years ago we inherited a Havahart trap from a local farmer and used it regularly to get rid of rabbits from the garden, chipmunks and an oppossum from the garage, and yes, even a small mink that was hanging around the house too close. It always worked, but it was old and a bit of a pain to set.Fast forward to now, and we are in love with this newer unit! It is so easy to bait & set, and then very easy to open to release a trapped critter into a more suitable place away from gardens & garages. We've had it for a couple of weeks and relocated one rabbit.As the name describes, the size is suitable for rabbits, squirrels and such. I hope we never have to trap a skunk, but I feel sure the size is appropriate. Probably not large enough for anything bigger, like an adult raccoon.Havahart is the standard for trapping/releasing small critters and I'm sure we will use this unit for years to come.
B000MV5V6A I have been using Havahart traps since I was a young kid--probably from the time I was eight or nine years old. I was fascinated by animals (I'm still fascinated) and my parents used to buy me a trap every year or two for my birthday. In the summer I used to set the traps at night and the next morning couldn't wait to go out and see what I'd caught. Then I'd give the animal a reward snack (often they were too scared to eat it!) and set them free. Mostly I caught opossums and, curiously enough, often caught the same ones over and over again. They didn't seem to mind spending a few hours in a trap if they got an apple out of the deal. There has never been a time in my life when I didn't have a Havahart trap (or several) in my garage.Once I owned my own house I used smaller traps to catch problem animals--rats and woodchucks mainly--and take them up to a local wooded area to set them free. I won't abide people killing animals just because they think they are pests. I'm sure we're much bigger pests in the eyes of the animals. All of the traps that I've owned, however, were double-door traps. This is the first single-door spring-loaded trap I've tried--and I have a few reservations about that and about this trap in general.The thing that I like about double-door traps is that the animals are less cautious about them because they can see an opening at the other end--they don't feel like they're walking into a dead end. Most animals are extremely cautious about not having a clear exit strategy. Squirrels and opossums will probably tolerate the closed end, but more suspicious animals (raccoons) are not so easily fooled. Still, I don't think the single-door design is a major concern and I'll know soon which animals will go in and which ones won't.But there are a few things about this trap that are giving me a bit of concern. For one, that spring-loaded door comes down with significant force; that can be a good thing if you want to be sure you catch the animal before it flees--it closes FAST. But I'm thinking that if a squirrel were to be hit in the head by that door (some animals trip the door with their hind legs as they LEAVE the trap and they could get caught under the door), you'd knock it silly. I'm trying to catch and release animals, not knock the sense out of them. Trust me, the last thing you want is a skunk caught with his head in the door--he won't be a happy camper when you go to release him. (Though most skunks tend to just wander away after being trapped--they're very nice animals.)Also, as a few other reviewers have mentioned, the trip plate on this trap takes a bit of weight to set off. With the two-door style traps the trip plate is very sensitive and a strong breath will set it off (and you can use a bit of oil on the lever to make it go even faster). There is no way to adjust the plate reaction on this. If you are catching a fairly heavy animal, this will not be a problem. But if you're trying to catch smaller lighter animals, they may not trip the door. Worse, if they trip if on their way out, that brutal door may give them a whack. I'm not sure if this will actually happen or not, I was just surprised by the speed with which that spring-loaded door closed.Like all Havahart traps, this is superbly made (in the USA, by the way) and it will last long enough for you to leave it to your grandkids. I have a few Havahart traps that are probably close to 50 years old (just gave my age away).Animals are so much fun to watch and even though most people buy traps out of kindness to gently move the animals to another venue, they are also a great way to teach your kids about animals. I became a photographer (part of my work is as a wildlife photographer) in large part because my parents indulged my curiosity. If your kids are taught to appreciate wildlife and taught to handle it safely, they'll be much better at understanding and dealing with animals their entire lives.By the way, I haven't set this trap out yet, but will soon.
B000MV5V6A I've used Havahart live animal traps, as well as other major brands, for over 25 years in a rescue-spay/neuter program for feral felines.  I have traps ranging in size to accommodate squirrels all the way up to dangerous predators like coyotes.Some of the traps on the cheaper end of the scale are made in China.  They weigh less than the USA-made traps because they use smaller gauge wire and are not as sturdy.  I bought one just for comparison.  They are not durable for the long term and the bite of a strong animal can actually bend and break the welds on the wire.There are some very good traps that are made in Wisconsin which I've used for years.  However, I've had to adjust the trigger mechanism with bent-nosed pliers to get the tripping weight exactly where I wanted it.  They are like setting an old-fashioned booby trap but they are sturdy and dependable traps.I like traps with a release door on on the opposite end from the trap door.  Unfortunately, this design requires the trapper to stand directly over the door to open it and release the animal.  Some animals are dangerous when frightened and squirrels can bounce faster and further than one might expect. I once released one squirrel that immediately bolted, did a 180&#730; and bounced off of me before I could move.  The back claws are sharp.  Many times I've wished I could be standing a few feet behind the trap when releasing an animal.Havahart must have heard my wish. The Havahart Easy Set Trap is exactly what the doctor ordered and I am sold.The operator does not have to stand directly over the trap to open it as with other brands.  Simply tie a cord to the handle, stand back behind the trap and pull the cord.  One slight pull disengages the lock and opens the door and the critter scrambles away to freedom...and you are safely out of harm's way.In case you're wondering, the animal can NOT disengage the lock from inside the trap.The Havahart Easy Set Trap is the easiest trap on the market to use.  The one-hand operation is great.  You open the door with one hand and the trap is set.  The tripping weight seems to be adjusted perfectly for the size of the trap and animal being targeted.I use a car-wash brush to scrub down my traps after each use and then rinse them off with a water hose and they're ready for the next use.WARNING:  Do not release any animal that appears sick or injured.  Call animal control in your area.  In most regions, 911 will contact animal control for you.
B000MV5V6A My wife loves her bird feeders and the amazing variety of wild birds they attract, but we have learned over the years that there is no such thing as a squirrel-proof bird feeder.Until I got the Havahart trap, I could count on seeing at least one and maybe three or four squirrels crowded around the bird feeders whenever I cast a glance out the window.Now, all I see is birds.It only took a few days to round up and relocate 14 squirrels with the trap. It's dirt-simple to operate and easy to set.We live at the edge of a forest, but luckily none of the skunks in the neighborhood took an interest in the peanut butter bait.
B000MV5V6A Very easy to set up.  Worked like a charm!  We used this trap to do a humane \"catch and relocate\" on a neighborhood feral cat that was causing problems.  Also very glad this well-designed product is Made in USA.  Highly recommended.
B000MV5V6A These Havahart traps have been around long enough to be true classics. This one is on the smaller side and is appropriate for the listed animals. Of course you still have the problem of what to do once your target animal has been trapped. Not a big problem if you are trapping a rabbit or squirrel, but think long and hard about your \"what next\" strategy if skunks are your issue.
B000MV5V6A I'm happy to report that this trap is working well.I also have a two-door model that will not work correctly, its a havahart 1062.This trap also uses a cable to hold the door open.  I'm not really enthusiastic about the cable design.But this trap works well and has been reliable enough.  If the reliability changes over time I will update my review.  I am worried that the cable design won't be as durable as my older Havahart.
B000MV5V6A We have had many live animal traps in the past ten years to keep critters out of our garden.  This one is the easiest one to set that we have had...and to release.  It is very strong and durable.  Although we haven't caught anything yet (the garden is just coming up), I am sure with this trap we will be able to.  Very pleased with it. The size is more like a possum or rabbit or squirrel or skunk.  Raccoon around here are pretty big so I don't know if it would catch one of those or not but we will see. :)
B000MV5V6A I ordered the Havahart 1084 Easy Set One-Door Cage Trap  because our little squirrel buddy had a couple of warbles (fly larvae) under his skin. Thankfully, it worked just like the other ratings and tips I read before attempting it. We caught him and took him to our Vet friend and neighbor and he got those disgusting things out of him. We have a lot of wildlife around and I LOVE, that but occasionally somebody has a problem and I have had to call someone everytime to come catch the guys for me. I can now do it myself. I have also let all the neighbors know I will catch animals for them if they have a problem. Most people don't know that Animal Control often kill the animals they catch by drowning them or in some other inhumane way ~ even sell them for their fur. The best thing to do is take them to a wildlife rehabber because even relocation isn't a good idea for many reasons but most imortantly because a mother may be taken away from her starving babies. I am so glad we have animal friendly neighbors and now I can help out the animals myself!
B000MV5V6A This is an easy to use trap for capturing those pesky little critters that get into your garden and destroy your crops.
B000MV5V6A When the Grid collapses--and it's inevitable that it will--a lot of people will be reduced to eating slugs and tree bark.  Not this chica. I am guaranteed as much fresh meat as I can personally consume, and a surplus, because I am the proud owner of the Havahart 1084 Easy Set One-Door Cage Trap for Rabbits, Skunks, Minks, and Large Squrrels. Who needs to resort to not-so-fresh roadkill when the backyard is your larder?Actually, I ordered this because we sometimes have to relocate \"problem\" animals that invade our garage, basement or attic. This trap is very strong yet lightweight, and it's really easy to open--you just squeeze the handle. It's not huge, so if you have issues with raccoons, oppossums or obnoxious children, this won't do the trick. But anything smaller can be caught, taken to a more appropriate area, and then safely released.I tried this out to make sure everything was mechanically in order, which it is, and I've used other models of the Havahart system before. I hope I don't have to use it any time soon, but I'm prepared if I do get an uninvited guest.But if you're going to use it for the first purpose I described, I have a great recipe for roasted bunny...which goes nicely with Tater Tots and a merlot. FYI.
B000MV5V6A i have had the most success trapping nuisance squirrels with this trap. it is simple and it is fast... small size... easy to move around. i can transport the squirrel down to another location to release without any worry about getting bitten. it is high quality and looks well made. i am very happy with this trap and i am using it every day now. thank you!
B000MV5V6A For as long as I can recall, I've never heard someone say \"get a live animal trap.\" They say, \"Get a Havahart.\" Havahart has been around a very long time (I remember their ads in Boy's Life when I was a kid) for the simple reason that their design is hard to improve on- although these new one-door traps are an improvement in some areas. For one thing, they're about as simple as possible to set and to release. Pull the handle one way, it's set. Pull it the other, you release the critter. The only trick is picking the right sized trap for the critter you're trying to catch.Aside from that, the one-door traps are pretty much identical to the Havahart traps that have been around for over a century. They're still simple, well made,  reasonably priced, and easy to repair if parts wear out. About the only difference I can see between this unit and the oldest traps is the use of plastic-covered metal clips that keep the various bent wire pieces in place. Functionally they're the same as metal clips, but provide a bit more protection against accidentally scraping yourself or ripping clothes on them.This model is marketed for rabbits, skunks, minks, and large squirrels, which means it probably won't trigger if you're being plagued by small squirrels or chipmunks, and it's too big for the possum that's been wandering around my neighborhood. It is, however, ideal for skunks, and if you follow the instructions at Havahart's web site you'll find no difficulty in trapping and moving a squirrel without getting sprayed. (I still wouldn't put the skunk inside my car. Releasing him away from the back porch he was inhabiting was good enough.)One curious thing: Mine came with a loose spring in the box. As there's no way for a spring to come detached from the trap (the coil is wrapped around an arm) I wondered, is this a spare? Or just an extra that found its way into packing? The instructions didn't mention it, and Havahart's web sit wasn't much help either. Whatever the reason, it's a handy thing to have on hand.
B000MV5V6A I remember when the \"Made in the USA\" campaign was out back in the 90's and I never really thought too much about it. Now that I am older and the ramifications of moving our manufacturing overseas has reached fruition, I am very glad to see that this fine product was indeed \"Made in the USA\". I used to think that some USA made products were inferior to Japanese Made items, but now I know that they far surpass to \"cheap Chinese items\" that are everywhere.This is a fine trap that works very well. I like the single door version even better than the double door one that I own. It is much easier to setup and has a \"front\" and a \"back\" side. Some wary animals may be better lured with the double door version, but as far as squirrels, small rabbits and ferrel cats, I think this one works great. It is so easy to set, just flip the lever handle on top the cage over. The lever flips over the carrying handle. It is held in place by tension of which the bait plate inside the trap releases and causes the door to shut. I really like this new design compared to the older style. It looks like it will last too. It seems very well made and hopefully will last a long time.Just remember to relocate your furry friends to a suitable place that is far away from other peoples homes that may not resort to using a trap like this one to solve their furry friend problems!
B000MV5V6A This product is incredibly easy to set. I have another Havahart trap (Havahart 1025 Live Animal Two-Door Squirrel, Chipmunk, Rat, and Weasel Cage Trap) that is much more difficult to set.I've had it out for a few days and the smaller critters have eaten up the bait (carrots) and not triggered it. The 1084 is not large enough for a full grown jackrabbit, some of the local jacks are the size of a small beagle, it seems.But cottontails would fit. I'm not sure there is a smearable bait that would attract the cottontails. They are my problem. I DON'T WANT TO CATCH A SKUNK.One big issue right now is that the remaining critters are the smart ones. Lack of rain for the last two years (creating less food) have culled the stupid ones.
B000MV5V6A I have this trap set in our attic where I have some little squirrels nesting. It has not caught anything as of yet, but it is set and the trap does trigger when the plate is touched. This is definately only for small animals. It could not catch an opossum or the large rabbits we have in our yard. Perfect for a squirrel and that is just what we needed. The trap is easily opened or set by flipping the handle over. Very pleased.
B000MV5V6A This is the first time I've tried to trap an animal, so I didn't know what to expect. I am extremely pleased with this trap. It's sturdy and a good size. It's easy to bait and set. It works exactly like the diagrams. I wanted the trap because a skunk parades under our bedroom window at night. I baited the trap with some apple slices as well as some peanut butter. So far I haven't caught the skunk, but I did trap a gray squirrel. I'll try some other baits, but I'm sure I'll be able to trap the skunk.I highly recommend this trap. I've had no problems using it.
B000MV5V6A Havahart Easy Set Live Animal Cage Trap is simply an easy & humane way to trap and release wild animals that you consider to be pests from your home or garden.  One word of caution, though, is to make sure you aren't trapping and releasing a mother away from her babies, or you'll be finding a wildlife rehab organization to raise the babies, or a nest of dead babies.We  have rented  a trap like this from a rental center, so we are already familiar with both the trap, and the high cost of renting a used one.Set-up couldn't be simpler.  You basically take the unit out of the box, and place it in the area you wish to trap an animal in.  Place bait appropriate for whatever kind of small animal you are trying to catch on the center plate inside the cage.  Lift the handle towards the back of the trap and it locks into position.  That's it!  When the animal goes inside the unit for the food, and he has to go all the way inside to get the bait, the trap door shuts, trapping him inside.  It's swift but harmless. After the animal is trapped, move it to another location, and release it by lifting the handle again, which opens the door.  The animal simply walks out.Again, pay attention to what you are trapping and try not to abandon babies by relocating their mother.  Have an idea of what you are trapping, and educate yourself on the birth cycles of that particular animal to gauge what time of year is best to relocate, unless you trap a male.  If you are moving the animal out of an attic or building, make sure you repair the place he entered into, or you'll be setting this trap every day!As a side note, this trap is large enough to trap a small cat, and trapping feral cats to have them spayed, then returned to their home, is a good idea.  However, from experience we have learned that trapping the feral mother from her kittens just means we let her loose again, because taking a mother away from her kittens is cruel and certain death for the babies.  In that case, it's best to wait a few weeks, and make sure you continue to offer food to the kittens if you have trapped their mother and taken her to be spayed, until you get get them all trapped and neutered.
B000MV5V6A We were really looking forwarding to giving this trap a go as part of the Vine evaluation program: we have a crawl space that squirrels keep getting into.Unfortunately, the squirrels just walked in and out of the trap, dining on the bait we left (peanut butter and various nuts).This trap might work fine for heavier animals that will activate the trap, so we gave it a neutral rating. It does appear to be well-constructed, and it might work better if tweaked for sensitivity (as other reviewers have suggested); but customers shouldn't be expected to make after-sale adjustments.Some reviewers seem to have had better results than we did, but maybe their critters are heavier...come to think of it, maybe our squirrels will put on enough weight to spring the trap if we keep it set up long enough! ;-)
B000MV5V6A The Havaheart 1084 is for small animals such as rabbits, squirrels, small skunks, etc. with the idea of catching-and-releasing the animal.  The trap is so simple it comes only with a one-page manual and thankfully the trap arrives pre-assembled.  The manual gives ideas on some of the best bait for luring various animals.  I've tested the trap trigger with my hand, and it triggered every time.  I also tested over-sensitivity by lightly shaking the cage to simulate an animal jumping on it or rubbing against it, and the trap wasn't set off.  Wonderful!For the animals this trap is designed to catch, I do think that a small squirrel may sometimes be able to get the bait without triggering the trap.  Since squirrels sometimes distribute th
B000MV5V6A For many years, I have owned one of these traps and immediately liked the changes.  The safety shield at the hand grip is particularly appreciated, but I will still wear my welding gloves when an animal is caught in the trap.  With it I can relocate the nastier critters and turn loose the ones that are good neighbors.  A note to others:  Whenever you trap a mammal, always look for signs of disease before touching the trap in any way.  These little guys can carry serious illnesses that  sometimes transfer to humans.
B000MV5V6A I have used various hav a heart animal traps and similar traps for years and this is a NEW wrinkle in setting animal traps.  They have patented a new setting device that is just a handle type thing that you pull back easily and it sets the trap without having to mess with \"hair triggers\" and having the trap go off when you move the trap etc.  This trap is a good one, I took it to our land in Oklahoma and was able to remove several raccoons from the area of deer feeders and relocate them to an area where they will not be stuffing themselves with deer corn.  I also caught a squirrel, and a cotton tail rabbit both which were released at the site.  This trap is super easy to set, very lightweight to carry and clean, the rounded corners on the trap mean no snags of your clothes or cuts on your hands/flesh.  I give it a full five stars for the great trigger set apparatus.
B000MV5V6A In an area overrun with squirrels, I've been searching for a catch and release trap. This is exactly what I needed. It's large enough to trap other nuisance animals too (skunks, etc) but perfect for the squirrel problem that we have. It's much easier to set than the older style traps, this can be done with one hand. It's also a one-hand release which keeps you further away from the animal. The trap is sensitive and closes in an instant. The only thing I didn't like is that the holes are pretty big and the trap food is hard to get inside unless you're using something large (we used peanut butter on pretzels and they fell through). Otherwise, very very happy with this trap.
B000MV5V6A This is a nice trap! Great for catching stray cats in our neighborhood, thanks. Easy to use, and easy to catch critters!
B000MV5V6A Our neighborhood is infested with feral cats, but we don't have a rodent problem.We have been arming ourselves with these preventative measures around our property, especially for our raised garden beds, as these cats have me up in arms, with them using my garden and children's sandbox as their litter boxes. Plus, all they do is feed from the dumpsters, breed, multiply and fight all night.I chose this trap to help resolve our big-little problem. I didn't want to use inhumane tactics, like a pellet, paintball gun, or poisons, so these live traps were the best and only alternative.This1084trap really works. We previously got the1083and it worked too, the first day we got it. Except that model was a bit to small for larger cats. So picked up this next size1084, which is longer but not any bigger, but still effective, and we also picked up the1064which is a double door trap and much larger than the others. We have all them spread throughout the property.*** Attention Cat Lovers: Please note. I do have a live and let live philosophy, and I do not harm these cats in any way. However, if they want to feed and breed, let them do it outside of the city limits, in rural America. They can be wild in the country, not in the city, and definitely not in our neighborhood. ***My kids get all excited when we actually catch cats in these traps. All we do is put a small $0.40 can of cat food, for bait, in the trap. Beautiful!We always check the traps daily to see if we catch anything. It's quite exciting for the family to have this much anticipation over catching a cat. I like it more for the simple fact that I will be reclaiming the yard.Overall, I'm very pleased with this trap and the results that I'm getting. Highly recommended if you have my type of problem.
B000MV5V6A Last year our garden and blueberry bushes were demolished by a mountain beaver... prior to seeing it and searching for what it was, I wasn't even aware they existed.Wanting to avoid the same thing this year, the neighbors and I wanted to try trapping the little animal that goes between our homes so that we could take it and release it FAR away (if we are successful I will be calling animal control to see where to take it).This trap is great - a nice size for smallish animals and VERY easy to set up.  I was worried that it would take a lot of work or coordination to set up, but really, you can set it up and release it with one hand.It also has some great build features - it is sturdy and has both human and animal safety in mind.We haven't caught it yet, but there is also no sign of our little pesky critter yet either.
B000N5WPQY First off I highly recommend the electric version. Who wants to pollute more than necessary and deal with gas? No-brainer to get this version because it has more than enough power for almost any job I can think of. We have a bermuda lawn that we wanted to replace part of with a flower bed. We could have paid someone or rented a heavy piece of equipment from a home improvement store but we decided to go with the Mantis.Very pleased we have. It cuts through Bermuda like butter on the lowest power setting. But because of the nature of Bermuda roots, the roots do need to be removed. I highly recommend the weed reducers. Weeds/roots still get on but very easy to remove. It also gives you a bit of a workout. It wants to pull forward so you pull back on it to till.We have used the edger and loved it. Did a wonderful job edging and no having to mess with cutting lines. The tines are TOUGH. There is a reason they have a lifetime warranty. With the edging tine a few times the unit bounced on to the sidewalk, the concrete loss not the tine. Our soil is full of limestone rock, granted not the hardest. The tines will not crush it but they also did not suffer any damage.Extremely easy to put together, basically just assembling the handle. However the kickstand is a challenge. My father in law had a handy angled kind of wrench kit and made quick work of it. But my friend who also bought it has never been able to get the kickstand on. Not really that important it still works fine. Also comfortable to move around.We have not tried the cultivating but you reverse the tines and it is suppose to cut less deep into the ground allowing you to use it around existing plants. With that feature I would highly recommend it to people who have a lot of flowering beds to cultivate in new compost every season. For people with annual beds it would be fantastic.Great product but do buy the weed reducers.
B000N5WPQY When I lived in Peru I used the Mantis 120-Volt Electric Tiller/Cultivator to work a large, extended field. It's Electric so I had to use a generator, fortunately I rigged it up to run on ethanol fuel (corn) so I wasn't contributing to oil exploitation.The Tiller/Cultivator is not at all bad for the ground and I was done in no time and able to plant my seeds. It works adequately and is quite suitable for medium rough soil. I even lent it out to the village and it held up after one year.I wouldn't mind if it operated on pig waste either if I could convert it somehow. In all, if you are just using the Tiller/Cultivator on a patch of yard, you'll be able to plug it in. The electric motor is quiet so I did not disturb the local bird crops which gather in the dusk.

B000N5WPQY Updated review: This is my second spring with this unit. I took it out of the garage, plugged it in, and started tilling. So very easy and very effective!!! This was a great purchase, I just tilled my front garden to get it veggie ready. The Mantis just kept working and working. Two neighbors have borrowed it, used it, and loved it!Great machine!!I purchased this tiller after reading the reviews for 2-stroke gas, 4-stroke gas, and this electric. Although I love my gas mower, I did not want another gas appliance around the house. So I took a chance on this electric. I love it!!! It took less than an hour to put together (make sure that you have a pair of 7/16\" wrenches/sockets). This little machine-that-could did!! It made very quick work of about 500sf of beds that were full of rock and construction debris and compacted soil. It is very quiet, in fact so quiet my wife didn't know that I was tilling right outside the kitchen window. The tiller is light (about 20lbs) and will bounce off of hard soil at first, but keep making short back and forth strokes and the tiller very nicely does its job. Well worth the money!!! Am very pleased! Plus, with Prime, it was delivered in 2 days!!
