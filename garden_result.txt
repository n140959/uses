B000RUM0R4 I was very excited to receive this Gardeners Blue Ribbon Ultomato Tomato Plant Cage.  I am planning on using it when my tomato plants get larger.  But for now it is staking up my raspberry bush.  And doing a great job of it!  This was sooooo simple to use straight out of the box.  The stakes are made from a sturdy material that won't rust or rot.  The clips are easy to place around the plant so that you don't destroy the plant while trying to place the stakes around it.  Also, the clips do not have to be parallel to each other.  So if part of your plant is heavy on one side and then on up a ways, it gets heavier on the other side, you can arrange the horizontal clips in any configuration you like to best support your plant.  When done this cage is very easy to store.  You just unclip the horizontal bars and everything wraps up with a twisty tie until next year.  These will definitely be something I purchase more of for the garden.  Some real thought went into these product!
B000RUM0R4 I have struggled with tomato cages for years and though this might be a solution. The long stakes are just green plant stakes, I had a bit of trouble getting them in the ground, and the side supports went on easy. Vine says I have to review in 30 days now, tomatoes are 17 inches high, will report back at the end of the season.
B000RUM0R4 I like this cage a lot.  The arms can be adjusted to where you want them, and snapped around the plant instead of put over it, potentially breaking the vines.  It's as tall as other stakes and cages I've bought.  The problem with the metal ones is they get bent up really bad and it makes them hard to reuse more than a year or two.  This one looks like it will last.  In fact, I've got this actually placed between two jellybean tomato plants.  I've got each plant staked with a plain straight stake, and then this between them with the branches trained and supported on the arm supports.  This is going to make it a lot easier to get to the little tomatoes as they ripen, especially when you want to reach and just eat some off the vine.  With the branches going back and forth through here, the clusters show up well.
B000RUM0R4 We just staked some of our tomatoes and two Knock Out roses with these. Unlike another reviewer our stakes were solid, the same kind you get at your local big box hardware store.  We did sink the stakes about 6 inches in the ground (just like we do other stakes).  We did the roses because they are so filled with blooms they needed support.  It was nice these were green because they aren't visible at all. We found ours locally.
B000RUM0R4 This is a solid tomato plant cage, and can easily recommend.Pros:- Flexible arms (guide them to the fruit laden branches for support)- Tough stakes - hard to bend, will keep it grounded.- Can place it around an already growing plant (with a little effort, but much easier than a regular wire cage) without damaging the plant.- Stores flat - can reuse next year, and the one after.Neutral:- Look for sales, you can get them for a  lot less at other stores.Recommended, especially in the $5-7 dollar range.
B000RUM0R4 Unfortunately the product came damaged during shipping, and it was not as sturdy as I thought it would be. It seems to be doing better than the cheap cages I have been using. I wish the product would be wider to support the plant as it grows bigger.
B000RUM0R4 As someone that has fought with more than my share of rusty or bent traditional tomato cages, I was happy to see this alternative.  Granted, it will be awhile to see if it shows weather wear, this is a solid cage that can be used to grow more than just tomatoes.  Any item from food to flowers could benefit from the climbing range and support.I prefer the shape of the support over the traditional round cage.  That circle shape was constantly getting dented or broken.  It just didn't make sense.  This gives more structured support and the greater height means I won't have plants breaking from climbing too high.I also found it easy to move as well as store.Overall, this is a great way to give your plants the best start to produce the most product...whether it be fruits, vegetables, or flowers.
B000RUM0R4 The tomato went together really well.  It plants tomatos great!  The vines really go together really well.  They go right into the ground.  Great tomatos!  They hang really well.
B000RUM0R4 I am actually using this for cucumbers instead of tomatoes and so far it's working great!  It was easy to assemble and fit my pot nicely.  I have very little space, so I'm growing most everything in large pots and having something like this really comes in handy for plants that like to climb.  I am very pleased with it.  It appears to be very sturdy as well so I hope to get lots of years of use from it.
B000RUM0R4 Don't expect this cage can hold the weight of beefsteak tomato. This cage is designed for grape or cherry tomatoes.I agree with other reviewer that this cage is very sturdy. It is sturdy for small tomato plant. I have about half dozen tomato plants and I use the cage for \"sun sugar\" tomato, a cherry type. For bigger tomato such as Burpee big mama and other large paste tomato, I use the larger cages from burpee.com or gardeners.com
B000RUM0R4 I have tried various methods to tie, stake, cage, etc. tomato plants for years. I thought I'd found the perfect solution with this product. However, I have not. I should have noticed from the picture, that the cage (stakes) are merely green plant stakes. That kind the ultimately don't work to hold up tomatoes! The length of the stakes is really on the short side as well as the diameter of the stakes (a bit too thin) allowing them to bend rather easily.Putting the cage together was pretty easy and I do like that cross section. My tomato plants aren't full grown yet. I intend to come back and edit the review accordingly. For now, I'll say it's \"just okay\".
B000RUM0R4 Everyone by now has seen these green plastic coated garden poles, they are everywhere. What this company has done is create clips that hold fast to the 4 ft size of these poles to make a sturdy triangular cage, and sturdy it is. The reason I am giving it 5 stars is because buying the poles and clips together as a cage is a very good value. The clips are approx a dollar each, and the poles are a bit more, so getting them as a kit saves money. Gardener's Blue Ribbon also sells the cross bar \"ties\" separately, so you can add them as needed when your plant gets large. Obviously, I am reviewing this in May, so my tomato plants are not quite at that stage - yet. I am buying more of these to replace the conical wire cages (good riddance), so let that be my ultimate review.
B000RUM0R4 I've used these cages for two seasons now and just got around to writing a review. I'll probably use them next season, too, but I think potential buyers should be aware of some things.The \"cage\" comes as a set of three stakes and nine plastic bars; both ends of the bar snap onto a stake, usually assembled as you see in pictures (three groups of three bars, although you can really space them however you want). I've lost a couple plastic bars over the years, but I notice some local garden centers sell replacement bars, probably for this reason. I suppose you could also get them to add another set of bars to the cage. The stakes are 5 ft tall, but you'll have to put them into the ground a bit, making the effective height a bit less.The stakes are also somewhat thin, and the bars are easily removable. This is good because it makes for easy storage but can be bad because heavy plants--like tomatoes--can easily push the bars off the stakes (probably why I've lost a couple). Together with the thin stakes, this makes the whole cage somewhat light and definitely NOT suitable for indeterminate tomatoes. You may have better luck with determinates, but I've never grown any true determinates in these to test. I've given up on using these for tomatoes and have stuck to using them with bell peppers, jalapenos (probably could have done without any cage on those, but I had some extra), and cucumbers, which I more or less successfully tried to make climb up the cage. The removable--and movable--plastic bars on the cage were very helpful for this. I didn't have an issue with the weight of the cucumber fruit weighing down the cage, toppling it over, or breaking the bars off, but everything was much lighter here than my tomatoes. I suspect other plants like peas would also work well (maybe spread it out instead of putting it like a cage, depending on how you plant them). I'd hate to try it with melons or squash, but if I was desperate for space and had nothing else I might see how it works.In summary, these cages are OK, but you'll need to stick to lighter plants: *maybe* determinate tomatoes, definitely *not* indeterminates, and besides tomatoes otherwise lighter plants like cucumbers or peppers. If they didn't market these for tomatoes (including the name of the cage itself!), I might rate them a little higher. They aren't horrible, but you'll have to be careful how you use them. For tomatoes themselves, after having used a variety of tomato support methods, I decided to make a \"Florida weave\" last season with not much more than metal T-posts and twine. (There are also a few other \"homemade\" solutions out there.\") Do a Web search for this if you're interested--it worked out well for me and was much less expensive than buying cages. They're also easy to store, and I suspect the metal posts will last me much, much longer than these cages.
B000RUM0R4 This tomato (or any plant) cage is sturdy, adjustable and reusable. The three supporting poles are made of a strong metal core with a hard plastic covering. This covering has ridges which keeps the adjustable horizontal attachment bars from slipping down the pole when the weight of the tomato branches increases with the growing season. I have accidentally broken off many stems/branches in the past when trying to accommodate the growing plant within a fixed support cage - the plant grows or needs extra support when branches become heavy with fruit, and the traditional fixed metal cages do not allow adjustments without bending/breaking stems in the process. This design allows you accommodate the plant as often as needed by adjusting the horizontal bars of the cage as often as you need to.  They snap on and off easily and can be placed anywhere on the vertical poles. By connecting several cages in a row, you can build a network of supports for many plants.  This is the best method I have tried so far, compared to fixed square and round cages and wooden stakes. I have yet to use it a second season, and the plastic horizontal bars may not hold up to years of wear and tear - they are plastic and less sturdy than the poles. But each cage comes with many bars, so extras are available in the event of a breakage.
B000RUM0R4 Makes growing tomatoes much easier. The cage could be used for growing tomato plants and other climbing fruits and vegetables. It is literally a \"snap\" to use, as the horizontal supports, snap on and off with ease. Three stakes and nine adjustable support clips for changeable support throughout the plant's growth. The stakes have a steel core and a thick plastic coating. It may also be used , flattened as a trellis.
B000RUM0R4 I moved from a ranch to a condo, and needed to start over with my approach to vegetable gardening.  I knew that I would be starting with an heirloom tomato in a City Pickers box, and when I saw this tomato cage offered via the Amazon Vine program, I grabbed it.Because it takes a while to see the longevity of a product that will be in the sun most of the day, I can't comment yet on the durability of the product.  Let's just say that I am a bit skeptical about the cross pieces lasting longer than one season, as it they are constructed out of plastic.  The uprights are constructed out of steel coasted with plastic, but they are rather lightweight.PROS:The tomato cage was easily assembled.  I had it put together and in the box in no time. The design is very clever.  I like it a lot better than the wire tomato cages that are metal cones (seeGalvanized Tomato Cage 33\"X12\"-3 Ring/3 Legs) which I have found to be flimsy and easily bent out of shape.  (At my previous residence I had the most success with homemade cages assembled from leftover field fencing supported by metal fence posts. Field fence has generous spacing between the wires.)CONS:The directions say to put the cage about 8 - 10 inches deep into the soil.  That does not seem very deep if one expects to support a large tomato plant.  I had no control over the depth that I had to set mine in, as it's in a box. (see product images) I get the feeling that once my tomato plant gets to a  large size that I am going to need to fasten the cage to the balcony rail to keep it from toppling over.  But, that's speculation at this point.I know that this review is incomplete at this point, and I do apologize about that.  But I do intend to post updates throughout the upcoming growing season.  Stay tuned for further developments....Three stars for now, as I am a bit skeptical about how well this cage is going to work out.UPDATE:  June 4, 2013I have had the cage in place for a month.  I must say that my opinion of this cage is slowly sinking in the west.  I had to add a row of string as an additional support for my young tomato plant.  I also had to fasten it to my balcony railing with zip ties, as even a moderate breeze would send it leaning to the side.  I decided to anchor it down before it tipped over and took my tomato with it.  See product images.Final opinion:  A waste of money unless you have some way to support it.
B000RUM0R4 This is only my 3rd year growing tomatoes so I am still a novice gardener. Since I live in a condo, all my gardening is done in containers--usually 5-gallon buckets. Even though this tomato cage is not intended for containers, I was able to make it work because it is so adjustable and versatile.The cage arrives UNASSEMBLED but assembly is easy. There are 3 5-ft. stakes and 9 support clips. The support clips snap onto the stakes very easily (it reminded me of a large Tinker Toy project). What's great is that, as your plant grows, you can readjust the space between the support rods to support your plant's branches and fruit/vegetables. This isn't something you can do with most other tomato cages.As noted in the product description, the stakes have a steel core with plastic around them. They are VERY strong. However, the support clips are completely plastic and I would recommend not being to rough with them during assembly or readjustment during growth of your plant. I did not have any breakage but, in \"forcing\" the cage to fit my 5-gallon bucket, the clips were definitely bending.I just put my tomato plants in yesterday so I can't speak yet to how well the cage functions in supporting the plant's growth, but since it is so adjustable, I can't imagine there being much of a problem. If there is, I will update my review once my plants have grown a few feet tall.I have never had a cage this tall so I'm looking forward to having less work this year in keeping my plants supported as they grow and bear fruit!I took a picture of my cage in the container with the small tomato plant to show customers, but unfortunately this company is not allowing customers to share their own images of the product.4 stars for now. This may change as my plant grows.
B000RUM0R4 Great tomato cage that can be added to your tomato plant at any time (and adjusted, as needed).  It's sturdy, adjustable, and green (it blends it with the plant and is barely noticeable).
B000RUM0R4 These vegetable support stakes are a nice 5 feet tall which leaves you at least 4 to 4 1/2 feet once you get it stuck in the ground.  They are coated metal and went into the ground easily on the pointed in.  I didn't even have to use a rubber mallet on them.  If you do have to use a rubber mallet on them, be sure to protect the coating on the stake with a piece of cloth before pounding.  They come with 9 connectors that are 12inches long and snap into place easily so you can configure them anyway you want.  You can make a triangle or free form shape.  They are green and unobtrusive looking.  Rather than tomatoes, I used them for my pole beans that are growing like skyscrapers.  After the pole beans are done, I will move them to my tomatoes which aren't very tall yet.  I'm am pleased with this product and would recommend it.  My only concern would be if the connectors will break of their end clips or not as I reconfigure them.  So far, no problem.
B000RUM0R4 We plant 20-30 tomato plants each year, plus I use tomato cages for climbing plants, like peas.  The Gardeners Blue Ribbon Tomato Plant Cage is a sturdy, versatile product that not only can be used for any size tomato plant, but can also be arranged for other uses.The cage comes disassembled, with three tall poles and 9 side pieces. You just put the poles in the ground and then snap on the side pieces in any arrangement you would like.The price is higher then your typical cage and I would be a little concerned about keeping track of the side pieces once you put the cages away after the growing season. However, the durability and flexibility of this product outweighs the cons.
B000RUM0R4 Even though this product appears a little flimsy, it's lack of rigidity is actually a benefit over some other more rigid tomato plant growers I've used.  I've been happy with it so far.
B000RUM0R4 I bought tomato cages for $.99 each at the hardware store. I'll use this for flat beans. The one good thing is that you can do that, open the panels and make a \"wall\" of them, if you want. I hope for the price that it lasts more than one season.
B000RUM0R4 Seems like a good idea, though perhaps it should be used for plants that are going to stay a reasonably small size (unlike, say, Sungold tomatoes). Of course I won't really know how well it works until I have it supporting a fully grown tomato plant, and I won't have any of those for about ninety days. However, since Vine members are now required to have reviews in within thirty days, I guess this will have to do for now. Perhaps I can add something else later in the year.Sep 18. Still doing a good job of supporting a \"Goliath\"plant which has already produced around 20lbs of big tomatoes. One of the nice things about it is being able to move the crossbars, which I have done as the plant has grown. It's now around four feet tall. Very pleased with it.
B000RUM0R4 This was a great addition to our garden this year as I had planted my tomato plant before getting this.  I was able to add it after-the-fact without breaking the branches because I added the posts and then the supports.I love that you can adjust the supports to put them where you need the support the most, and that you can move them as the plant grows.This type of plant cage also makes it take up VERY little space when you need to store it.
B000RYL1BQ This compost aerator is sturdy with quality, solid construction. A great tool for turning or churning your compost pile/bin.Help other customers find the most helpful reviews
B000RYL1BQ The materials that this Aerator was manufactured from, were worthless.  I took it out of the box, and went outside to stir my compost pile.  Two days ago, I had removed the sticks, which had mixed into the vines, leaves and such that were in the pile. This left me with about a foot of well degraded plant material, mixed with dirt, and random fine roots.  I started to jab the pointed  end into the pile. However, the wings which are suppose to fold down and then stir the pile, simply stayed up. I would pull them down manually, and when it was placed back into the pile, they'd immediately fold back up. &#34;At least the bottom tip is mixing up the mulch&#34; I thought to myself.  After about 15-20 minutes, I looked at the tip, which was bent to the side about 45 degrees. The cheap paint on the steel (?) had flaked off the tip too.Usually garden tools last a lifetime. In fact, I have garden tools I inherited from uncles long dead, so they are lasting TWO lifetimes.  Nevertheless I can accept if a garden tool only lasts a few decades.  Or at least lasts a few years.  But when you get a tool, and it only lasts a FEW MINUTES?  Perhaps the company changed the materials that they make the aerator from, or they changed the company that they subcontracted to mold the metal tip. If you look at other recent reviews, others have also encountered the tip bending over, or the wings that bend down so you can stir, not bending down.  I hope the company fixes this problem, because this seems to be a good tool for mixing the compost pile.  Unless you have a shovel.
B000RYL1NE I ordered the Yard Butler Gopher/Mole Bait Applicator to use with voles.  The method is the same: 1. Look for evidence of tunnels running through the yard; 2. Probe with the unit to enter the tunnel; 3.  When you feel the &#8220;drop&#8221; of entering a cavity, stop at that point; and 4) Turn the crank on top of the unit and dispense pellets into the tunnel.  It takes a bit of practice, but is easily performed.
B000RYL1NE After I've cleared the drybrush and trees from the slope behind my backyard, a gopher infestation exploded in my lawns.  Never to be outsmarted by rodents, I tried a wide variety of anti-gopher weaponry, including this Yard Butler Mole/Gopher Bait Applicator.Likes:*Sturdy metal spike applicator with a t-bar handle and foam grips.*Fairly easy to use: place bait/poison in the top container, insert the spike tip into the gopher hole, and turn the dispenser handle on top to dispense the gopher tidbits (available separately).Results after two weeks:*I don't know whether the gophers were immune to the bait, or the poison actually worked and some other predators dug up their decaying carcasses, but I ended up with newly dug holes around the baited areas along with a good sized mini &#34;pitcher's mound&#34;.Conclusion:Gopher bait/poison did not work for me.  It only aggravated more gophers to dig more holes.  The only dead gopher was one that drowned in my pool, but that was weeks after applying the bait.  Now I'm also concerned about poisoning predators such as hawks, coyotes, possums, and skunks, that are important in the food chain.  I'm not using any more gopher bait/poison, but this applicator is very handy as a probe for locating gopher tunnels and implementing other weapons of rodent destruction.  If all else fails, time to call the pros.
B000RYL1NE This Applicator works good, but my Gophers have not died yet, or I have not notice it yet!I live on 10 acres ,on a river, we have allot of huge boulders, where thegophers like to hide.So its not always possible to get into the area that there in!I have to plant all veggies etc. in Large containers, but if a  veggies drops to theground without a piece of wood there, gophers are on it, and of course at night.I'm not seeing the ground coming up, but mainly Gopher holes, that is where I'm sticking thistube at and realeasing the pellets into, then covering it upThat said, this Yard Butler Bait Applicator works very good..I know other friends that have this, and forthem it gets there Gophers..Going to keep trying to get those suckers.If I notice a big difference I will be back to give a up-date.
B000RYL1NE Every winter and spring its mole war around my neighborhood. I've tried countless poisons and old school tricks with no real positive results. When the opportunity came along to test this Yard Butler bait applicator I was glad to give it a test run. The instructions are mounted on the tool and are quite simple. It takes seconds to load and its one of the cleanest ways to apply poison. The wing nut does a good job of locking down the feed box. I got a pretty good seal without any product loss. I particularly like the mechanics on this puppy. The barrel easily slides into the tunnel for a quick application of bait. Two weeks later and no new mole activity. The manufacturer tacks on a life time warranty. So far so good. I have no problem recommending this great, working device. Its built to last.
B000RYL1NE Works ok.  It does get jammed at the exit hole at times but I kind of expected that.  The real issue is finding some sort of bait that will actually work with this thing and actually gets rid of your vermin problem...  The only thing that has worked for my occasional mole visitor has been poison gummy worms.  I will use this to make the hole and drop the worms in...
B000RYL1NE Our problem is with moles.  With the soil we have here in SW Washington, this applicator works great and it hasn't jammed on me yet.  Using disposable gloves to load this applicator keeps human scent off the bait.  Very happy to have this applicator, I wasn't aware that something like this even existed.
B000RYL1NE This bait applicator is a quality item which will last for years. It is easy to operate, and the bait is easy to apply. I like that is it made of a coated metal, and that the handles have foam. We are using this for our growing vole problem, and I prefer to apply bait in a direct manner rather than  broadcast bait where non-targeted species might get at it.Recommended.
B000RYL1NE If you have a mole problem, this is a great tool to help rid the yard of this troublesome critter. This applicator has two main advantages over placing mole bait by hand. First, if you use latex gloves to load it, you can avoid human odor on the bait, which may render the bait useless given the sensitive noses of moles. Second, of course, you can apply the bait in various places around the yard while standing, and when finished simply hang the applicator in your yard shed or garage.I've found that, although the process is quite simple, it can be tricky to get the bait pellets in the right spot. The tunnels are easy to spot in most lawns and gardens, but placing the bait is important. Even if you happen to collapse part of the tunnel, moles love to reopen them if it means getting at some food. However, I think it is best to cover the hole left by the applicator with some dry leaves and a little soil on top of that. This way, the bait is somewhat protected from other creatures and the weather, plus it is easy to see where bait has been placed if you wish to check on whether it's been eaten.Bottom line: if you have a mole problem and tried a number of approaches to getting rid of them, this applicator may help. In my opinion, traps are effective if they are placed just so (I've had little luck with them), but bait and mole-killer &#34;worms&#34; work best.
B000RYL2CY Our hydrant is practically at ground level in an area that's frequently overgrown, so groping around for the handle in tall grass, stopped over, has always been unnerving (Kansas is spider country). This extender is great for keeping my off my hands and knees and away from the creepy crawlers.I do wish it came with a leader, but I was able to make a custom one of just the right length in about 5 minutes with some scrap hose and a couple of menders (like this one: http://www.amazon.com/Gilmour-Polymer-Male-Coupling-01M/dp/B00002N66T and this one http://www.amazon.com/Gilmour-Polymer-Female-Coupling-01F/dp/B00002N66U/--I went with the cheapies because I've used them before and I won't be taking the leader on and off, and they're not in direct sunlight). I used teflon tape at the connectors, and added a splitter (I used this one, which has big, easy lever handles: http://www.amazon.com/Nelson-Rezimar-High-Water-Kink-Free-50315/dp/B0015AOEYC/), so now I have two hoses in a stable base at a good height. Hooray!The fittings are nice brass fittings. I did use teflon tape, but didn't replace the old hose gaskets, and I had no leaks at the input or outputs, even under pressure. The frame looks to be powder coated steel in dark green to camouflage in bushes, square tubular metal, nice and heavy.It's a bit hard to push in and not 100% stable in really rocky soil (ours is basically gravel held together with fine topsoil), but that's tru of pretty much anything jammed into the ground around our building, since you essentially have to rock it in--just giving a warning if you have really rocky soil.
B000RYL2CY I'm using mine next to my vegetable garden.  I am a square foot gardener so I have raised beds & I have to keep them fenced in with chicken wire or the rabbits will eat everything.  The fence has always been a problem when watering because the hose hangs over/on the fence & causes it to sag.  But with this yard butler, I can get enough height to clear the chicken wire.It was easy to set up.  I used a block of wood on top & then pounded it into the ground with a hammer.  Don't use a hammer on the metal butler itself or you will likely cause damage.Mine has been working for 2 weeks so far with no leaks.  From reading other reviews, it seems there are good/bad ones; I guess I got a good one.  I'll update my review if it goes bad.
B000RYOAHS This tool is great for loosening the top 2-3 inches of soil in the garden. It does take a lot of muscle power and you certainly will get a workout with it. The more compact the soil, the more difficult it will be to use.I would recommend this product for gardens where the soil is not too compacted and hard. In that case you may need a power tiller. This product is great for small areas. It helps to break up weeds, but not the kind that send long roots.
B000RYOAHS A bad back is a problem when you like to garden since pretty much every gardening task puts a strain on your back. While this is not a perfect solution, it provides for less back strain than using a hoe for weeding.The build quality is pretty good. It feels solid, but is lightweight to handle. The telescoping action of the handle is easy to use (simple twist lock) and stays put when extended except for the most severe pushing. The tiller blades (or prongs, actually) are sharp and each can be removed to configure the tool for specific tasks, such as edge weeding. The blades are held in place with a nut that goes right through the blade frame, which is far better than a friction fit that other similar tools have.The catch is that this is not something that will replace a digging hoe or tiller. It&#8217;s for light weeding on ground that has been well-worked. For that task it performs well and offers the advantage that you don&#8217;t have to use a lift and chop motion as you would with a hoe, but rather a back and forth motion. I find that easier on my back.It also works well to help spread out pine bark mulch, avoiding the need to bend as much during that task. The rotating tines even out the mulch better and easier than using a bow rake.The handle grip is plastic and comfortable. No need to wear gloves to protect your hands when using this (although gloves are never a bad idea when gardening).I&#8217;ll give this 5 stars since, for light weeding on worked ground it performs very well, and has good build quality for the price. I would not, however, recommend this for more strenuous tasks such as breaking new ground or tilling.
B000RYOAHS I have 5 raised garden beds and used the &#34;Yard Butler RC-3 Garden Cultivator&#34; to help me get them in shape for this summer's crops.This cultivator is light weight and will only be useful for fully established gardens. I had to pull the weeds that have grown over my beds since last autumn's harvest and the Yard Butler did a good job afterward in cultivating the soil.One thing I noticed was the small roots (from both the weeds and last year's vegetables) immediately got wound-up around the wheels. However, I was able to correct this by removing the middle wheel.The wheels, when all three were in place, rolled nicely forward, but tended to get stuck/bogged down on the return motion. Again, I corrected this by removing the middle wheel. Each wheel has a little screw-knob for fast and easy removal.At the end of the day, the Yard Butler did an acceptable job for a light-duty hand-powered tool. My garden is planted and I am happy with this product.
B000RYOAHS I do a fair amount of gardening -- previously, I'd been using a ho or a shovel to till the soil before planting.  This cultivator does a much better job of breaking the soil up into smaller pieces.  The handle could be better to hold (it seems sometimes like it needs to be at more of an angle or something, to be able to jam it into the ground).  I do have very hard, clay-like soil where I live, so that may not be an issue for everyone.  Generally, this does an ok job, at a good price.
B000RYOAHS This has good use if you have a planter with soft soil but don't expect it to do much in harder dirt.  For the amount of muscle I'd have to use to get this thing to work in hard dirt, I might as well just poke it with a fork.
B000S61YO2 The Yard Butler Roto Planter works beautifully in soft or tilled soil for planting bulbs, herbs, tomato plant and the like.  It can be used in harder, more compacted soil, but that likely will take more effort than it is worth.  I like to use it in a tilled garden for setting plants.Watch out when using this around roots.  If you have not set the clutch on your drill to give/let loose at a certain level of torque, the Roto Planter can become locked in roots, causing the drill to twist violently and suddenly in your hands, possibly wrenching your wrist.Use this for lighter duty planting such as that described above and you will likely be very happy.
B000S61YO2 I was looking for an auger that would be wide and long enough for greenhouse posts but not require special equipment. I used this auger with my corded drill to dig holes for the posts for my greenhouse. My drill isn't special, just your typical home depot drill and it connected to it perfectly. It dug very easily through my rock-hard clay soil with each hole only taking about 20 seconds to dig.  The trick to prevent it from getting stuck is to bring it up every 4-6 inches to clear the hole from debris. This will be a keeper for all the bulb-planting I have to do in the spring.I would definitely recommend this auger.
B000S61YO2 I bought this for tree fertilizing not for bulb planting. I have a 19.2 volt drill. Using this in tough conditions. But unless I flood the ground it makes almost no headway. And when I flood it, it still doesn't go down quite enough.If you intend this for fertilizing at least in clay soils, it might not work so well. I was looking forward to some deep fertilizing and unfortunately has not worked as I had hoped.
B000S61YO2 We bought 100's of bulbs last winter thinking we would get to plant them before winter hit.  However, as was the case across most of the country, winter hit hard and lasted forever.  Beginning in October the temperatures stayed in the 30's and lower and only finally got above freezing a few days in March, 2014.I was worried the bulbs might not be good any longer if I waited until this fall to plant them, so we went outside yesterday (May 1, 2014) and started the planting.  I expected it to take hours to plant all these bulbs, but with the Yard Butler it was so quick and easy.  We were done in less than 2 hours including a couple of breaks, and now I just hope the bulbs will bloom next spring.  I just won't know how successful we were until then.As far as the Roto Planter is concerned it is a super helpful garden tool.  Be sure you have a drill that will accommodate 3/8\" bits...a 1/4\" drill (which is most common) will not work.EDIT:  May 19, 2014We bought some annuals to plant in our flower garden this past weekend, petunias, marigolds, impatiens, and verbena, and because the yard butler had helped plant all the bulbs so quickly I purchased flats of 48 of each of those varieties.  Hoping this would work as well as the bulbs we went out on a Saturday morning at 9AM to begin planting 196 flowers.  Normally this would be a several hour job.  Between digging a hole with a trowel, breaking the plants apart from their containers of 4/tray, planting each one, and filling the holes with miracle-gro garden soil to replace what was displaced by the yard butler, it took us (two of us) less than 1 1/2 hours to do it all.  One of us used the butler, the other followed with the plants and covering their new home with good soil.  Now, we will wait and see one absolutely gorgeous garden in a few weeks!This is an essential garden tool!
B000S61YO2 I thought this product would help me quickly plant the hundreds of bulbs I wanted to plant, and looked forward to using it to get the depth and width holes needed for my many different bulbs.Boy was I disappointed.First, I was trying to plant many of the bulbs in soil next to perennials, many of which had great root systems.  When I tried to drill next to the plants, to plant the bulbs, I destroyed the root system.  Not good.Second, I couldn't get this roto planter to drill deeply into the clay soil we have here; the roto planter would freeze while drilling.  My HAND bulb planter worked more effectively than this product did.  It also didn't work in soil that had any small rocks in it.Third, this roto planter's shaft is difficult to secure in a drill.Overall, I think this product is great for  \"perfect\" soil, but wouldn't suggest it for anything other than rock-free, clay-free, root-free soil.
B000S61YO2 We planted about 50 bulbs in under an hour with this planter.  Our soil was relatively loose with some roots from the hostas.  We used a Panasonic 15.6 Volt drill without any issues with pop-out.  The roto planter easily dug the holes.  However, some of the loosened soil did fall back into the hole even when we reversed the drill.  So, we did need to use a small hand trowel to push out some dirt before dropping in the bulb.  We look forward to using it for weeding and planting bulbs next year.
B000S61YO2 i was very patient and practiced a lot of hole drilling with it. now i can do it real good. it works great for mixing up soil in my big nursery pots... in my compost heap... in my sandy soil.  i aerated my front yard with it using my electric corded drill and it was fun. i loosened up some potting holes for some hedge plants. it works great for me. thank you.
B000S61YO2 Buy this as opposed to the Awsome Auger in the made for TV adds.  It is strong, and not a rip off for shipping and handling.  It is a great labor saver for bulbs, annuals and loosening dirt in flower beds. Use a good cordless drill and let it do the work. Don't expect it to get thru roots.  And if the dirt is loose and dry, the dirt will tend to fall back into the hole.
B000S61YO2 My husband tried using this to dig a few holes in the yard. He said it did get a bit tangled on some roots, but if you just lifted it out you could start again. It uses the charge on the drill (battery-powered) pretty quickly. I can definitely see some uses for this, such as loosening soil in a flower bed each spring; churning the compost, digging holes if you want to plant a LOT of bulbs, etc. With that in mind, remember that you will need to store it somewhere and take the time to find it and hook it up (which probably tells you how messy our shed is). I expect we will use it sometimes (e.g., for bulbs in the fall) and just rely on old-fashioned muscle power the rest.
B000S61YO2 I have less than ideal soil and I needed a better way of digging holes than one at a time with a hand spade.I came across something like this at a local garden supply store but it was only 8\" long and dirt got all over my power drill. No local garden supply carried anything longer so I bought the 24\" version from Amazon.I used a hand file to create a triangle on the end of the bit so that the auger wouldn't slip in the drill.  With my soil, I have to use a powerful electric drill.  In the areas where I've been using good soft soil, a battery powered drill worked fine.What would have taken all day using a hand spade took only minutes.  Great tool.  Wish I knew about it a few years ago.
B000S61YO2 We have a fairly large garden and have been wanting to plant flower bulbs around it, but the idea of digging all those holes was daunting to say the least.The Yard Butler made it so much easier! It's basically a small auger, that you connect to your drill and it digs the holes for you.  It was easy to use and works really well. Recommended!
B000S61YO2 This is  a great tool and has many uses but they need to make one slight modification. In my hard soil I could not get the chuck tight enough to grip the shaft of this roto planter without slipping. I took it to the grinding wheel and ground some flats on the shaft at the end that slides into the drill chuck and that took care of any slippage. An easy enough fix but every one who buys this might not have that option available to them. Now that I took care of the slippage I am finding many uses besides the intended bulb planting. I really think it would be difficult though to dig under a sidewalk with it, as mentioned in the description. I docked it one star because I think the manufacturer should have put the flats on the shaft...not me.
B000SDKGC6 Ordered this trap and was impressed with 
B000SDKGC6 This is a well designed product, strong and sturdy. It is easy to set and remove. Unfortunately in six months I haven't caught a single gopher yet. They are tearing up our lawn. I'm switching to a different product.Perhaps I'm not using these properly. The other thing is our lawn is mostly hard clay which might not be the soil in which this works best. We've found the trap tripped a couple of times but no joy. I know others have had much better luck with this model.
B000SDKGC6 Easy to set and works!  I have tried other products to get rid of the moles, poison worms, deterrent spry and granules, and other traps.  Trapping seams to be the only thing that works and these are by far the easiest I have found to use.  I've even bought a second one I like them so much.  Make sure to find and active tunnel and keep moving them if your are not getting anything.  Good Luck!
B000SDKGC6 Maybe because the clay soil is like a rock or maybe because my moles have become highly educated but I've not snagged one mole in three weeks. I have tunnels everywhere and holes all over my yard but no dead moles. The trap seems like a good idea and it's well constructed but I don't think it's made for my area of the country. It's difficult as crud to set with the hard soil but once set it has never tripped. I've moved it to different locations but still no luck. The design seems like a good idea so maybe it'll work in your area. I'm going to keep trying and if I get positive results I will correct this review. Not recommended for clay soils.
B000SP2JLU Three years ago, at the recommendation of a friend, I bought a squirrel-resistant bird feeder (Brome 1015 Squirrel Buster Classic). It worked so well that even the heavier bully birds couldn't feed from it. I have all kinds of birds who feast from this feeder, so I decided I should get a second one. This Perky Pet feeder became available, so I was happy to give it a try. It is much cheaper than my other one, and the difference demonstrates that you do indeed get what you pay for. The squirrels figured out how to get into this one pretty quickly. So did the starlings.This feeder has a nice design, and it looks like it should work just fine. It has a spring mechanism that pulls down the plastic shell over the feeder holes when something heavy sits on one of the perches. Unfortunately, a couple of the feeder holes on this model are high enough that the squirrels just have to hang down from the top of the feeder - without putting weight on a perch - and feast away. I do have this on a tall metal shepherd's hook, so *that* deters many of the squirrels. And I have considered covering up the higher feeder holes to keep the rest of them out. I certainly wouldn't recommend hanging this from a tree or post or anything that squirrels can easily climb. Because of where I placed the feeder, most of the bird seed is actually going to the birds, but it's not because this feeder is squirrel-proof.
B000SP2JLU I've been wanting a bird feed for years, but never got one because I didn't want to lure the birds in and then have them end as cat treats.  But this little thing will keep the cats off (esp. using a shepherd's crook) and keeps the local raccons and pussoms out of the feeder!  I love watching the bird eat and flutter around the feeder.  Will buy this one again!
B000SP2JLU This is the perfect birdfeeder for my front yard.  I mounted it by hanging it from a Live Oak tree, using a \"hook\" similar to this Petco Green Bird Feeder Hanger and a thin, strong chain something like thisDroll Yankees LC18 Locking Chain.It's heavy enough when filled to hang well & the smaller birds like sparrows now get to eat more, since this is a bit small for our coveys of doves.  Occasionally, a young dove will land on top of the feeder, trying to figure out how to get some seed, only to close the doors for the other birds.  So far, the squirrel hasn't tangled with this, probably due to my precarious Rube Goldberg setup.I like the unobtrusive look of the feeder & I like that it holds enough seed for about a week of feeding (it's getting more popular; first it was 2 weeks, then a week, now about 5 days!).  It's relatively easy to fill; springs hold the lid on and can be tension adjusted for the \"right\" amount of feeder restriction if you do have a curious squirrel.  A winner!Have questions?  Leave a comment & I'll help you if I can.UPDATE 5/2/13:  Yet another advantage of this feeder is that its slim design handles windy conditions better than conventional feeders.  I live in Texas & springtime can get WINDY.  I briefly exchanged this feeder with a square one & immediately noticed strong swinging and spinning motions that were keeping the birds from perching.  Changed back to this feeder the same day & noticed how much less this feeder's affected by wind, due to its leaner profile.UPDATE 6/8/13:  A squirrel braved the Rube Goldberg setup yesterday & made it down the hook, down the chain, and onto the feeder.  Only to be TOTALLY frustrated, since his weight closed off all the feeding stations, just as promised : )
B000SP2JLU I've had this feeder for a month and really like it! I saw other reviews that say it doesn't last or doesn't work against squirrels, so I'll update this later, but so far I like it a lot.It was easy to fill and the hanger is a stiff wire, so I could reach a high hanger without it flopping over. The internal spring is adjustable, though I haven't needed to do that. There are multiple perches for birds to feed (6), and when I watched our pesky neighborhood squirrel defeated by it, I was very happy. That squirrel drives me nuts! It holds a fair amount of seed (2 lbs. according to the label), so I've only needed to refill it occasionally.
B000SP2JLU We have tons of birds AND squirrels around our house. We can open the back door and see them all over hunting for food. We've even watched them from our back door stealing dog food off the porch. Many times!! We hope the poor things don't choke on it.That said, we can't seem to attract any birds or squirrels to this thing to even test it out. I've even moved it around the yard a bit and watched from my back door. They don't even come close to it.So, I can't tell you how well it works as far as keeping the squirrels away, since I can't seem to catch anything eating or trying to eat from it.As far as looks, it's pretty. I like the way it looks in our yard. It's a little hard to fill with the way the top goes on. As long as you expect to spill some bird seed(the birds will eat it anyway), it's fine, though.
B000SP2JLU A simple yet extremely effective design for  keeping squirrels out of the wild bird seed. My only two concerns are at the two separate ends--the top does not open far enough/easily enough to effectively fill the feeder and the bottom while designed I'm certain to make cleaning it easier also makes it easy for it to be dislodged and all the seed pours out on the ground--something I discovered after a strong wind storm blew the feeder off the pole it was hung on, dropping it 4 feet to the ground. These two issues are extremely minor in comparison to the extremely attractive and effective baffle mechanism for keeping the seed away from the squirrels--if there was a way to rate this as a 4.9 out of 5 I would not hesitate. My 91 year old Father-in-law spends many hours every day at his dining room table watching the squirrels get frustrated that they can not get to the seed, no matter how hard they try. The mechanism for setting the \"weight\" allowed to gain access to the seed is extremely well designed and made--adding value. Again two very minor issues that other wise would make this an outstanding squirrel proof feeder! christina & bogie
B000SP2JLU I love this bird feeder.  I have several squirrels who constantly manage to invade my bird feeders, but not this one. The Perky-Pet Wild Bird Feeder is double sided with the interior tower made of sturdy plastic and the outer tower made of metalwork with tiny spings hooked to it. The feeder has six feeding ports with metal perches that let  birds  feed, but not the heavier squirrels. When the squirrels try to feed their weight causes the metalwork to move down and block the feeding ports. When the squirrel leaves, the spings bring the feeder back to the original position.  The feeder holds over 3 pounds of seed and the birds love it.
B000SP2JLU I love the beauty of this feeder, the birds love this feeder!  Well made with a heavy fixture and very clever spring that allows only light birds to pick out the seeds,Cardinals, Woodpeckers and the very small ones have a shot of the seeds.I used to have to fill the old feeder at least once a day!  As the birds threw out the seeds that were in their way to select that one perfect one!  Now, the birds select the perfect seed and cannot throw the rest out!I fill this feeder about once a week!Highly recommend this Perk-pet Bird Feeder. 5 stars
B000SP2JLU This is a light-weight feeder with plenty of space for seeds and birds, but I'm unsure this is really squirrel proof because of the crossbars.  Others have submitted photos showing squirrels on theirs.  The top deflector isn't big enough to be squirrel proof.  Since we live in the high desert, squirrels aren't a problem for us.  (They live higher in the foothills).  Our problem is neighborhood cats!This could also use some anchoring in a strong wind, but mine is hanging right in front of my south-facing window, high above the ground where cats can't go.  This feeder is easy to fill by removing the top where the metal wire is.  The design prevents seeds from flying out.
B000SP2JLU Here's the thing... I happen to love squirrels. They are my favorite animal. I don't mind feeding them, I actually enjoy it.  What I don't like is when my birdfeeders get broken due to gluttonous squirrels perching precariously whilst pigging out.  So many of my bird feeders have been destroyed by the squirrels and so much food wasted as it falls to the ground while they hang swinging upside down trying to feed.I moved my feeders out of the trees and onto shepherd's hooks a few years ago and that has also helped to hold off the majority of my fluffy tailed friends.  This product, so far, seems to be baffling and deterring my remaining stubborn squirrels.  So far they haven't figured out how to get to the food.I have only had this feeder for a couple months but I am happy to say I have yet to see a squirrel or a chipmunk feed from this feeder. I have seen a few try, and easily give up.It has taken my birds a while to get used to this new feeder and they still prefer the other feeders I have out there, but my regulars are coming back to the new one and I see the food disappearing faster.  I am hoping to see more and more birds - less and less squirrels.It seems like a sturdy birdfeeder and I think it is priced appropriately.  I like the look and the finish and so far have no complaints.  It holds a lot of food and I would buy this feeder again and purchase it for a fellow bird lover.Cherise Everhard, April 2013
B000SP2JLU I found the PERKY-PET SQUIRREL-BE-GONE FEEDER to be somewhat of a mixed bag.  While the concept is sound - springs lower the feeder when a squirrel gets on it such that the outside feeding holes no longer line up with the inside ones - the actual application leaves a little to be desired.  Since the springs are out in the elements and are relatively small, I don't give the feeder more than one or two seasons before water, dirt, feed, and bird waste fouls up the springs causing them to rust and seize up.  Admittedly, I have only had the feeder for about 6 months and it still works as good as new (as far as I can tell), the writing is clearly on the wall.The other problem I have is when larger bids land on the feeder, such as woodpeckers or a random crow, the cage drops just as if a squirrel got on.  So far no smaller bird had its head in the feeder whole when the larger bird landed, but I can see some mini-guillotine action going on if some unlucky Nuthatch was feeding the same time as my Pileated Woodpecker came along.  Obviously that would not be good for the bird - or make me very happy.All told, I'm not sure I'm going to keep the feeder too much longer because of the issues above.  It's pretty and appears to be working well now, but the drawbacks clearly out-weigh the good points.
B000SP2JLU I have two of these things.  Once is a relatively recent purchase, the other has been in place for close to a year now.  I have mixed emotions about these feeders and have had mixed results.  It was interesting to me that other reviewers here have had very similar complaints as to the effectiveness of this feeder that I have.Overall this is a good feeder and the concept is great.  It should be noted though that almost ANY feeder that claims to be \"squirrel proof\" is stretching the facts just a bit.  Squirrels are bright animals and if there is a way of getting around all the devices we humans attempt to discourage their raiding of feeders, they will find a way.  That is a fact.  Now I will tell you that this particular feeder is better than most I have used in the past.  We have been feeding birds at this particular location for well over thirty years now and have gone through a lot of feeders; both commercial and home made.  While it is extremely difficult to count squirrels, I estimate that we have at least 30 to 40 of the little critters living on our place - we live in the woods.  We have a very large number of bird feeders...always have.Anyway, while this feeder is better than most, it does have a couple of flaws.  First, the squirrels quickly learned that if they shake the feeder seeds will eventually fall out...not a lot of seeds, but never-the-less than manage to get a share of them.  Secondly, the springs which run the squirrel proof portion of the feeder are located on the outside of the container.  They are constantly exposed to weather condition which does the springs no good what so ever.  I keep mine treated with 3 in 1 oil, applied in very small amounts which seems to help not only with the actual working mechanism, but does inhibit rust and corrosion.  I have not had the problem others have had with the varmints chewing on the holes and enlarging them as of yet.The feeder is easy to load and is attractive.  It is more effective than many like products and I will continue using them.  I don't begrudge the squirrels a meal now and then actually as I enjoy them and their antics but to be quite frank, with the cost of feed and seed these days, feeding a herd of hungry squirrels had become a bit of a financial burden.Overall I am giving this one four starts but can well understand why some have ranked it lower.Don BlankenshipThe  Ozarks
B000SP2JLU I have many styles of bird feeders all around my yard. This seemed like it would be a pretty addition; one that I thought would look lovely outside my window.  I loved the idea that it closed when something heavy landed on it. I have other feeders that do this so I thought that this would be made the same way and react to weight the same way as the others.It did NOT.  When anything heavier than a goldfinch landed on it it would close---and STAY that way.  At first I thought I just had very stupid birds - they would land on the feeder and then hop around like they were looking for a port they could eat out of.  But when I went out to see what was wrong, I saw their dilemma. They just couldn't find a port because the whole thing just closed and stayed closed.It was this way not matter how I adjusted the springs.I don't want my feathered friends to starve, so I will be taking this down right this minute.
B000SP2JLU I filled it with bird seed and hung it out in a tree where I have a couple of feeders with bird suet and three of the bird socks filled with thistle seeds.  Then I waited.  It ususally takes the birds a few weeks before they will try a new feeder, but the squirrel only waited a few days.  The squirrel that likes to frequent our bird feeders stopped by one morning and his antics as he tried to get to the bird seed made my family laugh till we cried.  He jumped on the feeder from a tree branch and he held on until it finally stopped swinging.  Then he tried coming down to an opening to get to the bird seed, but of course the opening closed.  He kept trying all the openings, but no luck.  Then, he scampered back up the tree and down the branch to the feeder and holding on to the perches at the openings (which closed from his weight) he tried shaking it back and forth.  I guess he thought he could spill it onto the ground.  That tactic didn't work either.  He still hasn't gotten any bird seed out of that feeder.  I think the birds love it as I have seen them out there eating and I have filled it up numerous times now.  The feeder keeps the squirrel from getting the bird seed and it is a lot of fun to watch!  I highly recommend this bird feeder to those who love birds and also share their yard with squirrels.
B000SP2JLU I like this feeder and it is currently hanging in my yard and has not yet been broken into by squirrels. The one comment I would make is that if you hang this too close to a bush or tree with a near-hanging branch, those crafty squirrels will reach out from the branch, grab the hanging feeder and pull it sideways without closing the feeder stations to dump the seed out on the ground. However if you position the feeder so that the only way for the squirrel to get to the feeder is to climb up and on it, then their weight will close the feeding stations and preserve the seed for birds. For a hanging feeder, this one is relatively squirrel proof--if you can hang it away from other vegetation, preferably from its own pole. Recommended.
B000SP2JLU Have always had a problem with large birds pigging out on the bird feeder that we retired several years ago.  When you are buying a 40 lb. bag of bird seed every several weeks you know it's out of control.  We miss having a feeder in our back yard....The Perky-Pet 336 has at least for now reduced seed consumption by a huge margin.  Large birds like doves etc...shut down the openings while the little ones can enjoy!  Had to adjust the springs so it would take a lighter weight to shut it down, we do not have a squirrel problem.  Bought a five lb. bag of seed at the grocery store, the feeder took less than half to fill and it's lasting like I can't believe!  The larger birds feed off the seed than falls to the ground under the feeder.  So, for us, this really provides the enjoyment of the birds while keeping bankruptcy at bay!  Hope you enjoy feeding the birds as much as we do.....I would recommend this product on our very favorable use.
B000SP2JLU The Perky-Pet 336 Squirrel-Be-Gone Wild Bird Feeder has turned out to be a great feeder. I have not seen a squirrel even come close to the seeds. The unit is easy to fill and the spring adjustment is useful also. Great product.
B000SP2JLU Squirrels are the bane of people like me who enjoy feeding their backyard birds. That's because, of course, is that if squirrels had their way they would consume far more seed than the birds.Because squirrels are very smart and crafty animals, there are epic tales of the extent human beings go to keep squirrels from getting seed from their bird feeders. My personal efforts are approaching epic. I spent lots of money, to me at least, for a bird feeder that tosses the offending squirrel into the air and unto the ground when they slide down to a perch. But the squirrels responded by simply swinging my feeder, spilling seed onto the ground, and then climb down to enjoy a meal.So Perky Pet has come up with an alternative bird feeder that might be what I need. The \"Squirrel Be Gone Wild Bird Feeder\" holds two pounds of seed and has six feeding ports. The feeder has an outer shell that slides up and down, opening and closing the ports. The default position is \"open\" so birds of any size - except eagles, hawks, black birds, doves, etc. - are free to feed at their leisure. If a squirrel or unwanted larger bird rests on the perch, the outer shell slides down slamming shut the opening to the seed.I am not mechanically inclined and cannot describe this next function properly. But it looks like the chutes by each port are designed in such a way that it will prevent spillage when the feeder swings back and forth. So this might be my solution. I am sure the Perky Pets company has very smart designers of feeders and other products; I just need actual evidence that they are smarter than squirrels. And my squirrels won't give up until a year of trying.
B000SP2JLU Update weeks later:  We didn't re-fill the feeder for several weeks, and only a few seeds remained at the bottom. Still, the birds kept flocking to this feeder (despite another one, full, about 25 yards away and similarly situated). I can't figure it out, but they really seem to love this feeder. When the other feeder is empty, there's no activity around it.Yesterday, we refilled, and man, they're going nuts! They seem to squawk a lot more at this feeder -- flying around and staking out a position, and making a whole lot of noise in the process. Again, it seems to be the same birds who frequent the other feeder but aren't so noisy. It's not really a problem; just funny how different feeders elicit different responses.Update several days later:  Still no squirrel, habitually demoralized or otherwise. But one thing I notice: Even though the birds are flocking to the feeder (mostly finches and titmice), it's hard to see them from 20 feet or so. They blend into the color of the feeder and the seeds. This might be a good thing if it thwarts the hawks known to frequent our pine tree but it does make it harder to enjoy seeing the birds.---This feeder is not as sturdy or as well-designed as our current squirrel-proof feederBrome 1015 Squirrel Buster Classic, but it's also less expensive.I'd say that this model is more appropriate for small, sheltered gardens where aesthetics and a more compact size are more important than rugged durability and functionality. (It's currently hanging in a mostly shaded area; I don't think the plastic liner would last long where our other feeder hangs, in full sun.)I see the feeder from my desk, and I've seen only one squirrel so far attempt it. It was quickly discouraged and went away.  Of course I can't attribute this to the feeder. Our squirrels might simply have been easily discouraged after too many failed attempts at the Brome feeder.
B000SP2JLU I have been watching this feeder for a few days now. The birds land on the feeder, take one beak bite out of the feeder then hop off and repeat. So the birds are using it but it seems to be slow going for them.
B000SP2JLU It took a while for the birds in our yard to \"catch on\" to how this feeder works.  But when they did, they  loved it.  Today there is light snow on the ground(not very often in Arkansas) and they are absolutely creating a \"bird mob scene\" on this feeder.  Thank goodness it holds a lot of seed and has a lot of perches.  And it's so pretty too....an extra plus.
B000SP2JLU I feel horrible about watching squirrels slip off of the Perky-Pet Squirrel-Be-Gone Wild Bird Feeder.  The handle is flimsy so I hold my breath each time a squirrel pounces on the feeder.  The reason I rated the feeder at a 4 is due to the fact that blackbirds are not deterred.  If anyone knows of a blackbird AND squirrel-proof feeder, please let me know!
B000SP2JLU The Squirrel-Be-Gone Bird feeder is a creative solution to an annoying problem, but unfortunately our squirrels seem to be smarter then Perky-Pet's designers.Prior to this feeder the only method we found to keep the squirrels out of our bird feeders were large plastic dome coverings. We put this feeder out without a dome, and for about a week the squirrels were stumped; they hung on the feeder, the metalwork shifted down, and they couldn't get any food. (Luckily, during that time they didn't try to chew out the plastic, as some other reviewers experienced.) However, they soon figured out that if they hung from the wire suspending the feeder, the metalwork wouldn't shift and cover the openings, and they could eat. We also had one small squirrel who figured out how to sit on the bottom ledge without pulling down on the metalwork. Squirrel party time! So, the dome returned, and now this is just a large and fancy looking feeder.The feeder is large, and wide instead of especially long. It holds 3+ lbs of feed, something to consider if you might have trouble lifting it overhead. It seems well-made; it stood up well to the week or two of abuse from the squirrels, and a variety of birds, from cardinals to starlings (unfortunately) have been using it since. It has only been up for a few weeks, but during that time it has both snowed and rained, and we haven't had any immediate problems with rusting or leaking, however time is really the test on that front.Overall, this is an attractive feeder with multiple perches, and is quite large. Whether the squirrel-proofing will work for you seems highly dependent on your local squirrel population.
B000SP2JLU I am a life-long avid bird feeder and I'm in the heartland of the country so I feed in all weather conditions. I also have to find a way to feed seed to birds without bankrupting myself feeding squirrels and deer or replacing flimsy feeders every year. Having said that, here's my review of this feeder:Pros:* It's pretty. And that's not utterly unimportant, as anyone who loves her garden would rather have a pretty feeder than an ugly one.* It holds a reasonable amount of seed.* Because of the design of the feeder holes, the seed doesn't spill much as it's being filled or moved.* The birds took to it immediately. Of course, as my yard is what my husband refers to as the \"All You Can Eat Bird Stuff-a-thon,\" they know the location of my feeders and so didn't need to \"find\" it.* It does, in fact, appear to be squirrel resistant. I hung it on a shepherd's hook without a squirrel baffle and only about 3 feet off the ground (thus, I did not need a neon sign that said, \"Squirrel Food Here!\")  And the next day saw two fat-tailed friends (and a chipmunk) on the ground under the feeder (Why they were finding much seed there will be explained under \"Cons.\") Had the feeder not been squirrel resistant, I assure you my little furry buddies would NOT have been on the ground!Cons:* The innards seem flimsy. The spring that makes the squirrel resistant closing mechanism work is small and seems not terribly sturdy. And it's  _inside_ the feeder, which is going to make cleaning the feeder problematic and, I think, will make the spring mechanism vulnerable.* It's not terribly easy to fill as it definitely requires two hands - one to hold the lid aside (resisted by the spring) and one to pour. (I also note that this took me a bit of figuring out as there is nothing in the directions that tells you how to fill it.)* While it does appear to be squirrel-resistant it is NOT deer resistant so, if your bird feeders are right next to a deer superhighway as mine are, they will get their tongues in the feeder holes and will empty this baby in very short order! And while they are at it, a lot of your seed will end up on the ground under the feeder where the squirrels will get it anyway.Having said that, if deer aren't a problem in your neighborhood, then you might not find this a \"con.\" (The only truly deer-resistent seed feeder style I have found is also by Perky Pet - and this is just one example; they have several styles:No/No Bronze Hourglass Bird Feeder  BZHG00325) However, without a squirrel baffle on your feeder pole, you'll be back to square one with those little beasties. So, if you get a squirrel baffle and a deer-proof feeder, you'll have spent a bit more, but will save a fortune over the long-haul in seed (and destroyed feeders!)Woodlink Ltd-Woodlink Audubon 6-Inch Torpedo Steel Squirrel Baffle.Conclusion: If you are a sometimes, only-casual bird hostess who doesn't want to spend a fortune on a squirrel resistant feeder, you may like this. If you are at all serious about your birdie buffet, this may not be the best choice.
B000SP2JLU A lot of \"solutions\" for bird feed loving squirrels are either ugly, ineffective, or both. This feeder hits a nice compromise of being both attractive and effective for discouraging squirrels. It is sturdy and well built and holds a good amount of feed. A good choice.
B000SP2JLU As with all squirrels ours are pretty darn resourceful. We have tried several different approaches. We have tried the urine scented tablets and granules without any success. and various different types of feeders with varying degrees of success. So far this one is actually working. the spring loaded cage that covers the feed holes when to much weight on them is a good idea and has worked perfectly so far. The only issue I have with this is that the springs get in the way of filling the feeder. Only time will tell how long the springs will last.I received this product free of charge to try through the vine program.Would I spend my own money on this? Yes
B000SP2JLU Considering this is a 20.00 birdfeeder made in China it seems to be OK. Obviously the construction is low end, but the birds are finally eating out of it. It took them almost a month to use it which is very unusual for a bird feeder here in the winter. Have not seen any squirrels attempt an invasion yet and I hope they don't as I doubt this will hold up to many heavy attacks. Very decorative. This would be a nice bird feeder for an in town situation. Not too sure how well it will do here in the country.
B000SP2JLU [Please see the update at the end of this review]I'm an avid backyard bird watcher, so I've had considerable experience with various types of feeders (including those meant to dissuade squirrels).  The PERKY-PET 336 SQUIRREL-BE-GONE feeder is much less expensive than some of the ones I've tried, so I was intrigued.  If it works, it will be a real find.The feeder arrived in one piece -- no need to do any assembly (that's a very positive thing -- anything that works right out of the box is great by me!).  It consists of a slender plastic tube to hold seed, surrounded by wire and metal leaves designed to prevent squirrels from reaching the plastic.  There are six perches for birds, with feeding ports that will close up if a squirrel (or a heavy bird) tries to access them.  The mechanism is controlled by a small spring, which can be adjusted to allow or deny larger birds access -- squirrels shouldn't be able to get to the food no matter how the spring is set.Well, I've had it up for about a week now, and so far the squirrels aren't interested in it -- but neither are the birds!  I watched a few birds circle it during the first few days, but they invariably went to one of my other feeders.  One did try one of the perches, but then immediately flew off.  It's possible the thing just looks strange to them, and they prefer the feeders they're used to.  But this is the first time I've put out a new feeder and had no takers after this long a time.So far, after a week of use, here's how things stand:POSITIVES:1)  Low price for a squirrel-proof feeder -- can't beat that2)  Arrives fully assembled3)  Attractive, slim design -- looks nice hanging out on my deck4)  Squirrels don't seem interested in it (so far!)NEGATIVES:1)  Very small feeding tube, holds only 2 pounds of seed -- if my birds start flocking to it, I'll be filling it every day!2)  Thin plastic feeding tube doesn't look like it will last very long, even if the squirrels do leave it alone3)  Spring that controls the squirrel-proof mechanism is very small, and it's located on the outside of the feeder, meaning it's likely to rust or otherwise deteriorate -- if it breaks, the feeder will be inoperative4)  Perches aren't large enough for cardinals to feed comfortably -- they prefer a feeding tray (if you're more interested in finches, this feeder should work)I will certainly update this review if things change over time.  At this point, I can't say this is a winner.  As for what HAS worked for deterring squirrels, the only thing I can swear by isF.M. Brown's Bird Lover's Blend No Squirrel Just Birds, 7-1/2-Poundbird seed, which contains hot pepper.  It totally keeps the squirrels away, and the birds don't seem to even notice the pepper.  It's expensive though, so if this feeder ends up working with my birds, I'll be happy.  We'll see.UPDATE 3/12/2013:  I decided to let my other backyard feeders run dry, just to see if the birds would start feeding at the PERKY-PET.  Sure enough, once the other feeders were empty, smaller birds began to give the new feeder a try.  I re-filled the other feeders (so the cardinals and other larger birds could feed comfortably), and the finches, sparrows, and nuthatches are still frequenting the PERKY-PET.  So, I guess it just takes time.I still think the small seed capacity is a detraction from the feeder, as is the lack of a feeding tray for cardinals.  But birds -- even in Maryland -- will get used to the PERKY-PET.
B000SP2JLU I had this same bird feeder many years ago.  It deteriorated with age (springs went bad) and squirrels eventually chewed the interior plastic up.  Why then would I get another?It's attractive, holds quite a bit of seed and doesn't allow \"junk birds\" (grackles, starlings, etc) easy access.  Is it squirrel-proof?  Absolutely not, but that type feeder just doesn't seem to exist, even though so many (including this one) advertise themselves as such.  One or two squirrels may not present a problem, but avid bird feeders or those who live in settings with large squirrel populations know just what I'm talking about.For the past few years, I've taken a different approach.  It's not the feeder that's the problem, it's the squirrel.  Expensive baffles now surround all our feeders and squirrel populations gets thinned out periodically.  We have gray, black, red, flying and fox squirrels, and they're all Harry Houdinis.This time around, I'm not giving the Squirrel-Be-Gone feeder a chance to get squirrel tested.  It hangs from an unused basketball hoop, and is used exclusively by smaller birds, although I can attest it is not their favorite feeder in our large yard.  Next to it hangs a cheap platform feeder, used by a variety of birds.  Next to that hangs a small peanut dish, which is actually the most popular of all three.  Even Red-bellied Woodpeckers love peanut halves.  The whole set-up looks tacky, but hooray, no squirrel can reach any of them.The Squirrel-Be-Gone bird feeder definitely does not live up to its name, but if used creatively, it's an inexpensive feeder (especially if found on sale) that does keep out seed-hogging big birds.  I just hope the springs last longer than the first one we had, and maybe an occasional lubing will help.
B000SP2JLU I have been feeding birds (and thus squirrels) for a long time. I've had all kinds of feeders, and I have come to respect squirrel ingenuity. They are geniuses at figuring out a feeder's design flaw and getting what they want.Still, this is a nice addition to my feeder collection, and so far I've only seen birds feeding from it. I'm not, however, so naive to think it will always be like this. While the feeder is attractive, I can already see that squirrels will probably solve this temporary puzzle. Perhaps a better name for this might have been Perky-Pet Squirrel Deterrent (At least for a while) Wild Bird Feeder.
B000SP2JLU I like the look of the feeder.  It's attractive, and I really love that it holds over 3 lbs of seed.  It was good for about a week and a half.  After that, the squirrels chewed at the plastic, just making the seed openings larger, and the springs stopped working consistently.  The idea is great, the execution just needs a bit of work.  Our dog, however, was overjoyed, as it became the popular neighborhood bar for the squirrels.  He loves chasing them and got a good workout daily.  Made the dog and squirrels happy, the birds were less than enthused.
B000SP2JLU I have a few bird feeders in our yard, ranging from a hanging umbrella-top thing with a pan bottom and a simple plate on top of a stand, but when squirrels take over, and they often do, the birds get bullied out of needed feed. Weeelllll...Perky-Pet is a long (somewhat over 2 ft) plastic tube feeder. It holds 2 lbs of seed and each perch is a U shape, supposedly the kind birds prefer (who knew?). So, squirrel tried to nail it from above, but the surface is slippery... and it bounces.  Entertainment at an affordable price while feeding the birds that civilized people prefer.UPDATE: This is THE lure for birds in our neighborhood now. It does hold a LOT of seed, and they now flock and eat it up in a few days... much faster than before, so expect to keep refilling weekly. But oh, how cool!
B000SP2JLU I had a lot of success with the previous Perky Pet bird feeder I requested from Vine. During the fall migration, we had a lot more feathered visitors than usual--and by \"more\" I mean both in terms of sheer numbers and variety of species. Since we also have a high squirrel population (cute, interesting, ubiquitous and greedy) I thought the Squirrel-Be-Gone (SBG) would be a perfect addition to the yard.So, because we didn't have an extra feeder hanger when the SBG arrived, we took down the reliable feeder and replaced it with this.  In the meantime, I bought food that was a much better quality than the generic stuff we'd been using, hoping to reduce the waste.The SBG hung for DAYS and remained full.  Occasionally a sparrow would hop on one of the little perches and then fly away. We couldn't figure it out. Did they not like the feeder openings? Did they prefer the cheaper food? Maybe the cheap seed was the equivalent of fast food, and they were \"junk-food junkie\" birds.A squirrel did jump onto the shepherd's hook hanger and try to access the food, but after bouncing around for a few minutes he left in frustration.  So, the SBG does discourage Shadow-Tails.Then, we installed another hanger and filled our original feeder, and the birds rediscovered our yard. The feeder emptied within hours. So, they obviously liked the food.The full SBG hung there, still full, still ignored.Eventually, though, maybe out of desperation, the birds started to sample seed from the SBG. Mainly house sparrows, but you have to start somewhere. Maybe they'll spread the word that poking their heads into the little feeder openings will not get them guillotined.We have seen nowhere near the enthusiasm our original feeder triggered. But now that spring migration has started, along with a cold front, it will be interesting to see if we get more avian traffic.Perky Pet is a good company. Both feeders are well-made and attractive. The Squirrel-Be-Gone is easy to set up and adjust so that birds can get the food and squirrels can't. It's also easy to fill and clean.I am still not sure why it's taking so long for this feeder to become a hit with the birds. But if they start mobbing the feeder, I will post an update.
B000SP2JLU I received this bird feeder one day before we got a snowstorm, so we had cause to put it in the yard immediately. Almost as soon as it went into the yard it quickly became the most popular feeder in the yard. Weathering the storm the next day really showed this feeder's strengths.This feeder is marketed as a squirrel-proof feeder. It's not, exactly - too much plastic instead of metal so a squirrel can gnaw through it in time. I would call this feeder more \"squirrel-resistant\". That said, being squirrel-resistant is actually not this feeder's strength though it is a big positive. The way this feeder's anti-squirrel strategy is implemented is by spring-mounting the wire sheath on which the feeding ports are mounted. When a squirrel gets on the feeder, its own weight works against it and the wire sheath slides down, closing the feeding ports. It does work, though the enterprising squirrel may find ways around this depending on how the feeder is hung.Adjusting the sensitivity of the sliding mechanism is easy. The springs that control the tension can be moved to increase or decrease the tension with one hand in about 5 seconds (if you're slow). This is nice - it does not require disassembly or special tools.Though this is a squirrel-deterrent feeder, that is not where this feeder's strengths lie. This feeder has two very good features that make it better than a lot of other feeders of its type.First, this feeder has six feeding ports, and each has a short perch that is suitable for small songbirds and very awkward for larger birds like grackles. We have more troubles with grackles than squirrels and as such this feeder is already doing well in comparison to the other feeders we own. Second - and this is very important - the feeding ports are designed to avoid giving up all of the seed in heavy wind. In the middle of a storm, it is not unusual to see all of the seed blown out of a feeder in a short period of time, requiring more frequent refills.The biggest evidence that this feeder is well-designed is how it attracts the songbirds. This is by far the busiest feeder in the yard now. With no squirrels or grackles chasing off the other birds and no wind blowing all of the seed out on the ground, this is a feeder that allows us to watch birds instead of continuously refilling the feeder.I am very pleased with this feeder and heartily recommend it. With this feeder in the yard, you will spend more time birdwatching and less time maintaining the feeder.
B000SP2JLU Although I purchased this feeder at a local Ace Hardware store several weeks ago, I stopped putting seed in it... I was only feeding the squirrels.  Apparently, here in Florida, the squirrels must be too light-weight to close the feeder, (I've taken several photos), and the birds (Blue Jays and Cardinals) are too large to stand on the very small perches and bend their heads into the cups... it's too difficult for larger birds and they fly off.  It would probably work well in an area where little Finches flock!
B000SP2JLU The funny thing about this birdfeeder is that out of the 5 I have in my yard, this is the only one that still has birdseed in it after a week.Now I can't tell if its because the squirrels can't get to it or because the birds don't particularly enjoy it either, but it works to keep seed in there longer!I have seen it in action, the squirrels try to hang off it and eat but cannot. We have it on a shepherd's hook so there is nothing else for them to hold on to while eating. I have also witnesses some pretty big birds on it, too, eating without a problem.The birdfeeder itself is fairly light. The metal is thin and the inside is made of plastic. My only concern is the squirrels who get desperate enough might gnaw at the plastic and render it useless as a deterrent.It is super easy to fill and while the rubber hanger seems fragile, it has held up in plenty of storms and birds, so I suppose its good.
B000SP2JLU I got the bird feeder on a whim thinking it would be a fun addition to the yard.  However, I have to say that the design is a bit clunky and not very eye-pleasing.  We haven't had many visitors to the feeder...just wondering if it might be the time of year or our location.  It's a great idea and it's constructed very well, but like I said, the look of it is a bit mechanical to me.  If you have a tree/bush/or garden area to place this within, it would work great.
B000SP2JLU This feed is very nice looking and it is designed to keep squirrels away from your feed by closing the access doors due to the weight of the squirrel. Unfortunately, all my birds are avoiding this feeder for some reason. I have filled my other feeders twice and they have not taken the feed in this one down by a quarter. I have watched them looking for a reason, even let the other feeder go empty for a bit giving them no other option, but aside from a few sparrows, the other birds won't even land on this one.I don't know why?
B000SP2JLU My biggest problem is that of squirrels and large birds infesting my bird feeder. I have heard mixed reviews about squirrel proof feeders, so I thought I would give this a try. I adjusted the tension to prevent squirrels from entering. Thus far it appears to be working; however, some of the larger birds are still able to access the food. I may need to adjust it a little more. I will provide updated posts on this as well once Spring arrives. In any case it is a nice larger feeder that looks nice and is easy to manage.
B000SP2JLU I was surprised by how light this birdfeeder felt. It seems that the inner part is made of lightweight plastic which it first has me concerned because I've never seen a squirrel be detoured effectively by plastic.  The idea is, you fill the center part with bird seed. As the birds come to feed they rest on the metal bars just above the leaf design. Because they are lightweight the birds do not affect the position of the LEAVES, which if you haven't figured it out, act as barriers to the openings.  Therefore, when a squirrel comes a calling, their weight, pulls the \"cage part\" down so that the leaves cover the openings. Pretty ingenious. It also has kept away the sometimes pesky Magpie birds that often try to dominate the feeders.You have to place in a way where the squirrels can't hang from it and chew through the plastic, of course, if they're hungry enough, NOTHING can stop a Squirrel from getting through. The feeder is attractive and if you can take the time to fiddle with the loading of the seed and giving it a drop of oil every now and again, it could serve you well.  It's hard to beat that price (it was just under $20) for a feeder that could be an moderate squirrel deterrent, it's not bad.  Some people have reported having this one for 6 years, and that is pretty impressive. I suspect our squirrels have bigger teeth!  But the Birds love the support and it's worth the extra effort for that alone!
B000SP2JLU I would have rated this feeder a \"0\" or - 1 star if available. I bought this feeder about 9 months ago and should have taken it back then. The birds liked it at first, then stopped feeding from it even though it was 3/4 full of seeds. When I took it down, I saw that the remaining 3/4 of the seed were wet and matted together in a moldy \"brick\". It took about one hour to \"clean\" it and clean up the mess in my kitchen. Neither the lid nor the base is removable for cleaning, so there's no way to remove and clean the seeds from half way down to the bottom. To prevent the squirrels getting the lid off, it's designed to pull up a little way and tilt to the side for adding seed.If you turn the feeder upside down to shake out the old seeds, the lid (spring mechanism) pops back in place. That doesn't really matter because the seeds are wet and compacted into a brick anyway. I had to push a 13\" screwdriver into each port and try to loosen the seeds while running hot water through the top (cold water didn't work). I must have used 10 gallons or more of hot water and ran the garbage disposer the entire time I was attempting to clean this horrible \"feeder\". I bet it cost me $5 to clean the feeder.It's impossible to reach downward with a screwdriver to force the seeds loose, and you can't clean it because you can't get a brush in vertically. It's a HORRIBLE design. Once I flushed and poked most of the seeds out, I soaked the feeder in a big bucket of soapy water, then flushed it again. I still did not get out all the old moldy seeds.Since I could not get inside to dry it, I had to set the feeder on the floor near a heat register for THREE DAYS to dry it out. The birds left my yard and it took a couple weeks before they came back.After all that work, I decided that the wet seeds must have been a fluke -- perhaps the result of a heavy sideways rain or snow. So instead of returning the \"feeder\", I filled it again. Duh!! Within a week, the same thing happened. I took it down.It's been 9 months since I bought it, but I'm returning it to Lowe's tomorrow.This bird feeder is readily available for $19.99 at ANY big box store, yet online stores still try to sell it for much more. This feeder isn't worth 50 cents EXCEPT...for the fun of watching the squirrels try to get the seed. They cannot, and after less than a week, they gave up and went away. After that, I couldn't even use the feeder for fun.Buy a Brome feeder, and buy a 16-18\" diameter clear dome to hang over the top. It protects the birds from the weather while they eat. Of all the feeders in my yard, birds prefer the one with the dome. 10\" and 12\" domes don't protect the birds or the ports.UPDATE:  I never complained to Woodstream Corp. about this feeder. However, Woodstream saw my review and a Customer Rep. sent me the nicest letter! She said \"Your comments concerning the design and experience cleaning this model feeder have been shared with our product development team.\" I believe Woodstream genuinely cares about customers and making good products. To make up for my inconvenience with the Perky-Pet 336 Squirrel-Be-Gone Wild Bird Feeder, Woodstream sent me a Perky-Pet 337 Squirrel-Be-Gone Wild Bird Feeder as a replacement. It has three tubes so I can use 3 different kinds of seeds, and the lid comes off by unscrewing a large knob on top. Much easier! I didn't like the Perky-Pet 336 Squirrel-Be-Gone Wild Bird Feeder, but I LOVE Customer Service at Woodstream Corp.!! It's top notch--more than a 5-star rating. THANK YOU, Woodstream.
B000SP2JLU We have had this birdfeeder for many years and had great luck with it, so I just ordered another.  It absolutely does work to deter squirrels.  All birds seem to enjoy the feeder, including our larger woodpeckers.The downside of this feeder is also the upside.  The squirrel-busting mechanism for this feeder is the wire external structure, which is mounted on adjustable springs.  When a squirrel attempts to grip or jump on the feeder its weight automatically pulls the metal part down, closing off access to the bird food.  It is 100% foolproof.On the downside, I have read reports of small birds having their heads guillotined if they are feeding when a heavy bird or squirrel lands on the feeder.  I have never seen that happen, but I did at one time find the head of a small bird near the feeder.  That possibility really unnerved me.  Right now I have my feeder set to be as unresponsive as possible to weight, so that only a squirrel will close it (so it does not close for woodpeckers, starlings, etc.).  I also have it mounted in such a way that squirrels are unlikely to be able to reach it.  I am comfortable using the feeder with those caveats, but I do think the rapid closure and deep feeding holes could create a dangerous situation for small birds.
B000SP2JLU We have a feed tray outside that a squirrel is always getting into, then kicking off of (leaving the tray swinging/smashing into our window), so we're eager to give this a full test this season. The design looks solid and feasibly squirrel proof, so we can't wait!
B000SP2JLU I already had a bird feeder when I got this, so this is feeder #2. The first one is quite different in style.Here's the linkfor the first feeder (for comparison). When I added the new feeder, I filled both feeders. The birds completely ignored the new one while they emptied the original. However, once the original was empty, they discovered the new one and seemed to have no problems with it.Here are the positives for the new one:(1) It's fairly sturdy.(2) Small birds have no problem using it.(3) There was minimal spilling when I filled it.(4) The birds do not empty it as quickly as they do the first one, so the seed in it lasts longer.Here are the negatives:(1) It comes with minimal directions and no directions for filling. As best I can tell, to fill it, you pull off the top (easy enough) and push it to the side. However, as the top is attached to a spring, it tends to snap back. Keeping the top open is not easy, though I finally figured out to hook the top over the corner of the eave.(2) Because the perches are small, larger birds may not be able to use the feeder. I have doves that come by, but I have not seen them on the feeder. Typically, they sit on the ground anyway and eat the seed that the smaller birds spill.I'll keep using this feeder, but I'll keep the other one out too.
B000SP2JLU The huge blackbirds cannot steal from this one.  I feed big birds and even squirrels, but needed a feeder that the finches and smaller birds could utilize.  This is it, and I love it.  It is also very attractive.
B000SP2JLU Over the years I have tried several squirrel-proof bird feeders but to no avail. Chipmunks and baby squirrels can still go at it, especially in spring. These small critters appear from nowhere and go at my birdfeeders faster than humans can outsmart them.The design of this feeder is unique and built sturdily. It has six feeding ports with U-shaped perches and the feeding ports have sturdy metal to prevent squirrels from chewing the ports. When squirrels perch on them, their weight causes the entire metal casing to slip down, completely blocking the feeding ports and the seed. The adjustable weight activated springs allows me to change to any of the four different tensions, giving me the ability to choose what size bird I want at my bird feeder. Currently I have adjusted to the lowest tension allowing only small birds like sparrows can use them. After few weeks, if chipmunks can't get at it, then I will raise the tension level to two so that slightly larger birds can get at it. I have been using this for the past two weeks and so far it appears to be working.With regards to the durability, I don't know if the weather, in the long run, has deleterious effect on the materials of this feeder mainly from sun, heat and rain. If something comes up, then I will update this review.1.Perky-Pet 337 Squirrel-Be-Gone III Wild Bird Feeder2.Birdscapes 735 The Preserve Wild Bird Feeder3.Birdscapes 351 Squirrel-Be-Gone II Wild Bird Feeder4.Heritage Farms Squirrel Proof Bird Feeder5.Contech SquirrelStop Automatic Spinning Squirrel Deterrent
B000SP2JLU I like the capacity of this feeder and the number of feeding holes it has.  It is easy to fill, I use a wide mouth funnel and a small coffee can.  The spring loaded sides shuts off the feeding holes when squires or large birds try to feed.  I have purchased three before this one. The only problem I have had with the older one is that the springs corrode and stop working, then I just put a wedge to keep the holes open.Rain does work it way into the feeder holes and once a year I have to take the bottom off the feeder and clean it out.  Small birds lover this feeder.
B000SP2JLU This is a nice looking squirrel &#34;proof&#34; feeder. It is on the large side so ensure you have room for it.
B000SP2JLU PLEASE READ UPDATE AT BOTTOM DATED 5-2-13I have resident squirrels that love the bird feed - and many bird lovers can confirm that we come near to ripping out hair when the grey rodents take over the eating stations, we'll do nothing short of standing guard w/ guns to keep them away!Anyway - the squirrel has yet to breach this one.  It works well and the springs on the side are adjustable but I have to mention that it seems a bit flimsy and doesn't look as nice in person as in the photo.  The inner sleeve that holds the feed is plastic but it's grey and not \"new\" looking.I have this hanging next to a BROME squirrel buster feeder.  The birds congregate around the Brome feeder first and when empty, they will venture to this one.Two things - I think it's harder for the birds to get the feed from this Perky-Pet feeder HOWEVER the plus side ---- there is not an abundance on the ground under the feeder either.  My original squirrel buster is the favorite feeding station but guess what???  There's seed all over the ground under the feeder.I suppose, if I had to make a choice, I would go with the Brome squirrel buster feeder.  While I go through feed rather quickly - the spread on the ground allows tons of birds to eat AT the feeder and UNDER the feeder at one time so it's quite the site.The original is Brome 1015 Squirrel Buster Classic and retails (with PRIME) for approx. $50.  I can say that is what my daughter paid for mine at the local Agway store too so Amazon's price is comparable.The PERKY PET Squirel-Be-Gone retails for about $20 (with PRIME)but as I said, the PP feeder doesnt' seem to be as durable or sturdy as the more expensive Brome.  Birds do not know the difference between the cost but I don't know that the PP feeder is going to last more than a year or two...where the Brome is going on 2 years and holding tight.There's more to consider.  Come fall we have a big bear that loves to rip the suet and feeders down, destroying everything in its path.  So do I want expensive feeders in hope to remove them before the bears' surprise visits or do I want cheaper feeders that I won't be sick when I wake in the morn to find them torn up???  These are the things to keep in mind when purchasing.  Currently the Brome and the Perky Pet are keeping the squirrels at bay, so you choose how much money you want to invest.I know this review is back and forth - but consider everything and in the end, throwing feed out the door will bring in the birds and spread far enough that both the squirrels and the birds can eat with no competition!  Have a great day !5-2-13 -- BEAR came this Spring.  There's a 3 wk time frame from when their hibernation ends and the berries are ready to eat so they come calling for seed and suet.  Well I'm sick of them. As for the feeders - the BROME came through without a problem.  This Perky Pet feeder snapped like a dead stick.  Springs were sticking out all over like hair gone wild and the inner sheath was out and empty.  Oh yeah and the solid metal stake was twisted like a curly fry.  Anyway - the Perky Pet feeder did keep out the squirrels for the time we had it but now, it's no more cuz it couldn't last the bear beating it took.
B000SP2JLU Well, although it works like its supposed to (so far) when a squirrel climbs on it, the squirrels jump on it to swing it and when they jump off, the spring loaded gizmo pops back into place and seed falls to the ground, giving the squirrels what they want.You also need to hang this up much higher as its on the long side and some squirrels jump from the ground and climb up it. I also don't fill the feeder to the top because its way too heavy and the way i have it hung really droops the rope making it hang too low.As for the construction of the feeder, its just a matter of time before either the springs rust and don't slide up and down anymore or the tiny pins the springs click into will fail. Even when this happens its still a nice large feeder that plenty of birds can share. I honestly do not think that there is anything out there that truly keeps the squirrels away.
B000SP2JLU The Squirrel-Be-Gone lives up to its billing of resisting the actions of squirrels while still allowing small birds to enjoy the seed contained within.We have well over a dozen squirrels in the area that have become experts at defeating most all of the measures I have taken over the years to prevent them from devouring every sunflower seed I put out. Powdered red pepper works with limited effectiveness, but I've found that some of them have a taste for spicy things.Baffles and oversized pole covers only slow them down, and the only thing that works without fail is to use safflower seed instead of sunflower. However, some birds still like variety and offering a variety of seed increases the number and variety of birds that visit the feeders. This feeder seemed to be the answer to that need.Right out of the box, this is an attractive feeder. The bronze color and the leaf motif makes it a nice addition to any backyard, or front yard for that matter. The seed hopper is clear, so you can see how much seed is left quite easily. The feeder is suspended from a coated wire, which should hold up to the elements well, and might even sustain attempts by squirrels to chew through it in order to dump the feeder. The proofing part of this feeder comes from the wire and leaf outer portion of the feeder that is spring-loaded.During normal use, birds are able to land on the U-shaped perches and eat from the cutouts in the seed hopper. When a heavy animal tries to access the seed, its weight loads down the spring-loaded portion, which then covers the cutouts, blocking access to the seed. See the photos I have posted for visual reference of each kind of activity.I have to say, watching squirrels get denied is just as enjoyable as watching the birds at the feeder!With only a few weeks of use, there's no way yet to know how the feeder will hold up to normal use as well as the continued attempts by animals to get at the seed. While squirrels have been denied, raccoons can be more motivated. The effects of weather can also take a toll on plastics and metals alike, so time will tell and so will I if there is anything more to report at a later time.
B000SP2JLU It really works!  We have about a dozen or so different types of bird feeders, and had pretty much given up on trying to keep squirrels out of the seed.  The buggers would hang from their hind legs upside-down on the fence so they could reach in and steal bird seed from the feeders.Don't get me wrong. I have nothing against squirrels. We even put seed corn cobs out for them to eat.  They are cute little critters and fun to watch, so long as they aren't destroying something I own.  But I got tired of having to replace bird seed in my feeders every few days because the squirrels were feasting on it at will.Well, it's not working for the squirrels anymore!  The moment anything puts the slightest amount of weight on the metal frame around the outside of this feeder, it pulls down and closes off the holes, making the contents inaccessible. Within a day we noticed the squirrels weren't trying to hang upside- down anymore from the fence, and they have resorted to foraging on the ground below the feeders to get seed. Success!There are other nice features about this feeder also such as the small vent holes at the bottom, which allow water to run out of the seed tube.  The bottom is angled up in the middle to prevent water from pooling at the bottom, causing seeds to rot or grow/ferment.  The top lifts up for easy filling.Another bonus is that the tension can be adjusted on the spring that allows the \"cage\" around the outside to move up and down.  By adjusting where it hooks, you can adjust the tension some.The birds are happy, the squirrels may not be as happy anymore, but my pocketbook is happy to know that the money we spend on seed is going for actual birds, not just squirrels and other critters.
B000SP2JLU I received this bird feeder for free to review from the Amazon Vine program.  A house in our neighborhood has this same feeder hanging out on a tree in their front yard.  It looked very attractive whenever we would walk by and always has lots of birds feeding from it.  I was happy to be able to have the same feeder on our yard.  We hung it up in the back yard and so far it has indeed been squirrel proof.  Mechanically this feeder has weighted springs that shut the feeding windows when anything heavier than a bird tries to eat the food.  In our yard this design seemed unnecessarily complex.  The wire handle is too thin and slippery for the squirrels to climb down, which prevents them from getting at the food, though they have certainly tried. It actually seems kind of mean having all this free food out there where the squirrels can see it but not reach it. I think if you wanted a squirrel proof feeder for less money you could just buy a less complex design and hang it from a thin wire the squirrels could not climb down and it would be just as squirrel proof. But all in all, this feeder is very attractive and makes a nice additional to our back yard.
B000SP2JLU Construction is pretty flimsy, and I don't know how long it will last in the elements, but I didn't expect much for such a low price. The tension on the anti-squirrel system is easy to adjust, and it does seem to deter the squirrels somewhat. The squirrels now hang from the branch the feeder hangs on and get the seed that way. I may try adding some wire to move the feeder away from the branch. Cleaning is a little more difficult than some of my other feeders because of the greater number of parts. Ease of filling is about average, similar to other cheap feeders that I have. Overall, worth the money, but there are higher quality feeders out there for only a modest increase in price.
B000SP2JLU This arrived decently packed and intact despite some delicate parts.  The feeder has a brass finish but is made out of very lightweight materials - it looks good from a distance but the lack of quality is apparent once you have it up close.We have VERY smart squirrels in our area - and they are quite territorial and eager to feast on the bird feeder seeds.  In fact, they feast on everything - from Halloween pumpkins to anything we try to put in the garden.  Nothing survives our plague of squirrels.I was skeptical of this feeder due to it having a plastic barrier.  The squirrels here chew through everything so plastic isn't going to stop them (as I found with my garden vegetables and various covers I used to protect the veggies).  So I know this isn't going to last very long as a bird feeder.  On the plus side, perhaps the seeds will keep the squirrels out of the vegetables (and not eat my son's halloween pumpkin before it even gets to be used for halloween).Interesting concept but needs a little more development.
B000SP2JLU So far, I am pleased with my Perky-Pet 336 Squirrel-Be-Gone Wild Bird Feeder.  It's attractive leaf motif matches all of my exterior lighting.  The spring-loaded product design which 'closes off' the feeding holes from the weight of a squirrel is clever.  So far, I have not had an issue with a squirrel robbing the feeder.  The birds seem to enjoy the feeder.  In the week since it was hung, I have noticed a definite increase in bird activity.  Overall, I am pleased with the product.
B000SP2JLU I always get compliments on this bird feeder and it is quite pretty where I have it hanging. My old bird feeder had the same capacity as this one and needed to be filled more often so I'm not sure if the mechanisms are working properly. And because I seem to have more birds since my cat stopped hanging out by that window, I think it must be that only one or two of the openings is working properly. (I'm choosing to view this as a positive attribute at this point since bird food is expensive.) This feeder is easier for me to fill than my last one, but that's not saying much. My neighbors have feeders that seem to be much easier, but not the high capacity of this one.I cannot attest to the squirrel-proofness cause we don't have a squirrel issue in our neighborhood for some reason. Chipmunks, however, are everywhere. I've been keeping my eye out for the scavengers on the feeder, but haven't seen any yet.
B000SP2JLU I don't have a huge problem with squirrels normally.  The few I do have are not bothering this feeder at all.  They did for the first few days and then gave up.  If that changes or I have other problems, I will update this review.  The one thing I do like is the fact that the larger birds have difficulty using this feeder.  Living in the city, means dealing with pigeons.  They and similar large birds are too heavy for this feeder.  Now maybe the smaller birds can get some food.  I am happy with the feeder so far.
B000SP2JLU I've used a feeder like this before and was glad to give this one a try. We have lots of birds and lots of squirrels. Lots of squirrels. This is designed so that if a squirrel manages to get onto it, his (or her) weight will cause the portals to close (spring-action) and they can't get at the seed. The other one I had like this lasted for several seasons. Highly recommend this feeder.
B000SP2JLU It's an interesting design but has a major flaw: The feeder tube is plastic and squirrels chewed through it in just a few weeks. Now the seed just pours out and the feeder useless.
B000SP2JLU This feeder is easy to fill and holds about 3 pounds of mixed bird seed per fill.  The adjustment springs are easily accessible and simple to operate.  Lengthening or stretching the spring increases the weight required to close off the feed ports and shortening the spring by hooking it in the highest adjustment hole causes the feed ports to close with less weight on the perches.I hung my feeder on a 6' tall shepherds hook well clear of tree branches and no squirrels have been able to get at it.  I have set my feeder on the shortest spring travel in an effort to keep flocks of blackbirds from emptying the feeder before the smaller birds get a chance to eat, and that worked for about 10 minutes - - - until the large birds discovered they could support their weight on the flange at the bottom of the feeder with one foot and grab the wire of the sliding cage with the other.  When 2 or 3 blackbirds do this they can feed until they are full.  If more birds land on the perches, the ports do close and all the birds leave, but then they return and repeat the process.  It slows the blackbirds down but does not stop them, so only 4 stars.This feeder does work well with cardinals, song sparrows, chickadees and similar birds when not harassed by the larger more aggressive birds.  I believe the flange around the bottom of the feeder would allow squirrels to get at the feed as easily as the blackbirds did however, if the feeder was placed in a location accessible to the squirrels.
B000SP2JLU From far away this is a nice looking bird feeder.  It works on a pressure system, if something weighs to much and is on the perch the plastic covering will slide down and block the hole to get the feed.  My issue with the feeder is that the little metal figures attached are very flimsy and bend way to easy and I have already had one come off my feeder after only a few weeks of use.I would give 5 stars for appearance because it is a nice looking feeder but it gets 3 stars for just feeling cheap.
B000SP2JLU We don't have squirrels, but this is a nice feeder anyway.  The birds have accepted it well, and it doesn't dump much seed on the ground.  Just fill it and hang it up.  No problems so far.
B000UGT94C Peat Pots.... not much to say.  Hold their shape well, and slowly disentegrate over time once planted.  Work great for transplants and plantings.
B000UGT94C Always a useful item to have around the garden. Just throw in some potting soil and it&#8217;s ready. The entire pot is planted, reducing stress on seedlings.
B000UGT94C These are so easy and work so well for me. I start the seeds in the Jiffy Pellets and transplant the whole thing into the 3 inch pot with Jiffy seed starter soil and in the spring, I plan the whole pot in the ground, or put the transplant pot into a ceramic pot for inside.
B000UGT94C I love these - they are holding up quite well. And I really like the idea that you simply put it in the ground with your plant. MUCH better than all those little plastic pots!
B000UGT94C It's hard to say bad things about these pots. You plant your seeds in them, water them, and when you see the roots start to poke through the bottom, you transplant the whole thing into your garden (or a larger pot, if you'd like). You can start plants with even the most delicate roots indoors, and transplant them out without killing them by breaking the roots when tapping them out of the pot.The big problem is that the pot material wicks moisture out of the soil. I have to water seedlings in these pots two or three times as often as ones in reusable plastic pots. The best solution i've found is to buy plastic pots that are exactly the same size as these, and nest the peat pot inside the plastic one. That way the moisture stays in, but i can still transplant the seedling without disturbing its roots.
B000UGT94C When I germinate seeds in peat pots, I put the pots in cooking trays and keep some water in them which effectively becomes a self-watering container. The Jiffy pots held up well. These basically fell apart when I tried to plant the germinated plants.I would not use again.
B000UHDDJI If I had known how much I'd like this hose, I'd have hooked it up a lot sooner. The tri-grip collar made for one of the easiest and most secure connections I've ever had with a hose. The large collar is easy to grip and allows for plenty of manual torque. The other end with a metal coupling also allowed easy nozzle attachment.So far I've experienced no kinks and winding up the hose has also been a good experience. The next time I have to buy a hose, the Gilmour Platinum will be my first choice.Gilmour backs this hose with a full lifetime replacement policy and no fine print.
B000UJZCBS The woodpeckers stole this off the porch they love it so much. Ordered a holder so it won't happen again
B000UJZCBS We bought this case of suet cakes to supply our new Stokes Select Squirrel-Proof Double Suet Feeder.  Within a few hours, the feeder became a most popular place for the smaller-sized bird species.  While the feeder holds 2 suet cakes, we&#8217;re loading the feeder every 3-4 days (which is rather impressive.)  At $1.50 a cake (with free 2-day Prime member shipping), the case is a good deal to man and bird.
B000UJZCBS I used to make my own suet for my winter birds. I found this had everything I like in my suet. I did some pricing and found out that this was a better deal.
B000UJZCBS I get a number of different bird species with woodpeckers being my favorite. This suet, as many others have noted doesn't hold together very well. You have to be extremely gentle with it when taking it out of the package or it falls apart. Aside from that, the birds like it, and it's reasonably priced.
B000UJZCBS So nice and super cheaper then one by one at the store's.I like it. I keep it all in my freezer so it stays nice and handy anytime I need one for my bird feeders.
B000UJZCBS Well I don't eat it but the birds sure do! Very popular with the woodpeckers and many other birds too.
B000V1UU6M Works great on grease and grill grime. Add water with your grill pro cleaning brush and your grill is much easier to maintain. Received  packaged in plastic bag separated from sprayer with capped bottle. I would recommend
B000VOECSG This chainsaw is very reliable and does a great job at cutting down thin trees, branches and firewood logs.  Don't expect this thing to be able to cut down huge oak trees in your backyard - it has its limitations.  Not only is that not advisable without a professional, but it will likely overwork the motor and signficantly cut down the life of your chain saw.  Have used this chain saw extensively and am very happy with it for minor projects and really an important tool for every homeowner to have.
B000VOECSG This is a very nice saw.  While it is not meant to do big jobs, I cut down an Ash tree that was 12 inches in diameter at the base and this little devil just cut through is very well.  A gas powered saw would do the job better, but it worked just fine for me and is great for what it was designed for which is trimming limbs, branches, etc.
B000VU4KM8 I saw this until on a TV show that sells items....looked really handy as I have a lot of landscaping and I already had the WORX EDGER with the lithium battery I am crazy about...SO I knew about WORX quality already...and the price and reviews on their web page was really good.....Almost got it but decided to check AMAZON.COM first....low and behold it was priced LESS and FREE SHIPPING...ordered it in less than a minute from AMAZON...arrived in 2 days! Gave it run and it was so much better than my old Black and Decker vacuum.....and much handier with the shoulder bag....They weren't kidding about the force of the blower either....So Nice to have both a Blower and Vac together that mulches great....already putting free mulch in my garden beds.....
B000VU4KM8 A twin-barreled blower/vac .... switch between functions on the fly ... it sounds great, doesn't it? It sure does!I took the plunge. I have a 1/4-acre lot with 6 maple trees, in a neighborhood full of full-grown trees of various species. I am also on a cul-de-sac, on a sloped property, with terraces and walls, and a privacy fence. I have a *ton* of corners and crevices that suck up leaves every year.And every year, I haul out a rake, a mower, a trash can, and a corded blower ... multiple times. My usual routine is to rake leaves onto lawns and mulch them in. A great mulching mower makes short work of them.I bought this unit thinking it might speed up my routine, and be an easier way to suck leaves out of corners, and allow me to bag mulch for easy, targeted composting.After an hour's use, I returned it.Why? Let me counts the ways ....1.  It's a compromise ... a blower and a vacuum that does neither well. The blower is serioudly underpowered compared to the $30 weedeater model I have. The vacuum can only pick up smaller, drier, freshly fallen leaves, and only manages that slowly. If the material has been in place and had a chance to lock together, forget it. After the first bag full, I resorted to shoving the barrel into a pile, letting it get a hold on a (small) handful of leaves, raising it, and using my other hand to coaxing them in.2. Plastic impeller ... if you do decide to try this Trivac, get the -502 model. The plastic impeller does mulch, but not terribly finely. Even at it's slow feed rate, this unit filled it bag every 5 minutes or so.3. Horribly awkward, and short. Typical blower/vacs have to be reconfigured. When setup for blowing, they are pointed at the ground. Use this Trivac for 10 minutes, and you'll see why. Due to it's design, it avoids the need to reconfigure .. and creates a new, worse problem. As the bag fills, the center of gravity shifts farther back, and in no time you're forced to *force* the nozzle downward, constantly. I finally started holding it by the bag and/or cord. Not good design at all. The taller you are (anything over 5'4\" or so, I'm 6'), the worse this becomes.4.  Storage. It's much larger than blowers that outperform it. And has an ungainly configuration. It's even a pain when you *aren't* using it!To sum up, 2 stars because it does--technically--work. However, it's a complete failure as a power tool. The point of a power tool is to amplify human effort. While using this, I got *less* done. Raking them and mowing them is much faster.So who is this thing good for? I don't know, really. It's too large and heavy for someone who has trouble clearing leaves by other means. Perhaps if you have mostly paved ares, and a very minor leaf burden, or are very limited on green areas you can mulch them in ... perhaps. If you have to bag your leaves, I honestly think you'd be better off renting a standing unit, and feeding them in by hand. You'll be done much faster.Unless you have very small hands ... !
B000VYGDL0 This contraption is amazing. It sprays out and amazing mist. It simulates a fine rain, and my plants are very happy with not getting pounded! Barely disrupts the dirt :)
B000VYGDL0 Works great and the fittings are all top quality.  Very fine mist spray is great for the birds. Glad I got it.
B000VYGDL0 Heavy and solid. Dramm products are usually very well made, and this one fits the bill. Good for seedlings and cooling down plants in heat of summer.
B000VYGDL0 Very fine mist and LOTS of it.Three little outlets spray a fine mist but quickly get the small plants watered.Will see if it clogs up after some use.  Right now, it is PERFECT.
B000W72GBC A very sturdy gas can.  The pour spout is great.  Easy to control precise amounts of fuel and avoid spills.
B000W72GBC I am very pleased with this gas can.  It doesn't leak and fills my lawn mower without spilling gasoline. Of course, you still have to watch the lawn mower tank level to prevent over filling.  The nice thing about this gas can is being able to tip the can without gas pouring out before you get to the lawn mower tank.
B000W72GBC I find most CARB-compliant gas cans to be difficult to use and cause more spillage, but this one is easy to use. The 2.5-gallon size is perfect for me for typical small home gardening equipment like gas trimmer and lawn mower. I find the bigger 5-gallon size too heavy, so I use two of this 2.5-gallon size. This allows me to always keep one can filled with gas if one goes empty, and gas lasts longer because of less air space in the smaller can (less air = less moisture = less water contamination).
B000WB13QC I have reviewed a couple of other mouse traps (the green plastic Smart Mouse Trap & the Havahart 1020) which work perfectly - this trap sat in the same garage where I am catching a mouse per day with the other traps, and its caught nothing in months.  It is a novel idea that I appreciate as an engineer, but mice avoid it.
B000WB13QC Useless product--didn't work for me at all.  I trap mice all the time in the metal cages and thought this would be a good alternative, but never caught one critter.  Sorry, charlie.
B000WB13QC For small mice like we have on the Outer Banks of North Carolina, these mouse cubes are priceless and work where other traps have often failed.  Would highly recommend you try these because these ridiculous looking hunks of plastic DO WORK and work well.I bait mine with a small cracker smeared with a little peanut butter. Our mice must be gourmets because they seem to love Skippy Chunky!!!?  Leave trap out for a few days to weeks but check every morning or else they will not survive and leave a mess.  I drilled a few small holes in the ends of mine but this only helps a bit with the cleaning.
B000WB13QC I previously rated the Kness Tip Trap, so there is more info there.  These are pretty simple and look like they should work.  But in my case they didn't catch the mice.
B000WB13QC I've spent a lot on mouse traps: at least a dozen models--some humane, others instantly fatal, others torturous and injurious but not lethal, others primitive (the slow five-day death of rat poison), and others occasionally effective or little more than \"mouse feeding stations.\"  The Mice Cube is the simplest and possibly the best.It's a lightweight plastic rectangular container with an end that opens like a door (except the hinge is at the top).  But that end is slightly longer than the other end, preventing it from opening in the other direction.  It's an entrance only, not an exit.  Simply place a small cracker with a dab of peanut butter at the other end of the \"hallway\" and then sweeten the invitation by smearing a bit of peanut butter (for scent) on the door.  In the morning you should see Mickey, looking pensive and somewhat regretful after enjoying his little meal (hopefully Mickey won't be sharing it with a relative--set out more than one of these inexpensive traps if you're overrun with the critters).  At that point resist the temptation to keep him as a pet (mice perspire and expire quickly in such tight, poorly ventilated quarters).  Simply walk him away from your house, flip his house over so that the door opens up, and set the container on the ground.  (Some mice leap instantly for freedom; others require a bit of patience and even some nudging.)I've ordered a couple of the humane plastic greenhouses (Smart Trap), but the mice had no trouble gnawing through the latch and escaping.  A solution might be the metal \"Hav-a-heart\" trap, but it's a considerable nuisance to set it up each time. The same was true even of kill traps like the Victor Electronic trap (effective for the first week, before the mice started shredding it and jumping out) and the Victor \"Kill and Seal,\" which is effective 40% of the time (it either failed to attract the varmints or the lever refused to be set or, once set, the kill bar was never released).  If you don't mind the thought of the animals suffering for a while (I doubt such a thought even occurred to my father, who grew up on a farm), there are the glue traps, the water traps, and the poisonous pellets (you'll suffer too when the smell comes through the kitchen walls about a week later).As for all of the snap traps or the rubber girdles that literally squeeze the life out of the creature, they're undeniably effective but also \"medieval\" when compared to the Mice Cube, which gives you the opportunity to meet Mickey \"in person.\"  (Now my only problem is determining what to do with about twenty bucks worth of unused kill traps.)
B000WB13QC This is a terrific product.  Within three hours I caught both mice in my house.  My house has been \"clean\" ever since.
B000WEIHPY Easy quick replacement that keeps your grill new and lasting long. Had my Weber 9 years now. Replaced grates and flavorizers this year and I'm sure to get another 9 or ten years maybe more!
B000WEIHPY I've had my grill for six years and started noticing that the grill wasn't getting as hot and food wasn't coming out as well.  Decided it was time to replace parts on the grill.  Can't really say much more than that the bars fit perfectly on my Weber Genesis Silver.  After replacing other parts as well, grill cooked like it was brand new.
B000WEIHPY Finally had to change the flavorizer bars.  We've used our grill almost daily since 2003 and I have replaced these twice.  The new bars totally end flair-ups!
B000WEIHPY We love our Weber Silver C grill, but the old enameled flavorizer bars were rusty and disgusting. Amazon offered a terrific price -- considerably less than the Weber website -- for these stainless steel replacements, which we purchased with new ss grates. We feel like we have a new grill -- they were easy to install and operate perfectly. We're sure these will last a very long time, as do most Weber products.
B000WEIHPY Like other reviewers, I purchased these stainless steel flavorizer bars to replace my rusted enameled bars.  After two years of average use (grilling once a week or so during the summer), as I was cleaning my grill I realized that these stainless steel bars are rusty...quite rusty, on both the top and bottom.I was surprised, so I contacted Weber customer service about the rust on the stainless steel bars.  They explained, and I quote:\"The flavorizer bars will rust within the first year of use. This is normal due to the amount of abuse they take protecting the burner tubes. We recommend that you replace the bars once they break or fall apart. I would suggest rotating the bars for a longer longevity.\"Fine.  No problem.  Based on Weber's recommendation, I assume the flavorizer bars are still doing their job, even if rusty.  However, I now believe I was too hasty in replacing my old bars.  And, when it's time to replace the stainless steel bars, I may just replace them with the less expensive porcelain enameled bars.
B000WEIHPY Purchased these to replace the enamel flavorizer bars that came with my Weber.  They fit perfectly and will provide years more of service.  It's like having a new grill!  For anyone that isn't sure of the fit of specific Weber parts simply go to:  [...] and select Order A Part in the lower right side of the page.  There is a guided search process to identify your grill and what parts fit.  Then you can come back to Amazon to order for the best price.
B000WEIII0 I bought these, and many other Weber products, when I purchased my first Weber grill.  These seem to be very well made and work as I would expect them to.
B000WEIII0 I like weber because I know the product will be simple to use and high quality, this is no exception.
B000WEIII0 I replaced my schrade set due to the hanging hooks breaking off and I must say that these are heavy gauge and well made. They have hanging loops for usage on my grill and they are Weber so they match my grill.  They were a little pricey but the construction is very heavy and solid.
B000WEIII0 please buy this , its worth every penny very long great for the grill nice an long an built to last 9/7/13
B000WEIII0 Quality crafsmenship and style combine to make really nice BBQ tools.  Hanger hooks are really nice and most importantly useful.Tools have a heft to them and hang from the grill's tool hooks without a problem.  Cleanup is a snap in the dishwasher.Tongs do lock closed for easy storage in the dishwasher or drawer when not in use.Would definately purchase again.  This is the real deal, not some B.S. junk found in the stores.  This is worthy of the mighty Weber name.
B000WEIII0 These Weber stainless steal tools are just great. They have a decent weight and substantial feel when in use, and they clean up well in the dishwasher.
B000WEIII0 The Weber grill is great and we bought almost every accessory.  These are very easy to clean and great to use.
B000WEIII0 The Weber Style 6445 Professional-Grade Stainless 3 piece tool set is very well made, like all the Weber products. I bought the set to go with my new Weber Genisis Grill and am very satisfied. Great price and combining to get the free Super Saver shipping is the way to go.
B000WEIII0 This is my second set for a second BBQ. The first set I bought over 2 years ago still looks as good as when I bought it. Great quality you would expect from Weber.
B000WEIII0 This is a really nice tool set.  I find the spatula much heavier gauge than many on the market and love the fact that they are dishwasher safe. Once again Weber demands quality from anything bearing their name.
B000WEIII0 I take great pride in my Weber Genesis Silver grill.  It treats me well and I enjoy the Weber name and quality ... so I decided to splurge on the Weber grill tool set.  They are awesome.  They are weighty, ergonomic and durable.  Worth every penny whether you grill on a Weber or not.I highly recommend this set!
B000WEKLTE As with all things Weber, these pans serve a great purpose and were well designed as part of the Genesis (and other I believe) series grills. It makes it extremely easy to clean the drip pan and all the grease that pools at the bottom. A pack of 10 should last you for a few years. I change mine about 2-3 times a year and I grill at least once a week. For the cost, it is well worth picking these up.
B000WEKLTE Does its job, fits my Q320 Weber Grill perfectly. Ships with a set of 10, and trust me, 10 drip pans can last a long time!
B000WEKLTE Great little catch all tray.  Easy to insert in holder and keeps that clean.  The trays if kept washed are reusable.  I like that.Also easy to remove for easy cleaning.  I like the whole concept.  A lot better than the cups sometimes on the other grills.
B000WEKLTE I have reordered (2) this item and use them primary to catch bacon drippings to flavor other food. One at each end of the Weber griddle and one in the drip pan at the very end of the Weber Genius National gas grill.  They are light weight and must be handled with care,
B000WEKLTE I needed some more drip pans for our Weber grill and I was sad to not be able to find any locally (at grocery stores). These fit my Weber just right but they are a little pricey at about fifty cents each, especially since you throw them away so often.
B000WEKLTE It catches greasy drips. It was delivered on time and the price was fair. Saved me a trip to the store. And it works
B000WEKLTE it catches hot meat fluids and can hold a lot.  i am surprised how much fluid this thing can handle.
B000WEKLTE It fits well and its inexpensive
B000WEKLTE I use these drip pans for the grill.  I also for use for taking meat/vegetables off the grill.  Very convenient size.
B000WEKLTE Perfect size to help catch drippings or to fill in order to help keep meat moist while grilling and smoking.  Would purchase again.
B000WEKLTE These are effective drip pan trays for the small portable Weber grill.  It just helps keep the grill clean and fit well into the grill.
B000WEKLTE These fit perfectly in my Weber Q240 electric grill. A single pan lasts me at least a dozen cookouts, and when it's about half-full of grease you just slide it out, throw it away, and insert a new one.Would recommend. Do not try to use a washable dish!
B000WEKLTE These were cheaper on amazon than they were locally for me. They last a decently long time, and I tend to replace the pan just a couple of times per year.
B000WEKLTE The trays work great and depending on how often you grill or use sauces you can get quite a bit of use out of them because you get 10 of these in a pack.
B000WEKLTE This is a thin aluminum drip pan, probably the exact same one that came with your grill. Do yourself a favor and pick up a pack and swap in a new one every now and again. That way you can pitch the one you've got that's all full of sticky, greasy, grill drippings before you have to clean it or it turns to rot.
B000WEKLTE This is the same drip pan that comes with a Weber Genesis. However, any aluminum drip pan will do just fine as long as it's the same dimension
B000WEKLTE This product makes cleaning up grill drippings an easy job. It is well designed to hold it's shape and be easily removed for cleaning or replacement.
B000WEKLTE Weber makes an aluminum pan that fits their Genesis model grill so I bought a set of ten. They work as designed. YeaH!!
B000WEKLTE I owned a WeberWeber Q100for several years until it was stolen.  I went right back and bought a 200 Q and I have had it for several years now.  I really like the Weber Q series and use my grill often.  The removable drip pan that is built into the Q series catches all of the nasty, greasy, little bits that fall through the bottom of the grill.  You can clean it but you would have to do it every time that you use you grill otherwise you might a new form of life growing in the muck accumulated in it.These little disposable pans make cleaning the drip tray a breeze.  I have to admit that if one is just a little dirty I will rinse it out and use it again.  As long as you are careful it will survive the washing process.  They aren't cheap but what is?  I really like them and buy them from Amazon all of the time.
B000WEKLTE Than you need the tins.  When food cooks in your Weber grill, the drippings come out of the bottom and are collected in these drip pans.  Most of the dripping are fat which is flamable.  If you don't clean or replace the drip pans, you have the potential for a real fire hazard -- espciallly if your grill is near your house.  My Weber grill is quite a distance from the house and is on a cement slab so I don't need to worry too much.  My main concern is that the hose from the propane tank might catch on fire if the drip pan ignites.  This is a good way to make sure that your grill is safe.
B000WEKLTE You can use aluminum foil to line the drip pan of your Weber gas grill, but these are the perfect alternative. They fit snugly into the drip pan and hold up well over many weeks of use. It's very possible to clean and reuse them. The Amazon price makes them affordable, and much less work and mess than tearing up foil and fitting it to the pan.
B000WEKLTE I have had my Weber Q for about 3 years now and could never find the replacement drip pans in stores. I have been using the same original pan and covering it with aluminum foil.  These are a MUST have for any Weber Q owner.  Great price too.  Thanks Amazon.
B000WEKLTE These fit my Weber Genesis 310 grill perfectly.  You cannot beat the price either.  Ten should last me quite a long time but I'll purchase again when needed.
B000WEKLTE There isn't much to say about these drip pans. If you have a Weber gas grill that uses these, you need to keep them on hand. Nothing worse than a drip pan full of greasy gunk, and unless you want to wash them out by hand (a messy proposition), you need to keep these \"in stock.\" The quality is fine and Amazon's price is always better than my local hardware store.
B000WEKLTE These are heavy enough gauge that one can scrape excess grease or whatever out and re-use but inexpensive enough to make replacement every so often a good alternative.
B000WEKLTE During the work week I discovered that my original pan had actually disintegrated. Not having time to go to the store to buy replacements, I ordered these online from Prime so that I could continue to use the grill during the work week without having to go to the store.
B000WEKLTE These pans are small but they get the job done. They are deeper than your average alum pie pan so they can easily handle drippings from a chicken or side of ribs. The best thing about Weber drip pans is they are reusable after a quick wash.
B000WEKLV2 These are Weber products, in a Weber box and likely identical to the ones that came with your Weber grill.  My Weber Genesis Silver B is about 10 years old and these match perfectly.  The bars I received were made in the U.S.A.These are porcelain-coated.  They will last a few years before they start to disintegrate.  Some people suggest the stainless steel version, but I don't think the Weber warranty is any longer on those, and some people complain that they rust as do these.  Personally I stick with these.  These are my first replacements in 10 years; I leave my grill on my deck all winter with a Weber cover, and I live in the northeast.  I probably needed these a year or two ago, but didn't really realize it until now, when I went to thoroughly clean the grill in preparation for grilling season and noticed the old bars were shot.If you aren't sure which size flavorer bar, or any other Weber accessory, fit your grill, it's simple to determine.  Visit [..] and just answer questions about your grill type, gas versus charcoal, 2 buttons or 3, wheeled or stationary cart, etc. and your responses to the prompts will determine your grill model.These are a perfect replacement for your Weber grill.  some people feel they are unnecessary.  I think they do help return a little flavor from the smoking fat drippings which hit them.  But where I think they are important is they form a protective canopy for the burner bars, so instead of grease hitting the bar, it falls on the bars, burns off, or rolls past the burners into the drip pan.I highly recommend using flavorer bars and these are a perfect replacement, as they are made by Weber.
B000WEKLV2 My last Bars finally gave out this past month. One of them basically broke in two from rusting through.  These new bars fit perfectly and I'm back in business. Since these are designed to basically create the smoke (and therefore most of the barbecue flavor) from falling grease and juices from the meat, they are an important part of the grill. Shouldn't have waited this long to replace them. If yours are rusting through, do yourself a favor and replace yours.
B000WEKMLG For years I've been struggling with the whole barbecue sauce application process while grilling. Putting the sauce in a bowl or measuring cup and brushing it on with a brush was the best system I could come up with. I've been using a brush with silicone bristles for a few years, and that was a huge improvement. But I still had the problem of the brush falling out of the bowl or cup of sauce. What a mess! This Weber Saucing System finally solves that problem!! The container is sturdy plastic and dishwasher safe. The basting brush is high quality, heavy stainless steel with silicone bristles. It holds the sauce very well and is long enough to make applying the sauce very easy. And, of course, the best part: The brush rests perfectly across the sauce container, and any sauce left in the brush drains back into the container. No more brush falling out of a bowl full of sauce and onto the ground. No more mess. No more worries!! This Weber product is a must for anyone who grills and uses barbecue sauce while doing so. Great product, sleek design!!
B000WEKMLG The basting container feels cheap. The brush however feels industrial. It makes a weird combo and I rarely use it. I melted the container slightly.
B000WEKMLG Very attractice.  Very handy.  Large enough for barbecue sauce.  Perfect silicone brush that brushes on with ease and washes off easier.  Perfect.
B000WEKNMY I wanted something that could hold lava rock directly below the heating element of my Char-Broil Bistro. It took some twisting and patience but I finally got it to fit tand put the lava rock from my yard on it.
B000WEKNMY great to find a replacement for my weber, I thought when my old one rusted away, I'd have to get a new weber, but instead I got the replacement at a fraction of the cost of a new weber.
B000WEKNMY I bought this as a second grate for my 22.5&#34; WSM. I use lump charcoal and some of the pieces are small.If you use a second grate and turn it perpendicular to the bottom grate, you get small squares, so less chance of fall through.This grate is actually smaller than my bottom great and it happens to fit perfectly inside my charcoal ring.If you use lump charcoal, you need a second grate, and this one does the job.
B000WEKNMY Very good grate
B000WEKNMY After 14 years of owningWeber 761001 22 1/2-Inch One-Touch Platinum Charcoal Grill, Black, the charcoal grate finally needed replacing. To be honest, it probably needed replacing some time ago, but it never bothered me enough to do something about it. Since the rest of the grill was in pretty good shape, I decided that it was time to replace some of the wear items, so I purchased aWeber 7436 Replacement Hinged Cooking Grate, a new coverWeber 7455 Premium Cover, Fits Weber Performer Grills, and this charcoal grate.Replacing the old grate showed just how far gone it was when compared to the new one. The old one had bowed several inches, which means that charcoal had a tendency to collect in the middle, and it was no longer resting on all the supports, so using a chimney fire starter (excellent, by the way) was a balancing act. I might have to adjust my cooking style now that the charcoal is 3\" closer to the food!I'm sure that I could have saved a dollar or two by not getting a Weber-branded grate, but this grate is well-built using heavy-gauge wire and I think it will hold up better than a knock-off brand made to sell at a cheap price.
B000WEKNMY This shelve is perfect for placing a water pan below the meats in my Acorn Kooker by Grill King.  Will order a smaller one to hold small pieces of lump charcoal.
B000WEKNMY Purchase this as an add on to my new Weber grill.  I crisscross it on top of each other to save the charcoal from fall off to the bottom too soon.  It is less expensive order from Amazon at the time of purchase and save me a trip to the home improvement stores.
B000WEKNYW Installed on my Weber NG E310 and it provides plenty of light to cook with even in the twilight. I purchased 2 of them as I do a lot of grilling after the sun hides behind the earth's curvature. It also has 2 bar holders; 1 for a straight bar & 1 for a curved bar. Just a minor problem; be sure you have 3 AAA batteries available to install in light.
B000WEKNYW Use it on my Spirit E-320. Easy to install, provides very bright light. Conveniently turns off when the lid is closed. Very thought through device. Highly recommended for any Weber owner.
B000WEKNYW If you prefer cooking out in the weather, this no effort (auto on when you lift the grill cover) grill lamp sure beats the heck out of headlamps, flashlights, etc..., and has great a great battery life; over a year so far!  Would be nice if batteries came with it, but hardly a deal breaker. It does come with two different attachement clamps for the different Weber grills and extra screws.
B000WEKNYW I had one of these on my beloved Genesis Silver B. When I gave the grill a new home to upgrade to aGenesis S-320, I ordered this the same day.If you're grilling after dark, this light is just flat out awesome. It's just bright enough to cover your grilling area, without attracting every bug in the neighborhood. And because the lights are LED's with a gravity switch, you're never burning through batteries. In fact, I never used the power switch on my old one, and the three AAA batteries kept the thing going strong for at least a year.Seriously, once you use one of these, you will never, ever go back.
B000WEKNYW I was concerned that there may not be enough light output to actually see the food being grilled.  But it's a Weber on my new Weber grill so the quality had to be good.  Installed quickly.. and the first time I used I had my flashlight handy thinking I still might need it.  Well I didn't and very happy how well this lights up the grilling area.
B000WEMFQG for years we had larger grills on wheels and they always lasted about 4 to 5 years because we had no inside storage for them. Living on The Oregon Coast can ruin a good grill in a couple years, even the so called stainless ones. They rust faster then the painted ones unless it made of 316 grade  marine stainless which runs into the thousands. This small weber grill works great ,cooks fast and just stores on a garage shelf during bad weather. And the outside is made of aluminum that holds up great . An added plus is we can take it to the beach as wellRuns on 1 pound tanks or purchase a separate hose as we did to use you 20 pound tank(a lot cheaper)
B000WEMFQG I used to own a Weber Q-100 but it was stolen.  I then purchased a Q-200 but I replaced it after several years with a Char-Broil TRU Infrared Grill2Go X200.  I wanted a cover for it and this one fit perfectly.  It keeps my grill dry, clean and free of dust.  I will buy another one when this one wears out.
B000WEMFQG This cover fits easily and perfectly over the Weber Baby Q grill and protects the grill from rain and dirt. The snug fit ensure that it won't be blown away by the wind. Two draw cords let you snug it in further if you want. Seems well made and should last for several seasons.
B000WEMFQG This cover is very well made and should last a long time with care. It is roomy enough to cover the BBQ even with the attached Weber tables.
B000WEMFQG I am replacing the exact cover I bought 7 years ago.  My old one is still in one piece, but it has been through, rain, snow, hail and 110 degree summers.  I thought it was time to retire the girl out.The cover fits absolutely perfectly and is made of high quality material, or it never would have made it this long!As for the Weber grill, it is still working great also.  I just love it!
B000WEMFSO Bought this for cleaning Cuisinart CGG-200 that comes with enamel-coated grates. Works great and still no rust on grates yet! :)
B000WEMFSO I am a charcoal grill kind of gal and this is the first time I've used a grill brush other than the old-school square-headed brush with very stiff, dense bristles. I like this 21-inch T-brush better than the old kind in terms of having a wider brush head and a longer handle; THEORETICALLY, it seems like it would make grill cleaning faster and easier (especially if one wanted to clean the grill while it is still warm). Unfortunately, it doesn't work as well as I had hoped, which is a bummer as I kind of hate those square brushes.From reading the description on the product page, it seems that this brush is intended more for cleaning gas grill grates but it doesn't say that outright and doesn't say it shouldn't be used on charcoal grills. In fact, one of the product pictures shows it being used on a charcoal grill.I also have an infrared grill, though I don't use it much, and perhaps this brush would be better for that. For the charcoal grill, however, I felt that this brush would have been SO much more effective if it had denser, stiffer bristles. I'm guessing that this brush was made \"gentler\" for those with ceramic grill plates.It's too late to send it back as I've already used it, but I don't think I'd buy another one. It did fine on the larger food bits stuck to the grill tines, but did not clean the tines otherwise as well as I'd hoped.Can't recommend this for charcoal grills, but it may be fine for grills with other cooking surfaces.
B000WEMFSO I cant begin to tell you how many brushes I've bought and thrown out. Bought this baby and THIS IS THE ONE!!!I use it on my stainless steel round grates and it works great getting not only on top, but in between. The extra long handle and sturdy wooden handle saves the hair on your hands from getting singed off if you've got it on high burning off the residue.  I also use sideways motion for the really stubborn burned off foods and it works like a charm.  You can really apply decent pressure with this brush too. So stop looking... and buy it. You'll be happy you did.
B000WEMFSO i cook either on my smoker or grill at least once a week all year, used this grill brush everytime and its still in great shape.  Every other grill brush ive ever used seems to only last maybe a season if that, I would buy this again in a heartbeat.
B000WEMFSO I grill on my Weber charcoal grill three seasons.  Typically I go through two or three brushes from the supermarket each year.  I bought this one a year ago and it is still going strong.  It is also far superior at cleaning the grill grates.  The long handle keeps mu knuckles from the hot coals and makes short work of the toughest mess.One thing I do that I'm not sure is obvious - I use it vertically (the short pointy side) to get between the grate slats.  It fits perfectly and you can get all the gunk on the sides and bottom of the grate.
B000WEMFSO It is the typical high quality Weber product we are used to. The price is right and they hold up well.
B000WEMFSO It's long enough to reach the back of the grill.  Fairly stiff.  For heavy stuff I think I shall need a bladed scraper.  The bristles do not come out and leave dangerous bits on the grate.  Knocks off the easy stuff.
B000WEMFSO I've been using this brush now for approx. 3 yrs.  I replaced the first one after about 2 years, which is good, because I grill out almost evey night.  The brush design cleans great between grates and makes this job of cleaning grates a breeze.  Good quality product and have not had any issues with the wire bristles coming out and potentially ending up in the food.  I've used many style brushes over the years and this is by far the best designed grill brush!
B000WEMFSO The Weber brush arrived and worked as expected. The brush in the picture is what I got. It definitely works best when the grill is still warm.
B000WEMFSO The Weber grill is great and we bought almost every accessory. This does amazingly well cleaning the grates. I'm a big fan.
B000WEMFSO This brush is well made and is fine. Nothing spectacular. There are so many brushes out there but it seems like this one will last longer based on the materials used to make it.
B000WEMFSO Using this on my Weber Genesis Grill, it works good, but it doesn't get completely through the grill cross, I have to use a different brush to get completely through the edges. However, during mid grilling cleaning, this works perfectly, the arm is long which gives me leverage and distance from the heat.
B000WEMFSO We use this brush to clean our grates of our Weber Q300, 200 and charcoal grills. Works great. The 3D effect of this brush cleans well even between the bars.For Weber larger grills like Spirit and 22.5 inch charcoal use this one; for smaller BBQs the short one.
B000WEMFSO When I purchased this, I thought it would be great for getting between the grates on my grill.  Though it's well constructed, the head is a little wide and doesn't fit in the crevices as well as I expected.
B000WEMFSO I originally contemplated purchasing the grill daddy clean brush for about $20. I decided on this after reading a few reviews in a BBQ forum. I know the name Weber has quite a history and tradition for good products.The brush itself is definitely long enough for all of my needs. It can easily reach the back of my grill without me having to bend over it or risk burning my hand(s). The handle is sturdy and comfortable to grip. The bristles of the brush are rough enough to remove all of the gunk from my grill while not scratching the grates.Yesterday I poured some water over the bristles and cleaned the grill to somewhat replicate the grill daddy experience. The water seemed to make it easier to remove the grime from the grill.In the end, this is a great brush that does exactly what it should. Definitely worth the price paid (so far).
B000WEMFSO Purchased the top of the line Weber Summit E670, had to out fit it with nothing but the best in accessories right?OK, this is a nice brush.  Does a pretty decent job of cleaning the grates after high temp baking.  My only gripe is that the flexible handle has a tendency to bend after prolonged scrubbing.  Easily remidied by just turing it over to bend it back on the second round of scrubbing.  Having used the flat head styled brushes before, I wanted to try this one and I am glad I did.I think this used in combination with the flat replaceable styled heads is a sure win.  This tool is especially nice for getting in between the individual grates.Will I order again when it is no longer effective? YES.  Will I also be ordering the flat syled heads?  YES.  Is this a quality product?  YES.
B000WEMFSO I thought this would solve all my problems.  The traditional brushes seem to \"waste\" a lot of their surface area in that the bristles on the leading edge get squashed down pretty quickly and you end up using the wood (or in some cases) plastic to smear things around.  This looked like it would not have that problem.  But the bristle density leaves a lot to be desired and they tend to get squashed very easily.  I don't think this is any better, or in fairness, any worse than the traditional design.  I do find that I miss the metal scraper part that is found on traditional brushes, especially if it has the little cut out on the side to scrape each individual \"rung\" of the grate.  So I'll keep using this until it doesn't work but I doubt I'll get another after that.
B000WEMFSO I picked one of these up and I'm happy with it. The bristles aren't as sturdy as other brushes, but the fact that it gets between so many grates at once is awesome, and worth a few extra passes. Plus, being Weber, I didn't have to worry about it messing up the \"porcelain enamel\" grates.Update: After many months of use I find it doesn't do the job as well as when it was new. Maybe to be expected but for the price I wanted a longer life.
B000WEMFSO A bit pricy but probably worth it because it works great and still looks like new after a dozen uses.........seems to be very compatible with the Weber SS grates.........don't know how it would do on Cast Iron but probably OK.
B000WEMG24 I bought this to go along with my recent purchase of a weber BBQ grillWeber 751001 22 1/2-Inch One-Touch Gold Charcoal Grill, Black, it does what it's supposed to do and keeps all my other tools in close reach. For such a small price tag, definitely worth it.
B000WEMG24 I got this for a barrel (UDS) smoker.  Fits great is very handy for brushes, tongs, and other BBQ tools,
B000WEMG24 Convenient...handy....fits good on the Weber Round Grill.  You just have to make sure that all of the utensils you wish to hang on it have a hole in them the right size and not too small.  The tongs I bought didn't fit so I'll have to either improvise or look for other tongs that do fit!
B000WEMG24 The holder mounted perfectly on my weber grill.  Now I don't have to get my table messy with sauce from the brush.  It is also great for  storing my cooking tools and grill brush when I'm not grilling.
B000WEMG24 Since Weber seems to abhor putting anything more than the two side handles on the kettle, this appeared to be a handy addition for hanger tongs, etc. while cooking. Works well enough, but if you have the lid off and try to remove a tool, certain ones can catch on the hook and easily pull the whole thing off and either into your food or onto the ground. Perhaps I will put a squeeze on the hanger tabs and make them fit tighter.
B000WEMG24 If you grill outside you'll need one of these.
B000WEMG24 Not only is it easy to hang on the side of the Weber to hold all required tools, it allows air to feed the fire just enough to allow the top vent to be closed completely. Closing the top vent keeps the majority of the heat in, giving a good roasting action on chicken and turkey. It's a must have for any Weber grill!
B000WEMG4W I bought these to replace a similar set that was many years old and was failing.  The failure was with the welding between the pieces, not the pieces themselves, so Weber could probably do a better job if they wanted.  Anyway, they are long lasting and rust free, so well worth what they cost amortized over their life :)
B000WEMG4W This is my third set of grates for my Weber. The porcelain grates seem to start to fall apart after about four or five years. Went with stainless hoping they will last longer. Loved the bright finish, but after grilling two times, they are changing to black.
B000WEMG4W My original, porcelain-coated grates had chipped and were starting to rust.  Since the rest of the grill is still in great shape (after changing the flavor bars to stainless steel too), I decided to try these stainless steel grates.  I was concerned at first because they were so much lighter and thinner than the iron ones.  But they seem to work fine.  I still get a good sear when the grates are hot and the meats don't seem to stick to these grates any more than they did to the originals.  So I'm happy with the purchase, and I think these grates will last a long time.
B000WEMG4W 98% fit with my Weber Genesis Silver.  It's a shade more narrow than the original piece, but not wide enough to have food drop through.  It's a bit different than the stock cooking grates.  Far lighter and more like tubes than grates.  In combination, with the replacement burners, the grill as a whole gets as hot as I originally got it, but I have noticed that the hot spots are relatively even hotter.
B000WEMG4W I wish they put these in the grill as part of the original equipment. The original grill had rusted just about through and was falling apart in big chunks.These grates won't rust and are much easier to clean. They will discolor with age but not a big deal.
B000WEMGM4 I am really enjoying using my Char-Basket Briquet Holders in my Weber Kettle. It is great to be able to have focused direct heat in one section of the grill and indirect heat in another. The holders are heavy and sturdy.On Memorial Day, I was cooking burgers and dogs. One of my guests likes her burgers medium rare, so I was able to put hers on the indirect side while I continued to cook the others to medium well or well over direct heat. Since the hot dogs grilled much quicker, I could also move them over to indirect heat so they could continue to cook inside but not burn outside.The only downside to the holders for me is that I didn't see the one line in the product description that said they were for use with the Weber 22 1/2\" grill. I have an 18 1/2\" Weber so using them both gives me a very narrow field of indirect heat. However, when I am just grilling one steak for myself, I could just use ONE of the holders and have the rest of the grill cooler for veggies, etc.It is likely that I will upgrade to a Weber 22 1/2\" grill at some point since my 18 1/2\" is starting to show signs of wear. Then I'll be able to use both holders as intended. Despite them not being intended for my smaller Weber, I still find them to be useful. Because there are 2 holders, you can customize their configuration to work for you despite grill size.4.5 stars
B000WEMGM4 Love these baskets. They make moving the coals around much quicker and easier. Cleanup is extra snappy. The baskets are made of a decently heavy gauge sheet metal and look like they are built to last a long time. When you first handle them be careful a some o fthe edging is sharp and may cut a finger or two.
B000WEMGM4 Perfect for indirect or direct grilling.  You cannot go wrong with the purchase and works like a charm.  Weber makes some really good stuff!
B000WEMGM4 These are awesome for indie t or direct cooking. Easy to move around with grill tools.  These get plenty of air and clen up easy.
B000WEMGM4 These charcoal baskets are a must if you want to do indirect cooking.  They fit the Weber kettle grill perfectly and keep the charcoal in place.
B000WEMGM4 (Third set over about three decades!)With only two of us to cook for most of the time, a pile of charcoal is not only overkill, but like burning money.  With these, I can put seven to nine (not Seven-of-Nine) briquettes in each one, depending upon how much is left of the previous cook, and I can grill a couple of steaks, five or six burgers, eight Nathan's hotdogs, or two huge chicken breasts with ease.  I can move them toward the edges and add more charcoal for indirect cooking, or dump them out when cooking for a crowd.
B000WEMGM4 This will help anyone who wants to indirect grill on their weber become a master of their grill space.  Suggested that you get the hinged grate as well for easy access during a long, slow cook.
B000WEMGM4 I like using these for indirect heating on 1 side or split. The only issue I have is they don't hold a &#34;full&#34; load of charcoal; at least in the quantity I typically use which is 1 chimney full.
B000WEMGM4 I'm pleased with the Weber charcoal baskets.  I've had them for a month or two and used them 4 or 5 times.  They work great for cooking chicken with indirect heat, and they work pretty well for creating a sear zone for direct heat.  They also allow me to use less charcoal when I'm just grilling for two, which is often the case. I recently made a custom charcoal basket using expanded metal in an effort to get a really good sear zone, but the Weber baskets work better.  In hindsight, it looks like my homemade expanded metal basket was a waste of time and money.
B000WEMGM4 These baskets make indirect-heat grilling very easy.  They fit perfectly on either side of the Weber kettle with a drip tray in the middle, making perfect grilling of longer cooking foods, such as roasts and large pieces of meat, nearly foolproof.  These and my Weber chimney starter are the grill accessories I use most often.
B000WEMGM4 Bought these for my boyfriend who is an avid griller/smoker. They worked great on his weber kettle grill! A+! Would recommend!
B000WEMGM4 We used these Charcoal Holders in our new Weber grill and they worked great!! We followed the indirect cooking method, and these holders keep the coals neat and separated to allow for the water pan to be placed in the middle without any problem. The holders are highly recommended for anyone using the indirect cooking method, or if you just want to keep the coals on one side of the grill without much effort. Thanks!!
B000WEMGM4 I'm very satisfied with this product.  The holders allow me to easily place the coals where I want them and actually use less charcoal than I used to use.  We purchased the Weber Rotisserie at the same time and find the briquettes holders an excellent compliment.  I would not hesitate to purchase either item again!  Together, they produce an excellent meal.
B000WEMGM4 I originally purchased this to grill indirectly but now I use it for all grilling.  It allows me to easily control placement of the charcoals.  They still haven't rusted after years of use.
B000WEMGM4 These are some of the simplest yet most useful Weber accessories I own! They make everything easier, from lighting your charcoal to controlling how the heat in your grill is applied to your food for cooking.I have a Weber kettle grill (charcoal) with a gas ignition system, and all I have to do is place the desired amount of charcoal in each basket (or in one if that's all I'm using that day), position the baskets over the gas igniter outlet in the center of the grill, and wait a few minutes (about 5). By then the coals are pretty well lit and I can kill the gas, and in a few minutes more, they're ashy and ready to use. Then it's just a matter of repositioning them where I want them for cooking, whether in the center for direct heat or on the sides for indirect heat, and well I wish it were more complicated because I like making people read long reviews, but that's it lol. It's that simple!If you cook over charcoal, you'll love these, in fact you'll probably conclude that they're worth twice as much for the convenience they bring to the cooking process. I hope some of you find my review helpful in making a more informed decision as you consider your buying options! Peace :-)
B000WEMGM4 The perfect answer for indirect cooking, no more coals rolling wherever they want. Use in conjunction with the hinged grill. This certainly make more sense than having to remove the entire grill. Coal baskets are large enough to hold plenty of coals and are vented to keep them hot while cooking.
B000WEMGM4 These are pretty straightforward - today I used them to indirect grill some baby-back ribs and had excellent results! I really noticed the difference when I used the hickory wood chunks; they smoked much longer than they ever did when I would just use a modified garden hoe to rake the coals into two piles. This in concert with the hinged grill grate are excellent, practical accessories for your Weber kettle.
B000WEMGM4 We use these baskets frequently for direct and indirect grilling in our 22.5 kettles. About halv of a Weber chimney fit in the two baskets. They can be moved around on the charcolal grate depending on there heat is needed. After many uses they do not look nice by will last long time. After three years still no rust on them.This is a must!
B000WEMGM4 I have a Weber kettle grill and when I dump a batch of coals in they spread out all over. With these I can contain the coals to heat a specific area - nice for a couple of steaks, or a couple of slabs of salmon, or a couple of burgers. And still there's enough residual heat to warm a pot of beans or grill some veggies. Nice accessory.
B000WEMGM4 Probably not better than a pair of bricks.These don't hold very much charcoal, and when full, the charcoal sits just under the cooking grates. If you want to sear before or after you indirect cook, then you have to really be there to watch it as the coals are so very close.A pair of bricks will section off the charcoal better, giving you more room (and you can adjust the spacing from the wall) to drop coals, without them piling up so high.
B000WEMGM4 Though I really didn't need this to create indirect heating, organizing the fire is pretty easy.  I like being able to shake the ashes (cold, of course) into my ash can.  The design makes it easy to dump the contents (partial to completely full) of the chimney starter into the baskets.  Two things to improve the product:1. Make one SLIGHTLY smaller so they nest in each other better2. Not have sharp edges.
B000WEMGM4 I've owned a Weber One Touch Gold for almost 8 years. I finally decided to take the plunge and buy this product.  One of the advantages of this product is it keeps the coals isolated in one location. No need to worry about adding more briquettes and watching them roll off the hot coals down to the middle of the grill where they are wasted.  It also is the perfect tool for indirect cooking.  If you want to make ribs, just use one of these and throw your ribs on the other side of the grill. It definitely makes grill cleanup easier. The vast majority of the ash gets preserved in these things, thereby minimizing the wear and tear on the grill, enhancing it's lifetime. I would highly recommended this to anyone
B000WEMGM4 These are a must when indirect grilling.  I grill chicken at least once a week and these are perfect for keeping the coals on the sides.
B000WEMGM4 Will do what they were  designed to do but they are a little large for the Weber 18.5&#34; grill.
B000WEMGM4 These do do a good job for indirect cooking.  As at least one other reviewer mentioned, push them together and you get a really good sear too.  For thick steaks, I'll put these side by side and sear the steak on both sides.  Then I put the holders on opposite sides of the kettle and finish the steaks indirect.  That works very well.  The baskets are decent quality.  They look like they will last for a good while.  I think these are a very good purchase for Weber users.
B000WEMGM4 I have the smokenator for really slow indirect cooking with little coal.  Incredible ribs and pork shoulder. When not using the smokenator and just a few of us, I put the basket on the other side.  It is easier to stack up coal on the side for medium and high grilling surface and smaller lump coal will not fall to the bottom as easily. This is a great product.  If I do not have the smokenator, will use it for indirect grilling also.  This is a great product.
B000WEMGM4 They hold charcoal.  They are easily moveable. Will not rust. But I have had as much luck just piling up the charcoal where I want it.
B000WEMGM4 I have been grilling with a Weber Kettle for a long time and my standard procedure was to dump the charcoal out of the starter chimney into a pile on one side and cook on the other side of the grill - - - and that worked pretty well.I have been using these briquet holders for just over a month now and they work VERY well for indirect grilling.  Placing the briquet holders together in the center of the grill is the easiest way to fill them from the starter chimney and leaving them there allows hamburgers to be cooked around the perimeter of the grill - or after filling, the briquet holders can be moved to the sides of the grill and the center of the grill can be used for chops, brats, hotdogs, pork steaks etc. and a pan with sauce can be placed in the center to season the meat with out burning.Bottom Line - These are well made, reasonably priced, and work very well for indirect grilling. I would recommend them to a friend.
B000WEMHGO Got a new Weber Genesis grill and bought this to go with it.  Tried it with a big pork loin basted in beer, it turned out perfect. I like the way it will lock the meat onto the rod plus the handle is ideally shaped.  Highly recommend.
B000WEMHGO It just arrived and took all of 30 seconds to install on my grill.I cooked my first chicken on it this evening and it was incredibly juicy and tender (I did brine it for about 8 hours) even the breast was juicy which normally ends up being dry with other cooking methods.The motor seems to have good torque, the spit turned very smoothly without jerking or jittering as I have seen with cheap rotisseries.I enjoy grilling but not necessarily when chicken is involved - steaks and chops cook fairly quickly but chicken needs slower cooking and you need to keep an eye on it - with the rotisserie I can get it going and more or less forget about for most of the cooking time.Glad I bought it.
B000WEMHGO Would be nice to have gotten it with more than 2 forks for the ridiculous price but the unit appears to be well built and works great so far in my first experience with a 6 lb chicken.  Wish it had a wooden handle like all of my previous rotisserie rods.
B000WEMHGO I purchased this product this summer with a Weber grill I also bought from Amazon.  After about 4 - 5 uses, one  of the forks on the rotisserie broke.  Apparently the weld on the fork came apart.  After sending the serial number of the grill and time of purchase, Weber sent me two new forks.They were very responsive with their customer service and I am very happy with their support.  I am definitely a Weber fan now.
B000WEMHGO The Weber Rotisserie is very well made, like all the Weber products. I bought it to mate with the Weber Genisis Grill and am very satisfied. Great price and combining to get the free Super Saver shipping is the way to go.
B000WEMHGO Fits a Weber 320 perfectly.  Excellent motor, that doesn't \"jump\" through part of it's revolution if the meat is slightly off-center.  Well worth the money!
B000WEMHGO I got this rotisserie for chicken, which it excels at, but the design makes it less than ideal for other meats.  For chicken the spit and and forks work well, as the center of the bird is hollow and having metal forks pierce the meat has little consequence.  Larger birds won't fit due to the size of the grill and placement of the rotisserie.  As it is, you will need to remove the grates (or stack them on one side if only cooking one bird) to allow for rotation of chicken, but the flavorizer bars can remain.  Other types of meat may fit, but having a spit and forks pierce a roast will heat the meat nearest these metal pieces (due to conduction).  I'd imagine this isn't as much of a deal for pork, but I wouldn't want the center of a prime rib to be medium well due to the spit.  I'd suggest an E-Z Que for that.Back to the chicken.  As others have said be sure to truss or tie down wings and legs,as they will get well done due to their proximity to the flame.  This will also create more clearance between the chicken and the flavorizer bars.  In general cooking times are comparable to other means, but unlike \"beer can chicken\" withWeber 16128 Poultry Roaster, the chicken will cook from the outside in (due to steam on the inside with beer can chicken).  This along with better retention of juices (not many drip down) makes the rotisserie my favorite of the two.  The cord is woefully short, but the motor seems very solid, and it's not that noisy.  The spit seems to allow for a bit of balancing of weight, and it's relatively easy to clean.
B000WEMHN2 After years of use, the original burners for my Weber grill rusted out.  These replacement burners were OEM burner and work great.  Installation was quick and easy.  These should provide my grill with 10 more years of use.
B000WEMHN2 As noted in my ignitor review I am rebuilding an old Weber grill, this is just one of many replacement parts being used :)
B000WEMHN2 I decided to clean my 12 year old Weber about two weeks ago. When I took out the flavor bars, I found a set of rusted burners. The little bar that connects the three burners was rusted and broken. It was the original burners. I knew I needed new ones but was afraid with my limited mechanical skills I would not be able to accomplish an installation. I read some of the reviews on this site and was encouraged by others to give it a go. Ordered it using my Prime membership and got it in two days. I really love that service. I followed the easy to read instructions and using nothing but a wrench and a Philips screwdriver installed the burners in less than 30 minutes. Turned the grill back on and amazingly it worked. Yippee. I love Weber. I spent a total of about $150 getting everything but the flavor bars( replaced those about 4 years ago and basically have a new grill. I used to buy the $150 specials at Lowes or wherever and usually had to buy  a new grill every two years or so. With the new parts this grille is good for another 5-10 years. Wonderful.
B000WEMHN2 This was easier to replace then I imagined.  I removed the old one , cleaned the entire BBQ and then installed the new one. No adjustments or worries at all.
B000WEMHN2 Was looking to replace the parts of my Weber Genesis Silver.  This part was the most complicated to replace of all the parts because you had to take parts of the grill apart.  First I would say is take your time and really read the manual.  It's not really intuitive until after you remove the coverings.  However, it
