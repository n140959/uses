B000N5WPQY We have had this tiler for a few years now and since we were moving, just stored it until we were moved.  So, moving aside, we drug this thing out and guess what? It worked for a little bit then quit.  It wouldn't restart, and then the motor started smoking!  What a ridiculous machine!  SO wish I would have saved the money on this thing and bought the other tiller that's the Number 1 seller on amazon.  This thing is a total piece of junk!  And, I'm now out the $330 I paid for it.  Brother!
B000N5WPQY Yes, I use my Mantis tiller every day to loosen up my horse stalls.  Not typical use for a device like this, but it works fantastic.My horse stalls have a sand base, and running the tiller over them every day keeps the sand loose and the stalls fresh. I've been using this tiller in my stalls for several months now, and it's running like a champ. It gets the job done done quickly and better than I could do with a rake.
B000NCTGQE I bought this greenhouse to over-winter some not cold-hardy plants on my screened porch. It was easy to set up, although I managed to get the side supports upside down, once that was corrected, the finished product looked very nice. The shelves are rather flimsy but hold my plants with no problem. Even though the weather has only been cold enough lately to use the greenhouse a couple of nights, when I took the ferns out during the day I noticed how nice and warm it was inside. For my purpose the greenhouse works very well, the cover is fairly heavy, it fits good, the tubing feels strong and the pieces all fit together. I'm very happy with the greenhouse.
B000NCTGQE I use 2 of these with row cover cloth over them to shade my heat sensitive plants in the summer.  It's much more sturdy than I was led to believe by some of the other reviews.  We have pretty strong winds around here, and it doesn't phase it.  Granted I don't use the plastic covering.
B000NCTGQE I have one tomato plant and I use this mini greenhouse to keep it warm at night. ( I do not use the shelves)It has worked wellThe only issue is this.  During the day it gets too hot.  I would love to find a mini greenhouse like this with an automatic venting system. So if it gets too hot, the vent/fan turns on to remove hot airThe do have these types if venting systems for larger greenhouses so it can be done.
B000NCTGQE My husband put this shelving unit together in 20 minutes.  He added tie-ons around each tier shelf to keep them from moving around too much.  It's a handsome little thing but I can tell just by looking at it that it is not designed for long-term outdoor use.  Those reviewers who complain that it gets blown away in the wind are not using this for its intended use.  The intended use is as an indoor growing medium with supplemental light.  A heated garage, a sheltered patio or balcony or a sunny spot in a large kitchen would be ideal for this greenhouse and users could get many years of use from this thing.The connecting parts are plastic and when empty this greenhouse does not weight much (thus its \"portability\").  The lower end is open to air, so true humidity would be difficult to replicate.The \"plastic smell\" goes away when left out to ventilate a few days after set-up.I am happy with this little device.  Here in Arizona this covered shelving unit works to keep dust from getting on my garden tools in the off season.  In the dry, windy springs here, though, this thing wouldn't stand a chance of lasting long outdoors in the direct sun.
B000NCTGQE Although the construction of this \"greenhouse\" is somewhat flimsy, with 1/2\" metal tubular supports and wire shelves, it works well as a temporary shelter/space for plants, as long as you don't expect to keep plants warm during frosty nights.  I use mine indoors during the end of winter for starting seeds, then move it outside as the weather gets better.This shelving unit comes with a plastic tent with a zippered door that fits over the frame; the door can be rolled up to cool the interior or to access the plants.  Because the tent is relatively thin plastic (think suit-bag on steroids) and not glass, it heats up in the sunlight but immediately loses its heat as the sun sets, unlike greenhouses that are flush to the ground and have thicker glass/plastic walls to retain the heat longer.  If you still have temperatures in the thirties or forties at night and expect to grow warm weather plants like tomatoes outside, use plant heating pads or keep the unit inside until you can be sure that the cold nights won't stunt the plants.  If you do get an unexpected light frost, however, the plastic works like a row cover, keeping frost from the leaves.  If using outside, place it in a protected spot or anchor it in some fashion -- preferably both.  Even loaded with plants, the unit can blow over, especially with the tent in place since it can act like a sail.With the plastic in place, the top shelf is difficult to access, particularly toward the back because rolled-up the tent door and overhang get in the way.  The other three shelves (12-13\" between each) have plenty of clearance, and all four have room for 2-3 large seed trays.  Grow lights (not included) can be attached without much effort, provided, of course, that they are the right size.  The wire shelves are not attached to the frame - they sit on top of the cross-supports - but will stay in place during light winds as long as plants are on them.As long as you don't expect heavy-duty construction and heat retainment for cold nights, this shelving unit should serve well for seed starting or even for a display of small plants.  I don't find it attractive enough for a permanent plant stand for inside the house, but luckily it's lightweight enough to easily move around and store.  I find this perfect for starting my garden indoors and then using it to harden off my plants.-- Debbie Lee Wesselmann
B000NCTGQE I already have a couple of these that I've been using for years.  The units hold up well, but the covers don't hold up as long.  I don't use them to start my plants in.  I do that inside with heated mats and overhead lighting that can be adjusted.  I use these racks to harden off my seedlings prior to planting or hold plants I've purchased until planting time.  If you start your own tomato, pepper and other plants from seed, they can gradually acclimate to living outdoors using these handy racks.Only the top shelves will accomdate taller plants, but my seedlings are planted in the garden before they get too tall.  Sometimes I've needed the height if I purchased plants that were already quite tall.Most of my vegetable gardening is done in earthboxes.  We have a serious squirrel and slightly lessor rabbit problem in our area.  The squirrels will continually dig whereever I've planted things and the birds will quickly grab any seeds that are exposed.They destroyed all of the snap peas I planted a couple of weeks ago.  Only one seedling survived their havoc.  The other day I discovered that the shelves from these racks fit nicely over an earthbox.  The mesh openings are small enough to keep the squirrels and birds from digging up the seeds before they germinate.  I simply laid the mesh shelf over the top of the earthbox and secured it into place.  The soil level is a couple of inches lower and the seedlings can either grow through the mesh or I can simply remove the shelf once they've established themselves.I am considering buying another unit just for the mesh shelves.  I direct seed things like cucumbers, beans, peas, radishes and squash in the earthboxes and often have to plant multiple times before I have enough growing.  These shelves should solve that problem.For hardening off seedlings, I only close the covers if we expect a cool night and my racks are used on a covered front porch and against the back of the house.  I position them so they are less susceptable to wind to help sheild the plants from cold wind and keep them from blowing over.  After a brief period, I bring the plants out of the unit for gradually increasing lengths of time so they get a little wind and the stems get sturdy.  You do need to shift the plants because they will always grow toward the light and they need fresh air and wind to become strong enough to survive in the garden.Those who have had trouble with plants wilting due to too much moisture need to give the plants more access to fresh air and air circulation.  Just remove the cover when the temps allow it or remove the trays of plants for a few hours a day.
B000NCTGQE You probably need to make a few adjustments.  Firstly, the wire shelving does not snap into place so sliding a tray on the wire shelf would cause the entire shelf to fall off the railing.  I used locking ties to affix the shelves to the rail apparatus to prevent the shelves from sliding off. Also,  I would prefer the zipper to go both from top and bottom rather than just he bottom. If you have to water on the top shelf, you have to unzip the entire thing.  But good anyway.
B000NCTGQE We purchased two of these. We were excited to get them quickly and we put them together with no problems. We knew they weren't going to be the highest quality, but we thought they would do the job. We put a total of 6 small plants (herbs and vegetable seedlings) split between the 2 greenhouses. We also put things like our small shovel, empty watering can, and bag of soil on the bottom shelves. There is no recommended maximum weight listed on the product listing, the box, or the directions. We figured we should be okay since we had much less than what is pictured on the box and also on the product listing here.Not even 24 hours after setting these up both crashed to the ground. Pots broke, plants were tossed upside down, and everything was a mess. It was difficult to get everything out safely since the plastic was zipped up and the opening was facing the ground. Once we got everything out, we noticed the plastic supports on both of our greenhouses broke. They could not hold the weight. That is unfortunate considering there wasn't that much sitting in the greenhouse to begin with.We will definitely be returning both of these.I wouldn't bother wasting your money on this. We've decided to spend a little more and get a heavy duty rack like this one:Seville Classics SHE18487 18-Inch by 48-Inch by 72-Inch Shelving System with Wheels, Chromeand then wrap heavy duty plastic around the back and sides. For the front, we are going to attach a second piece of plastic with velcro so it is removable. Same effect, but at least we can be certain it won't come crashing down.--In case this review doesn't scare you away and you are still curious about the dimensions between the shelves:-There is 12.5\" between each shelf.-The top shelf has 20.5\" of space at it's highest point.If you are having trouble keeping the wire shelves flat across the supports, you can bend them slightly downward so they fit better. This stopped ours from moving around so much....well before they came crashing down. :/
B000NCTGQE I used this greenhouse this spring.  We had a long wet/ cold spring this year.  I was happy to have somewhere for my seedlings but there are several things I do not like about this product and I do not plan to buy another.Pros -*Works well to protect seedlings from wind and excess rain if monitored*Easy to assemble*Inexpensive*Nice lookingCons -*Forget using the wheels unless your surface is smooth.  My older deck was too rough and the tiny wheels kept getting stuck*Easy assembly yes, but also easy disassembly.  Every time you move the thing it falls apart no matter how well you think you have forced the pieces together.  I also had to use some electrical tape to tape the shelves in place as they just sit on the rails and will fall off, damaging plants below.*With no vents it can go from warm to plant killing heat in just a few minutes if the sun comes out unexpectedly.  I used a wireless thermometer to monitor it constantly.  I finally cut a 6 x 8\" vent on either side of the top where the heat built up the most.  I left the flaps hanging and tucked them up when it was warm.*If it is really cold the plants have to be brought into the house.  This unit is so small and the plastic doesn't go all the way to the ground there is no way it will actually hold heat overnight, something owners of even larger 'real' greenhouses struggle to do.In summary - I previously had an 8 x 10 actual greenhouse but have recently moved and needed something cheap and quick.  This fit the bill. After using it for 3 months the plastic around the zippers is starting to come loose.  I monitored it continuesly as to the temperature, opening and closing the front flap and my home made vents as needed.  Everytime I left the house for an extended period I had to decide if I wanted to just put the plants out on the table and risk cold damage or leave them in the greenhouse and risk heat damage.  This is a useful item but is very time consuming to make the best use of.  The quality is ok.  Originally I was planning to break it down for easy storage in the summer but now I think I will permenently glue the joints and store it fully assembled so it isn't falling apart on me.  Either way in one more season I am sure it will be shot and then I plan to purchase another 'real' greenhouse or use high tunnels.
B000NCTGQE I don't know what the negative posters are talking about.  It took me 5 minutes to assemble this greenhouse and place it on my pool patio.  I've started two generations of seeds in this greenhouse without any problems.  The shelving is metal, the frame is heavy duty plastic with metal parts, and the cover fits perfectly.  It is a very lightweight unit so I wouldn't recommend putting it in an area where you'd be encountering wind gusts since it might tip over.  However, that's just common sense, or so I thought until I read the reviews here.Good product, decent prices, easy assembly, 5 stars.... and I just purchased another right before leaving this review.
B000NCTGQE There's frost danger in our mountains until mid-May. We're at 5,500 feet, and it gets hot in summer (up to 100F), but the growing season isn't that long. If you want tomatoes and more that will finish producing before the temp. plunges below freezing again, you either pay for plants a couple of feet tall - or you grow your own from seed.We've begun to grow both veggies and flowers from seed, and we've set up a \"sprouting station\" with a heated warming pad under a fluorescent grown light (I've reviewed them separately). We use Jiffy trays of 72 peat pellets each, that come with their own tray and see-through plastic top. But what would we do would we do with those flats of pretty green heads once up?The answer was this greenhouse. We set it up indoors, in front of the fixed section of a sliding glass door. Some daylight gets to it, but it needed more light, so I rigged it with 2ft. fluorescent \"under-counter\" lights, purchased elsewhere. That doubled the cost, but it made the unit self sufficient.Overall, the shelving unit is a little lightweight - but then again, it had to be designed to ship in a box for a reasonable cost. Once here, it was easy to figure out and put together - took maybe twenty minutes tops. The greenhouse is 2'3\" wide by 1'7\" deep. It's just over 5' high. That sounds pretty small, but in fact, it holds a lot. We've got basil, parsley, cilantro and more growing, and the greenhouse holds eight herb-size pots to a shelf. Or you can (just) fit two Jiffy 72-pellet trays on one shelf.The shelves themselves are wire mesh, and not fixed down, so I used plastic zip-ties to hold them in place.The clear plastic cover is pretty easy to slip over the unit, and the 2 x zippers are decent quality.I held back 1 star for these reasons: while most of the structure is metal rods, the end pieces are molded plastic. With our herb pots on the shelves, they bow a little in the middle. I'll probably end up cutting dowel to shore up each shelf. The manufacturer should think about beefing up those end pieces.Also, some worker half way around the world must have had a bad day while sewing our slip-over plastic cover - the seam on the front is crooked. Not bad enough for us to return it, but that's what we see every time we look at it. The clear plastic (or vinyl?) cover itself could have also been a heavier material.Those are quibbles. Overall, this greenhouse priced under $50 is one of the most reasonable out there. It is what it claims to be - a cute, tight unit.Recommended.
B000NCTGQE I bought this thinking it would be kind of cool to grow some smaller plants and flowers on but was disappointed... Though it it was easy to assemble.For outside use-  Without a sturdy background AND screwing it in for support this greenhouse design will fall over with even the smallest gusts of wind destroying all your plants... yes it happened to me, but i was able to salvage and retransfer a few of my starts.-During the summer months if you keep the flap closed the plants will not get nearly enough oxygen and die.  Also, in summer even with flap open I recorded heat in excess of 110degF causing serious wilting.For inside use-  Pretty much can only be used as a display for small flowers or to start plants in a tray (seed dome only fits in top tier) but kind of looks like crap with any kind furniture you might put in a room.All in all- Not a good buy unless you want a slightly hideous plant display or just want to look like you grow plants in a &#34;greenhouse&#34;.
B000NCUW1M I've used this stuff for years.  You have to be patient with it, as unnerving as it can be to watch the little critters march across your floors/counters.  How long it takes all depends on the size of the colony I assume.  The problem at my previous residence took almost 2 weeks to clear up (They seriously slowed down after the first few days).  The ants at my current one took &#60;3 days.  I don't use the &#34;spots&#34; they provide.  I use a larger piece of cardboard and put individual drops all over it.  You want the most &#34;edge&#34; area for the ants to feed from, so one big pool doesn't work.  Check your spots often to make sure they don't eat it all and wander off to find alternate food...make sure you keep it like a buffet, always full!  Although you don't want anyone to ingest it, as far as poisons go....I feel fairly comfortable having it around.
B000NCUW1M Every few years we get invaded on our hill top by tiny ants. All the neighbors tried different things and it didn't stop it. Then one got terro several years ago and bam. So we all now use it. This year, lots of rain and sure enough, they are back. Used it for a week and no more ants. I have even used in my car when they invade the car. I put it in tiny plastic lids instead of on the tear off paper (not such a good idea but product so great, won't remove a star.. just save flatter type lids).
B000NCUW1M We had little Pharaoh ants in our RV.  I tried other baits and few home made ant killers.  These little Pharaoh ants had a picnic.  I bought this Terro and the party was over!  The ants formed a heavy line and in a day or two they were gone!  Be sure and keep them supplied with bait until they stop coming.Recommended!
B000NCUW1M Been using this for years and it is great stuff. Only issue is it dries up in a couple of days so you need to refresh the area.
B000NCUW1M Here we are in the middle of a major drought in Indiana and the only thing that is multiplying is the ants!  They are just thriving in the heat and they are everywhere.  If I set out food for the other animals the ants are all over it in minutes and they devour everything.  This product is a sure thing, it doesn't kill the ants in your home, it kills the nest and it is gone.I was unfamiliar with this product a few years ago and now I use it every year.  We found a few ants in our kitchen and they were so small that they were crawling under the door seal.  I got some Terro liquid and put a small drop on a few pieces of thin cardboard and placed them in the path of the incoming ants.  They immediately found it and within a few minutes hundreds of them were enjoying the bait.  They eat their fill and then take some back to share with the colony.  They even share it with the Queen (Which is really your target) and within a few days to a few weeks the colony is gone (Depending on its size).  The ants that eat it die within 24 to 48 hours and they are sharing it with other ants.  Don't disturb the bait and only replenish it if it becomes hard or they have consumed it all.  Just add a few drops and in hot weather, do this in the morning and at night.  The ants that find the bait leave an odor trail and this leads the other ants to the bait so don't move the bait.Terro also makes liquid ant bait traps that are prefilled and ready to use.  They feed the ants but protect the bait from the elements and it prevents the bait from drying out.  Leave the Terro in place for 3 or 4 days so you don't see any more ants and then you can dispose of it.  Terro is safe to use around pets and children and its active ingredient is Borax which is already used in many household products.This product works and it does its job quickly and safely.  It works both inside and outside and within 4 days you should begin to see the difference.  I believe in this product and I strongly recommend it to you!
B000NCUW1M I'm so happy they just sell the liquid.  Their ant killer is the best but I had switched to Combat's gel (in the syringe-looking thing) because the little bait stations Terro usually has available are dumb.  Ants NEVER go in them.  I have always just dumped the liquid out of them and threw out the plastic station.  Now I don't have to bother with that and I can put this anywhere!  I will say that this is a liquid and will run if you use it vertically.  The Combat gel can go on a wall without issue.
B000NCUW1M This is the most amazing product that I have used.  I put in it two areas where I either knew or suspected that there were ants inside my house.  Within 15-20 minutes, there were hundreds of them in a feeding frenzy.  The secret is to resist the temptation to spray them, since they eventually head back to the nest where apparently they infect others and where they all die.  So far, it has taken a little less than 3 days for the hundreds to drop down to a handful. Some didn't make it back to the nest. This is clearly a very effective product. You can get it for $2 and change at your local hardware store.
B000NCUW1M Living in New Mexico, we have lots of ants. We have used Terro for years now. We use it where ants are active and always put it on the floor. Don't put it on your counters. Perhaps we have many ants because last year we went through FOUR bottles of Terro and still had ants. It at least keeps them busy and in one place. They are very attracted to this formula. Whether or not it has been taken back to the nest and killed off any colonies, I don't know. I found that the traps sometimes will dry up before the ants can empty them, so I prefer the bottled liquid so it can be doled out as needed.
B000NCUW1M I can't tell but it does not seem to kill them.,...they swarm to eat it but they keep coming back !!
B000NCUW1M When I see ants swarming in the house, my natural reaction is to spray them with a diluted soap solution, which kills them almost immediately.Using a product like Terro Liquid Ant Killer, requires suppressing my \"kill immediately\" mindset and taking a long term approach.  The very best case scenario is that the foraging worker ants will consume the ant killer, and take it back to the colony, where it is consumed by the Queen ant.  When she dies, the colony will become crippled and die out.It sounds great in theory, and every species of ant I have encountered seems to love drinking this liquid.  It's very cool watching the ants maniacally feed, but how likely is it really that the poisonous solution will find its way back to her royal highness?  Probably, very, very, low.Many ant colonies are quite intensive, span large areas, can contain millions of ants, and some even have several queens.  Believing that the few ants consuming the poison, will fortuitously also feed and kill the Queen, is quite a long shot.  Logically the more ants that drink the poison, the greater the odds of success.  So infecting as many ants as possible makes sense, however that is a little challenging when the product is being sold in one or two ounce bottles, and administered by the drop.  It just doesn't seem very efficient, or provide the necessary coverage to poison enough ants.I live in a temperate part of the country, and have four or five different species of ants constantly battling for territory in my yard.  They are basically everywhere there is soil.  Having used this product and similar liquid ant baits, many, many times, I have yet to see it successfully wipe out a colony.The ingredients listed on the label are \"Sodium Tetraborate Decahydrate (Borax) 5.4%\", and \"Other Ingredients: 94.6%\".  Assuming the costs are nominal for these ingredients, the percentage of profit on a product like this must be astronomical.  If liquid ant killer was sold by the pint instead of by the ounce, at a price closer to actual costs, with a more efficient system of distributing the poison (traps or other dispensers), I suspect the product would have a much higher rate of success.  But of course, that would be financial suicide for Terro, who make no promises regarding success.  Consider this, at the retail cost of $6.50 for two ounces, Terro Ant Killer costs about $416 per gallon (128 ounces).  At the price for the one ounce bottle ($4.27), a gallon costs $544.  This stuff is not cheap!I use the product occasionally, with the hope that maybe just once I will get lucky and wipe out a colony.  Seeing the ants literally crawl over each other to guzzle down the stuff, feeds my fantasy that this will be the time the deadly elixir makes its way down through the depths of the colony, to the Queen's lips (sorry, mandibles), and she will meet a tragic end.  No luck so far.Ant bait does work, however what appears to be missing is some honest, accurate data about how much liquid, and how many ants may need to be poisoned, to stand a good chance of taking out a colony.  If as I suspect, both numbers are quite substantial, that information probably won't be forthcoming from Terro anytime soon.
B000NCWOKE I purchased this hose because I wanted a lightweight weigh hose I could maneuver around.  I also was more interested in pressure than volume.  I have been very pleased.  The hose is kink resistant and solidly built.  I highly recomend.
B000NCWOKE I have purchased four of these Gilmour 10 series hoses over the last three years, two are still working. The manufacturer specifies a lifetime warranty on their web page, but no-one from the company has ever replied to my emails. We have 3 hoses in the back garden, the third is a Flexon, which so far has outlasted two of the more expensive Gilmours, and it's a lot lighter.
B000NCWOKE I love this hose.  It replaced my HEAVY one inch hose that was hard to pull through my long yard.  This one is a joy to use, so easy to maneuver.  Will purchase again if necessary.
B000NCWOKE I demand a lot out of my hoses, and in spring/summer have 2 100-foot hoses + 1 50-foot hose running from the house to our raised-bed vegetable garden.Well, I didn't even start the garden yet but had the hose fail on me. I left if on for a couple hours but had the nozzle off from the sprayer. The hoses I had last year never had an issue in this state.But after just two hours, the Flexogen hose was spraying water from the part that connects to the faucet. I'll be able to patch it and use it with our rain barrel but it disappointed me.
B000NCWOKE I went for this because of price. My mistake, it kinks and the kinks turn into squeezed shut areas that have to be worked back to open flo. Never will buy again.
B000NCWOKE Length and 8-ply construction of this rugged hose means that it will swerve you for many years. As such, it is a better investment than buying a 2-ply or 4-ply hose!  Length is ideal for use in any corner of my yard.  Couplings are tightly fastened.  Well-constructed!
B000NCWP44 Have really held up.  Much better than the washers I bought at the local hardware store, although you'd never know by looking at them.
B000NCWP44 What a difference a washer makes! It turned my leaky spitting garden hose into a well behaved no leak hose!  These washes are made from high quality rubber.  They are easy to install and fit the hose perfectly.  They are more expensive than the cheap washers that you can pick up at a home improvement store for a couple of bucks, but I think they will last longer and in the long run will not be more expensive. I have hard water and had to replace the flimsy washers every year.
B000NCWP44 Something that always gets lost and you need to have extras on hand when they get hard and useless. Or you risk getting very wet every time you hand water anything. A must have for homeowners with large yards
B000NCWP44 Must have washers for your hose and attachments as they all eventually begin to degrade.  Nice pack of seemingly quality washers for a good price.
B000NCWP44 These seem to work very well.  They are a lot snugger than the plastic(?) washer that came with my spray nozzle, and they have more depth and \"cushion\" than the old one.  I don't think I'll have any problem with leaks now.
B000NCWP44 What can I say, rubber hose washers, they work just fine.  This is hard to give rate reasons as they are just washers.
B000NCWP44 Came with 10 washers, at well less then 4 bucks its a great deal. I had a pack of these before that lasted about 6 years until I lost them, so I'm certain the rubber will stay good at least that long when stored. I've only used 2 of these but so far both the hoses don't have any leaks.
B000NCWP44 There seems to be a softer quality to this rubber that makes for a far superior seal with no leaks, as opposed to products that appear very similar but are harder and don't seal as well.
B000NCWP44 great deal stops leaking water hoses. very fast shipping. working great so far. great price. will order again when I need them. thanks.
B000NCWP44 I have been using Gilmore washers for quite some time now and of all the washers I've dealt with over the years this brand is consistently the best.  Now unlike some folks who have one or two hoses hooked up and connected, I have the things running all over the place.  We have a very large vegetable garden, a large number of flower gardens, orchard and grape vines.  We do A LOT of watering.Now some of our gardens, trees, etc. are located quite a distance from our various outlets.  Folks, we are talking four acres here with stuff that needs watering all over the place.  This requires multiple hose connections.  Now I have found that when I have a leak near the joint or main connection that in 99 percent of the time is requires a washer replacement.  The thing is, washers wear out, especially if you leave the hoses out year around like we do.  I make it a practice to replace all washers each spring.  This saves me a lot of frustration and hassle during the main growing portion of the year.Please note that if you run over the end of your hoses or hose joints with a car, tractor or lawn tractor, a washer will not normally fix the situation.  Nor, I fear to tell you, if you accidently burn your hose while burning leaves and brush, will a washer fix the problem...trust me...I know about stuff like that.The price here for a package of ten washers is quite competitive.  I pay more at local stores.  I will start ordering these things from Amazon as it will save me some bucks so I can replace burned hoses.Anyway, when you buy a new hose, check it out.  You will almost always find one of those little plastic washers either in the end or wired to the hose.  If you want my recommendation, you will get rid of the plastic washer and replace it with one of these Gilmores...you are going to have to do it anyway very soon so you might save yourself the headache.I always keep an extra pack or two of these around as I have little patients and when I need a washer, I need a washer now!This is a good buy and as a Prime member, I get free shipping which makes it even better!Don BlankenshipThe ozarks
B000NCWP44 I had the black washer in my garden hose and spray nozzle that came with them when purchased. They both leaked, so I purchased these red ones. They stopped both the leakes and I've not had any leaks from either one. I'm very satisfied, so far.
B000NCWP44 What can you say about them they do the job and must be used to keep your water where it needs to be and to keep you dry. theese are very good,thicker than others i have purchased I would recommend these!
B000NCWP44 I had no idea that the a good washer could make the difference.  They are very large and sturdy and actually fit our hose beautifully.  These are not the cheap, hard plastic washers you find other places.  These beauties really work and no more leaks.
B000NCWP44 Not much to comment on gaskets except that they serve there purpose in our garden hoses.  Somewhat larger than those you buy at a discount store.
B000NCWP44 These washers are an add-on item which means they ship free with a $25.00 order. There are 10 red washers in the plastic bag at a cost of $3.98 for the 10 of them. They are the exact size as the black washers that come with the Gilmour solid brass hose connectors that are known to cause cancer according to the state of California. These washers are made in China as are the Gilmour hose connectors for which I bought the washers. There is no cancer warning on the red washers. Replacing the washers is a very easy task. They do a good job of stopping leaks.
B000NCWP44 These washers are an excellent fit for my 5/8-inch hose ends. Old washers do tend to dry out regularly and the fact that Amazon carries these washers makes it much easier to replace them as needed.
B000NCWP44 bought these for my non heavy duty hoses that didn't have washers built in.these performed exactly as i wanted/expected.  leaks stopped, but functionality remained.perfect.
B000NCWP44 They seal just like they are supposed to and so far I haven't had any leaks. Right price, product as described.
B000NCWP44 You can't beat these red rubber washers. They seal so much better than the black O-Ring style. At least I have found them to be far superior.
B000NCWP44 Excellent hose washers, far superior to the cheap plastic &#34;washers&#34; found at box stores. I will definitely consider buying these again when the time comes (in a few years or so).
B000NCWP44 It is always good to have a couple of these as spares. They fit nice and snug in the hose that for the price I always replace them every other year or so.
B000NCWP44 Sometimes improvements don't have to be fancy & expensive - like these Gilmour washers.  Over the years it seems like every time I use my hose for something I end up wet in one manner or another.  All my hoses and connector nozzles have leaks at the connector point - if I'm lucky the leak sprays harmless away from me but alas about half the time I take one in the eye, pants, shoes, etc.  I still remember the time I got a good soaking in the upper front part of my pants right before company came over...I used to think the problem was in the nozzles so I would replace them more frequently than I probably should have (at $10+ per pop).  However, even the new nozzles leaked and sprayed me in the eyes/pants/shoes/etc.  Over the years it dawned on me (I'm not that bright) that it's  not the nozzle but probably just needs better washer sealing.  I knew what to do next  -> Amazon.com ->  search ->  garden washer ->  read user reviews ->  Gilmour Hose Washers.I'm glad to report that these washers work as advertised and can't beat the price (vs buying new nozzles).  No more leaks/soakings.  I've found I do need more washers than hoses - I insert mine in the nozzle heads and I've got more nozzles than hoses. 
B000NCWP44 I didn't intend to purchase these, but ended up buying them based on an amazon recommendation. I didn't realize how much I needed these and have been very satisfied stopping all leaks in my hoses and attachments.
B000NCWP44 This is a pretty handy pack of washers to have around, they are probably going to work better for you then any washer included in a new garden hose or garden sprayer.  Works even better if you put a thin layer of teflon-based lubricant on it like Magic Lube or something similar.  Prevents leaks.
B000NCWP44 I tried yellow plastic washers and a quick connect set purchased at Lowes, they didn't work. Despairing of finding a solution, I put this washer in yesterday. Success! No leaks when turned on hose. Hoping for best.Update 9/27/12 Still no leaks!
B000NCWP44 use these to replace all the old ones that leak or are disintegrated. used for hose and hose connections  great with add on
B000NCWP44 Hard to say too much about these simple little washers.  Replace the crap vinyl ones you usually get in hoses and attachements with good quality washers and fix those leaky joints.  I order several packs of these just to make sure I can find them when I want them.  It's the little things in life that you appreciate....
B000NCWP44 They were ok, but the bag was torn open with one missing when I located it inside the box. Never had that happen before or since at Amazon.
B000NCWP44 These are for 3/4 garden hose and if your like me it's easier to change them than have a leak.  These are a little thin but still work well, I have needed to double them up once, because they were so thin.
B000NCWP44 Cannot beat the price, they do what they are designed for and they are durable.I have used and re-used these washers on multiple hoses and sprinklers.
B000NCWP44 I used a washer to stop a leaky hose connection and it worked. The leak is now between the hose female end and the connection to the hose. I don't think there is a fix for that leak except buy a new hose. The rubber washers work.
B000NCWP44 These are the best I have gotten. They are thick enough not to squash easily and they are flexible enough to fill uneven spots on older faucets. I never have to get out the pliers to stop a leak. I always keep some around. There really is no disadvantage to them at all. I buy a set whenever I buy any hose related Gilmour item so that I can replace the junky ones that come standard with them and make installation easier. You should get these.
B000NCWP44 Basically these are red rubber washers like the ones that were used years ago. They work fine. Many products made today come with those plastic washers. I find that the plastic ones allow the fitting to loosen up on its own, which is very annoying.
B000NCWP44 These are made of good quality rubber so they should function very well and last for a long time to come
B000NCWP44 replaced one 2day on the 2nd of 2 ordered Gilmour* Platinum hoses from last year - should have sent that back. Now to 'crack of' the collar' to hopefully get problem fixed as this not a solution -Gilmour 20-58075 20 Series 8-Ply 5/8-Inch-by-75-Foot Flexogen Hose, Platinum
B000NCWP44 These washers fit perfectly and snuggly in your hose and nozzle as needed.  I had to use a flat blade screwdriver to firmly fit the washer in place.  That way it was tightly in place.  It keeps leaks from occurring at the spigot and at the nozzle.
B000NCWP44 If you use garden hoses, then you will eventually need these. The provider washers wear out or get lost. These are a cheap solution.
B000NCWP44 Though these washers work better than any others I've used, I would still like to see a softer washer become available. I have a lot of hoses and it would be so much nicer if I didn't have to turn the hose ends together with such force to get a good connection. I'm constantly moving hoses and changing lengths. Someone should make a good soft rubber washer. If anyone one knows of some, let me know.
B000NCWP44 These are excellent little washers. We do a lot of watering here in the desert and the sun is out from about 6AM to 9PM so washers take a beating and we replace most every year. However, why anyone would pay about 10 bucks (Amazon's price when this review was orginally posted) for hose washers is beyond me.I just purchased a few packs of these now that the price has dropped to a little over 2 bucks... Amazon price on 5/11/12 was 2.22 per 10-pack. The price difference may not seem like much but I recently purchased a 50 pack on eBay for 8.38 so that's under 2 bucks per 10 pack and that's a whole lot of washers.This is a good cart filler if you're a few bucks under 25 and these are great washers. Heavy duty rubber has lasted me longer than the plastic and other types of washers that come with most hoses and attachments. We have about 24 connections that require washers because we pump from a canal, water from field hydrants and also use several hose bibs on the house. It's hot here, the wind blows hard frequently, there's no humidity and all that adds us to a fast dry in the gardens and yard. We hate to waste water so spending a few bucks on washer, especially the Gilmour rubber ones, is much better than the water loss from the collective drips from inferior washers. However, even these do get a permanent crease that hot metal on the hose ends and the faucets will leave and though they don't leak they are hard to reuse the next season.
B000NCWP44 The important thing is the fact that they are rubber, not stamped-out cheap plastic.  They'll actually what they are supposed to do, and they'll last a lot longer than the cheap plastic junk.
B000NCWP44 I purchased a hose at wal mart and someone must have jacked the rings out of it. I plopped these in and it worked like a charm.
B000NCWP44 I am very glad to have these as &#34;back-ups&#34; for the usually cheap and thin one that comes with most hoses.  I used one on top of the one the hose had, and there is absolutely no leaking when watering my plants.  Love them and a very inexpensive solution.
B000NCWP44 Best use for auto irrigation projects.  No leaks secure the in near home prevents leaks to basement.Always have these available for projects where pressure finds its way past cheap washers. Well made and thicker.This brand and type best
B000NCWP44 These are good quality washers that are very well made. I bought these to replace some cracked washers of my garden hose. These are much better quality than the original ones that came with the hose.
B000NCWP44 Who can't use some extra washers; I can never seem to find mine when I really need one.  So I have this item on my Wish List to use whenever I need some extra amount to bring my order total up to the &#34;free shipping&#34; limit.  It is perfect for this.
B000ND3MGS This plant has been both more cold resistant and more pest resistant than the two dwarf cavendish banana plants growing in the same microclimate.  I bought the two cavendish plants at Home Depot with about eight leaves and about two feet high a week or two after I got this tiny nanner with four itsy bitsy leaves on it and they are all about the same size now.  We had two near-frosts that took a toll on the two others, but this plant never blinked at the cool weather.  So far so good.  It is now about three feet tall with no brown spots or blemishes of any kind, and no pest problems.  By comparison, the two dwarf cavendish plants always have at least a few leaves with brown spots on them no matter how often I care for them.  No fruit from any of them yet, but all things in their time. :)
B000ND3MGS Update: 8/30/2013:--------------------------------Plant has been dead for some time now.Update: 7/03/2013:--------------------------------This plant is just about completely dead now.Update: 1/13/2013:--------------------------------I managed to save the first plant, but I noticed a few days later after I've gotten the plant I noticed it was infested with spider mites. I used an insecticide on the plant, but it appears they already did damage to the plant. They were not discovered at first because they were all down inside the base of the plant. I suggest the seller (9GreenBox) to use insecticide on them ASAP.The insecticide I used isSafer Brand 5118 Insect Killing Soap - 16-Ounce Concentrate. It seemed to work on the first use, you should do it twice just to be sure none survived. If you're not sure if you have any you can look for small dots on your plant, move the leaf some and see if they move. If you're still not sure you can use a insecticide anyway.Also keep in mind this plant does NOT produce bananas. The image for the product is misleading. Any fruit it does produce is completely inedible, I'm not sure if the fruit will harm animals. I plan on picking them off and throwing them away just to be sure because I have three dogs.I've since then transplanted both of the trees into aSmart Pots 3-Gallon Smart Pot Soft-Sided Container, Tansince my last review. I used soil from my garden, yes it was not a \"great\" thing to do. But with the smart pot it seems to be doing good with it. Because the soil can get muddy when I water the tree it seems to do good with watering once a week. The only problem I have is with the first tree which was infested with spider mites.Keep in mind both trees came almost dead. But after a week or two of care it seems to come back and starts producing more leaves.For those of you that change your mind about keeping this plant you can grow it to the first flowering stage and get about $50 for it locally. If you let it flower fully then you can get about $110 for it.-------------------------------------------------------------------------Below is line is the old review-------------------------------------------------------------------------The I got the plant today, the leaves seem like their dying from the shipment. I'm giving it some emergency care to see if I can save it, two of the leaves were completely dead. I have it under a special light which acts like the sun. It's also in controlled heating at 80F.I suggest you expedite the shipping if you buy this, might be dead if you wait a week.Also, it seems like a second tree is starting to come up in the pot. I don't want to do any transplanting from the original pot until it's more healthy.I also have some organic fertilizer coming which I'm going to use on it.I'll update this review if I'm able to save it.
B000ND3MGS First of all, I can't believe these things survive the shipping process.Got mine about 3 weeks ago.  It was packed pretty well, but it was obvious one of the leaves wasn't very happy.  I transplanted it into a bigger pot after 3 days and put it outside where it gets full sun.  I have two new leaves already.  We'll see how it survives through the Oregon winter, but so far so good.  No complaints.Update 12/28/12: well this little guy survived through the first OR winter so I took it out of its pot and stuck it directly into the ground last spring.  I was getting about one new leaf per week during the height of the summer growing season and the plant is about 3 feet tall now.  It is now set to go for its second OR winter.Update 5/27/13: the 2nd OR winter didn't go so well.  We had a week where temps dropped into the teens and the ground was frozen.  That killed the plant since I hadn't mulched the ground or done any prep work to keep it warm, such as wrapping it with burlap.  I cut the plant at the base thinking I needed to start over, but much to my surprise, three new plants poked their heads out of the ground as soon as the soil warmed up in March.  They're now about a foot tall each and it will take a while for them to reach the stature of their Mom, but I'm thankful to have my plants back.  I will definitely take better care of them come next winter.
B000ND3MGS This thing has done great so far. It survived the winter well indoors. I may plant it in the backyard this year and see how hardy it really is.
B000ND3MGS Hirts sent me a nice baby banana tree, in a four inch pot. When I got it, it did look small, with an outer leaf that looked brownish, and half dead. There was a leaf growing out of the middle, tho. Within a few days of receiving the tree, I transplanted it into a  larger growers pot, using very free draining soil. (Use palm soil, which is like cactus soil, or mix together potting soil, vermiculite, perlite, and turface if you have it too). This creates a very loose soil, for fast root development. Also, fertilize your banana tree quite a bit, but don't burnt the tree. Use a balanced fertilizer, 10-10-10. Keep it in the sun, and keep it warm.  I would take the plant outside when the days would go up into the 60s, and take it inside at night, when the springtime tempertures dropped into the 30s and 40s.  During this first month, the banana tree grew like crazy. The leaf that looked brownish, just dropped away. These plants grow VERY fact at first, in order to develop its &#34;trunk&#34;.  New leaves come out of the center of the plant, unroll, and stretch out, each one bigger, and thicker, than the previous one.  Now its about 5 weeks after ordering, and I'd say it doubled in size easy.  The 6 inch pot I have it in, is basically too small for the banana palm tree.  I've been busy, fixing the banana tree a permanent home in my yard, while it's enjoying its childhood in the 6&#34; pot.The location of your banana tree is important.  It should get as much sun as possible, tho be protected from harsh winter north winds.  These trees need mulched for winter, and the internet has a lot of websites, and Utoob videos, to show how this is done. I dug up the soil, in a 3 foot radius, adding a lot of organic mulch to the soil, along with a bag of manure. These banana palms require a LOT of food, and a LOT of water, in order to make these huge growth spurts. Only now, in late May, can I even hope to plant this tree in the ground. (I live in region 5.) You need to wait til the nights warm up, and all danger of frost is past, to plant these.  If its down in the 40s at night, it wont kill the tree, but it just wont grow.  I'm going to plant it this Sunday, in the well prepared soil, that receives full sun.  I'll fertilize it again, and make sure it never wants for water.  Then, sit back and wait for my instant palm tree! I hear if you can push the tree to create 18 leaves (?) in one year, it'll bloom for you. That's what I want to see. So, don't worry about those outer leaves turning brown, and wilting. Its how these plants grow. As the outer leaves die, know this: larger, thicker, taller leaves are rolling out of the middle to replace it.
B000NJ3R26 Wanted a simple, inexpensive system for the raised garden in my alley.  Bought last year's model but didn't set it up because one of the hoses was badly kinked due to the way it was packaged by the manufacturer.  Decided to order another one this year, figuring I'd use 3 sections of hose and 4 sprinkler heads.  T'was not to be... Hose construction has been improved, but same packaging problem resulted in similar kink.  Went ahead and set up my original one (I'm returning new one) with just one hose and two heads. The sprayers worked reasonably well, and the spray is relatively close to the ground, which I liked.  Five nozzles are included - three are a full circular spray, one is cone shaped, and one is semi-circle - but don't think this is a high tech system.  The whole set-up is fairly primitive. The sprinkler heads are light weight plastic - so light that the slightest movement of the hose shifts them , making it hard to keep them flush with the ground. They really need to have some kind of weight set on them to keep them stationary and stable (or simply made heavier in the first place) .  I ended up not using them as my garden has a slope, which meant they had to be propped in order to be level.  I wasn't confident they wouldn't somehow get knocked off kilter, and as this was to constitute watering for an extended vacation it seemed too iffy,,,,
B000NJ3R26 First, my product seems to have a differnet hose than the one pictured above - and it is by far one of the most inferior/poor quality types of hose I've encountered to date. The actual sprinklers are all plastic so no worry about rust - but they are also very light weight and prone to move about easily. In a nutshell, this product works but for how long is another question entirely. For just a little more money I purchased three hose remnants and sprinkler heads here on Amazon - of MUCH better quality. I'm glad I only purchased one of these...given the cheap production we'll see how long it lasts but suffice to say, I won't be buying a 2nd one any time soon.
B000NJ3R26 Needed something to water a strip of lawn and these fit the bill perfect they are plastic but seem to be well made
B000NJ3R26 You're not going to leave this out over the winter. Perfect for spreading the sprinkling through a large vegetable garden. Easy to aim.
B000NJ3R26 Other reviews noted the low pressure, but where I use these, I don't need a lot of water pressure.  They work beautifully in a narrow area where you don't want to get water on the house.
B000NJTFPE This animal is the greatest thing since sliced bread. I originally replaced my perfectly good electric (with a cord) mower with the CMM1000 model 10 years ago and stopped dragging my cord around.It was like Christmas opening the box. Then I was disappointed in the fact that everything was put together. You did not need three hands to assemble obscurely named parts. They don't even care what angle you hold the mower at, as the battery does not spill. My lawn was so small that it is not even on the chart of square feet cut on a single charge. Following the instruction I plugged it in for 24 hrs prior to use. I was gearing up for an afternoon of mowing. I waved my arms around like Norton on the Honeymooners, disconnected the charger, inserted the safety key, pushed it to the lawn, and turned it on. It was so quiet that I had to make the motor sound my self. I used the mulcher mode so the rear bag is hanging on the wall. 15 minutes and it was all over. I am going to run out and find the best compost I can find so I can mow more often.-------------------------------------------------------A few changes have been made to the new model; the key is smaller. And some of the electronics were moved from the mower to the charger. I have not dismantled this one yet however the last one was very simple to dismantle as I replaced the batteries once after seven years.Black & Decker MB-850 19-Inch  Lawn Mower Replacement Blade
B000NJTFPE I just got this mower and this thing works great.  I charged it up overnight and then went about my lawn mowing.  I don't have that big of a lawn, would say about .08 of an acre so it had more than enough charge to cut the grass.  The mower is simple to use and requires no assembly except for the grass catcher bag.  Just remember to pull out the mulcher when you first use it if you want to catch the grass in the bag.The mower weighs about 80 pounds, and gets heavier as it fills with grass.  Flat lawns are effortless, but pushing it up an incline might prove troublesome for some.  It's not self propelled so it does take more effort, but once you start pushing and it's cutting the grass, it's not even noticeable.You just insert the safety key, and pull up the handle on the right side and off you go.  Instant on and off.  There is no option to plug in a cord so you will have to have it charged for each use if you want to cut your lawn.  Just make sure to charge it after each use and always leave it plugged in.  It's alot quieter than the gas mowers I have used and I think it is quiet enough that you can even cut the grass early morning without waking people up.Forget the trips to the gas station and no need to worry about gasoline catching on fire.  The charge is advertised to work up to 1/3 acre so if your lawn is smaller than that size, this is definitely the better choice.  Zero emissions and low noise.Again, Just remember to plug it in after every use and leave it plugged in year round and you should have a well maintained battery.
B000NJTFPE Smaller front and back yards, mow every 2 weeks on the average.  Have had for almost 3 and 1/2 years, still runs great.  Did recently have a problem with the power lever, a little plastic piece breaking off which made it unable to turn it on.  I opened it up and basically replaced the plastic with a nut & bolt and that part is now better than new.  This is extremely easy to adjust and to mow with.  It lasts quite a while on one charge, I would guess I could mow a baseball field infield grass (probably about size of my lawn) no problem.
B000NJTFPE So far, I'm thrilled with this purchase!After I charged it overnight, it mowed my 1/4 acre lot and big back yard without problem. No fumes, no oil, no gas, relatively little noise and it's SO much easier to plug something in than run to the gas station to fill a container!The push bar also collapses easily when you want it to, so it fits well into a nook in my already crowded two-car garage!I also like the idea that if I throw solar panels on my roof, I'll be able to fuel my mower with completely clean energy so I just may have to in the next couple of years!
B000NJTFPE Although this mower works well at cutting grass and bagging leaves, the switch is very poorly designed and has broken on both (I purchased two mowers since I have a larger yard) mowers within one year. A flimsy plastic handle pivots on a thin plastic post, held by a light-weight spring. The plastic post degrades and fatigues quickly, and eventually breaks off at both ends, resulting in a mower that will not operate.  I have not subjected the mower to unusually severe treatment, and cannot fathom why an otherwise well-designed appliance should have such a poorly designed switch.
B000NJTFPE The four stars is actually for our CMM1000 which was the first generation of this mower.  It's been a trooper for us and the only thing we do is sharpen the blades once a year and we've swapped out the batteries only once!&lt;COMPARO>I've put a quick guide of the most popular models on Amazon.

They are super quiet, clean, and convenient. They aren't necessarily cheaper than a gas mower since they cost more up front but there is almost NO maintenance. (We spent $80 over 10 years for a set of replacement batteries.) Corded electric mowers are a lot cheaper but then you have a cord.>>Why SHOULDN'T I get a cordless mower? They weigh a LOT more than gas mowers so if you have a hilly lot or have difficulty with physical exertion, forget it. They don't have as much power as gas and re-fueling means charging for a few hours so if your lot is over  acre you may want to reconsider.>>Why do they all come with mulching PLUS bagging? Electric powered mowers have come a long ways but mulching still takes a LOT more power than discharging, so bagging is pretty much a standard feature.>>What is a watt-hour? It's basically how big your gas tank is - the more watt-hours, the longer you can mow before you have to recharge.>>Is the cutting path a big deal? Yes - for two reasons. 1) The first thing manufacturers do when power is marginal is reduce the blade size, so I tend to see the smaller mowers as more likely to be underpowered. Second, when you consider that you have to overlap each pass by ~3\", a 20\" blade now effectively cuts 13% more on each pass. If you have a larger yard, you definitely do NOT want anything under 18\"  Also, my measurements show most mowers overstate their blade size by 1/2\" (Our 20\" measures 19-5/8, our 19 measures 18-1/2)>>Why might I want a removable battery? If you have a large yard, this means you can have a second battery charging while you are using the first. A second battery typically costs $100-$150 but it can make the difference between going electric or not. Finally, if you keep the mower in a shed that doesn't have power, a removable battery will let you bring it in for charging.>>How long will my batteries last?  That depends on your climate and usage.  We had a small lot for many years and were religious about recharging right after use.  We also live in a cooler climate (Michigan) so the mowing season is shorter.  Our batteries lasted about 7 years.  Most people should get 3-4 years easily but if you're careless and live in Arizona, you could probably kill the batteries in a year or two.>>Why should I care about higher voltage? Higher voltage = more power, PLUS you can recharge the mower faster. With the same chemistry and current, a 36V mower will charge 50% faster than a 24V mower.>>Metal deck or plastic? Metal rusts but with minimal care it's not an issue. Plastic ends up giving you a more stuff to trim since you can't cut as close to fences, etc.If you've found this review helpful or have questions/comments, please let me know!
B000NSGNOG This is sort of a difficult product to evaluate. It is supposed to help keep algae from growing in your pool, but other things we use in the pool also do that. So if no algae grows, is this chemical responsible for it, or is it just maintaining acceptable chlorine levels and this stuff is irrelevant?I originally bought it as a stab at getting rid of some black algae stains plaguing a few spots on the vinyl liner. It did not help those.However, we've had a VERY rainy, often very hot summer. Those are perfect conditions for algae growth, and I haven't been using any more chlorine or algaecide than normal. I have been using three capfuls of this once a week. I haven't seen the first tiny spot of algae try to get a toehold this summer. With experience over 19 years of pool ownership, under these weather conditions I would say that is very unusual, and very pleasant.Since adding this chemical is the only thing I'm doing different than years where I might have had to brush off a few algae spots, I'm going to give it credit. It certainly is no more expensive than using extra algeacide and shock, and those are responsive measures rather than preventative measures. Its better to have the algae not show up in the first place than to have to beat it back when it does.Recommended.
B000NSGNOG This is a great product if you are like me and prefer using natural pool products instead of swimming in chemicals. This is the second product you use to keep the phosphates down after using phos free. Phos free brings phosphates down, pool perfect plus phos free is the maintenance step to keep them in check. Algae feed on phosphates, so remove the food bye bye algae. Note when algae die they put off phosphates as well. Once you get phosphates under 500 you can use this.If you have an algae bloom like I did before finding this stuff this company also has a super concentrate called first aid. I used a product called banish as I did not know about first aid at the time. I slowly reduced the phosphates after the outbreak although you can dump a whole jug without any issues.You must still watch your chlorine levels and don't let them drop, but you can use less chlorine, or in my case turn the salt water generator down some.
B000NSGNOG My pool can't function without Phos Free ... just a little bit each week keeps the algae at bay!  My pool is very hot (94 degrees in the summer) and even hotter if I run the hot tub; so some sort of algae control is absolutely required.  When I'm using Phos Free, the pool is algae free and clear as a bell!
B000NSGNOG use this if yo uhave any algae issues.  once you get rid of your algae, this will keep it away. i promise you that.  i found this item while i had a profesional pool company cleaning my pool.  when i went to the pool supply store, to buy it, the guy asked if i had a pool cleaning company.  i said no, and he said it is the best kept secret out there. one product that keeps you rpool super clean and algae free!!FORGET ALL THE CRAP ON THE SHELVES....USE THIS!  using this for over five years now and it works great!
B000NSGNOG I developed algae in my pool that kept coming back, even after treating the algae with an algaecide.  Well, I finally learned that to rid your pool of algae you have to first rid it of phosphates because that it basically the food for your algae.  And if you don't remove the phosphates, the algae will keep coming back.So, I first started with Phos Free.  Not the one labeled Pool Perfect + Phos Free because that is just for maintenance.  Look for the one they call simply \"Phos Free\" (by the same company).  That is like a shock treatment to rapidly remove the phosphates from your water.  Just follow the directions on that product, and then once your phosphate levels are down to an acceptable level (zero is best, but I've been told up to 300ppm is acceptable) THEN you can start using the Pool Perfect + Phos Free product on a weekly basis to maintain it.I now add the Pool Perfect + Phos Free to my pool once a week, and have not seen any algae re-appear.  It's been a couple months since I started using it, and I am very happy with it.***P.S.  I originally bought this product from Leslie's Pool Supply, but I will never buy any product from them again after I found out that their website rating system is rigged.  They will NOT publish a review about a product if it is negative in the slightest bit.  They will only publish (or maybe even write themselves) a review for a product if it is positive, so you never know if you're reading accurate/fair reviews or not.  I have emailed their corportate headquarters about this numberous times regarding my concern over why only my positive reviews are showing up on their website, but they haven't fixed the problem and don't even have the courtesy to respond.  Do NOT buy from Leslie's.  Amazon is the only way to go because at least you can read ALL the reviews and judge for yourself.
B000NSGNOG Boy, does this work! We had a green pool from the winter winds and spring pollen. This worked within 2 days of back-flushing and one filter cleaning. My gardener couldn't believe that the pools was clean and clear within one week (actually 3 days). This is the best price for the product but the nice part is having it delivered.
B000NSGNOG I just started using Phos-Free/Pool-Perfect this year on my 12,500-gallon pool.  It works.  The water is as clear as it was when the pool was first filled 7 years ago.  I use 1-1/2 capfuls once a week and no sign of the algae that showed up early-on this year and the water is crystal-clear.  When this runs out, I'll buy another container.  Simplest product to use that does what it says it will.  Can't beat that.
B000NSGNOG Being a new pool owner I don't know if by using this stuff I am eliminating the need to use other chemicals or not.  I have an automatic cleaner, use (3) 3&#34; chlorine tablets weekly and occassionally use muriatic acid to bring pH levels to where they should be.  I add 2 capfuls of the Pool Perfect + Phosfree weekly for my 22,000 gallon pool.  That's it.  My pool is spotless, no issues with discoloration, cloudiness, or smells.  Someone also commented that our water doesn't have that chlorine smell to it.  I don't know if it's because of using this or what?  Our chlorine levels are in line with what they should be.
B000NVDGFM I bot this hoping it would protect my feeder but the squirrels got right around it.  At first they would fall off, but then they eventually figured it out.  Also, in a windy storm my feeder and the bottom hook on the underside of the baffel fell right off.  Hook is lost in the snow, had to buy a new one at hardware store.  Can not recommend this.  Am going to try to coat it wish vaseline or wd40, see if that works.  Otherwise it is on to another feeder.
B000NVDGFM I got this cover to go with my birdfeederPerky-Pet 312C Panorama Bird Feeder, Copperto keep the squirrels off of it and to protect the feeder from the rain.  So far I haven't seen any squirrels any where near it, but it didn't quite shelter my feeder like I hoped and the seeds got soaked during a recent light rain.  Still, it is attractive (well, as attractive as these things go) and it had kept the squirrels out of my feeder so far.
B000NVDGFM This keeps the rain out of my dish-style hummingbird feeder perfectly.  It's also a deep dome so the feeder tucks up inside it just perfectly.  The hummingbirds can access it while the rain cannot.
B000NVDGFM I love this.  The seed in the feeder no longer gets soaked during rain storms and the birds at the feeder stay dry, too.
B000NVDGFM We had just purchased a couple of replacement bird feeders and wanted to get something smaller than the large domes for protecting the feeders from some of the rain.  While nothing will protect a feeder from a driving rain, this cover does very well for steady down pours and for light rain on our tube style bird feeders.The unit is very well made and is simple to assemble.  Both of the hooks pictured on the dome are included and they screw into the metal plate in the dome after you screw on a locking nut to each hook.  Once you thread in the hook you use the nut you previously put on to tighten against the metal plate.  This locks the hook in place so that it will come out with use.Would highly recommend this to anyone who needs a rain shield.  Keep in mind that this is NOT a squirrel baffle, but so far it has worked sell as such due to its steep sides.
B000NVM2L6 Little birdies love this feeder. I wonder if they get confused by their reflection in the window.I like that this feeder is window-mounted because not only can I watch them from inside, but the feeder is up and away from squirrels or stray kitties.
B000NVM2L6 Easy to use.
B000NVM2L6 I thought this would be great for our birds to feed at our window.  But very few want to perch on it.  Plus, it doesn't drain well.  After one season, the plastic discolored, and the suction cups wouldn't stick to the window.
B000NVM2L6 This was a gift I appreciated greatly  after my old one was ravaged by a storm.Since I had already acquired regular birdie visits from my previous one, the birds came back to feed without hesitation. The most common visitors are sparrows and chickadees.The clean application of this feeder onto the glass is key to a secure hold. Also make sure you place it within easy reach for cleaning and refilling.I'm not the only one enjoying birds at the window, my cats who are never outdoors are also entertained.Great gift for any bird lover, I recommend this to anyone who enjoys a close, indoor view of birds.
B000NVM2L6 Edit: 2 to 5 starsThis is a decent design and stays up well (and holds 2 cups of seed). But, the birds in my area utterly ignore both of the ones I purchased even though they bathe in the water-feeder right next to it. I have them on different sides of the house where the finches gather, and no-go.  They eat the seed it is filled with elsewhere, just not from the feeder.Edit:After several months of ignoring this feeder, the mother finches have found it in earnest and have taught their babies.  The finches used it all through spring and summer last year and are coming back in droves now that winter is warming up in California. The feeders are so popular that 6-10 more finches regularly line up on the fence railing waiting their turn!Now that there are birds inside or on top of both feeders most of the day my house cats are THRILLED. They have something so fascinating to watch just inches from their cat tree. My kitties spend 4+ hours a day watching birds and it has greatly improved their mood for the rest of the day; they're more attentive and loving.If you want to use 2+ feeders, place a second feeder out of sight of the first and the birds will fight less. I have a corner window (windows that come to a corner) and they the birds seem to prefer one feeder on each side vs both on one big window.
B000NVM2L6 Suction cups just don't work.  We have caulked this little feeder to the window.  I wish whoever makes suction cups would work on something that works. Good product - just make sure you figure out how to keep it up.
B000NVM2L6 I put this on a second-story window and it took less than two days for the birds to find it. So far, mainly the titmice, chickadees and house finches are eating from it. But I am hopeful that eventually I'll get some cardinals to find it. Its very easy to install...just read the instructions in these reviews about how to do it. Worked like a charm. I plan on buying more and putting them in various windows around the house.Update: I have now purchased 4 of these. The birds love them. I have never seen a Cardinal come to any of the feeders (they are hanging on first and second floor windows). I have mostly the birds mentioned above and wren, as well as nuthatches and woodpeckers if I put peanut butter suet in it. I have gotten mostly hairy and downy woodpeckers, which are small enough to actually sit inside the box. But I got a red bellied woodpecker the other day. He was MUCH too large to fit in the box, so hung off the side and rocked forward to grab the suet and then leaned back to eat it. He rocked back and forth a few times, flew away...and came back many times. I have suet in cages all around the house. But for some reason he wanted to go through the trouble of eating at this little plastic bird feeder. DETERMINATION!
B000NVM2L6 We loved it till the squirrel noticed it and started jumping on it trying to get to the food.  The idea is great but you have to find a window that isn't near a tree with squirrels around.
B000NVM2L6 My 2 cats love this feeder as it brings the outside birds right up to their ledge on the inside of the window. I received the feeder yesterday and filled it with sunflower seed and hung it even though heavy rains and winds were forecast.  Not only did the feeder NOT blow down, the seed inside remained dry!  YAY - no more wasted, moldy seed!
B000NVM2L6 This is a neat concept although I have not had any birds use it here yet. It's winter so I'm guessing by the spring it will fill up. I wish it was slightly bigger so that larger birds like a dove, cardinal could use. It would need another suction cup though.
B000NVM2L6 I have had 1 bird in it since I put it up..Have changed the food but they still don't come.  Would not buy another one. I think maybe a bigger opening would help..but
B000NVM2L6 No, the Perky Pet Window Feeder won't last forever -- a year or so before the suckers weather -- but while it's stuck to your window you'll be able to get a close look at our feathered friends, which can be so much fun for kids and adults.We stuck ours on the window next to the breakfast table.  The children got to where they'd sit so they could watch the chickadees and sparrows drop by to have breakfast with them.  And my husband and I enjoyed sitting quietly drinking coffee and doing not much else but waking up and watching them dart to and fro.I liked these small feeders well enough that every year I now buy them for the children's teachers.  Though I must admit that in kindergarten they didn't stay up long because they were too much fun and the little ones were paying more attention to who was dropping by to eat than their teachers (lol!)THE SKINNY:::Sticks well enough.  Can be difficult to fill if you don't think about this aspect before deciding on a site.  Didn't need cleaning unless there was a real downpour.  (You don't want the seed to get moldy and gross.)We highly recommend.Pam T and family~
B000NVM2L6 This window bird feeder works, but only stood up to 1 season of use for me before requiring repairs.  It's flimsy plastic, so you get what you pay for.Pros:- Plastic is clear, so watching birds is easy- The roof does help keep the bird seed dry- The suction cups had plenty of holding power and held to the glass through most of the winter- The plastic cleaned up well with dish soap and water- The limited opening was an effective deterrent to squirrel raids.Cons:- The feeder consists of two halves of plastic that are held together by 5 little nibs along the seam.  Through normal use, these nibs broke and my feeder started to separate.  Luckily, super glue works well.- The opening is only big enough for a single bird, in my experience, without squabbles.- A single fall, if the suction cups give out, will likely result in a broken feederI think it's just o.k. because it is easily damaged and didn't permit more than one bird to feed at a time.  I ultimately upgrade to aSongbird Essentials Recycled Plastic Window Bird Feeder.  It's more accessible by squirrels, but allows several birds to feed at once without squabbles and is built far more ruggedly than a plastic window feeder.Tip:  To increase suction cup strength, clean the window well and put a minute amount of cooking oil on the suction cup.  It increases holding power significantly.
B000NVM2L6 Not only do we humans enjoy the close up bird views, but my cats think this is the best invention ever.  They spend hours watching and making little cat chirps of joy. Best gift under $10 one can buy!
B000NVM2L6 This bird feeder is a total piece of crap.  It's made of cheap thin plastic with teensy connectors to bring both halves together.  Two of the flimsy connection prongs immediately broke upon insertion.  I doubt the product cost 25 cents to make.  Avoid this poorly made feeder.
B000NZZG3S This thermostat is a pretty nice construction.  The thermometer lead has a nice length to it.  The thermometer is pretty accurate and has nice response times.
B000NZZG3S I use this with the Hydrofarm CK64050 Germination Station with Heat Mat and it works great with it. The temperature could be faster at updating though. Sometimes I have to wait 10-15 minutes for a stable temperature after using fresh soil.
B000NZZG3S I picked this up for my son who just moved to St. Louis... pause for involuntary shake due to cold weather... and it connects perfectly to a flexible heat wrap to allows him to keep a constant temperature on his home brew year rounds.  Good thing he works for the largest brewer in St. Louis!
B000NZZG3S No more turning on and off the heat mat.  This little baby monitors the heat and keeps it at the temperature that you set it for.  I used to use the heating pad method under my seedling trays, but now they make most of them that turn off after a certain amount of time and that leaves the seedlings cold and without heat.  I bought two of the Hydrofarm seedling heat mats, plugged this digital thermostat in and never turned back.  I used it this Spring in the little conservatory where I keep the citrus trees in the winter.  It performed flawlessly.  If you want to keep a consistent heat under your little seedlings; this is the way to do it.
B000NZZG3S A must too help regulate temps for sprouting seeds and rooting clones .This will help speed up the time for root development, better the chance for successful germination & better success in rooting clones as well.Well worth my investment .
B000NZZG3S This keeps my heat mat at a steady temperature for seed germination. I used it for all my seeds this winter and it worked like a charm. I would recommend this product to anyone that grows plants from seed.
B000NZZG3S This made the Hydrofarm CK64050 Germination Station with Heat Mat more usable.  I hated that I could not tell at what temperature my seedlings were.  With just the heat mat I knew it would not be cold but did not know how hot.  This thermostat is awesome.  I feel like I have all the information I need to grow seeds and cuttings in a perfect environment, with a humidity dome.  I got this thermostat right after I got the germination station with heat mat. Then I also bought the higher dome cover.  7&#34; so my cuttings would fit.
B000NZZG3S Bought this along with the heat mat and glad I did. My greenhouse gets pretty warm during the day so this helps keep the mat from overheating my seed trays. It's really nice, easy to use and constantly displays the temp of your medium. It has a sensor that you push into the medium so it's measuring the temp of the soil at all times. Well worth it!
B000NZZG3S Used this thermostat for about five months, in a greenhouse, in conjunction with a heat mat.  It maintained the set temperature pretty well.  The only fault I can find is that the readout can be difficult to see in a bright environment such as a greenhouse.
B000NZZG3S This thing is such an absolute delight. Your heat mat plugs into this thermostat and then the thermostat plugs into the wall socket. Programming it is a breeze and the included sensor just goes into the plant bed. The only slight downside is sometimes the ideal heat may not be reached all the time. To solve this, simply unplug the thermostat from the wall and then plug it in again.
B000NZZG3S I have half a dozen of these thermostats to control 48&#34;x20&#34; heat mats.  The temperature maintained seems very accurate.  Heavy AC cable is overkill for controlling a 120W mat.
B000NZZG3S I just purchased my second one of these and so far they both have been working perfectly. There is nothing on the market in this price range that gives you a readout of the current temps with a nice bright red LED.Everything else is over $150.00........!Mine are actually used for ceramic heater.The Max current: 8.3 amps / 1000 watts
B000NZZG3S With this thermostat you can have complete temperature control and always will know what the temperature is.  The heat mat will work good without a thermostat  but works Great with one.
B000NZZG3S If you bought the Seedling Heat Mat your going to need this thermostat to complete your set up, with this it's a synch to have your heat mat keep its correct temperature, very easy to set then you just sit back and let it do its job.
B000NZZG3S The digital thermostat works with the Company's heat matHydrofarm CK64050 Germination Station with Heat Mat- there's nothing it can do on its own.It's ruggedly made, easy to use, program, understand and read. You might wonder how it works with the heat mat - you just plug the 3-prong plug from the mat, into the receptacle on the thermostat - which, in turn, plugs into the wall.I've had mine working for 2 weeks, and I can read it at a glance. I've confirmed that the temperature is what it says it is with a separate thermometer - bang on.I'm starting herbs (cilantro, parsley, basil and more) right now, and all the little green guys are up, and apparently loving the consistent temperature and humidity in the germination station.Recommended!
B000NZZG3S I have 4 of these currently and use them for all kinds of different things.It is very easy to use right out of the box and the temperature gauge is surprisingly accurate and they all have always been right on point with my external thermometers.Highly recommended!
B000OM82J0 Seems this product is best for getting your seeds to take off and root fast, looking forward to seeing how it helps with the garden outdoors. Does well with house plants
B000OM82J0 Using Superthrive to boost my plants health this summer and it will boost my crops production.  You don't need much for it to be effective.
B000OM82J0 This is some amazing stuff! It works fast and a great supplements for the garden. I'm never unhappy when I buy this product.
B000OM82J0 I've head from various reviews that it's just not the same as the 'old' formulation. Far as I can tell, it works as it always has. i've used this stuff for forty years, and it's good stuff.
B000OM82J0 This liquid is like having plants on steroids!We kept all of our summer geraniums &#34;juiced&#34;all winter and the result was obvious(not leggy,but full of greenery.It is really concentrated,plants love it and it is a great&#34;recovery solution &#34;for plants in distress.
B000OM82J0 I have been using this stuff since.....well, 40 years, and I still think it is the best thing out there to make plants stay happy!
B000OM82J0 I have been using this for over a year in order to really give it a chance.  I've used it on various potted plants as well as plants in the garden.  I really wanted this stuff to work but I wanted to be objective.  I only used it on half of my plants of each variety to see if there would be a difference.  Soil, fertilisers, care, light etc were all the same but only half got the \"Superthrive\".  ABSOLUTELY NO DIFFERENCE.  It didn't seem to harm the plants but also made ZERO difference to growth, flowering, size or taste.  Obviously some people love this stuff but I can't see why...placebo effect?  If it was as spectacular as it claims, then why wouldn't it be a standard product for all commercial growers?  Bottom line for them is money and obviously they see this as a waste...as do I.
B000ORYO4W I have been using a Hoover Spin Sweep for years (on my second one) so when this came up, I thought it would be a good product to review. My review is going to mainly be as a comparison with the Hoover model.Karcher better than Hoover1) Cleaner pick up. The Karcher uses a single round broom in the back to scoop up debris and deposit it in the bin. It does a much better job of cleaning up what you roll over. The Hoover relies on the front 2 brushes to sweep debris into the bin and tends to leave a small line of debris from where the 2 brushes come together2) Better front spinning brushes. The secret of the Karcher front brushes is they a geared to spin slower than the Hoover's. This results in a gentler sweeping action that does not fling debris to the left and right like the Hoover does, especially the faster you walk. The bristles are softer and do a good job a simply moving debris under the sweeper to be swept up by the back brush3) Dust bin easier to empty. It just sits in place and you do not need to push a button to get it out or press down to click it back in place. The problem with the Hoover over the years is the bin lock can break because you are pushing down in the same spot to lock it back in placeHoover better than Karcher:1) Easier to push. The Karcher seems to have a lot of gears to turn and it is noticeably harder to push than the Hoover, which seems feels featherweight in comparison2) Better with large debris. The Karcher has a &#34;twig catcher&#34; in the form of plastic fins that are supposed to keep large objects out of the bin, but it tends to get clogged up. Since I have a lot of little twigs to sweep up, this has been something I have to avoid with the Karcher. The Hoover seems to be able to swallow everything.3) Brush bumpers. The Hoover has bumpers with wheels on the outer part of the machine that do an excellent job of guiding the sweeper around walls and corners so the brushes keep spinning. The Karcher's brushes are unprotected and you can easily jam them to a stop against walls4) Steering. The Hoover steers easily and goes in a straight line. The Karcher seems to have a mind of its own and you are constantly adjusting it to stay in a straight line5) Reach. The Hoover uses the front brushes in a single step to sweep debris up at the front of the sweeper, so you can usually get anything the brushes touch into the box, but the Karcher uses a 2 step approach and you have to travel the length of the sweeper before the debris get lifted into the bin. Imagine trying to clean up under a table. The Hoover would get everything as far as you can push, but the Karcher would need more room to travel to get the same debris.6) Containment. This is something perhaps particular to my situation. I have to move the sweeper up a step to cover the area I sweep. Picking the Hoover up with the handles angles the front up as I move it. It also angles the Karcher the same way. But when you tilt the Karcher backwards, some of the debris in the bin falls back out, onto the rear brush and gets stuck in there and ends up being redistributed all over the ground as you move it, You have do extra sweeping to get it all up. The Hoover bin stays contained and even helps, because as the bin gets almost full, it can start coming out the front. The Hoover has a bigger bin, tooAt first I thought the Karcher was much worse than the Hoover, but as I used it more, I've come to realize it may be better for some jobs than others. It does a better job on driveway debris, for example. I really wanted to give it 3.5 stars.In the end, I would say use the Karcher if you have a lot of flat area with a lack of big twigs to pick up and you want a clean sweep (a garage floor would be good). But if you want an easier to push and guide sweeper that can pick up bigger and more debris, but not do it as cleanly, the Hoover might be better. I'm luck to have both, so I can switch between the two depending on the job.
B000ORYO4W Karcher's a great company. I like their products. This one is targeted to people who want to sweep concrete, as on sidewalks, driveways, and garages. The compartment that holds the debris isn't very big, so it won't hold a huge amount of leaves, etc. However, it is easy to maneuver and seems to be built well. If you are SERIOUSLY SERIOUS about keeping the concrete around your house fastidiously clean, this may be the right machine for you.
B000ORYO4W This sweeper was very easy to assemble. (The assembly instructions had no words, just diagrams.)The sweeping area is large. It's about 26 inches across (from the outside edges of the round brushes). The sweeper is very easy to maneuver and make turns. it has a cylindrical brush at the back of the unit and 2 round brushes at the front. It is not perfect at picking up debris, but I prefer this over the loud blower that we usually use to clean up the driveway.I like that the handles fold down to make it more compact for storage.
B000ORYO4W I got this push sweeper to do my walkways and driveway, because I hate carrying the leaf blower around, it gets very heavy after a while. So I started with my driveway, because now that the warmer weather is here, I wanted to sweep up all the dirt and salt from the snow, and this sweeper did a great job with that, but the compartment is kind of small, so it doesn't hold a whole lot, and I found myself emptying it constantly. However, it is very easy to put together, and very easy to push along the driveway and walkway. The good thing about this is that I can push it, and not have to carry anything. It does a great job with picking up debris, it's just the emptying it constantly that is bothersome. I feel like this should be geared towards the older generation that wants to clean their own walkways and driveways, but don't want to carry around a leaf blower. Or even towards people that have back problems, because you can lean on it while your pushing it. I just wish it had a bigger compartment so I don't have to keep emptying it.
B000ORYO4W It was quick and easy to assemble.  It is a cinch to push. It picks up all the debris. I use it on my sidewalks, patios, and my messy garage floor.
B000ORYO4W This sweeper is better than a broom in some ways, and not better in other ways.When it's better than a broom...After running my lawn edger, my sidewalks are full of grass clippings that I would rather not blow back onto the lawn to turn brown and ugly. Running this sweeper on my long sidewalks is much better than using a broom. It does a good job of collecting the clippings and saves my hands from blisters.When it's not better than a broom...Tight areas such as the garage.When the grass or leaves are wet.If there are clumps of soil.Mostly, I'd say it's better. I'm glad I have it simply for the clean-up after edging. It's worth it for me just for that.
B000OV8OTY Sticky Stakes successfully wooed and killed tiny gnats growing in my potted plants.  Although the view of used Sticky Stakes is not pleasant, the work is done.  I highly recommend this product.
B000OV8OTY Works amazing.  Attracts fruit flies and fungus gnats.  However, know that this is really only a &#34;band-aid&#34; to your problem and may not solve your problem with one or two applications.  If you have fruit flies, the root of the problem will probably be left over food somewhere, check dishwasher, under the counter, take the garbage out more frequently.  If you have fungus gnats, it will most likely be moist environments and decaying plant matter, i.e. stop watering your plants so frequently.
B000OV8OTY I had a big problem with nats and this did the trick for me it took about a month but it worked like a charm.
B000OV8OTY We were having trouble with white flies and other insects that were killing our tomatoes and other potted plants, This little trap catches them easily and since we do not like insecticides, it is part of 
B000OV8OTY These work well for helping control the mass populations of fungus gnats that seem to breed in the potting soil of my houseplants. The only problem with them is there is no good way to peel the backing off and stick the paper into the holders without getting the sticky residue on your fingers. I've tried several different techniques but I always end up getting my fingers all tacky and it is hard to get off even with soap and water.
B000OV8OTY These work great.  You stick them on little spikes, (if you can get them off of your fingers) and the little insects stick to them.
B000OWF7YI WOW!  Whenever I have trouble growing a plant, I have to look absolutely *no* further than Miracle Gro.  By the next day (assuming it's a sunny warm day) the wilted leaves and stems are guaranteed to look MUCH healthier and beautiful by simply adding only a touch of Miracle Gro.  No matter WHAT kind of plant it is, this stuff seriously works amazingly well.  I can't recommend it highly enough!  Just last week my tomato and pepper plants were looking ill for example, and Miracle Gro completely gave those plants the refreshment and reinvigoration they so desperately needed, haha.  What a great way to help any plant that's looking wilted and weak.  Get ready for the surprise of your life!
B000OWF7YI this is another great buy , I use this in my garden all summer an my garden is the biggest an best out of my whole neighborhood please buy this if you have a garden or planting one it works
B000OWF7YI I have a container vegetable garden each summer for years since I don't have space for a garden in ground.  I have relied on Miracle-Gro for years to feed and fertilize my container grown vegetables.  Easy and convenient to use... just dissolve in water and feed to your plants every 7-14 days.  You would be amazed how many vegetables- peppers, cucumbers, eggplant, tomatoes and the like you can grow in a few pots on your deck or patio.  Also great for your houseplants.
B000OWF7YI You can't go wrong with miracle-geo for annuals and perennials. Feed the as directed and you will have healthy plants. Am I selling the product, no! However I am a horticulturist and know plants well. At the same time I would not use this on my vegetables because it is a chemical. Again, good for annuals and perennials.
B000OWF7YI Which I found somewhat confusing, especially when I wanted to use it in a non-Miracle-Gro hose-end sprayer. Eventually I gave up on the sprayer and went back to measuring two tablespoons per two gallons of water. It's hard to beat Miracle-Gro.
B000OWF7YI I have read and been following all the reviews of this product so far. So far this product is working wonders on my garden, it is one of the ingredients I am using this year for a strong healthy garden. I am using this product for all my vegetables and flowers. I have 14 different varieties of corn, I have 12 different varieties of carrots, I have 94 tomato plants of different varieties, I have broccoli and I have cabbage, peppers sweat and hot, I have cabbage and herbs, peas and beans, watermelon strawberries and canalope, I have onions and a lot of other things and so far everything is growing big and strong. I am using one package a week it comes with eight packages and I mix it with water and keep it in a water sprayer. Do not dump right on plants and do not let the blue sit on the plants in powder form. us as directed will do just fine. I also used cow manuer in the ground before I planted and I make sure to water every day unless it is raining outside. But I do like this product and I do keep pictures and videos from day to day as to compare the different years to see what works and so far this product is working and doing a great job. I have very healthy plants that are bigger then even I expected.
B000OWF7YI This works great to feed all my potted plants and hanging baskets. Just a tablespoon or two in each can of water and I can be sure my plants will be well fed. Buying the large size is way more economical too.
B000OWF7YI This has got to be the biggest box of Miracle Grow plant food ever.  When you get it, you'll be so happy!  It will last forever.  I use it on my potted fruit trees, in my sprayer, too.  Don't buy it anymore at the grocery store or home warehouse.  I can't believe the price!
B000OWF7YI I really wasn't expecting the growth for my Lilac bush. It exploded. A few days later, I looked and the thing was all over the place. Pruning time for sure.Picea abies 'Hillside Upright' got lots of bright, new growth as well. Hemlocks are happy. Just fed baby boxwoods yesterday and they already seemed to grow noticeably.
B000OWF7YI Miracle-Gro has always been good and I got this because of the price and convenience. All one has to do is put one of the packets the box contains  into the Miracle-Gro Sprayer (Miracle-Gro 100410 Garden Feeder) and one can feed the lilacs and everything else in sight in a relatively short time.
B000OWF7YI I bought this for my house plants and it's more than I'll ever need.  The tub is huge, and all I need is a little tiny scoop (it comes with the scoop) in a bucket of water.  This can also be used with the Miracle-Gro garden feeder, which is actually a more appropriate use for this given the bulk size of the container.I have a tendency to neglect my plants, just water them now and then so they don't die.  Every so often, I decide I'd better take better care of them and start feeding them Miracle-Gro.  They start greening up the very next day.  What a difference.  I love how they look when I feed them Miracle-Gro.
B000OWF7YI I just bought the same 10 pound box for 17.88 at the local Home Depot.I've been using the granular Miracle Grow for 30 years or so.  It works well.  You can expect most plants to show improvement after about 10 days.COMPARISON TO MIRACLE GROW LIQUID FERTILIZER.As others have noted regarding the soluble fertilizer feeder (used with the granular fertilizer), the feeder it is erratic.  If you don't empty the container and allow it to dry after every use, it can clog up internally and will cease to deliver fertilizer.  The Liquid Miracle Grow system has exactly the same problems (in my experience, worse), and is the fertilizer is more expensive.OTHER CONCERNS> Sometimes you get a bright blue stream, and a few seconds later, a colorless stream (presumably containing less fertilizer).> A different situation is when a few minutes of watering, the solution is considerably less blue.  What happens is that the blue pigment is more soluble than other components of the fertilizer, but the blue pigment itself is probably not an essential component of the fertilizer.  As long as there is at least a teaspoon of undissolved fertilizer in the container, the feeder is still probably delivering full-strength fertilizer solution.TIPS ON USE:Fill about half (not more than half) the container with water.  Pour in the dry fertilizer---much of it will dissolve instantly as it hits the water, making room for the rest of the bag.  Add water as necessary to fill the container.  Screw the sprayer onto the container.  Shake (and turn upside down) to mix.  The first several minutes will be very rich, so use it where you need the most fertilizer.  Swirl the container occassionally as you water to encourage the undesolved fertilizer to dissolve.  Concentrate on spraying the leaves, not the soil---the soil will get enough dripping from the leaves.When there gets to be only a teaspoon of undesolved fertilizer in the container, consider it \"used up\".  You can continue to water, but don't assume that you are applying fertilizer.  When you are nearly done, turn the container upside down.  That will empty the container, including any undesolved fertilizer, so the fertilizer stream can be rich, so spray it where it is needed.  Water with the container upside down for 30 seconds or so after the container is empty to rinse out the internal passageways.  Ideally, you should take the sprayer off the hose, and open it so that the sprayer and container and dry out fully.FEEDING SCHEDULEA good soaking will provide your plants with all the nutrients they need for a 2-week growth spirt.  Beware though that the solubility of Miracle Grow is a mixed-blesssing, if you feed your garden in the morning, an afternoon shower can wash all the Miracle Grow away before your plants have a chance to absorb most of the nutrients.  So, I suggest using Miracle Grow at least once-a-week in the spring when your plants are growing rapidly.  Later in the summer, when growth slows and rain is frequent, reduce the feeding schedule to one every two to four weeks.  Toward the Fall, a maintenance feeding once a month may be advisable.  Most professional gardeners discourage Fall feeding, on the theory that dormancy should be encouraged to avoid frost damage.  Depending on your situation, your feeding schedule might be different.  Here in tropical South Florida, the dry season sets-in in the Fall and the plants come out of their Summer torpor, so that's when I step-up my feeding schedule.  If your Springs are cool and misty---once every two weeks may be adequate. In the northeastern States, I suspect that weekly feeding all Summer long would be desirable.FOLIAR FEEDINGPart of the whole point of Miracle Grow is foliar feeding---that plants will absorb nutrients through their leaves faster than via their roots---but the leaves can only absorb a little at a time.  So foliar feeding needs to be light and frequent.  Light frequent foliar feeding (even daily) is most effective in which it rains frequently during the growing season, washing nutrients out of the upper soil layer.  Orchids are best feed sprayed daily with a weak foliar solution.DIFFERENT SOLUTIONS FOR DIFFERENT PROBLEMSDespite all the shortcomings of Miracle-grow feeders, they remain the best solution for fertilizing home vegetable or flower gardens.  Trees, hedges, and lawns are best feed inexpensive dry granular 10-10-10 fertilizer, well watered in.  Orchids and delicate indoor flowers are best sprayed (with a pump-up or squeeze bottle sprayer) with a weak solution (1 teaspoon/gallon) of liquid Miracle Grow.  New plants are best started with slow-release fertilizer pellets mixed in with the soil.
B000OWF97S have a couple different seeds planted already. One has already popped up. Not sure if that's due to the dirt, but i'm happy.
B000OWF97S This seed starting potting soil is great for seeds and for rooting cuttings.  It is light and airy and roots can develop nicely.  Plant seedlings need air to grow properly.  It is clean, sterile and without fungus.  Fungus can cause damping off disease which usually kills the plant.  I would recommend this mix.
B000OWF97S If you like using Jiffy-Mix seed starting mix, comparison shop.  Even your local home center probably has it available cheaper.
B000OWF97S The price is great but found this easy to use and my plants doing great. So glad I got it.
B000OWF97S I keep herbs in my kitchen year round and this soil works very well for me. I start seeds in the little Jiffy wafers and set them in a larger container of the starting mix. I use grow lights because I don't have good light in my kitchen. This winter I am adding some wonderful pepper plants I am starting now.I'll trasfer them to 4 inch pots, keep them under the lights until Spring and set out the plants, along with tomatoes I'll start later. It is very nice and easy to work with this soil. It is light and holds moisture very well. I have good luck with it.
B000P0DK1Q BROKE
B000P0DK1Q + Does the job, mixes feed decently with water if you don't tilt/shake it around too much.- Very on/off trigger, wish it was more progressive or had a light setting for smaller plants.  Seems like it's made for large coverage and or large plant watering.-Leaks slightly in a couple areas, around the head and somewhere around the trigger, but not terrible.Overall, glad I got it, does the job.
B000P0DK1Q I bought this not for the fertilizer that comes with it I use that regularly anyway and have been using the fertilizer this review is not about the fertilizer I love there fertilizer and usually I love all there products however the Garden feeder I am not impressed with and there are cheaper and better feeders on the market. I will list by number the things I found wrong with this particular feeder.1.  Pressure is not very good on any of the settings.2.  Dispenses product unevenly3.  Dispenses product to fast or to slow or not at all4.  Have to turn upside down at times to get product to come out even after it is mixed really well5.  The setting spin on the front the dial does more harm then good at letting the water out in a certain way6.  No hose or tube inside the bottle or bowl area to pull product through everything is based on how much water is in bowl.Ok to be fair these are the positives1.  Light weight2.  Arrived on time3.  Does come with Miracle product inside of it ready to go.4.  The water shut off Does work ok5.  The product shut off to allow only water to get through works OK also.As I said I love and I use Miracle grow however I am not at all impressed with this dispenser and or there liquid dispenser. For a company that puts so much hard work into a great product to help plants grow you would think they would put more effort and ideas into how to dispense the product onto the plants and not sell cheap stuff at a higher price.Two stars because it showed up early and I like that that is one star, it was packaged well and arrived brand new, that is two stars. Did come with product inside that I love and it does not leak and it did put the product onto my garden even if I did not like the way it did it so that is the third star.I finally had to downgrade this to a two star, wow I really do not like this product. It leaks now and it is not that old, does not dispense evenly, I tried my best at giving it time and seeing if I would like it but I do not.Hope this helps anyone looking.
B000P0DK1Q I just used it again this afternoon. It is simple, durable, and does the job remarkably well when used with the ready-made packets in Scotts Company Miracle Gro All Purpose Plant Food and Miracle-Gro 1001832 Lawn Food Box, 5-Pound container. I just noticed Miracle-Gro is part of the Scotts company which explains much. Also, the price is right--I'd actually pay a little more for the sprayer and food.
B000P0DK1Q This review applies to ALL Miracle-Gro brand fertilizer-feeders, includingMiracle-Gro 100410 Lawn and Garden FeederMiracle-Gro 101411 LiquaFeed Starter KitMiracle-Gro 101411 LiquaFeed All Purpose Plant Feeding SystemandMiracle-Gro 100511 LiquaFeed Advance Starter KitI totally agree with ALL of you who have posted on the \"rip-off\" index of these products. My \"other half\" bought these one of each type at local home improvement warehouse on two different occasions thinking how easy it would be to use. She did not realize how EXPENSIVE it would be for the LiquaFeed Kits, it just looked EASY. Not only are the refill cartridges costly, the things LEAK, don't dispense evenly and is basically garbage! (Maybe she has learned on 2nd time around, then again ... )Miracle-Gro bulk granular water soluble fertilizers of various types are great! I have never burned any plants with them (see note below) and have healthy excellent looking flowers, plants and few veggies. But Miracle-Gro equipment is JUNK, including this item and Miracle Gro Lawn & Garden Feeder Miracle-Gro 100410 Lawn and Garden Feeder.  They are made of BRITTLE plastic, as I stated LEAK, do not mix & dispense fertilizer well, and break easily.AVOID these products.( NOTE: I do apply in cool of morning or after sunset here in HOT central Texas, and after going around fertilizing ALL plants, come back and \"mist off\" any fertilizer that may still be too concentrated on leaves and water plants. )
B000P0DK1Q This carries the Miracle-Gro name, so I expected it to be good stuff, in spite of the low price.  It does work well, but my water pressure blew out the first one I bought (locally), so I had to get a pressure-reducing coupler--not a big deal--and now this sprayer works fine.
B000P0FHQ2 STARTED GROWING CLOVER?
B000P0FHQ2 This lawn food has worked great bringing my lawn back to life. after getting the weeds under control with a different product, this fertilizer has brought back the lush green color my lawn should have! As others have noted though, it takes many applications before you see the results and often you can find this stuff much cheaper in your local brick and mortar stores. I have found it for about 9 bucks at my local walmart.
B000P0FHQ2 If you get this and the sprayer (Miracle-Gro 100410 Garden Feeder, Ready-to-Use Solution, 1-Pound) you can do your whole lawn in just a few minutes with excellent results. This container has 4 packets. You open the durable, extremely simple and easy-to-use sprayer, put in one packet, and spray. No ratios, no guesswork, no nothing but pleasant results. I believe I love the darn things.... The lawn does, anyway.
B000P0FHQ2 My front yard has only a couple inches of top soil covering crappy clay. It literally died last year in a horrible heat wave and drought, and did not come back this Spring. I dethatched and replanted it. After the new grass germinated and was a few weeks old, I applied this lawn food generously with a sprayer.One month later, I have a thick, beautiful, dark green lawn. It doesn't take a rocket scientist to conclude that the grass LOVED this product. I'll have to wait and see how long it stays happy, but I wouldn't hesitate to buy this again.
B000P0FHQ2 This product seems to be very effective in &#34;greening up&#34; the lawn, and it is certainly easy to apply.  HOWEVER, I must comment on the Miracle-Gro  sprayer I purchased to apply the lawn food (there are very few sprayers which will accept a granular product and dilute it in the sprayer).  I went through two of them before--both started leaking profusely out the business-end of the sprayer the first time I used them.  It finally dawned on me that my water pressure was too high for the sprayer (100 psi), and, upon disassembling one of the units, I discovered that a small O-ring in the valve had been displaced by the pressure.  I purchased a pressure-reducing adapter (from Amazon) which lowered the pressure and solved the problem.  I had to buy a third sprayer and it worked just fine.  I also re-glued the one I had disassembled, and now IT works well, also.
B000P1TB9K I think this Aspects 182 Super Dome Humbrella for Bird feeders by Aspects is about double the price I would have liked to pay, but this Humbrella Dome for Bird Feeder is just what I need to keep the squirrels out of my feeder. The price of feed saved will pay for it over one season and I won't have to cringe when I look out and see one of the little fuzzy tails hanging upside down from my feeder. Works well and is a sound product which offers: Classic styling for easy cleaning and refilling: Strong polycarbonate construction is leak proof and drip resistant and has a Bee Resistant design and built-in ant moat.
B000P1TB9K I bought this to add to my squirrel proof feeder (other review). Wish I had bought it from day 1 because the squirrels had already chewed parts of that feeder, and this prevents squirrels from sliding onto ANY feeder....they slip right off.....clear plastic has not discolored and does its job. Birds linger on the feeder when it's raining since they keep dry....
B000P1TB9K Squirrels learned in a few days how to get around this.  I wasted my money but you don't have to.
B000P1TB9K A good squirrel baffle actually serves two purposes being directly over a feeder.  It hopefully keeps the pesky varmints that its designed to deter away, and it also serves as a roof in keeping rain and whatnot away from the seed portals and helps them stay dry.  There are people that buy baffles as protection from the weather even if they are fortunate enough not to be bothered by squirrels.  The Aspects dome is certainly big enough to do both jobs.  But it is no more effective than any other baffle of the same size and design that is much cheaper.  If one sets out to buy a baffle just about anywhere of the dome variety, they will get a swift and severe education as to how expensive they are.  You will come to believe that all baffles must have uranium in them somewhere to be so overpriced.  The only exception to that rule that I have come across is the dome that can be found at a local Tractor Supply company, or at the Tractor Supply website.  They sell a full 15\" gray plastic dome squirrel baffle for the unbelievable price of only $8.00.  (At the time of this writing.  It my be a little more now, but will forever be far cheaper than the Aspects).  They are the same size as the Aspects and have the same double hook system.  And they also come with an attachment for mounting the baffle on a pole if that serves your needs. They are so cheap and effective I ordered 6 of them at once for all my feeders.  The only difference between the two is the Tractor Supply baffle is a solid gray instead of clear.  Something I actually prefer since the clear ones only look clear for the first couple of Weeks anyway.  From that time on they are never clear again.  If you're in the market for a baffle, especially for more than one, forget this horrendously overpriced Aspects model and check out the squirrel baffles at Tractor Supply company.  You will be most pleased I believe... : )
B000P1TB9K Very well made, not \"cheap, thin, brittle plastic\".  Quite attractive, actually....but most importantly, keeps those annoying tree rats (squirrels) out of my bird feeders.
B000P1TB9K This is one of my favorite domes because it is 18 inches in diameter. (Wide domes offer more protection.) The polycarbonate is thick and the hangers are heavy duty. It's durable. My only complaint is that the top screw hook is too long. Feeders need to be high enough off the ground so that feeding birds are safe from cats.This particular dome works best on feeders that have a ring or very short hook on top. A ring or  short hook allows the dome to almost rest on top of the feeder, and that's the way it protects the birds and seeds. In the photo displayed in this listing, the feeder has a tall bail for hanging. The dome hooks on the bail. But see how this makes the dome sit WAY above the feeder? That's not good because it exposes both the birds and seed ports to rain and snow. This style feeder needs the Aspects 351 Super Tube Top II or any dome that has a slit across the top that is wide enough to go over a bail in a way that the dome rests directly on top o the feeder. Look at the Aspects 351 Super Tube Top II and you'll see what I mean. Whatever you buy, make sure that the opening at the top of the dome will fit the hook, eye or bail on your feeder.
B000P1TB9K We have lots of squirrels and I have fought many the battle to save my feeders.  Purchased this as my last attempt before just giving in and giving up on feeders.  This is a miracle!  They all have tried to get to several different styles of feeders under this dome and NONE have made it.  They have given up and now my feeder is safe and full for the birds.  Birds were a bit confused at first since it is quite large, but only took a few days and now they're loving it as well.
B000P1TB9K I live in Florida, a state that experiences almost daily monsoon like weather every day during the summer, with horizontal rain being common at least a few times a week. I purchased my first as a rain guard to keep my feeder dry.The reason it looks silly is because I have various Brome Bird Feeders which are quite long (12 to 18&#34;) and while the dome is super wide, it doesn't look like it will do anything. Then the rain will begin, my Florida wide gutters straining to handle the rain, but the dome &#34;appears&#34; to be blocking the rain. Immediately after the rain stop, I stick my fingers into each port to test the dampness of the seeds. To my surprise, they were fully dry. I tested this on one of our rainiest summers. Note - I do take my bird feeders down during severe hurricanes, but it did handle a record breaking 22&#34; of water in a 24 hour time period.When I purchased future bird feeder, I ordered an additional super dome. Combing the cost of this pricey dome plus a good feeder (Brome in my case), it can really hurt one's pocket book,  but it is hard to argue with success - on an almost daily basis I see feeding: 3 red bellied woodpeckers, 4 cardinals, 40 golden finches, 2 bluejays, and the random mocking bird or robin.
B000P1TB9K Compare this to the Tube Top Dome, 12&#34; Clear version available here on Amazon.  Notice how the handle goes through the dome on that one, compared to attaching to a hook on this one.  The closer your feeder is to the dome, the better it will be protected.  Just an observation that may help you with your selection process.
B000P71GLU I love this thing.  Without bending over I can make holes in seconds even in hard packed dirt, then just plug in the little plants and you're done.  I have lots of tree roots to contend with and with this tool, I know right away if the spot I've picked is suitable or if a large root lurks below the surface and I should move my hole a couple of inches.  The hole this unit makes is ideal for the small plants in flat trays--and of course, bulbs.  For larger sized plants, I can make several holes right together or just wiggle the auger to enlarge the cavity and so far have been able to make holes for plants in pots up to 3\" pretty easily.  I wish I'd discovered this thing years ago.  It makes spring planting soooo much easier.
B000P71GLU I have just about worn out the auger that I purchased here.  I started out planting bulbs.  Then found it was an easy was to collect soil samples several inched deep in untilled soil, was good to drill holes for installing deep tree watering ports and turning my compost pile.  It has worked for me in loose/loamy soil, southern red clay and rocky southern red clay.  It has done the job in all (using an 18 v drill).Advice:  If drilling into moist clay soil, it tends to drill straight down like a screw.  I have to hold it back to auger the damp clay out of the hole.After hundreds of holes, the lower half has worn to a cone but still works well.
B000P71GLU I had only one use for this digger and that was to help aerate the yard.  Red clay compacts easily and makes grass growing close to impossible without aeration.  Renting those big bulky machines is O.K. but I wanted something like this and this is fantastic.May 17, 2012 added:  Please add young trees to the list of Bye, Byes.  About now the Red Bud Trees have started growing to about 1' to 2' and they can really take hold in the soil.  I attacked them with the Yard Butler and by golly they are gone with a few turns and NO bending or backaches.  I continue to be delighted with this tool and it is always ready to use.The length (30\") reduces the need to bend down.  The hole diameter is better than the smaller types and works beautifully in most soils.  Rocks are a nag and depending on the torque set on the drill the Yard Butler will stop when they are too thick or not worthy of messing with the drill's abilities.  If the rock is too large perhaps digging it out would be more satisfactory.  My attitude is dig a hole as deep as it can go and the rest will take care of itself.  My initial trip at drilling the yard centered on bare spots and I drilled holes about 2\" to 3\" apart to cover the hole.  Return trips included inspections to find other weak grass spots with the objective of reducing the compaction.  So far so good.  Not much apparent wear on the drill yet.The best part of this gem is the \"weed attacker\" aspects.  Put the point on the crown of the weed and turn the drill on.  The tool literally winds the weed onto the tool and all I have to do is take the weed off the tool.  Gone are the roots and the weeds.  So far I have only used this on mostly chick weed and one or two dandelions.  Earlier applications of weed killer eliminated most of the dandelions but like MacArthur, they will return.Great tool for exactly what it is to be used for.  Thanks for making my life a little easier.
B000P71GLU I have the shorter version of this roto digger, but needed the extra length for my back, what a great back saver this is. I use this for annuals also so I don't have to bend so much. Love, Love, Love.
B000P71GLU I got this to do some spot holes in my rather hard packed lawn and it is perfect. I use it to make &#34;spot&#34; areas to overseed grass,I drill a series of shallow holes close together, spread the seed, the cover over.a lot eaiser than doing the whole lawn.note that you will need a 3/8 inch drill.Mine has an adjustable torque, so I can set it and if the drill gets bogged down, it just will stop, then I can reset and start again.
B000P71GLU With almost 400 bulbs and perennials to plant I knew my spade would not hold up (or my back).  Popping this little guy on the end of my drill made the job a breeze.  Be careful to set your clutch low enough that you don't twist your wrist off should it hit a rock or hard spot.  400 holes and it still digs like it did on the very first hole.  This is one of my better purchases this year; really don't know why on earth I hand dug holes when for under 15 bucks I could have saved myself the trouble.  If you're a gardener, and don't have one -- buy this now.  Your only regret will be that you didn't get one sooner.
B000P7345G This is the only MG fert with Magnesium in the mix natively. It really does a good number as a General Purpose Fert for anything that likes a balanced diet ... Oh and Tomatoes really do like this one over the 24-8-16 mix which will just leave them flowering into October ... IHMO. ( Too much N compared to P and K you see, for a matto to go all the way. 18-20-21 is about perfect. )
B000P7345G This is the best fertilizer to supplement your container grown tomatoes.  Dissolve in water and feed every 7-14 days.  Special formula designed for tomatoes.  Contains Magnesium which helps prevent blossum end rot in tomatoes.
B000P7345G Yes, I know that too much watering makes your tomatoes a bit dull tasting.  So, I knew better than to over-water.  But, the fruit was just not quite as tasty as other years.  We routinely apply the Miracle Gro liquid fertilizer for vegetables, but something was missing.  So, I tried this fertilizer, and there was a marked improvement in taste.  Great product!  I just wish they made this in the bottled form that screws into the sprayer they sell for attaching to a hose.  It would be so much easier.  Maybe next year....
B000P7345G I have used Miracle Grow all year and my yields for all veggies and tomatoes are very high and the growth of my tomatoes is unbelievalbly big.
B000P7345G Plant food was shipped quickly, received in good order. If it is as good as Miracle Gro was in the past, I should have some outstanding plants and tomatoes. Good idea to put the food in &#34;ready to install packets&#34; in the sprayer. If you don' have the sprayer,just use one tablespoon per gallon of water and mix. Easy, huh? When feeding, be sure to wet the leaves as well as around the plant, since tomatoes absorb the nutrients through both areas.
B000P7345G This is a God send for all plants. It nourishes even dieing plants back to life. I would but it again.
B000P7345G REVISION: Below I said to stop using Nitrogen later in the season, but I have had to adapt that recommendation.  Over the last two years, early blight has stricken tomatoes nation wide, including places where it was relatively rare like New England.  Entire farms have been wiped out, especially organic farms.Early blight can be treated with a fungicide, but you need new stem and leaf growth to compensate for the leaves and stems lost to blight.  You will have a smaller crop at the end, but losing the plant will result in many fewer tomatoes.I found after several of my plants succumed to blight (no tomatoes, a couple of branches of leaves, etc.) that providing the rest a good dose of late season nitrogen helped them enormously.So, I would suggest now, until the early blight has run its course (maybe never) you should use Miracle Grow Tomato Plant Fool all season and don't try to overinduce the flowering and yield of your tomatoe plants.  Two live healthy plants with average yield are way better than one dead one killed off by blight.Watch for youtubegarden.com, for more info.--------------------------------------------------I always plant with manure (raked into the soil, about one 25 pound bag of dehydrated manure per 10 plants, about 2 feet apart and spaced 3 feet per row) and some fresh garden top soil (just placed in the hole where the plant is, not throughout the garden).If you remember, it is good to mix in lime as well about a month or so before you put the tomatoes in the ground.  It helps by providing calcium to the plants and helps prevent blossom end rot.  Although, I rarely have had any problem with that here, it can depend on your soil, so better safe than sorry.  If you forget, don't worry, things will work fine without it for the most part.I plant the tomatoes deep, relative to the size of the plant.  1/3 down into the soil or more depending on the size.  Before I do I place fresh garden top soil in the hole and water it.  Then I place the plant firmly in the muddy mixture and surround it with more fresh garden top soil.  I have not found that different brands of gardening soil are better, so any cheap bag at your local gardening shop will do.  I have never lost a plant doing this.  People talk about other ideas like using 80 degree water to water the plants or using special techniques to keep from hurting the plants.  But I have never used any technique like this.  Hose water is fine as is rain water.I do not fertilize my tomatoes until a couple of weeks have passed and they have rooted and grown a bit.  I let the manure, new garden soil and lime do the job.After that, every two weeks, I apply Miracle Gro, and when I do, the plants are more vigorous, grow faster and I have fewer problems with the plants such as discolorations of the leaves or bug infestations.  I have heard numerous folks say to use less or more than the directions, but you know, the 1 Table Spoon per Gallon of water always has worked for me.  About a gallon for every three plants when they are young.  A bit more when they get to be 2 feet or more.  The box does twenty plants for the period of the season I use it.I use a bucket or watering can for mixing.  I have not had good luck with the automatic dispensers attach to the end of the hose and it seems to waste fertilizer.  But your mileage may vary.When the plants first start to show fruit and have reached about 3 feet, I stop using Miracle Gro and switch to a no-nitrogen fertilizer.  I find that by the time the plants are 3 feet tall, their root growth is fantastic and their leaf production is strong, so I want to focus on flowering and fruit production.  Something that reads 0-10-10 or even higher is fine.  Just absolutely no nitrogen.I have tried other fertilizers for my plants.  Nothing has worked better than Miracle Gro and some brands seemed to not work at all.  I have always been satisfied with Miracle Gro and stick to it for great tomatoes and strong plants.
B000P7345G Buying from Amazon with prime has really made shopping at local stores far and few between. I order this product from Amazon every year. This stuff will help and make you look like a person with a real green thumb for gardening. Just use one table spoon per gallon of water and pour. Use it every two weeks. You will be blown away how your tomato plants will blossom and grow. I didn't use it on two of the same kind of plants to see if I could tell the difference. Trust me on this..... Those two were half the size as the plants I used this on. So I know this product works better than it says it does. Try it and you will be amazed how good it honestly really works!!!
B000P7345G I like this because I can mix up a batch and use it any way I want. Spray, soak or dunk this is easy to use.  You don't need much of it so the 3lb bag will be in use next year too.  I'll buy more when this runs out, in a year or two. You know the only way I dont use this is in the hose sprayer it's made for.  I don't think it would last as long burning a bag that way.
B000P7345G I used this on my tomato plants and they seem to respond well to this treatment. You have to use it every week, but it doesn't take much and with last me this season.
B000P7FVX4 Bought this to use as a roof sunshade and a privacy shade on a side of the deck close to our neighbors house. Doubled up it functions *alright* as a privacy shade, and certainly more economic then any other options. As a sunshade for a roof you couldn't ask for more. It really does not reduce light visibility that much and you get the hot sun off of you. You can buy clips and fasteners for it from plenty of places, I just went with wood staples and they work great - no tears/rips or any issues otherwise. All in all a great product that I would recommend.
B000P7FVX4 This stuff is great.I installed some on top of my pergola.  I simply nailed the cloth into the boards with several dozen roofing nails.  We've had severe weather, hail, drought, and the fabric looks exactly as it did when I installed it.It definitely provides effective protection from the sun, though I did wind up modifying the design of the pergola to better position more fabric in the best spots.The price is hard to beat, and the stuff is forgiving and easy to work with.
B000P7FVX4 Easy to cut (minimal fraying), easy to sew (fold over once and stitch), and the selvedge edge is bound neatly.This 64-70% shade version is great for shading vegetable beds in very hot summer sun.  I attached it to my PVC shade structures with PVC grip clamps and they hold onto the fabric marvelously.
B000P7FVX4 good quality... holding up good so far. will update later if anything happens. i want more of this but at a cheaper price. i'm glad i bought it when i did.
B000P7FVX4 I have a deck with a high roof that at times in the day produces a lot of glare.  Shades work well for the 8 feet between a support beam and the deck floor.  We cut this to fit the top triangle above the support beam.  It does an excellent job of blocking the sun.  We have stapled it into place.  It is porous enough to allow for excellent air flow and has not torn or come lose even on windy days.Very please with this product.  I also have deck shades by the same company and am thrilled with them as well.
B000P7FVX4 Maybe I should have bought the \"authorized\" hanging tools but I used grommets and the fabric is ripping at that point from the wind blowing.  I am concerned about making it more secure as I am not sure if it will rip more if it cant move or rip more if its whipping around.But I do like the look of the fabric and that I can still see out through the fabric.  I would buy it again but have to get a better way of securing it and/or not use it in a windy area (not sure where that would be considering its designed purpose).
B000P7FVX4 I got a roll to cover my small patio.  It blocks the sun well, is sturdy. It is for sure worth it to get this product.
B000P7FVX4 We cut to shape and installed on the underside of our lattice patio cover to further block the sun.  It does a fine job.  Wanted something easily removable when wisteria covers the top and provides natural shade.
B000P9URDQ I bought three different kinds of mouse traps for some mice that have found a way into our home. I set it up last night and sure enough shortly after I went to bed I heard the SNAP! Dead mouse. Unfortunately this trap is a pain in the butt to set. There is a little plastic hook that holds the metal spring down and it just doesnt want to stay. After playing with it for a while I manage to get it to hold but I do wish it was a bit easier to set.
B000P9URDQ These traps are really effective; you place a small amount of bait (I use peanut butter applied with a toothpick) in a little bait-cup, close the cover, and slowly move the set-lever back until it locks.  Unlike traditional spring-traps there is no way I can see that you would accidentally snap your finger, unless you have them sticking into the entrance.  Getting it to lock  can be a little tricky, you really do have to move the lever down slowly.I think the secret to these traps is the mouse has only one way to approach the bait, so he goes down the little hallway and is lined up head-first and SNAP!, no more mouse.  I've caught two mice in the same night with the same bait.Update 09/2012:  I've been through a few of these traps over the years, sometimes the trap is in a rarely-visted place and the dead mouse gets nasty by the time I find it so I just throw the whole trap away.  I see these traps have gotten cheaper but a couple of the new ones I bought have broken after 1 or 2 uses, a little plastic piece breaks and you can't set the trap.  I tried to fix it using Gorilla Glue but without success.  Hopefully this isn't a trend.
B000P9URDQ A feature of this trap is \"never have to touch a dead mouse!\"  I find that pretty pathetic, because if you can't go through the trouble of putting on a pair of gloves then... I won't go into that.  Yes this trap catches mice, but it also catches and kills chipmunks and other rodents that do not create problems for humans.  The trap uses a conventional spring set arm that crushes the animal quickly and is therefore more humane than other traps. The problem with this mechanism is that it can crush the animal into a mess.  Maybe some people would get a kick out of that, but I don't. The most selective and humane way to trap is to use a Havahart trap, then euthanize only the problem animals with ether (found as \"starting fluid\" in automotive stores).  Ether is a potent anesthetic which was used on humans in early medical procedures.  It's also extremely flammable so take great care.
B000P9URDQ We live on a large lot that borders a freeway.  Some years we have trouble with mice in the fall and no longer have any cats.  We used glue traps for years.  Although they work fairly well, you still have to actually kill the mouse once it's trapped.We won't use poisons for several reasons and don't want to use the old fashioned, open snap traps because they present a danger to our small dog and us.I ordered two of these traps, which arrived quickly.  One of them was defective, but the other has proven to be very efficient.  I wish we didn't need it at all, but it works very well and is reusable.You can dispose of the already dead mouse without ever having to touch it and easily reset the trap.
B000P9URDQ So far I have spent $50 on two electronic zapper traps that my mice managed to enter, eat the bait, and leave (sans zap) and; $30 on four of these traps which the mice have thus far simply ignored leaving the bait behind (peanut butter) along with some mouse poop left right nearby as an F/U to me letting me know they were there and that they weren't falling for my traps.My mice have no reason to suspect traps as I have thus far relied on my two cats to keep the house mouse free and it hasn't been an issue for years. That is if you don't count the occasional mouse corpse left diligently just outside the bedroom door for me to walk on half-asleep the morning after the kill...Then recently I started noticing mouse poop but no mouse corpses and assumed the cats were't keeping up their side of the deal. So, loving electronic toys, I got the expensive Thomas Edison style electrocution mouse traps which failed, followed by these which also failed. So I guess the little critters are smarter than I thought and the cats are back on Tuna.I gave it two stars instead of one because they appear well made for the money and I still think they look likely to do the trick if your mice are of the low IQ variety.In any case these are batting a zero so far but are still baited as are the zappers. Time to try something else.I promise to update this if they ever come through.UPDATE: A month and a half into this one of the D-Con's came through and I got a mouse using peanut butter.  Bumped these up to three stars.  Only three because I still have mice...Update#2: These traps = 4 kills - Zapper traps = 2 kills. I appear to be mouse free now. Cats are fired!
B000P9URDQ I've caught many mice with this trap. This is just the traditional trap with a cover so you don't have to see the dead body, just the tail. What else can I say? I've caught at least a dozen mice with this. Very occasionally the mouse will clean up the peanut butter without setting off the trap but I just bait it again. About 3 times, the mouse turned around and set it off facing out. I have no idea why a mouse would back into it, but the trap killed it all the same. The entry hole is pretty big so that it can catch some pretty big mice.
B000P9URDQ I bought two of these traps, and the first night, I caught a mouse.  I also purchased two other types of traps for comparison, and think I will continue to purchase these when I need to.  I love that you can set these with one hand.  When the mouse is caught, you don't have to see it, just lift up the flap, and push the lever to release the mouse into the garbage.  Then it is really easy to reset.  I am really excited to catch another mouse now!  Sadly it's been two weeks since I caught the first mouse, and I am beginning to think I only had one mouse. I highly doubt that, but I will be grateful if I only have one.
B000P9URDQ Didn't like it, returned it, it didn't work at all.  I trap mice all the time in the metal wire cages, and this caught nothing.  Sorry, charlie--useless to me.
B000P9URDQ I ordered 4 of these traps after I saw a little mouse run across the garage floor. I used a pea-sized dab of peanut better for bait, as recommended in the instructions, then set two in the garage along a wall and the other two in our basement storage area, where I noticed some mouse droppings earlier.The next morning the two traps in the garage each had a mouse - and today (the second morning) there was another mouse in one of the basement traps.It is sort of gross to see the mouse's hind-end sticking out of the trap, but I used a bag for each to pick them up and then tied it shut and took it outside to the trash. I know the instructions said the traps are reusable (which they are) but I guess I'm a wimp -- I'd rather order new ones (which I just did). But if you wanted to reuse the traps it is very easy to do so -- you can release the snap mechanism without touching the mouse.The only (very minor) thing was that three of the traps set on the first try but the last one was a little tricky - I had to repeatedly mash down the lever to get it to set. And then if I even bumped it the trap snapped shut - on a hair trigger. But I finally got it in place along a wall in the basement and set it (that is the one that caught the mouse last night).I also have 4 of the round-type of traps that are designed to close when a mouse enters -- you can't see the mouse if it's inside but will know one is in there because the spring-mechanism moves from \"set\" to \"caught.\" So far those haven't caught any mice  so looks like I'll stick with the product on this page. Glad to get rid of those mice.
B000P9URDQ The hook that holds the metal bar in place doesn't work on mine. I know that if I didn't have a defective trap, it would have probably worked... but who knows with my mouse. It's managed to set off but avoid 1 Snap-E trap and 3 ordinary d-Con wooden traps. I was hoping this would do the trick, as I've had to move the food in my cupboards and pantry twice and tape up any and all openings, no matter how small and it seems to be working. I guess I'll have to manage life with a mouse in my kitchen. I don't want to use poison because the mouse hides in places I can't get to and I don't want it's dead body stinking up my house.
B000P9URDQ I hate the idea that I have no choice than to kill, I tried the humane way for 5 years, but they are overunning my house, since I have chickens and mice are attracked to the feed etc.I bought several different types and the mice beat the trap and got away with the goods.  Not with this trap, I put it under the sink with some cheese I had left over and within ONE HOUR, no joke, I had a mouse, I was a little taken back to see his little legs and tail sticking out but I am sure he could not have suffered since this thing is quick.I will buy several more tomorrow now I can put them everywhere not being afraid it would hurt my dig or cat, yes I have a lazy cat. I had a terrier that brought me  mice on a regualr basis, she is gone now, guess that is why I have a problem.It is Oct.09 now and I am mouse free, I found their exit from the attic where they were making a home and making lots of noice. I placed the traps in their path under the sink.  This trap caught 14 mice in less than 2 weeks.  Unfortunately one was not killed and I feel bad about that, but he was not really hurt because he ran off outside. I also found a few in the garage.  Funny thing when you scare them away as long as you keep the traps open they will be afraid to come back, I think it is that way.
B000PBXESO We found the hummingbird feed very easy to set up. We mix our own sugar water and have lots of hummingbird visitors. We have enjoyed watching them as they use the feeder.
B000PBXESO With this feeder hanging outside my office window, I see hummers feeding on it all day long. It's easy to fill and hang, easy to take apart and clean, and the hummers can't get enough.Living in the southwest desert, the hummers around here have a particularly hard time finding fresh nectar sources throughout the year. It gets so hot here in the summer that the nectar in hummingbird feeders either ferments or completely dries up within 5-7 days. The feeders here need to be cleaned and filled with fresh nectar twice a week.With this feeder it's easy and painless to take down, clean and refill.The hanging hardware works well, everything seems to be fairly durable.I'm planning on ordering a second one soon, I could not be happier with the one I have.
B000PBXESO This is the best Hummingbird feeder I have ever purchased. I can actually fill it enough to leave it hanging for two weeks, even though I have more and more hummingbirds attending. The bottom has a built-in perch all the way around so the little guys can actually rest while they are drinking. What a concept! Very easy to fill and clean.
B000PBXESO I've got beautiful blown glass and antique glass bottle feeders I just adore, but none of them hold nearly as much nectar as this beast does.  Come the end of April, my swarm of hummers is back and hungry - I keep them all out and need to refill 5 feeders at least once per week.If your garden is heavily trafficked by humming birds, this feeder is great.  If not, the nectar may turn to vinegar before they finish it, so a smaller size or lower fill level might be better.  I never color the nectar (the red colorant chemicals can cause the laid eggs to be thinly shelled and easily broken).  The birds find the feeder by the bright red plastic dispensing bottom without complaint; no need to color the sugar-water.
B000PBXESO I bought 2 hummingbird feeders at the same time since the little cuties can be so aggressive. I bought 2 different brands. This one was my favorite at first as I liked the way it looked. However, its not going to hold up. The metal ring at the top is not attached in any way and the nectar bottle will fall through from time to time even though I don't even fill it half way. This has caused the plastic \"bowl\" at the bottom to break. This red plastic nectar holder is actually in 2 parts. One of the two pieces has broken slightly from all the falls to the ground. It is holding up for now...but will probably need to get tossed at the end of this season.If you're curious, the other feeder I purchased was this one: It is holding up much better...B00004RA8P
B000PBXESO This feeder isn't all designery like those made by Perky Pet, but hummingbirds seem to like it better, it cleans up reasonably well, and none of the materials are toxic to birds (no copper or zinc galvanization as seen on many other products).  There's no paint to peel off like has happened with the other brand, and the red color is what seems to attract hummers most reliably.
B000PBZFJK I have 3 feeders hanging on my deck - this is the &#34;go to&#34; one.  I don't know why, but I guess &#34;pretty&#34; has nothing to do with their choice!  Easy to clean, assemble.  No drips or spills.
B000PBZFJK These feeders are very well designed. I have 3 Best-1 feeders hanging outside my office window, I see hummers on them all day long. The feeders are easy to disassemble and clean, seem relatively durable (unless you drop them), and most importantly the hummers love them.I originally ordered and have been using the larger version of this feeder, theBest-1 32oz. Hummingbird Feeder. I was so happy with it that I decided to order two more.After trying the large 32oz. version I decided to go for the smaller 8oz. version, mainly because it gets so hot in the summer where I live. If I put the 32oz. feeder out full of nectar, it will ferment and go bad in just a few days, before the hummers can drink it all. The 8oz. version is exactly the same product but with a smaller bottle attached. The bases look identical and are the same size.The small bottle on the 8oz. version is easier to unscrew from the base, easier to clean, the hummers drink most or all of the nectar before it goes bad, and it's easier to see how much nectar is left in it.If you live in a cooler climate then the 32oz. version is probably a better choice because you can fill it up and leave it out longer, but if you live somewhere that gets hot enough that you have to change the nectar several times a week like I do, then these 8oz. bottles are the way to go.The hummers here in the southwest desert have a hard time finding fresh nectar in the summer, so it's really fun to set up a little sanctuary for them. These feeders are perfect for it.Hummingbird Nectar Mix======================For the nectar mix I am using 1 part sugar to 4 parts water, boiled then cooled. One drop of trace minerals added after the mix is cool. A great trace mineral to use isLiqumins ConcenTrace Trace Mineral Drops, Low Sodium, 8-Ounce Bottle.
B000PBZFJK Easy to clean and fill. I don't get a lot of hummingbirds but the ones I get are here year-round so I have 3 of these and they get plenty of use. I did have to order extra bases because some of them seem to break easily. The birds love having a place to perch as they feed.
B000PBZFJK I bought the one with the small bottle and refresh it twice a week, The birds love it. The ants love it too but it is a death trap for them. They tell me ants are high in protein?
B000PBZFJK This was my first hummingbird feeder that I have ever purchased.  Arrived as described, though it is smaller that I thought it would be.  Have already made food and have it hanging, just waiting for the birds!
B000PBZFJK I buy hummingbird feeders locally whenever there are end of season sales.  Six or seven hang out in our very large yard at any given time; we've gone through many different styles and brands.  Best-1 hummingbird feeders have held up the longest (7+ years) and seem to be the hummingbirds' favorite.  As a matter of fact, the only time one failed is when a raccoon tried to drink out of one, the feeder fell, and the glass bottle broke.  With any other, you'd have to throw the whole thing away.  No problem here--replacement parts are made and sold.These feeders can be found elsewhere at cheaper prices, and replacements for either the glass top or plastic bottom can be bought separately.  Look up Nottawa Wild Bird Supply (can be found online) in Indiana.  They sell this 8 oz. feeder for $8, the base replacement for $5, or the 8 oz. glass top for $3.  I stop in whenever I'm in the area--it's a birder's paradise.
B000PBZFJK The bottle is glass and I like that because glass clean easier than plastic.Haven't used it yet, but I like it because it's small and I got two of them so hummers have more to choose from
B000PGOON8 Given the cost of this unit, the water reservoir capacity, and the fact that it only fits certain types/sizes of pots, I think I'm better off just asking my neighbor to hit my fussier plants with some water from my hose if I'm going to be out of town for a week or more.
B000PGOON8 The instructions that come with the CobraCo Plant Sitter are terrible.  In order to make this product work, you must (1) fill the container with water (nothing else mixed in), (2) wet the ceramic cone, (3) fill the ceramic cone with water, (4) make sure the plastic tubing is at the bottom of the water container, (4) start the siphoning process, and (5) put the ceramic cone in the dirt up to the cap.The container is made for small rimmed pots only.  If you have a larger rimmed pot, you'll have to improvise or put the water container inside your pot.  The problem with putting the container inside of your pot is that the water will siphon out quicker than if hanging on the pot, so you'll need to monitor your plant to see if it is getting too much water.  The container is see-through, so you can eye-ball the water level easily, but it is made of plastic, so time will tell how durable it is.Overall, not a bad product.  An adjustable hanger would have been nice to have in order to use the system on different types of pots.
B000PGOON8 I tried this while out of town for six days and it did not seem to work. The soil was dry when I got back even though the plastic container was still full of water.Other reviewers have left tips that I should try. Maybe then it would work. But the system should work more simply than that; it is basically a water container and a wick. And it is not good-looking although it is not real ugly either.
B000PGOON8 The lid will not stay snapped shut, thus the suction needed to draw the water into the plant is not present.  Could not get it to deliver water to the planter.
B000PGOON8 The concept is a good one, however, it's a little bulky and ugly and will only work on certain pots.  The system is too big to work on anything less than 8\" tall.  If you have a decorative pot that has a thick rim (over 1\") or overly curved, this will not fit.  I would use this for plants if I was going to be away for a few weeks, but it isn't attractive enough to have on my pots year round.
B000PGOON8 I followed the instructions that accompanied this loser and the results were poor. The lid on the tank will not stay closed. I had planned to use this outside but without the lid staying shut this would be an excellent hangout for mosquitos so I left it outside for only about a week and a half. I dropped (pushed would be a better word) the \"hose\" through the hole in the lid. Instructions say insert it until the tip reaches the bottom. I pushed the entire \"hose\" through the hole and it never reached the bottom but remained suspended in the water about two thirds of the way down. The tank hangs on the side of the pot all lopsided and really looks as tacky as all getout. No water ever transferred from the tank to the flower pot during the week or so that I left it outside.Not sure where this was made although there is a USA address on the cardboard but it does not say \"manufactured in\". However I would not blame any manufacturer for not wanting to admit to making this butt-ugly and worthless recycling candidate.There has to be a much better offering of plant watering products than this. Look elsewhere for something that has at least a smidgeon of quality which this does not. Stay away from this - far, far away.
B000PGOON8 I have pretty much given up on the CobraCo 6000 Plant Sitter. The instructions that come with the plant are basically useless, leaving the user to try and figure out how to make this thing work. It seems simple enough. Fill the reservoir with water, connect the hose, and stick the watering thing in the dirt.But it isn't that simple. The water doesn't seem to flow on its own. I have tried several things, from mounting the reservoir at different heights and trying to \"prime\" the tubing with water, but nothing seems to work. I did read that there is a way to get it to work, but I had already given up at that point. It seems like if you are going to make a product that sells for $17 and the only thing it has to do is water a plant, that you would at least provide instructions on how to do the one thing it is made for.I can't give it 1 star because apparently some people have figured out how to make it work, and so apparently it isn't totally worthless. But for wasting my time, and frustrating me, I will give it 2 stars. I should also mention this thing is ugly and won't clip on to pots that have a thick rim, like some ceramic pots. It is also made of very cheap plastic, not high quality plastic like tupperware or rubbermaid products. Overall, this thing is not good and I do not recommend it.
B000PGOON8 As many have said, the lid will not stay shut which can impact the suction through the hose.  It is ok, but I believe that they could have made a higher quality version and charged more as there seems to be good demand for such a product.
B000PGOON8 I have to say that this little thing has worked wonderfully for me. I have read that it does not work for bigger plants but that works out for me since the one I use it on is a smaller one. It is very easy to use although you may have to figure it out yourself since some have had trouble with the instructions. Luckily everything was fine for me and this thing works. I am away from home a lot so this really works out well for me. I recommend this to any one with a plant in need.
B000PGOON8 I held great hopes for this gadget.  We have a 20-inch pot on our upstairs desk, containing a brugmansia.  We needed a plant there to shade the window, but it's a hassle keeping it watered. Perhaps this would cut down our daily watering to every other day.Unfortunately, it didn't work for this purpose.  The lid to the plastic container would not stay closed, so perhaps that's part of the problem.  Also, the curve of the plastic container wasn't wide enough to accommodate a a pot this size.  I tried sitting the container on the ground, though, and that didn't improve the function.Judging from another review here, I might be able to use the wired device in another container. But right now I don't have time to engineer that.Kudos to the manufacturer for the handy video instructions. Very clear.
B000PGOON8 This watering system only fits on medium/large sized pots, and I wouldn't recommend it for use as your sole watering system. However I have a bad habit of only watering my plants every few days, and this has worked well to pick up the slack in between.The design concept is interesting and quite functional, however the materials used are not particularly high quality. It would be a better use of money to create your own reservoir and purchase water sensors from CobraCo (CobraCo 6001-TC Replacement Ceramic Watering Sensors) or another company.
B000PGOON8 FOLLOW THE DIRECTIONS, if you do that and pre-soak the ceramic spike, then fill the spike and the tank with water this system will work VERY well. I've been using the ceramic spike for years now and they have never failed me. Now they're just bundling the spikes with a water tank, which is convenient. This tank is probably only good for a few weeks with most plants, but you can use a bigger tank if needed. I've used up to a gallon tank without a problem.
B000PGOON8 I'm not the world's best organized as far as remembering to water my plants, so this plant sitter is ideal. I have it \"sitting\" a plant that's perched up on a high credenza in my office that I have to get up on a stool to water--- hence it sometimes gets missed. With the sitter I don't have to worry about it anymore--- I can see clearly from the tank when I need to replenish its water. Very handy for me and very pleased to have it.
B000PGOON8 The Plant Sitter is a product designed for those who'd like to have their plants watered automatically over a period of time. It contains a reservoir for the water and a ceramic sensor to trigger water release when the soil gets dry. You will need to carefully follow the instructions and test-run it to make sure it is properly watering your plants. Some users need to make adjustments to get it working sufficiently, such as changing the position of the reservoir, taping the lid closed, adjusting the sensor insertion spot, etc. It has a decent cosmetic appearance and hangs easily on most plant containers - I have a variety of potted plants on my patio and it fits a majority of them. It seems to usually work well when used as directed but there are exceptions and if you expect it to work fine for every plant and without any adjustment then you could have it ruin a plant. The mechanism for how this functions is simple enough that someone could create a similar system on their own using parts that are less expensive. Thus, if you have a lot of plants that need automatic watering it would be expensive to buy a lot of Plant Sitter packages - you'd probably want to find a more inexpensive system. Thus, I'd say this is an option for those with no more than a few plants that may need watering when there's temporarily no human around to do the job - and you should first test run it when you are around to ensure it is functioning as intended.
B000PGOON8 This arrived just as I was about to leave for four days, and the plant I most wanted to save was an outdoor potted plant. I knew this was not made for outdoor plants, but I figured I'd try anyway. That was a useless effort; I came back to find the tank completely dry and the plant dry, too... I guess the tank just evaporates easily in hot weather.Anyway, then I tried it for its intended use. I placed it in a small potted houseplant and it has watered for 7 days-- the soil is nice and moist and the tank is about halfway down, just as the literature says (up to 2 weeks of watering).PROS:-Works as intended-Camouflaged colors-- the green blends in with the plant, so it's not a big, obvious device-You can use it with your own water container, too, if you want something bigger (as long as the hose reaches the bottom)CONS:-Expensive. How many people have just one houseplant they want to save? At this price, you could rack up triple digit expenses just to keep your plants watered.-The top doesn't stay closed. You'd expect there to be a tab or something to keep it \"clicked\" closed, but nope. It just sits there. My cat hasn't knocked it over yet, but it's just a matter of time, I think.-Doesn't fit \"almost all\" containers as advertised. I've tried it on several small containers, and it doesn't stay on them. Not a big deal in my case, though, because my plants are on a countertop and I've just put the tank behind the plant instead of hanging from the side of the pot. Also won't work for hanging plants-- it tipped mine sideways from the weight.Overall: if you have just one or two indoor plants you really want to save while you're away, this could work well.
B000PGOON8 2nd UPDATE:The sensor was empty today. I thought I made a mistake the first time this happened. Since this has happened three times & the two sensors I've been using for years still have water in them, there must be something wrong with the Plant Sitter. I noticed that the Plant Sitter feeding tube is smaller in diameter than the sensors I've used for years. Maybe that's the problem. I don't know for sure, all I know is that the Plant Sitter sensor is not siphoning water like it should be.My rating went from 3 stars to 1 star.UPDATE:After setting this system up using 3 sensors (one that came with the plant sitter & two I previously owned), I thought everything was working normally. After a few days I checked each sensor again to be sure each was full of water. I was surprised that the sensor that came with the Plant Sitter was empty again. The other 2 sensors were full of water - like they're supposed to be. I soaked the empty sensor for 15 minutes then re-filled it with water. I will check in a few days to see if it is empty again. If so, I will update my review & reduce the star rating.~~~~~~~~~~~~~ORIGINAL REVIEWI've used self-watering probesSelf-Watering Probes - Package of 5for indoor & outdoor plants successfully for many years. I use gallon milk containers as the water reservoir.  The CobraCo 6000 Plant Sitter works the same way way as the ceramic probes I used in the past & it comes with its own 1 quart reservoir.To use self-watering ceramic sensors:~Remove cap~SOAK the ceramic cone/probe  10-15 minutes in water (Cobra forgot to add this important step to its product label instructions)~Fill the cone/sensor ALL the way to the top then recap it.~Push the ceramic sensor into the soil. I always make sure the ceramic portion is completely pushed into the soil.~Fill the reservoir with water.  To feed  your plants, add a little liquid fertilizer to the water.~Drop the feeding tube into the water reservoir making  sure it rests on the bottom. (For the Cobra Plant Sitter, drop the end of the tube through the center hole on the reservoir's lid)~Cover the top of the reservoir so that the water won't evaporate & so mosquitoes won't get in if you're using it outside. (The Plant Sitter has a lid, but the lid doesn't snap closed. To keep the lid closed, I put a rubber band around each side of the reservoir. If I was using the Plant Sitter outside, I would cover the center hole & the feeding tube with aluminum foil)~IMPORTANT: Always set your Plant Sitter up a week before you leave to be sure it's working properly. (I noticed that the water level in the reservoir hadn't changed in a week. I pulled the ceramic sensor out, removed the cap & saw the cone was completely empty...that's why it wasn't working. I filled it back up, put the cap back on, pushed the sensor back into the soil; by the end of the day, the reservoir's water level was going down)...see my UPDATEA few tips:~Larger plants will need at least two ceramic probes/sensors.~Depending on type, size & season, a plant will require from 8 ounces to 32 ounces of water weekly. I find that for my plant in a 6\" pot, the Plant Sitter's one quart reservoir will water it for approximately 2 weeks.~If you rely on the Plant Sitter to always water your plants, you should water the plant from the top once a month.~The level of the water in the reservoir should be below the cap on the ceramic sensor. Raising the reservoir increases the flow rate; lowering it reduces the flow.~If the reservoir runs out of water, you need to refill it & you will also need to refill the ceramic sensor.The Plant Sitter's reservoir is a nice translucent color, not flashy or showy, so it won't detract from your plant. It's too tall for some of my smaller indoor plants. So I sit it near the plant instead of hanging it on the pot.I added two more sensors & am using the Plant Sitter to water three plants at a time. The center hole is large enough for me to thread two feeding tubes through it, but I had to put the other tube under the lid; two rubber bands are holding the lid closed. I'm sure the reservoir will need to be filled  often, but the plants have been so thirsty lately that I haven't been watering them enough. I'm expecting happier plants by using the Plant Sitter.Amazon's product description is confusing to me. It mentions both a 1 quart reservoir & a 2 quart reservoir. I received a 1 quart reservoir & one ceramic sensor.Made in ChinaThis is a 4 star product, but I deducted 1 star because an important step was not included on the product's label instructions & the lid doesn't snap closed.~~~~~~~~
B000PGOON8 This device is designed to provide you plants with consistent water over a couple weeks, like when you go on vacation. Now the water reservoir is rather cheaply made. The lid does not close properly, I had to place a rock on it to keep it closed. Now if you look above, you can get the Hydrospikes by themselves and use almost any bottle or jug with them. This model works best when you don't have any place for that jug as it attaches to the side of the flower pot. You can also use multiple hydrospikes to one jug to water multiple plants or one large pot.Now the one thing to keep in mind is that you do need to \"prime the pump\" by soaking the terracotta sensor and pouring water into the hydrospike to get the water flowing. You may also need to do this occasionally if the water stops or runs out for any reason.If you have a lot of flower pots, are forgetful when it comes to watering and especially if you have a tendency to over water your plants, then this is a great tool for keeping your plants healthy and alive.
B000PGOON8 The Plant Sitter Automatic Watering System is really just a simple water siphon consisting of three parts: A curved reservoir that can hang on the side of a pot or stand free, a thin coiled hose, and a pours ceramic cone (they call it a \"sensor\") attached to one end of the hose. Setup is simple: FIll the tank, soak the \"sensor\" in water until well saturated (this takes 10-15 minutes), insert the sensor in the soil, and you're done. The ceramic cone is the key here. From what I can tell, It prevents dirt and particles from being drawn back into the hose, plugging it, and it provides a lot of surface area to help draw water into the pot while preventing the siphon from immediately draining the reservoir.I set up my Plant Sitter in a 12\" pot containing a few ivy cuttings I'm starting. I've placed the pot on my side porch, where it'll get sunlight but will be sheltered from the rain.  Everything appears to be properly configured according to the instructions. We'll see how it looks when I return from my vacation next week.
B000PGOON8 I tried this in my guest room, where I have a few plants that get forgotten. After following the directions, I put this into a pot of Emerald Gem that had been recently divided from the mother plant. It was doing great because I was remembering to water it.This watering system didn't work well. A month after installing, there was still water in the well. The plant was very droopy. I'll try again with a different plant and see if I get better results.
B000PGOON8 I am evaluating this product winter 2013 when indoor environment is extremely dry. The houseplant sits facing Southern window connected with the watering system. Instructions are so easy to follow. I fill the reservoir and ceramic sensor with luke-warm water. The system does the watering for me. In about two weeks, I re-fill the reservoir.One more thing about the watering system is that it may take a while to \"calibrate\" the system. If you notice that the water level in the reservoir does not go down, the system is not properly calibrated. Simply refill the ceramic sensor. Repeat the process if necessary.
B000PGOON8 I was excited for the Plant Sitter to work, but alas, it must have gotten distracted and focused on playing on its cell phone when it should have been tending to the plant. Alas, so hard to find good sitters these days. :)Really, though, it's a good idea, but just didn't work for us. Maybe it was operator error, but the thing really didn't come with a lot of instructions.We placed in to tend a tomato plant that we had in a pot about 14\" in diameter.As we checked on it, it seemed that the water level in the Plant Sitter container was going down, so it seems like it was watering, but it just wasn't watering enough, and the tomato plant really struggled.This may be the type of Sitter that needs a watchful eye, but then, what's the point?It could be used as a backup for watering if you're prone to forget to water everyone once and a while, but as a main source for watering on a long vacation, I'd think twice about, unless you test it really well before you leave and are confident that it provides enough water for the size of planter you have.
B000PGOON8 When I was first offered this product for review, I thought \"What a great concept!\" Since I live in a condo and do container gardening outside, I decided to give this product the ultimate test by using it on the container for one of my tomato plants. It stayed there all summer and into the early fall.First off, you're supposed to soak the ceramic piece that's going to go into the soil in water. I totally didn't see that part of the instructions at the time, so that clearly could have impacted the plant sitter's performance that first week or so.  You then put the ceramic piece into the soil and put the long thin tube that is connected to it down into the plant sitter water well that hangs on the side of your plant's pot. Super simple and quick to install.The first problem I encountered is that the LID of the water well would not stay shut. This may not have been a problem if I'd been using it for an INDOOR plant, but it certainly was a problem with an outdoor plant, because all the bugs, dirt and other detritus that swirls around the parking lot of my condo could go right into the water. Over time, even if I occasionally poured out the old water and put new in, a green gunk grew on the inside bottom of the water well. I can't say exactly how much this impacted the plant sitter's ability to keep my plant watered, but I suspect it clogged up the tube somewhat.The end result was that, when comparing my two tomato plants in exactly the same containers with exactly the same type and amount of soil, the plant with the plant sitter generally needed less watering. HOWEVER, in no way would I have been able to rely on the plant sitter SOLELY to water my tomato plant, so I still watered with the hose when necessary (especially during that part of our summer that was over 100 degrees). I could see a small to medium house plant that didn't have a great need for water being able to survive over the long haul with this plant watering system, but not a large plant and not likely one (like my Spathiphillum) that constantly droops unless it is well and regularly watered.I would definitely get another plant sitter for an indoor house plant IF the company could fix the lid problem. The fact that the lid refused to latch and stay shut was a constant annoyance to me this summer...and trust me, I tried many times to get it to latch. I think I succeeded ONE TIME out of an entire summer of tending to my tomato plants...but it didn't stay closed for long.In summary, this plant sitter is a GREAT concept for those who want to have plants but travel often and don't want to pay someone to water their plants while they're gone. It is easy to set up and easy to use. If it hadn't been for the lid issue, I would have happily given this product 4 stars.
B000PGOON8 Although not a bad concept, and upon seeing it you think, \"Why not?  I'll give it a try,\" this item works better in theory than in practice.You can't really rely on it to keep your plants alive.  I think another review said you had to siphon the thing first.  That kind of takes away the \"automatic\" idea.  Maybe my expectations of the product were a little too high, and my review sounds a bit harsh, but when I see automatic, I want something truly automatic.Not only that, the system is a real eye-sore.Maybe plant sitting technology is still in its infancy and hopefully it will improve in the future.  I'm glad to see other users were able to get something out of the product.  I wish CobraCo the best of luck and hope they can some day live up to my higher expectations.
B000PGOON8 This does work.  It enables you to give your plants access to water when you are not around to water them.  But it's not exactly a needed product, even for dedicated plant lovers, since it none too hard to set up your own wicking system.  That would do the same job, and do it for a lot less money.So: it works.  No problem.  But...needed?  I don't know.
B000PGOON8 The COBRA 6000 PLANT SITTER works OK for what it is, however, the company didnt print the correct instructions for its use. You will NOT get any water moving into the watering stake, unless you syphon the water thru that hose. The instructions only mention filling up the stake with water. So, first fill up the water tank. DO NOT ADD ANY FERTILIZER. (You dont want to get that in your mouth.) Next, twist off the cap over the watering stake, and fill it up with water, RIGHT TO THE BRIM. Then, CAREFULLY put the cap back on. Now, SYPHON the water thru the hose, and when its flowing, then attach the hose to the plant stake. Place the plant stake as close to the roots as you can get it, without damaging them. Lastly, either hang the tank on the side of the planter, or place it ABOVE the plant's soil level, so you get good water flow. The hose's opening should ALWAYS be at the BOTTOM of the tank. The instructions remind you NEVER to let the tank run out of water, or let the water lever fall too low inside the watering stake. If you do, the syphoning suction will break down, and you'll have to initiate the syphoning process again.DOES THE COBRA 6000 WORK? Its OK, tho other self watering systems I've seen, use TWO of these watering stakes per planter. Unless you have a SMALL plant, just one stake wont moisten all the dirt in your planter, to the detriment of some of your roots. Also, the water tank is designed to attach to the side of a planter. However, its TOO BIG for that to work, unless you have at least a one gallon sized planter. It claims to water a plant UP TO 3 WEEKS. I guess they mean a cactus. I found the water tank to run out, after about 7-10 days.BEST METHOD FOR KEEPING YOUR PLANTS WATERED DURING VACATION.1. WATER THE PLANTS THOROUGHLY before you leave.2. COVER THE DIRT WITH WET PAPER TOWELS, or wet rags. Then, cover over the planter with a plastic bag. This will hold a LOT of water inside your planter. For outdoor plants, skip the plastic bag, cos you'll want to get whatever rain you can inside the planter.3. PLACE HUMIDITY TRAYS NEAR THE PLANTERS. Lack of humidity will cause extra evaperation thru the leaves.4. DONT PLACE IN DIRECT SUN. You'll want to get your plant to go almost into hibernation, while you're away.5. USE A WATERING SYSTEM LIKE COBRA 6000. I've seen people take a 1 liter plastic bottle, fill it with water, plug it with a rag, and place it upside down inside the planter. The water will slowly drain thru the dirt. This is good for BIG pots, and plants that like wet feet, like tropicals. The COBRA 6000 is a sophisticated version of that same method of watering, that works well for small planters.Overall, the COBRA 6000 works, but only on a smaller plant. If the plant is too big, the stake cant get water thru the WHOLE root system. Rememeber, to syphon the hose before use, make sure the opening is placed on the bottom of the tank. Also, keep the stake filled with water too. Best results were optained from placing the tank ABOVE the planter's rim, not hooked on the planter's side. If you place the water tank upon the rim, as the drawing on the cardboard container suggests, the weight of the filled tank might tip over the planter. Also, its less likely to work well, as the tank drains.Overall, a cheaper alternative to the more expensive, multi-pot watering systems. However, the vague, incomplete instructions, and the watering tank that's designed too large to hang on the planter's rim, might spoil this product for some.
B000PSFLT2 While I tried to swear off any more awful Chinese plastic hose accessories, favoring far better US brass stuff when available (not often), this was the only configuration that would work for my irrigation system without redoing the whole thing. Cheap and with a lot of optional ways to hook up stuff, and the shut-off valves are very handy.Although plastic threads usually fail after awhile, this device seems well-made with decently formed threads, a brace kit useful for some installations, an upper brass coupling and the valves work smoothly and are big enough to operate fairly easily.I had to take off a star because a somewhat similar, and discontinued, Orbit manifold sprung a leak right in the middle of the body and sometimes guilt by association is hard to deny.
B000PSFLT2 Plastic Manifold has Brass Coupler, 2 plastic End Caps, and 3 plastic Ball Valves for a total of 1 entry and 5 exits to the manifold.Ball Valves work smoothly and shut off completely.Manifold comes with a steel brace, mounting screws,  and instructions.To avoid the extra work of drilling holes in the block wall, I didn't use the enclosed steel brace. Instead, I measured the installed length of the Manifold to the ground at the intersection of the wall -- cut a length of White Schedule 40 PVC to fit, and have an easily-removable brace that's a plenty strong.I mounted a RainBird Pressure Gauge on the center valve -- an Orbit Digital Timer on the right that feeds a RainBird Gear-Drive Sprinkler -- and a 37' hose with a Bel-Aire Nozzle on the 3rd port for durability and versatility.All this behind a Valterra A01-1122VP High Flow, 55-lb Lead-Free Pressure Regulator -- ALL available here at Amazon.My order arrived promptly and in perfect condition. Thanks, Amazon !!
B000PSFLT2 I bought this to hook up a hose and two sprinklers at the same time, so I don't have to constantly switch hoses depending on which item needs use currently. Works great, made it through the first year. Each hose outlet has a on/off control valve which it's good. You probably won't be able to run 3 items at one time unless you have great water pressure in your home - or if they run just fine at low pressure. I definitely recommend bringing it in over the winter so it doesn't crack and leak. I've had two Gilmour two-way splitters before and they only lasted one year before they started leaking, however I didn't bring them in for the winter - so that may be the cause.
B000PSFLT2 I have this set up with two soaker hoses at either end.  Since they are so light, there is no need for me to use the anchor that came with the product.  For my needs, this product is just right!
B000PSFLT2 I have two of these, they are both working very well. I am very pleased with them and will buy more if the need arises.
B000PSFLT2 This is great to use in the garden I currently have two hoses attached to it and this helps me to get all over my property, we have 4 acres. I se it daily and have not had any problems.
B000PSFLT2 This was easy to hook up and is a life-saver now that I am trying my hand at landscaping and have several hoses going all over the yard. My only complaint is that it sometimes leaks, but I'm not sure if that's an error on my part or if it's the product itself. I also think that the hoses sometimes get stretched (as in, pulled slightly away from this product when they're in use), so the seal isn't as tight as it should be. It's easily fixed.Also, sometimes, for the same reason as above--stretching of hoses as they're used--the gold part on the top (that attaches to the main faucet) unscrews a bit and starts leaking. But you just have to twist it back on tight and again, probably only happens because the hose is being stretched.
B000PSFLT2 Kind of a cute little gadget and does serve a purpose. The supporting arm provided was useless so have to invent one of my own.. It sure makes it convenient to have several hoses at the ready and don't have to mess around disconnecting  and re connecting to change hoses
B000PSFLT2 The Orbit 3-way faucet valve is absolutely great so far. One or two reviewers almost scared me off by saying you should get the metal one instead, but I had a metal 2-way faucet valve and hated it. It leaked, it was too hard to turn the dials and it was surprisingly insubstantial for metal.This faucet valve comes with a brace you can attach to the back to bear some of the weight of the hoses, but I didn't attach it and I don't think I need to. Everything is tight and sturdy as can be. Maybe the angle of my faucet coming out of the wall makes it unnecessary to have a brace. After my experience with my last 2-way faucet valve I bought some washers for this one, but I haven't needed them at all. Not a drop of escaped water. I run a hose to one garden, a hose to a second garden in the opposite direction, and a hose across the yard to a dog pen. I had forgotten that sometimes I need water at the faucet for other things as well and was thinking about getting a 4-way faucet, when I realized the end cap screws off and there is your 4th outlet, and even a fifth one on the other side.I love this thing. It has solved so many problems for me. And again, it's sturdy! Nothing moves when I yank on one of the hoses. What a difference from my \"better\" metal one!Update -One month of constant use later: This connector has had a workout. Everything still works smoothly. I guess that is what impresses me most after having struggled with a brass connector. The individual dials turn sooo easily and when they are off, there is no leakage. This whole thing is so well made.Another update -One year later I am having to buy another one. I think the couple of deep freezes we had this winter did it in. But the price makes it painless to replace.
B000Q5S7RM I had an issue with my order that the seller resolved immediately, so I won't detail that.Once my worms arrived I opened them up and gave them some water before placing into the soil.  The box was a lot smaller than I anticipated; I was envisioning 4-6 inch long fat worms in a box the size of a gallon jug or bigger.  The box was about 8\" square, and the worms were TINY- average was an inch, inch and a half long.  But I've no doubt there was 1000 in there.  Once it warms up in SoCal I'll be buying several more boxes for my garden.
B000Q5S7RM It's not every day that a bag full of lively worms land on your doorstep. Several generations of these worms have feasted on our compost pile ever since, leaving everyone happy.
B000Q5S7RM Arrived on time and included a bunch of live red wigglers.  I didn't see any dead worms and my worms have been thriving in my composter.  They also started mating right away... I don't know if that's a sign of adjustment or not but they do seem to be very happy worms.  I would definitely buy from this company again.
B000Q5S7RM Healthy, live, wiggly worms. Put them in my compost bin and hopefully they will do the job. If they migrate out to the rest of the yard thats fine. I will be back for more.
B000Q5S7RM Ordered in March going to Fl. And they arrived quickly and all alive. The worms are happy and thriving in my compost bed. They are already improving the crappy dense non draining pile of fill that I have been putting my household compost in. I noticed the hump in the middle is going down faster and it's getting more like soil rather then muck fill. Still has a long way to go before I can plant but the worms are definitely improving the quality and airation. Gotta have worms and this company was a good choice to get them from!
B000Q5S7RM I bought these because I am having a problem in part of my lawn with compaction.  I have some heavy clay under my soil.  I have aerated my lawn, but it just need some more help.They arrived packed well, and had a cooling pack to keep them from getting too hot.  They also included a sheet of instructions which I highly recommend you read before putting them out.  I did not find any dead worms.  In the instructions and FAQ with this company they stated that the worms may seem a little thin from being dehydrated from shipping, but mine were fat and healthy.I followed the instructions and put them out in one spot and covered them with damp newsprint, after loosening up the soil (I used a pitch fork).  They started wriggling down into the soil right away.  I checked the next day under the newsprint and did not see a one, so I am sure they are happy underground,  and I am looking forward to them helping my lawn.
B000Q5S7RM I'm trying to think of something to say about a bag of worms.  They're worms, right?First of all, there were several dead ones.  Of course I didn't count them, but there were enough to notice the difference between the moving worms and the motionless/limp/lifeless ones.  I guess some perishing in transit might be normal, I don't know.Second, there were some critters other than worms.  Some of them look like miniature centipedes, others are just little wiggly things.  I guess it's inevitable that you'll have supplemental detritus-eaters, but actually I was expecting only worms.Hopefully these are the last worms I'll ever buy.
B000QD7MZ2 This is supposed to be a hummingbird feeder, not a nectar fountain....... It IS big, and once assembled, it looks attractive. It was fairly easy to assemble except for the little yellow centers, which kept popping out and flying onto the floor, but once that was taken care of the unit was impressive, looked very nice.Adding the cylinder, which I had thankfully  filled only 1/3 with sugar syrup, was an unwieldy process, But  I did that over the kitchen sink and once I mastered that and everything was in place, and the feeder was ready to hang on my balcony -- that was when I noticed the syrup dripping out from UNDER the red flowers. Had it been dripping out from under ONE of the flowers I might have been more forgiving but ALL the flowers were leaking. Nuh Uh --  I just installed a new balcony rug and there is NO way I am going to hang that on my balcony.Like some of the other reviewers did, I will disassemble it, and GLUE the flowers on to see if THAT helps. If that doesn't work then this product is  waste of everyone's time.
B000QD7MZ2 PROS- large size, individual perches, easy to hang bailCONS- all plastic, including the nectar bottleThe main advantage of this model is its large size, so if you have lots of hummer activity, you won't run out as fast.  Also, being plastic, it doesn't weigh as much as those with glass bottles, though of course once you fill it with a larger amount of nectar it weighs more.However, I do wonder if some of the plastic from the bottle is getting into the nectar.  We try to avoid plastic packaging in our house, what is this plastic doing to the hummers.  Also, I wonder if the clear plastic bottle will discolor or scuff from cleaning over time, in a way that glass wouldn't.The bail (hanging loop) is larger and easier to manipulate than on other hummingbird feeders I have, but it still gets in the way of standing the bottle up straight when filling it.  If they had made it just a bit larger, or designed the plastic bottle to have some recesses in it for the bail, then the bottle could stand up straight when needed.
B000QD7MZ2 I'm not sure that the hummingbirds around here will be enough to drink up all the nectar before it spoils.  It holds 48 ounces, which of course is a quart and a half.  So be aware of that if you don't get lots of hummers around your area.The base is a little hard to clean, as it doesn't come fully apart.  I usually run it through the dishwasher on the top rack with the heat OFF.  So far, so good.  I wish it had an ant moat like my other feeder, with that one I can fill the top little moat with water and keep the ants from getting to the nectar.The nectar chamber is made of plastic, so it's not as heavy as if it was made of glass and less likely to break.  The base simply twists into place.  It has a large metal bail which is easy to get on and off my hanging hooks.  It has 6 feeding stations with perches, so multiple birds COULD feed at once, but we have a male here who runs off everyone else if he's anywhere around the feeder!If you're looking for a decent, sturdy feeder that holds a LOT of nectar, then this is the one for you.  The box also states it is made in the USA, which was a BIG plus for me.
B000QD7MZ2 I have yet to find the perfect hummingbird feeder, and I've gone through a lot.  This feeder is no exception.While it holds a lot of nectar and has six ports, I find that hummingbirds are too territorial to allow more than one family to feed -- one male, one female, and, eventually, a couple of juveniles.  The huge capacity of nectar is wasted since it must be changed twice a week to avoid bacteria and mold.At first, I absolutely loved that it didn't leak while hanging in its place -- and then I had to change the nectar.  The moment I moved the feeder, nectar poured out of the spouts and over my hands.  It was even messier when I turned it upside down to unlock the base.  I was covered with sugar water. I'm sure the ants had a field day below.The feeder comes unassembled, with no instructions.  It was pretty easy to figure out, although if the flowers aren't all the way in, the feeder will leak right away.  Everything is plastic.  This feeder is much easier to clean than others.I just wish someone would make a bee-proof, non-leaking, easy-to-clean, easy-to-fill feeder.-- Debbie Lee Wesselmann
B000QD7MZ2 I do love the size and the 6 ports to feed from but I can already see it is hard to open and fill and get closed right again so it doesn't leak. I don't really expect this to last more than this season. Don't get this size unless you have a lot of hummers coming because you should refill your feeder and clean it once a week so if you fill it full and don't have enough hummers to use it up there will be a lot of waste. If you don't need that much just fill it half full. You can always add more if needed but be sure to clean your feeder every time you put more syrup in it for them to drink.You really need to push firmly on each piece as you put the feeder flowers on and the center parts. If they aren't on right they will just fall off so you'll know if you did it right or not. The stand for the hummer feet are on securely because they have little cut outs for them to fit tightly before screwing them tight onto the feeder. Just take your time putting these features on so you don't break them.UPDATE: The little yellow centers in each flower that are snapped in independently are coming off. The Orioles keep playing with them and they are coming off even though I had them on securely. Now there is an opening large enough for any bird, fly, wasp, etc. to get into the juice. Not a good thing. When this is empty I won't use it again. Spend more and get a nice glass feeder, they are the best.
B000QD7MZ2 Early May is the start of humming bird season around our house so the arrival of the Perky-Pet feeder was very timely. Like clockwork, the little critters came looking for food and my wife was able to put the feeder in the garden in time to satisfy a small flock of these fascinating creatures.The feeder holds a lot nectar and that's both a blessing and a curse. The blessing, when there are a lot of birds feeding, you don't have to refill as often. The curse, the base doesn't come apart and because of its internal corners and seams, it's hard to clean.The tube is easy to clean but the base is somewhat inaccessible making it hard to get spotless - important because around here, mold forms quickly.The small perches are used by the birds, giving us a good long look as they feed.Overall, a good product and recommended if you are a careful and dedicated cleaner. Else, keep shopping.
B000QD7MZ2 This has been a great year for the hummers in our yard.  Have two nests, each with two eggs and a source of pleasure just watching.  The one feeder that we have had just doesn't hold enough and a royal pain to clean.  So glad we were able to get this---it holds plenty of our \"nectar\" and refills a lot less often, very easy to clean.  The really great feature is that this holds 48oz of nectar.....enough to last more than a day!  After years of feeders in our yard I can honestly say this is the cream of the crop----I'm thinking the hummers agree!  A great product for so much entertainment in our outdoor space.**May 17, 2014  This update is an unhappy one! Our huge feeder now has a leak underneath, along the bottom of the base...what a mess!  We had it hanging in a tree and thought that the wind was causing the feeder to sway too much, losing all of the solution.  We decided to place it on a stable post to correct the problem...wrong!  The plastic base piece is open for easy cleaning, but actually consists of two attached pieces that do not make a good seal .  We are totally disappointed with Perky-Pet concerning this flaw in design.  Hopefully, the company will soon address this issue, and figure out a way to make a bottom piece that is solid. but easy to clean.  This also applies to the models that have two separate bottom pieces that Really Leak!  We like Perky-Pet products, and hope that the solution to the leaking problems will be soon!
B000QD7MZ2 Who can resist the tiny delicate hummingbird?  I love seeing them in gardens at flowers such as coral bells, honeysuckle, columbine, delphinium, trumpet vine and other plants that tend to have a bell like blossom.  This feeder when filled with a syrupy liquid will attract the lovely creatures too but it is a bit of a pain to put together and if the user is not very careful spills and leaks are a fact of life.  Holding forty-eight ounces this is the &#34;grand master&#34; of hummingbird feeders but I still prefer the old fashioned method of feeding them with flowers thus receiving the additional benefit of more beauty and color in my yard.
B000QD7MZ2 While it's attractive, it's way too large. I prefer having (several) smaller feeders. Party because hummers are territorial they like having &#34;their own&#34; feeder to go to. And a feeder with 48 oz. of nectar is going to take a long time for the birds to empty. Probably one will never fill it  more than 1/4 full. Nectar liquid goes bad in a few days, especially in hot temperatures.  All the red color on the unit itself is bound to attract, but I prefer glass feeders these days, they hold up better in the hot sun and with time.
B000QD7MZ2 This hummingbird feeder does its job. It's much larger than many others on the market- 48 oz. Its constructed of plastic, but seems relatively sturdy. Other people have had problems with leaks, but I haven't experienced any after 2 months of use; (if any do develop I'll update the review). One thing to keep in mind for first time hummingbird feeder buyers is that you have to buy special food so that the hummingbirds don't starve to death on sugar water. They need nutrients, and it's only fair for you to know that ordering this feeder won't be everything you need to get up and running.It's easy enough to clean, although for people like me who don't like to take the time to disassemble, clean and dry multiple parts it's not fun. I'm not aware of any alternatives, just something to keep in mind because I'll either make the effort to pull apart and hand wash my juicer or the birds', but not both. Only one of us will get our nectar!
B000QD7MZ2 There are many different styles and sizes of hummingbird feeders. The hummingbirds don't seem to care as long as there's fresh nectar (sugar water).This 48 ounce feeder is BIG. Unless the hummingbirds we get would consume 48 ounces within a couple of days, this size is overkill. That's because when the daily temperature hits the 90's, a couple of days is the most we can go before replacing the nectar and cleaning the feeders.I don't know about the store bought nectar because we make our own (3 parts boiling water to 1 part sugar), but it can go cloudy in as quick as a day during the hottest part of summer. Cloudy is bad, as are visible black floating specks. It means contamination.As long as the nectar doesn't get contaminated, cleaning is pretty easy, it's really just a matter of rinsing. However, once there's contamination, a full out washing is the only way to feel it's safe to use again.For me, the best feeders are the ones that are the easiest to use and the easiest to clean. This one fits the bill; it is easy to take apart, fill and clean.On the negative side, I had a knee jerk reaction to the plastic bottle. Only time will tell, but I have had plastic feeder bottles that became brittle and / or cracked in as little as one summer's use. (Probably due to our mountain location where summer temps can hit 90 during the day and drop to the 45 at night.)For my purposes, this feeder is okay. Of all the feeders that we have tried, I like Perky Pet's, but prefer their smaller ones. I start with putting a couple out in April and add as the hummer population grows. By July, when the Rufus' come in, we have a dozen in different places about the deck. These are my favorite:Perky-Pet 8109-2 Antique Glass Bottle Hummingbird Feeder-16-Ounce Capacity, Redand thePerky-Pet 447-12 Round 10-Ounce Glass Hummingbird Feeder.
B000QD7MZ2 While this is one of the larger hummiingbird feeders, it lacks in quality. First, it's all plastic, unlike their other product, the 209B. It also came with the drinknig stations unassembled (though the other model comes assembled). There were also twice as many pieces sent - is this a mistake or intentionally wasteful? So while this feeder is functional, it just isn't nice as a glass one.Please toss away the included food. It contains dyes that can be toxic to birds. It's unconscionable  that Perky-pet is including this nasty stuff with their feeders. Just mix 4 parts water to 1 part sugar and you'll be good to go.
B000QD7MZ2 This is not your typical Perky-Pet hummingbird feeder simply because our hummers avoid it often.  Even after setting out fresh food along with the other Perky-Pet models, they only visit this feeder when the other 4 are busy with birds.It should be the center feeder with all of its features attractive to birds and old geezers.  The birds voted with their feeding habits and have said they are not too interested.  The humans like a large, 48 ounces in this case, feeder; however, unless a large eating population has arrived the 220 (this one) goes stale.  We probably refill more often than necessary, but, I'd rather do that, especially in the beginning of the season, to encourage their eating at our stations.  The 220 has 6 'seats' for the birds and when you watch them, they will sit there, socialize and eat for a short time and then begin a fight with the arrival of the Alpha Hummer.The top has a built in moat and that is a nice feature since it does keep out the ants but not the wasps.  There is nothing that I know of that will eliminate wasps, but do we want to?  The hummers do not seem to care.  They just go to another feeder.  I do not care for the plastic feeding tube.  On the first two refills, it leaked and it was my fault for not tightening the bottom to the tube tightly.  Because it is a light plastic tube, the wind blows it easily and in doing so the food comes out of the holes.If the birds begin enjoying this feeder similar to the other ones, I will edit this and make necessary changes.  Of course, there may be reasons to downgrade it also.
B000QD7MZ2 This just came today in time for hummer season this year. Anxious to see how well it holds the large about of feed that it is rated for. The lid seems a little wonky to screw on, so we shall see. I expect this to last about one season with the critter activity we have here. Went together fairly easily and should provide a lot of feeding stations for the birds.
B000QD7MZ2 This feeder is great.  It is easy to clean.  No more sticking something down inside it try to clean stuff out.  The base does not come apart but there is plenty of room for a dish brush or cloth to get in there and clean.  I was slightly disappointed that the nectar holding part is plastic.  For some reason I thought it would be glass.  We will see how it holds up in the weather but so far so good.
B000QD7MZ2 Perky-Pet 220 The Grand Master 48-Ounce Hummingbird FeederCategory: Accessories...One can never have too many Hummingbird feeders! :)Notes after using the Perky-Pet 220 The Grand Master 48-Ounce Hummingbird Feeder for a couple of weeks:  In the box, one finds 1 Perky-Pet 220 The Grand Master 48-Ounce Hummingbird Feeder, 6 red flower-shaped medallions, 6 yellow (coin sized) inserts with feeding holes for flower-shaped medallions, 6 perches and 3 metal screws -- all in individual (clear) packets.Note, the feeder is not fully assembled (and Mine didn't come with instructions). so, just grab a pair of gardening gloves and press one of the (included) red plastic flower-shaped medallions into each of the 6 holes on the base of the unit -- *snap* -- . Next, press one of the (included) yellow coin-like inserts into each of the red flower-shaped medallions.  The (included) perches will need to be screwed into the underside of the base with a flathead screwdriver (not included). One will find 3 pre-drilled holes, one for each of the perches. When finished, there will be a perch above each of the flower-shaped medallions for the little Hummers to rest on while sipping nectar. Done!The unit is made of a very sturdy, thick, plastic. Cleaning the Perky-Pet 220 The Grand Master 48-Ounce Hummingbird Feeder, for the first time, was quick and easy. A normal sized bottle brush did the job.The nectar reservoir is crystal clear, making it easy to see the nectar level from a distance. The opening is large, making for easy filling or cleaning.  The large base, with six feeding ports, easily screws on, or off, the feeding reservoir for refills or cleaning. One fills the reservoir when the unit is upside down, screws on the base and flips unit right side up, then hangs in designated place via a sturdy metal hanger built into the cap. The red cap -- at the top of the unit -- also screws off, providing a flat surface for filling the unit. Nice!Perky-Pet 220 The Grand Master Hummingbird Feeder has a 48 ounce nectar capacity --  that's 6 whole (8 ounce) cups of nectar. This will make the feeder a bit heavy, so one will need to select a sturdy hook, or tree branch, to hang it from. The large size, and weight (when filled with nectar), of the Hummingbird feeder, keeps the wind from blowing it back and forth. It is also large enough to be seen from a distance, making it a very nice focal point in the garden or on the patio. There is no ant trap/moat on this Feeder....Neighbor-envy... The Hummers flock to my new Perky-Pet 220 The Grand Master 48-Ounce Hummingbird Feeder ..  *smiles, sips espresso*tip:  this is the nectar recipe I've used for years:  add 1/4 cup of pure cane sugar to 1 cup boiling water -- stir till clear -- let cool -- add to Hummingbird feeder. Change out once a week...Does the Perky-Pet 220 The Grand Master 48-Ounce Hummingbird Feeder, sound like what you may be looking for? :)  Highly Recommended!  --Katharena Eiermann, 2014
B000QD7MZ2 As a brand I like Perky-Pet Hummingbird feeders the best this one I have some doubts. It comes in a box and you need to assemble it no instructions included but it is obvious how to do it. My fear was you have to press so hard on the plastic red flowers to snap into the base it would crack, same with the yellow rings. It did go together without cracking. The top that holds the bottle seems to come off too easy I fear if the feeder if full it may fall to the ground. The one thing that really disappointed me is the built in metal hanger is just a tad to long to slide over the shepherds hook without spilling some of the sugar water out onto the ground.Last Summer I read that the red dye is hard on the kidneys of the hummingbirds so I make my own sugar water and they drink it down faster than I can make it. I hope this year adding 2 large feeders it can be a once a week fill and clean. It is early here yet the scout hummers are out as one came to my window 3 times last week where last year I had a window feeder that broke. I do have this one out now but I didn't fill it I do want to make sure my regulars know they can count on food again this year.If the unit does fail I will come back and update my review.
B000QD7MZ2 We have another Hummingbird feeder with small perches, and we've found that Hummingbirdsdo use the perches, and in doing so allows us to watch them longer.This large and roomy Hummingbird feeder is 25\" around the base (7 3/4\" dia) which allows ample roomfor the birds to share six feeding ports, which is nice since Humming birds are rather territorial.It's well made, and the plastic of the six perches are flexible, durable, and are a nice large size (1 1/2\" wide)The feeder doesn't come with instructions how to put it together, however, it's obvious how it belongs.Except for the yellow buttons which took a second glance to understand they snap in rounded side up.The 6 buttons and 6 flowers are quite firm to snap together, but the flowers easily pull out to clean.And the yellow centers punch out easily with a slotted screwdriver.A very nice 48 oz feede
B000QD7MZ2 The hummingbirds and orioles love this feeder.  There is a place for their cute, little feet.  So do I love it.  It is easy to take apart and clean.  I use little brushes.  It holds a lot of liquid so I do not have to fill constantly.  I have a number of feeders going at the same time and have at least 50 hummingbirds humming around all day long in the summer.  I hang these feeders in the shade of a tree.  Would definitely recommend.
B000QD7MZ2 I have three different feeders in my backyard and this seems to be the favorite. Sadly, my hummingbirds fight so, at most, I'll get two hummingbirds carefully spaced. Even so, they don't want to go to one of the other feeders but rather fight over this one.They don't share very well, so it's really kind of big since I change the solution regularly.The one thing that really brings this down to three stars for me is that the diameter of the lip of the top that fits into the base is too big. First, the top needs to be inserted, it goes down about a half-inch, and then it is turned and locked into place. I was having a very difficult (and messy) time getting the top to fit. I finally had to shave off some of the rim around the base with a razor. Happy to say that I still have ten fingers.It is easy to clean and I don't have a problem with the vacuum effect that I've had with other feeders.So, it's a five for the hummingbirds and a three for me -- average is four.06/22/2014: I changed my review to a three today. Even though I've tried to shave away some of the plastic on the base, it's still a tight squeeze. Today while trying to maneuver the container onto the base, the whole thing slipped, spewing sugar water all over my kitchen. Now I should also add, \"the ants give it a five.\"
B000QD7MZ2 When in a hour of hanging this feeder the hummers found it! It was very easy to put together. It's super easy to refill and to clean. I love the perches under each flower. The birds seem to enjoy them as well. They come and rest on them often. We love watching these amazing creatures and this feeder helps us to do so. Great product!
B000QD7MZ2 I bought this for my parents who live on a farm where they literally get swarms of hummingbirds.  My father has to refill the nectar every day because there are so many birds lighting on his little feeder.  With this new 48 ounce feeder, now he only has to refill the nectar every two or three days.  I would not recommend this feeder if you only have a few visitors because the nectar will spoil and ferment before they can consume it all and this is very unhealthy for the birds.
B000QD7MZ2 First let me say we go through A LOT of hummingbird solution. We drain five 48 ounce feeders a day at our house from Mid March through mid July. We also have two pairs that over-winter - so I always have at least one feeder up.I purchased my first Grand Master feeder from Amazon and,when I went to buy more last week I noticed that Amazon is not selling them because of some complaints - or whatever the verbiage was - so I ordered three more from another online source.I have been thrilled with these feeders. They are easier to fill, much easier to clean (you can get your whole hand in the opening) and I no longer need a bottle brush to clean them, plus I am not having to fill quite as frantically as I was because of the larger size. I was so puzzled by the fact that Amazon was not selling them that I started to think of what people might possibly have to say that wasn't good, and this is what I came up with:Most of us, if we use a larger sized hummingbird feeder, are accustomed to using the 32 ounce model that is a bottle with a narrow opening through which you fill the feeder. I used to use a funnel to do so. The bottle sets in the base. When carried outside in the upright position here is always a little leakage as you carry them out to the feeding station but that seems to happen with all of the hummer feeders that I have ever tried. With the 48 ounce feeder, the bottom is much wider; hence no need for a funnel and the ability to make cleaning easier. When you set the bottle back on the base, because of the larger opening there is more leakage. That's the only thing that I can think people might complain about.I have easily solved this issue  ( and used to to do the same thing with the 32 ounce models) by keeping the bottle upside down (standing on the top) after they are filled and replacing the bottom of the feeder (which I always cleaned at the same time as I refilled)  on the top and walking them outside in an upside down manner. Problem solved.For me, with the amount of food I go through, this feeder is such an improvement that I would never complain or return to the 32 ounce feeder, funnel and bottle brush ever again. I love this feeder, and with a bit of common sense it is no more 'drippy' than the smaller sized bottles.
B000QD7MZ2 This is ideal feeder. Easy to fill and easy to hang up. That is what I liked, the easy of filling and hanging. The ease allows me to let my daughter to help me. She really enjoys feeding and watching the humming birds.
B000QD7MZ2 We love hummingbirds and always put out a feeder or two every year despite the fact that in our x-burban wooded area we don't get that many.  (We still try ;)The feeders I currently have on hand are all PERKY-PET.  I know there are other varieties out there but Perky-pet provides different styles, all at affordable prices.  Right now I have this one (which is the 220), thePerky-Pet 209B Our Best Glass Hummingbird Feeder, and our old standby, thePerky-Pet Pinch-Waist Glass Hummingbird FeederOut of those three, this is the one I would have rated the lowest, except I have to say that the Hummingbirds really like it.  What I worried about was the base. Since it doesn't come apart I'm going to have to clean it with Q-tips.  This would be a real negative, except for the fact that their Hummers like this feeder.  It has convenient little perches which are set perfectly for feeding.  The birds sit up high enough so that all they need to do is bend over a bit and drink from the plastic flowers.THE GOOD--I prefer glass, but sometimes if children are involved, shatter-proof plastic is better.--Nice handle.--Attractive design.--Hummingbirds love it. We are just getting our first Hummers as I write this and I have to say that they like sitting on the little perches and drinking.THE BAD--Looks like it's going to be difficult to clean.OTHER OBSERVATIONS--I read all the reviews about leaking. Mine didn't leak. I don't know if Perky-Pet improved the design, but we shook the container, and so far, no leaks.--Unlike the other models I mentioned this one doesn't have threaded glass. Instead it has a 'bayonet' connection.--This thing is HUGE. Unless you live in a locale where you get tons of hummer traffic, I wouldn't suggest you fill this feeder with more than a cup of hummer-chow. The reason is that once it starts getting warm the sugars can get all gross and you should change them out frequently.--Since this feeder is plastic, it might make a good choice if you are going to be letting younger children work with it.SUGGESTIONS--It's best if you don't use the red food. Making your own is super easy, nothing more than mixing 1/4 cup sugar with 1 cup of distilled water. Red dye not needed.--Ants! We hang our feeders off the deck from iron hangers. We keep ants away with vaseline. I have the kids coat the the riser on the road with a heavy slather of vaseline and the ants stay away. Doesn't harm ants or other wildlife.
B000QD7MZ2 I didn't realize when ordering this hummingbird feeder that the container itself was plastic. We have other Perky Pet hummingbird feeders but he jars are made of glass. The plastic is more difficult to lock into place with the plastic bottom so that it won't leak. It's a nice big feeder, holding 48 ounces of feeding solution. It is surprising how fast tiny hummingbirds go through the food but since it needs to be cleaned every two or three days in order for mold not to grow, we will probably fill it only halfway unless we get more Hummers.The feeder came unassembled, but it was pretty easy to snap the yellow flowers to the openings and screw the little perches to the bottom. The container is easy to clean but the bottom part requires a brush since it's difficult to remove the yellow flower covers and they will probably not last if we have to take them on and off all the time. It's a little bit difficult to secure the container to the bottom, having to twist it into the slots and secure it so that it doesn't leak. I am hoping it will last long-term. We use this type of ant barrier or \"ant moat\" that hangs between the hook and the feeder.Songbird Essentials SE620 Nectar Protector Bird Accessory. It works very well and keeps the feeder from being overrun with ants.
B000QD7MZ2 There isn't a whole lot to say about this, it's a hummingbird feeder. The feeding ports and perches all come in separate bags and you just snap them on. There aren't any instructions or anything but it's easy enough to figure out if you just look at the picture on the box to see what it should look like. The only real downside to this feeder is that it is so big that it's really impractical unless you've got tons of hummingbirds in your yard. When you consider that nectar is supposed to be switched out at least once a week if not more often, 48 ounces is an enormous amount to keep switching out. I would suggest going for something smaller unless you really think you're going to make it through this much nectar before it spoils.
B000QD7MZ2 I like the large capacity, and the hummers liked it right away. I guess I've gotten spoiled, but I miss a bee guard and ant moat. I made my own ant moat. A hanging wire would be nice. But I really appreciate the wide filler. Assembly was a little tough with my arthritic thumbs, but I got it done. The most important thing is that my tiny hummingbirds like it.
B000QD7MZ2 I have used a lot of Perky-Pet feeders over the past 20+ years. This one definitely has more capacity than any other commercially available hummingbird feeder, which means trips to remove, clean and refill the feeder are less frequent. The feeder does not come fully assembled and it's a bit of a struggle to snap in those yellow floral discs... and because of the opening there is big (a huge invite for wasps, etc.) without the yellow disc, it's not an optional add-on - you've got to snap that sucker in there... it just makes it more complex to take apart to clean. I make my own feeder mixture of 5:1 water to sugar ratio as the birds do not need red dye - the red on the feeder is enough to attract them. I prep the mixture in the kitchen after I clean my feeders, then fill the feeder - carrying it upside down until I get in the yard so there is minimal spillage. Even though this one was properly assembled, there was some spilling when I righted it - more than I'm used to in a feeder. The central reservoir is plastic - likely because glass would make it too heavy - but I am not impressed with the quality of the plastic grooves you use to turn/lock this into place. Taking it apart and re-assembling it just once put little clear and red plastic shavings everywhere - including in the nectar reservoir. I do not see this lasting through an abundant number of refills - because those plastic tabs get shaved each time you screw and unscrew the bottom from the reservoir - eventually, it simply will not have the friction to stay together when too much material is lost. I know they're calling this &#34;The Grand Master&#34; because of the capacity - but I'd much rather see a higher-quality one - glass reservoir with a metal bottom and baked enamel paint instead of this weak plastic that quickly wears. I have some high quality feeders I paid a lot of money for - because they are made out of such better materials and frankly -they look better. Perky-Pet did great on the capacity - I just wish they'd done better on the materials end.
B000QD7MZ2 If you live in an area where you need a large capacity feeder to keep your hummingbirds happy, it's hard to imagine how this feeder would not suit your needs. That said, I did see comments on a review where the person said they have several and are still refilling daily! This feeder was made for those situations, but sadly, those of us that do not have swarms of hummers in their yards will do more dumping of unused juice.Assuming that your situation is the former, and you need 1.5 quarts of juice to keep your hummers happy, you'll find that the plastic cylinder is very easy to clean. It has a wide mouth that makes thorough cleaning a snap. However, the base is nearly impossible to clean properly, as the liquid fills the base, with the recessed areas very hard to reach and clean effectively. If you have any liquid in the cylinder when it comes time to clean, have a place to drain quite a bit of liquid out of the base when you tip it over or take it apart in the sink.In the four weeks that I tested this feeder, I did find that the ruby throated hummingbirds we have here did use it without any issues. Our birds are very territorial, so we never get more than one at a feeder at a time. I was really hoping that the number of ports on this feeder, and the fact that we had six feeders spread around the yard at one time would encourage more birds to be visible at once, but that didn't happen.Just recently, I have found that getting the cylinder to fit into the base is more difficult; almost as if it is going slightly out of round or something. It's not a big deal, as it just takes some patience to put the pieces together.Filling this with 48 ounces of sugar water means that it's going to have some weight, so a sturdy hanger is a necessity. Fortunately, the metal hanger at the top of the cylinder is up to the task. I never had a concern about it breaking and falling, but the shallow clearance requires a proper hook so you don't have to tilt the feeder. An added plus is that the red cap with the hanger screws off the cylinder, which has a flat top, so you can fill the inverted cylinder while it stands on a counter and then screw the top on to hang it. Having these separate parts makes replacements possible as well so heavy users should have some options in that regard.Durability doesn't seem to be a problem, as it was dropped onto a tile floor from a height of about three feet, and all that happened was that one of the feeder port flowers popped out. It snapped back in without any trouble, and nothing else cracked or broke as a result of the bouncing it took.Overall, this is too much feeder for many situations. But for those that need the capacity, this is one of the few I've seen that will hold this much juice. While the base is a little unwieldy when it comes to cleaning, I'm not sure there's a better way to build it and still serve six ports with this much juice. If it weren't for the hard-to-clean crevices in the base, I'd give it a solid four stars.
B000QD7MZ2 The best thing about this feeder is its huge 48 ounce capacity. If you're looking for something you can fill up and then forget about for a long time, this may be it. Otherwise, it's all plastic and looks cheap. I'd invest in a smaller glass/metal feeder instead.
B000QD7MZ2 I've had a few of the Perky Pet feeders over the years, a few of the plastic, a few of the glass - and they all have their pro's and con's.  Aesthetically, I still prefer thePerky-Pet 8120-2 Green Antique Bottle Hummingbird Feederseries, but the birds in my area don't seem too attracted to the color (although Perky Pet does offer blue and red versions which might do a better job). The glass bottles just seem to have a little bit of visual impact that allow it to act sort of as a decoration and not just a feeder. These giant 48oz feeders don't try and hide their function - they very boldly proclaim that they are hummingbird feeders.The feeder doesn't really include any useful assembly instructions, but that's not too big a deal as putting it together is pretty elementary. The large reservoir is easy to clean, but you do need a brush (or a really small hand) to get to the very bottom. The perches are very finicky and feel delicate - I'm not really sure how long they'll last. The plastic is also a big question mark. I live in sun country in the middle of Texas, and the harsh sun likes to take out its aggression on plastic. Previous plastic feeders have often cracked or discolored within just a couple of seasons.Another thing to keep in mind, although the large size is nice, unless you're feeding a giant swarm of birds, the nectar will probably \"go bad\" before the birds get to drink it all. In my hot climate, the sugar water molds up within a couple of days or less.All-in-all, I think my next feeder will probably be another glass + metal, but the brilliant red coloration and significant nectar size do make this particular feeder stand out. As long as the plastic parts make an attempt at lasting more than a single season, I'll be pretty ha
B000QD7MZ2 I was skeptical because there are too many parts and openings.  The more  openings and parts the more chance for failure.The &#34;flowers&#34;  have to be pushed into holes and then the yellow centers inserted.  The hole you push the flower into is failrly big and  over time the plastic becomes brittle and leakage begins. My hummers seem to like the smaller feeders  ( which are made by Perky Pet)  I think a little more &#34;design tweaking&#34;  is needed. The smaller feeders are simpler but work better.
B000QD7MZ2 This is a huge capacity plastic feeder that does the job well and attracts hummingbirds quickly.  Where we are, we get mostly Broad-tail hummingbirds.  They tend to feed one at a time; if a second one shows up, they chase each other around until one leaves (for the time being).  The six feeding flowers may help hummingbirds find the food, but aren't used simultaneously by our birds.It is well made of sturdy plastic; the jar is especially thick clear plastic.  The jar is sealed at the top - to refill, unscrew the top and bottom, flip it over, clean, and pour in the solution.  Ours leaked the first day until we realized we needed to turn the flowers so the clips would hold them tighter - presto, no more leaks!  The perches can be removed if desired, but it is really cool to see hummingbirds perched - which they do about 1/3 the time when feeding.For the \"nectar,\" we dissolve 1/2 cup white sugar in 2 cups plain boiling water; be careful about adding anything else as it could be harmful to the hummingbirds.  This fills it about 1/3 way, which lasts several days even with lots of bird activity.  I don't want to let it go more than a few days between refills to ensure the solution doesn't spoil.  So really, something with less capacity would work just fine.  It doesn't leak (except for spillage when the wind blows it around), and the hummingbirds noticed it and began feeding within a few hours of putting it up.  The base has plenty of color to attract birds, so no need for red solution.Taking down the feeder for cleaning and refilling would be easier with a small clip.  We tied ours to a string and have to either work the top out of the wire hanger, or unscrew it and leave the top hanging, making it harder to reattach when full.  A clip would make this much easier.  Also be sure to let the solution cool completely before filling, and rinse off the perches when cleaning and refilling to encourage perching.We hung ours a few feet outside a picture window, and the hummingbirds don't seem to mind at all when we are nearby.  Perhaps they have gotten used to humans.  We can stand quietly just under the hanging feeder and they come in to feed without seeming to notice us.
B000QD7MZ2 We got this setup and hung up in the yard and are now just waiting to see some humming birds.  It took a bit to get warmer in New England this year so hopefully soon.
B000QTMT7W I am relatively new to wood splitting. I have the great Fiskars 36\" splitter, but it couldn't get through a few knotty pieces I have. I hear wedges are good for this, so I got this one.My observations is that it doesn't do great for knotty pieces. It gets in so far, and you give it a good whack, and it bounces out. Looking at the wedge, it doesn't have a gradual grade/increase in angle; about a quarter way up, it broadens really quickly (as you can see). This is, I think, why I was seeing the behavior I was--not enough force (even with a 10lb sledge) to drive it in at that angle for these.I have a theory (and that's all it is for now ;) ), that if I get a more traditional wedge, that will work better for knotty pieces.  This wedge is probably better as an alternative to using a maul/splitter for straight pieces; people say it can split four ways in one go. I will try it for that.  But if you are looking to deal with knotty pieces, I think a standard wedge will probably be better.Again, I'm not very experienced, so take it for what it is worth.UPDATE 29 Dec 2012: I since bought a regular wedge, and I am none too impressed with it. In fact, this one seems better in getting bite so you can really drive it in.  Maybe I am just missing some part of the technique, but the problem is you need to hit it hard enough to get it to bite into the wood, then when you really lay into it for the split, it always bounces out. Seems like it should work better--like driving my splitter into it works great; I just don't want to ruin my splitter.  Will keep looking for the perfect wedge. :)
B000QTMT7W Colin's Wood Splitting Wedge, Diamond Shape, 4 Lbs. Is very good except the point bent a little which keeps me from giving five stars.
B000QTMT7W This wedge ssplits through the toughest wood like a champ! It must be because of the extra angles it attacks the wood with, but it makes splitting EASY!
B000QTMT7W During the winter (and even this Spring) we occassionally have a fire in the fireplace. I have some huge logs (some 2 feet or more in diameter) from a tree we had cut down two years ago. This really made it easy to split them. Before I was using a flat wedge but this diamond shape is fantastic!
B000QTMT7W Having had a large oak taken down and left with a large pile of 17 - 20\" pieces to chop, I figured a new splitting wedge would make life easier. My old wedge is of similar shape and design but with a blunter tip. For me the new wedge works no better than the old one. Not to say it doesn't work, but that I didn't need to buy a new one.This new wedge is more prone to pop out of the log than the older one and takes quite a bit of effort to drive into the wood with my maul. On one log section, I eventually gave up and attacked the piece with my new Fiskars X27 axe by slicing around the perimeter. As the diameter of the log shrunk, I was able to finally drive in the wedge and crack the remainder of the wood section in half.I have found that putting the wedge in the center of a log section, even one with a crack, doesn't work as well as off-centering the wedge. On less challenging sections of wood, I was able to drive the splitter much more easily and often separate the wood into three pieces.And so this wedge  works fairly well within limits; it's just not the heroic, wonder tool I was hoping for.UPDATE - After more use and experimentation I've found that my much older Oregon splitter is easier to drive, doesn't fly out at me, and works faster. This new splitter has quickly been relegated to reserve status.
B000QTMT7W I have not had a chance to use this product yet. I bought a big Fiskars wood splitting axe and the axe works so well I have not needed a wedge. This wedge seemed well priced and it arrived quickly. Looks good in my shed. If someone steals my Fiskars I might need this wedge in the future.
B000R0WXI0 I always have weeds on my sandy beach which I pick daily, but want a product to kill them for as long as possible.  This product can take 4 - 7 days to start working.  The bottle says that it will prevent weeds from coming back for up to four months,  my experience has been that it lasts about 6 weeks before I have to start pulling weeds again.  A friend told me to try a brush killer, I am going to give that a try.
B000R0WXI0 We live out in the country where weeds and thorny vines really flourish, so I still use either the Roundup Super Concentrate (purple top) or the Tough Brush Killer (yellow top) for much of our more stubborn vegetation such as blackberry vines, multifloral rose, poison ivy, and saplings.  It just seems to do a better job of getting rid of the difficult stuff.But for sidewalks, flagstone patios and walkways, and driveways, this Roundup Extended Control can't be beat.  When I use the purple or yellow topped Roundup on these areas, I end up having to respray every 3-5 weeks to combat all of the new weeds.  With the Extended Control, I can usually go 2-3 months before spraying again.  The bottle claims that it lasts up to 4 months, but in my experience, it generally wears off before then.  Still, it makes a big difference.  Instead of the 5-6 times that I would normally need to spray these areas during a growing season, I can usually get by with only spraying a couple times a year.Roundup products do take considerably longer to start producing noticeable die-back of weeds.  Many weed killers, such asSpectracide Weed And Grass Killer, wilt the weeds within an hour and leave noticeably dead weed \"leaves\" within 24 hours but have little luck in killing the root.  With the Roundup, I rarely notice any effect at all on the weeds until at least a few days later.  Even then, it's sometimes up to 2 weeks or more before they are fully dead.But, there is a reason for this.  Spectracide uses a an active ingredient called \"diquat\" which kills only the part of the plant that the spray physically touches...in effect, just drying it out so that the leaves and stem die quickly.  Therefore, it doesn't tend to kill the roots and so the weed continues to put forth new growth from the ground.Roundup, on the other hand, uses an active ingredient called \"phosphoenolpyruvate\" which works to destroy the entire \"metabolism\" of a weed and kills the entire plant...including the roots.  For these reasons, I much prefer the Roundup products.  Even though the results are not immediately noticeable, the longer term outcome is much better.Like with the other Roundup products, I mix it up with water in a pump pressure sprayer.  It is supposed to be safe from rain wash-off in 30 minutes.NOTE:  While I use Roundup as my primary weed killer throughout the growing season, I do find it beneficial to keep a container ofSpectracide Weed And Grass Killeron hand.  In late autumn, Roundup isn't usually as effective since it works on the weeds' metabolism...and the weeds are nearly dormant in cooler weather.  In this instance, the \"dry up\" process of the Spectracide works the best in my opinion.
B000R0WXI0 Used this to kill weeds and grass which were growing between the stones on my patio. In two days, they had turned yellow. It is &#34;extended control&#34; killer- will update if it has to be re-sprayed. So far, am well pleased with the product, and can recommend.
B000R0WXI0 Some here say there's better products out there, and there may be, but this one works pretty darn well for me.  It kills everything I need it to.  I just mix it in a pump sprayer and go!
B000R0WXI0 I've been using another well-known product for years but desired to try this one to see if it was any better. Cost wise it was more economical but did not do everything I would have liked. It works very well on grass and weeds (as long as it is not in a wetland area) but does nothing to small saplings or tough plants like blackberries. I suggest adding a small amount of dish-washing liquid to your sprayer because it helps the liquid to stay on the leaves instead of beading off.
B000R0WXI0 I gave up buying anything else. I have a pervasive weed and Bermuda grass problem twice every year, southwest desert area.  Other sprays have to be reapplied too often and have actually killed shrubs and harmed trees.  Not this one! It lasts through to the next spraying time! Do it once and forget bout it!  It is very important to apply it in the sun or warmer part of day, but too much sun or heat (in excess of 110 degrees) seem to counteract the effect.  Every year I seem to have less to spray, too!  So maybe in a few years.........
B000RNENU8 Miracle-Gro 1001501 All Purpose Liquid Plant Food Jug, 32-Ounce.  I better like it as I ordered 3 of these.  Have put some on a few plants but have not seen and change yet.
B000RNENU8 Mixed this with some water, and watered my girlfriends plant that keeps lilting in the summer heat.  Boing!  Now, it only needs to be watered once every 4 days to prevent lilting instead of twice a day.  Plus, the leaves are more vibrant and it's reflowering.  Good stuff!
B000RNENU8 I used to use fish emulsion on my garden. I got that tip from working at a garden center when I was in college. People used to buy the stuff like crazy and my mother became a fish emulsion lover because the stuff worked.Fish emulsion is stinky and messy. The stuff is so bad that it can induce vomiting. However, that was then and Miracle-Gro is now.This product works like a charm, is every big as effective a fish emulsion, but without the negatives.Follow the directions as stated on the label, water, and then bask in the compliments. It is just that easy. I prefer the liquid Miracle-Gro because it disperses quickly and is easy to use. There is no mess or unpleasant odor. It works quickly and within the matter of 1 to 2 weeks the results are very noticeable. This is the best plant food ever.
B000RNENU8 I've tried several different plant foods over a period of four decades with my vegetable garden. From everything I can tell, Miracle-Gro is the best in boosting the growth of one's plants. Other brands I've tried have produced less consistently good results. I generally add at the time of planting and follow the directions on the bottle. I would definitely recommend this product for any vegetable or flower garden.
B000RNENU8 Just to state the obvious, perhaps, you are paying for convenience here by getting it in liquid form. If you don't mind digging into the powder bag and getting your fingers a little blue (always happens with me), the granular Miracle-Gro costs about 1/3rd as much for an equal amount of NPK. However, it works great, just like granular Miracle Gro, although I would note that both forms are very short duration (7-14 days), so you might wish to consider a time release product if you have a large yard or garden.
B000RNENU8 I've used this product for years and it works great on all plants and flowers. I highly recommend for anyone.
B000RUDBMC It takes time to install and figure out the settings, I am not sure about the long term use, and I will post an update as soon as I notice the results.
B000RUDBMC Love this product! Within 4 days, my yard was poop free. Easy to set up. Seems to work great!
B000RUDBMC You'd think that an animal that relies on its hearing to find its prey would dislike this repeller. But our skunk blithely ignores the thing, goes about his/her business as usual, digging up our lawn in search of grubs. The only time I saw the skunk react, was when I set up the repeller on its usual path into the garden. Unless you have a yard with only one or a few access routes that you can set up one of these each, it's a pretty useless device, IMO. It certainly won't cover thousands of feet as advertised. The skunk simply ignores it!
B000RUDBMC I was hopeful that it would keep the Racoons away from my sweet corn patch. However one of the Racoons leaned up against it while the rest of the family had a feast on my corn. Ya gotta get up pretty early to match wits with a Raccoon. Those critters are smart. They know how to get over an electric fence by the jump and climb method. Playing a Radio constantly to scare them away does not work, they dance to the music and ignore the commercials. I am going to try a laser show next, followed by a motion detector water cannon.  I will let you know if any of this works. It isn't that I love corn, it is the challenge of out witting a Racoonn!
B000RUDBMC I live in the only township in CT that specifically prohibits any harm to the deer. Not surprisingly, they run amok in the neighborhood, destroying prized flowers and carefully grown vegetables with impunity.I have experimented on many remedies over the years. The spay-on repellent washed away too easily and smelled terrible to human too. Last year, I tried Enviro Pro Deer Scram, which lasted longer but was too expensive. I gives this ultrasound noise maker a try this year. It makes a high-pitch screech that is audible to human and therefore quite annoying in the evening, although the family dog does not appear to be too bothered by it. I add aGE 15153 Heavy Duty 24-Hour Mechanical Timerto turn it on from 11pm to 7am because most deer feed in our neighborhood at dawn. So far, our Casablanca Lilly remains unmolested. We will see if it survives the season.
B000RULG8I It is exactly as desribed but my ignorance ofmaterial used  made me have hier expextation. The door is a little flimsy and I use care when using it since I want it to last and not break too soon.
B000RULG8I Mounts easily to the wall. Very sturdy. Well made will last a long time. The hose fits great and it does have a bit of a storage space for other nozzles and things.
B000RULG8I Well built and easy to install. Love the little tuck away compartment with shelf so that you can store your attachments. You really can't ask for much more than that from something so simple. We have two of them and they've held up for a year so far with no signs of wear.
B000RULG8I I liked the fact that it will hold 150' of hose. I recently bought a 120' hose at a warehouse club. My old hose hanger broke within minutes.This hose hanger does the trick. UV protected plastic and a nifty mini-cabinet to store nozzles and the neighbors cat! For those \"up north\" the hanger can be taken down very easily. The hanger holes are key slotted so you can take it in.The plastic is UV protected and nice neutral brownish-beighish color. Remember plastic doesn't rust! Excellent product at this price point.
B000RULG8I Made with durable material (i.e. looks like it will last many years)We have a wide diameter hose that is 100 ft long and the hose fits nicely in this hanger.The storage cabinet offers a great space for small sprayer and provides an attractive look on the front of the house.
B000RUM0R4 We installed the Ultomato Tomato Plant Cage around existing growing plants.  The pictorial instructions were easy to follow.  Spacing and snapping in the clips to the three (03) stakes was a \"snap\".  Since the vine tomato plant was in full growth, we removed the existing single bamboo stakes and ties and pushed the three cage stakes into the soil prior to snapping the arms in place.  What an improvement over the flimsy stakes we originally used.  The unit comes with nine (09) adjustable support clips attached to the steel core stakes with heavy plastic coating. The unit can be used again and again - a quality cage at a reasonable cost. Recommended.The box contains:*Three 5' heavy-duty Sturdy Stakes*Nine fully-adjustable support clips and instructions.
B000RUM0R4 This is a handy cage, lightweight and easy to set up and move around.  In my case, though, I think it will be better suited to being a pepper support than a tomato support.  I grow indeterminate tomatoes inEarthBoxes, and they get very tall and very bushy.  This cage worked well while they were smaller, but before long it did not support their weight or height well.  I had to lash it to the deck railing.  There also weren't enough cross braces to tie all of the bushy branches to the cage.  However, the EarthBox also does a phenomenal job with peppers, and I think it will work well with those.
B000RUM0R4 For those gardeners who like to plant vine veggies this is perfect.  I like to grow grape tomatoes and they like to grow upwards to 8 feet high.  In order to keep a grape tomato plant growing upward instead of spreading outwards towards the ground is to tie it as it grows to a trellis or pole.  Doing this enables the plant to flower and make grape tomatoes spaced out and away from pests on the ground.  With the Gardeners Blue Ribbon TMC60 Ultomato Tomato Plant Cage you have three separate planes for the grape tomato to grow, which provides more air to the vine and space for tomatoes to grow.  My plants are just starters at this point but I have grown grape tomatoes for years.  I found in the past fastening the vine on a 2 dimensional plane was cumbersome and unnatural for the plant.  I'm looking forward to now having a 3 dimensional cage to allow the plant to stretch out.I plan on updating this post with possibly a video in a few months.  Happy gardening!
B000RUM0R4 My tomatoes were about 2' tall when I decided to cage them. I have been using stakes and ties in the past, but a gardening friend recommended that I cage instead. I received my cage via the Amazon Vine program, so it was risk free. I liked it enough that I purchased 3 additional ones for my other plants.Since my plants were already in the ground, I had to assemble the cage around the plants, which worked fine. The packaging on the product, however, was a little intense...there is a lot of plastic to unwrap and many twist ties. It seemed quite excessive. My plants are in deep planters as I'm in the process of reworking my garden space, so I wasn't able to put the ends in as far as they recommend. This makes the cage a good height. I am uncertain if it would be quite tall enough had I been able to insert the stakes as far as they suggested, though. The product material seems very good and I expect to be able to reuse them for at least 5 years.It loses one star for needing more horizontal support clips to be included in the package (I ended up using the twist ties).Caution to anyone who might be interested in ordering as a present: it came shipped box free, so it was clearly evident what it was.
B000RUM0R4 We've used the small round tomato cages that cost a couple of bucks for a few years now.  This cage is a huge improvement!  First of all it's significantly taller, our soil is muddy so I don't see our plants overgrowing this cage.  It is also sturdier than the round cages we've used.  I like the adjustability of it.  Our plants haven't come up yet for this season, but I have high hopes for this quality cage.
B000RUM0R4 I ordered this tomatoe cage for my husband. He has a tomotoe garden at the side of our house.  In the past he used wooden stakes and the tomotaoes grew every where.  We wanted more order to the chaos, so decided to order this tomotoe cage.  The plastic is light weight and easy to assemble.  Unlike other reviewers, our tomtoes have not grown very tall so we didn't have to worry about snapping the cage around the tomaotes, but that seems an easy thing to do with this prodcut.  We only ordered one of these and have more tomoatoes plants so did use wooden stakes again so we can see how the cage comapres to the stakes. Like another reviewer I wonder about the height of the cage and support for the plant.  Once the plants start growing, I can come back and do a comparison.
B000RUM0R4 I was delighted with this arrived- it is perfect. Far sturdier than any other tomato cage I have used, and versatile. I grow a wide range of indeterminate heirlooms, and this is perfect. I will be ordering more.
B000RUM0R4 This review is for the Gardeners Blue Ribbon TMC60 Ultomato Tomato Plant Cage. The cage is sturdy and provides good support, up to 4.25 feet above ground. Rating 4.5 stars.The cage is made of hard plastic.  Each stake is 5 feet (60\") in height, and 1/4\" thick. One end is slightly pointed and that end gets buried 8\" to 10\" into the ground, leaving slightly more than 4 feet above ground.  The connecting arms are 12\" long, 1/4\" thickness at the center, and 1/8\" thickness at the ends.  The circular ends of the arms snap onto the stakes. The stakes are ridged/textured so the arms don't slide up and down with weight from the plants.  The arms do glide up/down on the arms with a little bit of force in case you need to reposition them.  The stakes are sturdy and barely bend. They seem tough and durable, and are not flimsy.  The arms do bend slightly more than the stakes, but they aren't flimsy either. I would have prefered if the arms were a little bit stronger/thicker to provider stronger support.
B000RUM0R4 I planted tomato seedlings several weeks ago but did not set up the cages.  Last weekend I asked my teen son to help me do it and we pulled out a bunch of the traditional wire cages, along with the one Ultomato Cage, still in its original shipping box.  After wrestling the wire cages over the plants, trying not to break off branches or fruit, and trying to get them to stand straight in the ground, it was a breath of fresh air to break open the packaging of the Ultimato Cage and find out how easy it was to set it up, and set it around the tallest of the plants.  Since the cross bars snap on and off easily, we decided to place most of them low at the moment since the plant is not yet very tall, and we can then move them up as the plant grows, to provide support to new branches.  My son suggested I get more of that type of cage since it is so far superior to the traditional wire cages.  I came inside to try to order more and found that Amazon is not currently stocking them due to shipping difficulties.  This is so disappointing!  I ended up ordering a few more from my local ACE Hardware merchant, but as soon as Amazon has the kinks worked out I will also order more.  Ultimately, I'd like to get rid of all the wire cages and have only these, since the storage at the end of the season will be so much easier with this style of cage.  They may be a little more expensive but to me they are well worth the investment.Update: August 14th, 2013: Unfortunately, since writing my review I have become quite disappointed in the cages.  Admittedly we've had a year of heavy rain, which softened the ground, but these cages are just not holding up the weight of the plants.  Every other day I have to go out and pick them all up off the ground and try to get the stakes into the ground that little bit further so they have a chance of holding.  Now they are in so far that there isn't enough of them left to hold up the plants.  The other problem I've found is that because the bars snap on and off so easily, the weight of the plants is snapping them off, so I keep having to \"rebuild them\".  Perhaps if I try putting them on backwards (i.e. put them on the inside so the plants are leaning against them holding them on, instead of pushing against them?  But that means redoing everything all over again).  One of the cages I purchased came with a set of the bars that is missing the loop at one end so it is useless, and that cage is even weaker as a result of having fewer bars I can use with it.  The bars are also bowing quite a bit.  Just this morning I was thinking I need to google other solutions for next year since I don't think these will be it after all.The traditional metal cages are also falling over - the ground really is very wet - so perhaps in a drier year my experience would have been better.  Sorry....
B000RUM0R4 The concept is not a bad one, but in reality, the stakes are too short and too small (in diameter).  I use similar stakes in my garden for tomato plants, but I use 6 foot stakes (and they are not long enough) and the diameter is larger - and still they bend and sometimes crimp and get ruined.  This device does have a nice concept in the cross pieces, but I would hardly call this the \"Ultimate Anything\".  I think it will fulfill a need that I have for pole bean plants, but I will not be using it for tomatoes.
B000RUM0R4 I'm currently using this to grow cucumbers in a large pot.  This was super easy to put together, and has weathered a few good midwestern storms without incident. It is really ideal for what I am using it for.  I'll update if it has any trouble supporting the weight of the cukes as the summer progresses.  If things stay as is, I won't have any complaints!
B000RUM0R4 Honestly, I love it, and now I regret the time, expense and damage to my poor tomato plants caused by regular metal tomato cages. This apparatus is just like an old-fashioned Tinker-Toy, with sturdy vertical upright poles and horizontal connectors which snap on to them so that the tomato support structure can be arranged, extended and linked to any possible configuration. The best is that it can be installed around established plants, and horizontal supports added as the plant grows.
B000RUM0R4 We usually make our own homemade tomato cages with cattle fence, which is very difficult to bend. We also found that it is hard to reach through the holes in the cattle fence to pick the large tomatoes, and even some of the small cherry tomatoes that grow inside. This is a much better design than our do it yourself attempt! The Blue Ribbon Ultomato cage holds the plant up, but also has a wide opening so the ripe tomatoes are very easy to reach. If you do need to secure a section a little more it is easy to tie a section to the middle or upper stand (I use garbage bag twist ties). This is a great design and I will soon be replacing all of our homemade cattle fence stands with the Ultomato cages.
B000RUM0R4 The reason I got this product was to get my cucumbers up off the ground, as they tend to take over a lot of territory otherwise.  (See my note below on how I stake my tomatoes.)As stated in some of the other reviews, I agree that the five-foot stakes that come with this product are pretty short, but I love how this design works. The product is designed so that you can place the cross supports anywhere you want.  They don't have to be three in one location as shown in the picture.  If you need to move one cross-support up or down to accommodate a heavier, fruit-bearing branch, just do it.By the way, if you think that that 5-foot stakes will be too short, the stakes that come with this are the same standard green metal rods covered in green plastic that you can buy at any garden center.  So -- if you want more than 4 feet of stake showing above the ground, you can get longer green stakes at a garden center and use the three 5-foot stakes that come with this unit somewhere else.  The cross-supports will clip on the longer stakes in exactly the same way and you'll still be able to adjust them as needed.The bottom line is I love the simplistically clever design.  If you cage tomatoes, these are a good alternative to regular wire cages.  I just wouldn't use them with any plant that gets TOO heavy or has to withstand high winds.  As for my own personal use, this product will work just fine for my cucumbers.**RE: Tomatoes -- After many years of trial and error, I now stake my tomatoes using a single 2x2x8 pounded one-foot deep about 5 or 6 inches from the plant, then pinch off all suckers, tying up the main vine along the stake as the vine grows.  Using the single stake method is, by far, the best I've found for better production on tomato plants.  I also get more plants in less garden space, and it's easier to work around them, too. Cages were always a pain -- falling over with heavy growth, bending in high wind, and breaking.  I learned the single-stake method from a tomato grower who moved here from Romania, and after a bit of online research I learned that commercial tomato growers use similar methods in greenhouses, hanging strings from the greenhouse ceiling.  Because I don't have huge greenhouse, I tried the 2x2x8 single stake method--with great results.  That said, if I was told I had to use a cage, I would choose the Ultomato cage design over traditional wire cages, as the modular design provides greater flexibility to change/adjust the set-up as the plant grows.
B000RUM0R4 I've used these cages for the past four growing seasons and I won't go back.  In the size the come they are great for your typical determinate tomato.  I find that for the big bushy heirloom indeterminate varieties that I like to grow that I need bigger cages.  No problem, I buy a couple and make the cage fit the variety.  Four poles will do for most, but I find using six really gives me room to let the plant spread out.  That allows the plant to dry better and helps reduce fungus problems.  They cost a bit, but they last.  I use a rubber mallet to drive them in, and only loose a few poles a year (out of about 30).  These are so easy to use that I can't ever see myself going back to the old rigid cages.
B000RUM0R4 My wife and I love the adjustable arms that give a lot of flexibility.  First tomato cage we've seen that can do that.  Easy to assemble and use.
B000RUM0R4 I'm a long-time gardener who has had to give up the ground game and now must plant in 5-gallon bucket planters (SIPs) on a dirtless back patio. I was really hoping this Ultomato tomato cage would be the answer to my prayer for a structure I could set down inside my bucket planters, then remove and store at the end of the season. Oh, so close...but no cigar. The cross-pieces are just a little too long to allow the vertical rods to stand straight in the bucket, which puts unnecessary tension on the snap-on ends if you try to force it to work. I do hope the Ultomato designers will consider shortening the crosspieces slightly in the future, because this would be a fantastic product for my purposes if they would.Now, that said, I'm going to attempt to plant a bucket planter with the Ultomato just standing on the patio on the outside of the bucket, which does work fine, to see how well it supports a tomato plant once it gets large enough to need the supports. A set of crosspieces can be placed right at the top of the bucket so the bucket itself helps hold the Ultomato up until the tomato grows up into it, then those crosspieces could be moved up to the top. It could be that the weight of the 5-gallon SIP (which I make with gravel in the bottom per Pete Sims' design) will be sufficient to keep the planter itself from blowing over; maybe the Ultomato arranged outside and tied to the bucket won't go anywhere, especially when the tomato gets large enough to press down on the structure and keep it stable.If I don't come back here for an update, you can assume it worked well in the latter case and I'm too busy canning tomatoes to update my review! And, if that is the case, I'm sure I'll get more of these. I'd like to try growing some winter squash on one.
B000RUM0R4 Put mine together today and think this is a terrific idea.  I have quite a few of the large, metal cages that fold flat, but they don't fit in my earthboxes fully expanded.  These will not only fit, but the support can be customized to really provide support where it's needed.I don't buy the cheap, circular wire cages anymore because they don't hold up well, aren't as flexible as square or triangular cages and I prefer supports that fold flat for off-season storage.If a person had several of these cages, the possible configurations and uses are nearly endless.  The poles can be connected and uses to support peas, cucumbers or many other vegetables that need support.My only complaint would be that I think the price is a little high, but the prices are high on all of the decent supports and cages.
B000RUM0R4 I recently installed the Ultomato Cage on my patio tomato plant in a pot and it is working well so far.Pros:* Sturdy* Lightweight* Green color blends with tomato plant* Installs around already-growing tomato plant* Can place cross bars at whatever height is desired - place lower when the plant is smaller and move up as the plant grows* Triangular center cross-section is small enough to support the stem of a plant and also to add twine if additional tying is necessary* Disassembles for compact storage* Bamboo and plastic construction will not rust or corrodeCons:* A little more time consuming to set up compared to the 4-sided fold flat metal tomato cages* Might not be large enough or sturdy enough for large tomato plants with heavy tomatoes (eg, Beefsteak) - time will tell
B000RUM0R4 \"Do your tomato plants overtake the garden?\"  You bet!!!  We have tomato plants growing crazy this year, and have been trying to corral them so the other garden plants can breath and survive.  We have been using the common metal circular 3 ring style that requires daily maintenance to keep the branches under control.  This year, we got the Ultimate Tomato Cage for the one huge tomato plant that was missing a cage and invading surrounding plants.  WHAT A FANTASTIC INVENTION!  It was easy to put together, and to rearrange the arms after sinking the 3 stakes in the ground.  The stakes are plastic coated metal and very sturdy, and the 9 arms are plastic (not sure how long they will last in the hot AZ. sun), but I think more arms can be ordered, and also stakes, for making a bigger square cage.  I think we may be purchasing a few more of these wonderful cages, possibly for training some squash or cucumber branches up, instead of on the ground, but for it's intended purpose, tomatoes....they are the best!!!
B000RUM0R4 While a part of me still wonders if this is significantly better than a tomato cage or even a few well-positioned stakes, I can't deny that it is awesome to have around.  The assembly was easy, and I was amazed at how sturdy it was--I always worried about those flimsy tomato cages flopping over.  No, sir, this one is quite secure and so easy to move around.  This holds a new plant well, but can also be placed around an already existing plant without too much drama.  Good quality and should be appreciated by gardeners.
B000RUM0R4 Update 07/19/2013: Well, the cage has failed. My moderately-sized tomatoe plant has already proved to be too heavy for this cage. The tomatoes are just getting started and the tomatoes are going to be about medium-sized. One of the horizontal rungs has already sunk under the weight of a few of the branches and now I have an unsupported tomatoe plant.Super easy assembly and well-packed. Adjustable arms are a nice feature.I do have some doubts about how well it will support my full-grown tomato plants, but so far, so good. These stakes do have some give to them - I've seen these sold before with out the side arm supports - they are a plastic/resin type material with a wire down the center.I assembled mine BEFORE I put them into the ground - no problems there. The side support arms are easy to move around, if needed. This cage can be taken apart at the end of the season for easy storage, unlike the metal cages which take up way more space to store.I'll definitely report back at the end of the growing season. So far, no complaints!
B000RUM0R4 I was very disappointed in this purchase.  It's my fault because I should have read the description in more detail.  This is like a plastic erector set, and not very sturdy, and really not very good with tomatoes.  It worked somewhat better with my peppers and onion plants, but not with the tomatoes.  I would never recommend this product to anyone.
B000RUM0R4 I've been a tomato gardener for 20 years now, and support means everything.  This \"cage\" might be good for a determinate tomato, but for an out of control, constantly growing indeterminate variety, especially with large fruits, this will be useless.First off, this item came ridiculously bubble wrapped, and was extremely frustrating to get undone.  I managed to break off 3 snaps, rendering 3 of the supports useless.  Is that my fault?  Yes, but in my defense, the bubble wrap was so tight and glued, and wasn't easy to open up.The stakes themselves are too short, 5' and \"Strong steel core stakes\" is laughable at best.  These \"Strong steel core stakes\" are the same stakes available at Home Depot, Lowes, or any local nursery, and while they're okay, \"strong\" is not a word I'd use to describe them.  You want strong, get rebar.I ended up putting these \"Strong steel core stakes\" around an obelisk that I am using for my cucumbers, which fit perfectly when I attached the 2 remaining rows of the supports together.
B000RUM0R4 I first bought these &#34;Ultomato Cages&#34; four years ago, after having struggled with multiple other varieties of tomato cages.  I LOVED that these cages broke down into small pieces, which made them MUCH easier to store, AND I loved that I could personalize how close-together the horizontal supports were.  They were fantastic for the first two seasons, but then fell apart.  Please read below.~~~~PROS~~~~~ Tall, Five-Foot Stakes-- the height of these cages means that I can bury the first six inches or so (for support/strength) and still have PLENTY of height for my tomatoes to grow with support.  Each cage comes with three stakes, each of which are steel stakes coated in a thick plastic coating.~ Sturdy Supports-- each cage comes with nine plastic support clips that can be placed anywhere on the cage that works for that plant.  For bushier tomatoes, I always put the clips closer together near the bottom of the cage, while for leggier tomatoes, I spread them out more.  The GOOD thing is that you can buy extra supports, so you can add as many as you would like.~ Easy-to-Store-- Because this cage breaks down completely, it is VERY easy to store for the winter.~~~~CONS~~~~~ Begins to Crack After One Season, and to Break After Only Two Seasons--  The plastic coating on each stake began to crack at the end of the first season, and by the end of the second season, the steel was VERY rusty and VERY fragile.  The ends had broken off of eight of my twelve stakes by the time I set them up for the third season, and most were in five or six pieces by the middle of season three.~ The Ends Bend Easily-- Despite being made of steel, the ends bend easily, which makes it hard to push these into hard soil.I would absolutely recommend these supports as long as you don't expect them to last season-after-season.
B000RUM0R4 For the price I paid for these I expected them to do very well holding my tomatoes, well they don't.  I expected them to hold the tomatoes up nice and straight, but they sprawl all over the place and have to be attached to the cage.  I don't feel they work any better than wooden stakes or the wire cages and are not worth the price I paid for them.
B000RUM0R4 This cage is great since you can assemble it piece by piece around an already tall tomato plant without worrying about damaging the it with a traditional cage.  It does get a little tall and unwieldy so I use garden twine and tent stakes to anchor it in place.
B000RUM0R4 This seems like a great answer to a number of problems, so I am giving it a 4 star and will wait until Fall to review it again.  The standards are sturdy and substantial.  At five feet, it gives you a good amount to drive into the ground and still have height to use.  The cross-bars are substantial and the clip into place.  They seem like they will gold well, but will have to wait until a full load of tomatoes is hanging on them.  The year end cleanup is what I think will be the best deal.  Normal wire cages bend when trying to remove the old vines and they rust.  This plastic coating should solve the rust problem and having the cage come apart in pieces should make cleanup easier.  I can see getting several seasons out of this while I usually have to replace wire cages every year.  We'll have to see.
B000RUM0R4 I like the design of this tomato cage, simple though it may be. I love that it is versatile and can easily be added to established tomato plants that have already started. It is easy to snap together and install. We did tomato starters this year, but since we've had such a late start in our area our starters have gotten HUGE, so I like the design of this cage, I think it will be easier to use than a regular cage which can't be adjusted.For the price and design, definitely recommended.
B000RUM0R4 I have always used the circular  wire cages that make such a confused mess in your garage all winter, and I won't be able to replace them all (because of cost) but I really kind of like this one.  It is at least as sturdy as what I've been using, easy to use, and \"open\" enough to reach the tomatoes in the middle.I have to say that it is probably taller than a tomato will ever grow in my short season northern garden but hope springs eternal.  If you live in a normal climate I think you will love it.
B000RUM0R4 I have used wire tomato cages for years, and have found that they are have their limits. The wires do tend to get bent, and adjusting mid season for new growth in plants becomes increasingly difficult.The advantage of this tomato cage is how it can be adjusted as the growing season goes along, and because the plastic making up the stakes is firm, yet flexible, it does not have the bending problems that traditional wire cages have.The ability to adjust the height of the supports is very useful, as the plant grows throughout the year.As a product for long term use, I cannot seeing this having the issues that traditional wire cages have.
B000RUM0R4 I have tried SO MANY things to stake my tomatoes. The cheap cages. Bamboo stakes. Bamboo stakes with twine. Triangle cages I thought would do the trick, but still weren't as adjustable as I'd like.But these. These are awesome! You can move the side sections on the fly as you need to which is great. Setup is easy and storage is flat. You can even just use the stakes if you want. This would also work great for lightweight climbers like peas.I LOVE these tomato cages and plan on buying a couple more this year and slowly stocking up on them as the years go by. I think these will last for quite a few years, too, so your investment won't be a one year deal.
B000RUM0R4 Anyone who has grown tomatoes year after year knows how quickly they grow out of control, regardless of how you \"train\" them or stake them. We have used the typical circular wire tomato cages, but they've always seemed a bit flimsy and too small; and you have the problem of storing them the rest of the year.When this new tomato cage arrived, I was immediately skeptical of the quality because it was just wrapped in bubble wrap with a shipping label attached, and our UPS driver just tossed it onto the front porch. Nevertheless, the parts were all included and in good condition. After snapping the horizontal plastic support pieces into place, it was easy to embed the plastic-coated metal vertical stakes into the planter box and plant the tomato plants around it. It's much taller than the adjacent wire cages we're also using, and it appears that it will be able to support the tomato plants throughout the growing season.I will try to remember to update this review later in the growing season; the plants are just too small right now to know how effective this support system will be.Another benefit is that it will be easy to disassemble and store the Ultomato Cage throughout the winter.
B000RUM0R4 I am so delighted with this ULTOMATO TOMATO PLANT CAGE! I've used the wire circular tomato cages for more than 25 years, and every year my tomato plants far exceed the height of the cage, resulting in the cage tipping over, tomato plants breaking or tomatoes laying on the ground. This tomato cage, however, is 5 feet tall and, although plastic, very sturdy. The legs of the cage plant firmly into the ground, which should result in no more tipping. Although my tomato plants aren't at full height at this point in the growing year, I expect little or no tomato plant to rise above this cage. It's about time someone came along with a better tomato cage! I will be back to buy several more!
B000RUM0R4 We've had some Gardener's Supply metal cages for years, and thought they were as good as it gets.  Nuh-uh.  These green gems snap together easily, are TALL and will adjust as your tomatoes grow.  If you're delayed in installing them, they can be fitted around existing plants without damaging them.  Genius!
B000RUM0R4 This arrived bent. Then, when trying to straighten it out, it broke, but still worked out well enough to work OK. So, it could have been made sturdier.
B000RUM0R4 I was very excited to receive this Gardeners Blue Ribbon Ultomato Tomato Plant Cage.  I am planning on using it when my tomato plants get larger.  But for now it is staking up my raspberry bush.  And doing a great job of it!  This was sooooo simple to use straight out of the box.  The stakes are made from a sturdy material that won't rust or rot.  The clips are easy to place around the plant so that you don't destroy the plant while trying to place the stakes around it.  Also, the clips do not have to be parallel to each other.  So if part of your plant is heavy on one side and then on up a ways, it gets heavier on the other side, you can arrange the horizontal clips in any configuration you like to best support your plant.  When done this cage is very easy to store.  You just unclip the horizontal bars and everything wraps up with a twisty tie until next year.  These will definitely be something I purchase more of for the garden.  Some real thought went into these product!
B000RUM0R4 I have struggled with tomato cages for years and though this might be a solution. The long stakes are just green plant stakes, I had a bit of trouble getting them in the ground, and the side supports went on easy. Vine says I have to review in 30 days now, tomatoes are 17 inches high, will report back at the end of the season.
B000RUM0R4 I like this cage a lot.  The arms can be adjusted to where you want them, and snapped around the plant instead of put over it, potentially breaking the vines.  It's as tall as other stakes and cages I've bought.  The problem with the metal ones is they get bent up really bad and it makes them hard to reuse more than a year or two.  This one looks like it will last.  In fact, I've got this actually placed between two jellybean tomato plants.  I've got each plant staked with a plain straight stake, and then this between them with the branches trained and supported on the arm supports.  This is going to make it a lot easier to get to the little tomatoes as they ripen, especially when you want to reach and just eat some off the vine.  With the branches going back and forth through here, the clusters show up well.
B000RUM0R4 It is still early days for a full review - I think if these make it to next year in the garage I'll have to edit this review up to five stars. Seems like nothing survives my garage...The poles are very sturdy and provide plenty of room for large (and growing larger ^_^) tomato plants or other plants that vine out of control.  I've got it supporting one of my bigger tomato plants and it is doing just dandy.The poles are some kind of plasti-composition with little bumps on them which I think gives them a weird feel but it allows the plants to grasp better too I suppose.  These poles are taller than I am.
B000RUM0R4 We just staked some of our tomatoes and two Knock Out roses with these. Unlike another reviewer our stakes were solid, the same kind you get at your local big box hardware store.  We did sink the stakes about 6 inches in the ground (just like we do other stakes).  We did the roses because they are so filled with blooms they needed support.  It was nice these were green because they aren't visible at all. We found ours locally.
B000RUM0R4 This is a solid tomato plant cage, and can easily recommend.Pros:- Flexible arms (guide them to the fruit laden branches for support)- Tough stakes - hard to bend, will keep it grounded.- Can place it around an already growing plant (with a little effort, but much easier than a regular wire cage) without damaging the plant.- Stores flat - can reuse next year, and the one after.Neutral:- Look for sales, you can get them for a  lot less at other stores.Recommended, especially in the $5-7 dollar range.
B000RUM0R4 Unfortunately the product came damaged during shipping, and it was not as sturdy as I thought it would be. It seems to be doing better than the cheap cages I have been using. I wish the product would be wider to support the plant as it grows bigger.
B000RUM0R4 As someone that has fought with more than my share of rusty or bent traditional tomato cages, I was happy to see this alternative.  Granted, it will be awhile to see if it shows weather wear, this is a solid cage that can be used to grow more than just tomatoes.  Any item from food to flowers could benefit from the climbing range and support.I prefer the shape of the support over the traditional round cage.  That circle shape was constantly getting dented or broken.  It just didn't make sense.  This gives more structured support and the greater height means I won't have plants breaking from climbing too high.I also found it easy to move as well as store.Overall, this is a great way to give your plants the best start to produce the most product...whether it be fruits, vegetables, or flowers.
B000RUM0R4 The tomato went together really well.  It plants tomatos great!  The vines really go together really well.  They go right into the ground.  Great tomatos!  They hang really well.
B000RUM0R4 I am actually using this for cucumbers instead of tomatoes and so far it's working great!  It was easy to assemble and fit my pot nicely.  I have very little space, so I'm growing most everything in large pots and having something like this really comes in handy for plants that like to climb.  I am very pleased with it.  It appears to be very sturdy as well so I hope to get lots of years of use from it.
B000RUM0R4 Don't expect this cage can hold the weight of beefsteak tomato. This cage is designed for grape or cherry tomatoes.I agree with other reviewer that this cage is very sturdy. It is sturdy for small tomato plant. I have about half dozen tomato plants and I use the cage for \"sun sugar\" tomato, a cherry type. For bigger tomato such as Burpee big mama and other large paste tomato, I use the larger cages from burpee.com or gardeners.com
B000RUM0R4 Seems like a good idea, create brackets that clip to some of those standard corrugated green garden stakes, then sell as a package. The problem is, this was shipped just in plastic and bubble wrap, with nothing to protect the stakes, so it showed up totally bent (and trying to bend it back to shape causes the stake to crack in half). I uploaded a pic to the product page if you want to have a look.My suggestion to the company would be to sell just the brackets (easy to ship) and have people use their own stakes. Or send them in a box.
B000RUM0R4 I have tried various methods to tie, stake, cage, etc. tomato plants for years. I thought I'd found the perfect solution with this product. However, I have not. I should have noticed from the picture, that the cage (stakes) are merely green plant stakes. That kind the ultimately don't work to hold up tomatoes! The length of the stakes is really on the short side as well as the diameter of the stakes (a bit too thin) allowing them to bend rather easily.Putting the cage together was pretty easy and I do like that cross section. My tomato plants aren't full grown yet. I intend to come back and edit the review accordingly. For now, I'll say it's \"just okay\".
B000RUM0R4 As with most people I know in the Northwest, we are avid gardeners and optimists to the max when it comes to being able to raise tomato plants.  Still, we have figured out that you need short times for ripening and you need to keep your plants well supported.To that end, I decided to give this product a try.  Things that really interested me were the following:1.  Compact storage:  There is NEVER enough room to store all of the garden stuff an that especially applies to tomato cages.  Most are very bulky, but this one breaks down into small and easy to store pieces.2.  Moveable supports:  I have not yet found a tomato plant that will put it branches just where the preformed supports are in most tomato cages.  Thus, having the ability to move a support to where it is needed is great.3.  Metal stakes that are plastic coated:  The base construction of this unit uses plant supports that I have used for years in the garden.  They are basically hollow metal stakes that are plastic coated.  I have several that are over 15 years old and are still providing garden structure support.4.  Extra supports are available:  Amazon carries extra support cross members, but there is a catch, you have to have an order that totals more than $25 or they will delete it from your order!!!!  So, if you think you want extra supports, order them at the same time you order your plant supports!Here is what I liked about working with the product:1.  Very easy to assemble and the assembly can be accomplished either before the plant is in the ground or after the plant is in the ground.  Personally, I think it is much easier to put the unit together, install it in the ground, and then plant your plant.  Keep in mind that you MUST insert the legs of this unit at least 12 inches into your ground if you want it to provide good support for a heavy tomato plant!!!!!!!!!!!!  that is NOT mentioned anywhere in their instructions, but it is what most gardener's would do if they were building their own support.2.  Once assembled and installed in the ground, it is VERY easy to move support members around!!!  Remember to follow the directions about clipping the supports on from the inside and NOT from the outside.3.  The green color of the materials disappear into the foliage of the plants making it more visually appealing.Here is what I did not like about the product:1.  Amazon limiting the ability to order extra supports unless your total order is more than $25.  The way it is worded on the website, it looks like free shipping is limited unless the order is more than $25.  That is not what they are saying,  your ability to order it at all is limited to the fact that your total order must be at least $25 or they will remove it from your order.  This makes no sense to me since there are many low cost items that you can order on Amazon.  Thus, if you order some batteries for $5 and supports for $15 for a total order of $20, they will remove the supports from the order and only ship out the $5 of batteries!  What sense does that make???????????Overall, I am currently happy with the product, but will need to come back and update this after the growing season to be able to add how well this works with plants as they grow.  I would recommend this to anyone looking for a good and flexible support system.  Just remember my caution about including any additional supports you want with your order.
B000RUM0R4 Everyone by now has seen these green plastic coated garden poles, they are everywhere. What this company has done is create clips that hold fast to the 4 ft size of these poles to make a sturdy triangular cage, and sturdy it is. The reason I am giving it 5 stars is because buying the poles and clips together as a cage is a very good value. The clips are approx a dollar each, and the poles are a bit more, so getting them as a kit saves money. Gardener's Blue Ribbon also sells the cross bar \"ties\" separately, so you can add them as needed when your plant gets large. Obviously, I am reviewing this in May, so my tomato plants are not quite at that stage - yet. I am buying more of these to replace the conical wire cages (good riddance), so let that be my ultimate review.
B000RUM0R4 I've used these cages for two seasons now and just got around to writing a review. I'll probably use them next season, too, but I think potential buyers should be aware of some things.The \"cage\" comes as a set of three stakes and nine plastic bars; both ends of the bar snap onto a stake, usually assembled as you see in pictures (three groups of three bars, although you can really space them however you want). I've lost a couple plastic bars over the years, but I notice some local garden centers sell replacement bars, probably for this reason. I suppose you could also get them to add another set of bars to the cage. The stakes are 5 ft tall, but you'll have to put them into the ground a bit, making the effective height a bit less.The stakes are also somewhat thin, and the bars are easily removable. This is good because it makes for easy storage but can be bad because heavy plants--like tomatoes--can easily push the bars off the stakes (probably why I've lost a couple). Together with the thin stakes, this makes the whole cage somewhat light and definitely NOT suitable for indeterminate tomatoes. You may have better luck with determinates, but I've never grown any true determinates in these to test. I've given up on using these for tomatoes and have stuck to using them with bell peppers, jalapenos (probably could have done without any cage on those, but I had some extra), and cucumbers, which I more or less successfully tried to make climb up the cage. The removable--and movable--plastic bars on the cage were very helpful for this. I didn't have an issue with the weight of the cucumber fruit weighing down the cage, toppling it over, or breaking the bars off, but everything was much lighter here than my tomatoes. I suspect other plants like peas would also work well (maybe spread it out instead of putting it like a cage, depending on how you plant them). I'd hate to try it with melons or squash, but if I was desperate for space and had nothing else I might see how it works.In summary, these cages are OK, but you'll need to stick to lighter plants: *maybe* determinate tomatoes, definitely *not* indeterminates, and besides tomatoes otherwise lighter plants like cucumbers or peppers. If they didn't market these for tomatoes (including the name of the cage itself!), I might rate them a little higher. They aren't horrible, but you'll have to be careful how you use them. For tomatoes themselves, after having used a variety of tomato support methods, I decided to make a \"Florida weave\" last season with not much more than metal T-posts and twine. (There are also a few other \"homemade\" solutions out there.\") Do a Web search for this if you're interested--it worked out well for me and was much less expensive than buying cages. They're also easy to store, and I suspect the metal posts will last me much, much longer than these cages.
B000RUM0R4 This tomato (or any plant) cage is sturdy, adjustable and reusable. The three supporting poles are made of a strong metal core with a hard plastic covering. This covering has ridges which keeps the adjustable horizontal attachment bars from slipping down the pole when the weight of the tomato branches increases with the growing season. I have accidentally broken off many stems/branches in the past when trying to accommodate the growing plant within a fixed support cage - the plant grows or needs extra support when branches become heavy with fruit, and the traditional fixed metal cages do not allow adjustments without bending/breaking stems in the process. This design allows you accommodate the plant as often as needed by adjusting the horizontal bars of the cage as often as you need to.  They snap on and off easily and can be placed anywhere on the vertical poles. By connecting several cages in a row, you can build a network of supports for many plants.  This is the best method I have tried so far, compared to fixed square and round cages and wooden stakes. I have yet to use it a second season, and the plastic horizontal bars may not hold up to years of wear and tear - they are plastic and less sturdy than the poles. But each cage comes with many bars, so extras are available in the event of a breakage.
B000RUM0R4 Makes growing tomatoes much easier. The cage could be used for growing tomato plants and other climbing fruits and vegetables. It is literally a \"snap\" to use, as the horizontal supports, snap on and off with ease. Three stakes and nine adjustable support clips for changeable support throughout the plant's growth. The stakes have a steel core and a thick plastic coating. It may also be used , flattened as a trellis.
B000RUM0R4 I moved from a ranch to a condo, and needed to start over with my approach to vegetable gardening.  I knew that I would be starting with an heirloom tomato in a City Pickers box, and when I saw this tomato cage offered via the Amazon Vine program, I grabbed it.Because it takes a while to see the longevity of a product that will be in the sun most of the day, I can't comment yet on the durability of the product.  Let's just say that I am a bit skeptical about the cross pieces lasting longer than one season, as it they are constructed out of plastic.  The uprights are constructed out of steel coasted with plastic, but they are rather lightweight.PROS:The tomato cage was easily assembled.  I had it put together and in the box in no time. The design is very clever.  I like it a lot better than the wire tomato cages that are metal cones (seeGalvanized Tomato Cage 33\"X12\"-3 Ring/3 Legs) which I have found to be flimsy and easily bent out of shape.  (At my previous residence I had the most success with homemade cages assembled from leftover field fencing supported by metal fence posts. Field fence has generous spacing between the wires.)CONS:The directions say to put the cage about 8 - 10 inches deep into the soil.  That does not seem very deep if one expects to support a large tomato plant.  I had no control over the depth that I had to set mine in, as it's in a box. (see product images) I get the feeling that once my tomato plant gets to a  large size that I am going to need to fasten the cage to the balcony rail to keep it from toppling over.  But, that's speculation at this point.I know that this review is incomplete at this point, and I do apologize about that.  But I do intend to post updates throughout the upcoming growing season.  Stay tuned for further developments....Three stars for now, as I am a bit skeptical about how well this cage is going to work out.UPDATE:  June 4, 2013I have had the cage in place for a month.  I must say that my opinion of this cage is slowly sinking in the west.  I had to add a row of string as an additional support for my young tomato plant.  I also had to fasten it to my balcony railing with zip ties, as even a moderate breeze would send it leaning to the side.  I decided to anchor it down before it tipped over and took my tomato with it.  See product images.Final opinion:  A waste of money unless you have some way to support it.
B000RUM0R4 This is only my 3rd year growing tomatoes so I am still a novice gardener. Since I live in a condo, all my gardening is done in containers--usually 5-gallon buckets. Even though this tomato cage is not intended for containers, I was able to make it work because it is so adjustable and versatile.The cage arrives UNASSEMBLED but assembly is easy. There are 3 5-ft. stakes and 9 support clips. The support clips snap onto the stakes very easily (it reminded me of a large Tinker Toy project). What's great is that, as your plant grows, you can readjust the space between the support rods to support your plant's branches and fruit/vegetables. This isn't something you can do with most other tomato cages.As noted in the product description, the stakes have a steel core with plastic around them. They are VERY strong. However, the support clips are completely plastic and I would recommend not being to rough with them during assembly or readjustment during growth of your plant. I did not have any breakage but, in \"forcing\" the cage to fit my 5-gallon bucket, the clips were definitely bending.I just put my tomato plants in yesterday so I can't speak yet to how well the cage functions in supporting the plant's growth, but since it is so adjustable, I can't imagine there being much of a problem. If there is, I will update my review once my plants have grown a few feet tall.I have never had a cage this tall so I'm looking forward to having less work this year in keeping my plants supported as they grow and bear fruit!I took a picture of my cage in the container with the small tomato plant to show customers, but unfortunately this company is not allowing customers to share their own images of the product.4 stars for now. This may change as my plant grows.
B000RUM0R4 Great tomato cage that can be added to your tomato plant at any time (and adjusted, as needed).  It's sturdy, adjustable, and green (it blends it with the plant and is barely noticeable).
B000RUM0R4 These vegetable support stakes are a nice 5 feet tall which leaves you at least 4 to 4 1/2 feet once you get it stuck in the ground.  They are coated metal and went into the ground easily on the pointed in.  I didn't even have to use a rubber mallet on them.  If you do have to use a rubber mallet on them, be sure to protect the coating on the stake with a piece of cloth before pounding.  They come with 9 connectors that are 12inches long and snap into place easily so you can configure them anyway you want.  You can make a triangle or free form shape.  They are green and unobtrusive looking.  Rather than tomatoes, I used them for my pole beans that are growing like skyscrapers.  After the pole beans are done, I will move them to my tomatoes which aren't very tall yet.  I'm am pleased with this product and would recommend it.  My only concern would be if the connectors will break of their end clips or not as I reconfigure them.  So far, no problem.
B000RUM0R4 We plant 20-30 tomato plants each year, plus I use tomato cages for climbing plants, like peas.  The Gardeners Blue Ribbon Tomato Plant Cage is a sturdy, versatile product that not only can be used for any size tomato plant, but can also be arranged for other uses.The cage comes disassembled, with three tall poles and 9 side pieces. You just put the poles in the ground and then snap on the side pieces in any arrangement you would like.The price is higher then your typical cage and I would be a little concerned about keeping track of the side pieces once you put the cages away after the growing season. However, the durability and flexibility of this product outweighs the cons.
B000RUM0R4 Even though this product appears a little flimsy, it's lack of rigidity is actually a benefit over some other more rigid tomato plant growers I've used.  I've been happy with it so far.
B000RUM0R4 At first glance this seemed pretty flimsy. The plastic coating fooled me into thinking that it was solid plastic for a moment.  But it's plastic coated steel, which makes for a robust and probably long-lived outdoor product.  Once assembled, it can actually stand on its own on a solid surface which is something one of those flimsy not-quite-wire-but-almost cages can't do.  It looks like it's going to support even the heaviest stalks without tipping over, which is something I have longed for in my tomato cages.  I'm tired of having to readjust them virtually every day.The modular design is really brilliant.  Getting bonked in the head by the uprights a couple of times during assembly is a fair trade-off for dealing with the wobbly, never-quite-fits-together-properly quality of lesser cages.  The cross-bars snap on and snap off easily making for compact winter storage as well as easy reassembly.The price is more than fair for what you get. I look forward to many years of tomato-growing with the Ultomato
B000RUM0R4 I bought tomato cages for $.99 each at the hardware store. I'll use this for flat beans. The one good thing is that you can do that, open the panels and make a \"wall\" of them, if you want. I hope for the price that it lasts more than one season.
B000RUM0R4 Seems like a good idea, though perhaps it should be used for plants that are going to stay a reasonably small size (unlike, say, Sungold tomatoes). Of course I won't really know how well it works until I have it supporting a fully grown tomato plant, and I won't have any of those for about ninety days. However, since Vine members are now required to have reviews in within thirty days, I guess this will have to do for now. Perhaps I can add something else later in the year.Sep 18. Still doing a good job of supporting a \"Goliath\"plant which has already produced around 20lbs of big tomatoes. One of the nice things about it is being able to move the crossbars, which I have done as the plant has grown. It's now around four feet tall. Very pleased with it.
B000RUM0R4 This was a great addition to our garden this year as I had planted my tomato plant before getting this.  I was able to add it after-the-fact without breaking the branches because I added the posts and then the supports.I love that you can adjust the supports to put them where you need the support the most, and that you can move them as the plant grows.This type of plant cage also makes it take up VERY little space when you need to store it.
B000RYL1BQ The current picture photo shows folding wings which can extend out to turn the compost.  The unit I received has no moving parts, but a welded piece that goes out into two posts.  Ultimately I'm happier with this design as it feels like it has much less change of breaking.  Although based on the looks of the 'winged' one it appears as it might have been easier to insert into the compost pile.It gets the job done, allowing you to insert it into the compost pile, turn and get it worked up.  I have let my compost bin go too long all to often, forgetting to rotate and move the compost, but this aerator is an easy way to get it stirred up.
B000RYL1BQ I started my first compost last summer.  Before then, my sum experience with compost was dumping coffee, peels, and veggie parts in a trench in my garden.  I made some mistakes with theGood Ideas EZCJR-BLK 7-Cubic-Foot Compost Wizard Jr., particularly in its placement.  It was in a back corner of my yard and even though I shoveled it out for a few months, eventually it ended up under a few feet of snow.  My sum total of compost was about a gallon.  I can't believe I put that much stuff in there and ended up with such a small amount.Back to the drawing board.  I went back to my garden compost and discovered that I had a lot of rich dirt that had continued after I abandoned it.  That is where is used the aerator, to pull the compost out and rotate it and move it around the garden.  The first few lifts of it were much heavier and it wasn't as easy to pull out.  But this aerater is exactly what I needed to rotate the ground.  It opens up as I pull it out, and it makes it do a lot, very easily.
B000RYL1BQ My daughter picked the compost project in last school year (middle school). It turned out not too bad for our garden. So, I kept doing compost for fertilizing our garden. This compost aerator is easy to get into the center of the compost pile. But the wings (or fins) at the bottom usually stick together and don't move the compost. Once a while, one of the wing does open when I pull this aerator out, but not always. Not sure if I does not use this tool correctly or I just got a bad unit.
B000RYL1BQ I agree with other reviewers (all of whom I read before ordering) about the wings not opening with regularity when plunging this tool into the compost pile.That being said, this tool has great thrust, is easy for even my arthritic hands to use, and doesn't require a lot of upper-body strength to do a reasonable turning session of a single compost pile.  I've taken the other reviewers suggestions to plunge it in at a slight angle then give it a twist to open the wings, before pulling it up. This seems to work well.  This is also how I discovered that my beloved BioBag Food Waste Bio Bags, 3 Gallon 25 ea that I use for composting, are NOT degrading at all (as they came up impaled on the wings), so now I simply empty them into my bins, and throw the bags into the regular trash.I'm hopeful that this tool speeds up the process of composting in my bins, especially now that the warmer weather is coming.  I do love all of that glorious black soil!
B000RYL1BQ I actually didn't realize there was a tool specific for this purpose until I saw this!I have a large compost bin, and tried using a shovel and a pitchfork to turn it over (which it needs regularly to make good compost).  Neither was effective or easy.This aerator is both -- it is a huge help in making compost.  Compost gets clumped very easily, especially during the rainy season, and this really helps to aerate it, as well as turn things under and keep things generally rotated.  I definitely recommend this to someone who composts a lot.
B000RYL1BQ This compost aerator is sturdy with quality, solid construction. A great tool for turning or churning your compost pile/bin.Help other customers find the most helpful reviews

B000RYL1BQ The materials that this Aerator was manufactured from, were worthless.  I took it out of the box, and went outside to stir my compost pile.  Two days ago, I had removed the sticks, which had mixed into the vines, leaves and such that were in the pile. This left me with about a foot of well degraded plant material, mixed with dirt, and random fine roots.  I started to jab the pointed  end into the pile. However, the wings which are suppose to fold down and then stir the pile, simply stayed up. I would pull them down manually, and when it was placed back into the pile, they'd immediately fold back up. &#34;At least the bottom tip is mixing up the mulch&#34; I thought to myself.  After about 15-20 minutes, I looked at the tip, which was bent to the side about 45 degrees. The cheap paint on the steel (?) had flaked off the tip too.Usually garden tools last a lifetime. In fact, I have garden tools I inherited from uncles long dead, so they are lasting TWO lifetimes.  Nevertheless I can accept if a garden tool only lasts a few decades.  Or at least lasts a few years.  But when you get a tool, and it only lasts a FEW MINUTES?  Perhaps the company changed the materials that they make the aerator from, or they changed the company that they subcontracted to mold the metal tip. If you look at other recent reviews, others have also encountered the tip bending over, or the wings that bend down so you can stir, not bending down.  I hope the company fixes this problem, because this seems to be a good tool for mixing the compost pile.  Unless you have a shovel.
B000RYL1NE I ordered the Yard Butler Gopher/Mole Bait Applicator to use with voles.  The method is the same: 1. Look for evidence of tunnels running through the yard; 2. Probe with the unit to enter the tunnel; 3.  When you feel the &#8220;drop&#8221; of entering a cavity, stop at that point; and 4) Turn the crank on top of the unit and dispense pellets into the tunnel.  It takes a bit of practice, but is easily performed.
B000RYL1NE After I've cleared the drybrush and trees from the slope behind my backyard, a gopher infestation exploded in my lawns.  Never to be outsmarted by rodents, I tried a wide variety of anti-gopher weaponry, including this Yard Butler Mole/Gopher Bait Applicator.Likes:*Sturdy metal spike applicator with a t-bar handle and foam grips.*Fairly easy to use: place bait/poison in the top container, insert the spike tip into the gopher hole, and turn the dispenser handle on top to dispense the gopher tidbits (available separately).Results after two weeks:*I don't know whether the gophers were immune to the bait, or the poison actually worked and some other predators dug up their decaying carcasses, but I ended up with newly dug holes around the baited areas along with a good sized mini &#34;pitcher's mound&#34;.Conclusion:Gopher bait/poison did not work for me.  It only aggravated more gophers to dig more holes.  The only dead gopher was one that drowned in my pool, but that was weeks after applying the bait.  Now I'm also concerned about poisoning predators such as hawks, coyotes, possums, and skunks, that are important in the food chain.  I'm not using any more gopher bait/poison, but this applicator is very handy as a probe for locating gopher tunnels and implementing other weapons of rodent destruction.  If all else fails, time to call the pros.
B000RYL1NE This Applicator works good, but my Gophers have not died yet, or I have not notice it yet!I live on 10 acres ,on a river, we have allot of huge boulders, where thegophers like to hide.So its not always possible to get into the area that there in!I have to plant all veggies etc. in Large containers, but if a  veggies drops to theground without a piece of wood there, gophers are on it, and of course at night.I'm not seeing the ground coming up, but mainly Gopher holes, that is where I'm sticking thistube at and realeasing the pellets into, then covering it upThat said, this Yard Butler Bait Applicator works very good..I know other friends that have this, and forthem it gets there Gophers..Going to keep trying to get those suckers.If I notice a big difference I will be back to give a up-date.
B000RYL1NE Every winter and spring its mole war around my neighborhood. I've tried countless poisons and old school tricks with no real positive results. When the opportunity came along to test this Yard Butler bait applicator I was glad to give it a test run. The instructions are mounted on the tool and are quite simple. It takes seconds to load and its one of the cleanest ways to apply poison. The wing nut does a good job of locking down the feed box. I got a pretty good seal without any product loss. I particularly like the mechanics on this puppy. The barrel easily slides into the tunnel for a quick application of bait. Two weeks later and no new mole activity. The manufacturer tacks on a life time warranty. So far so good. I have no problem recommending this great, working device. Its built to last.
B000RYL1NE Works ok.  It does get jammed at the exit hole at times but I kind of expected that.  The real issue is finding some sort of bait that will actually work with this thing and actually gets rid of your vermin problem...  The only thing that has worked for my occasional mole visitor has been poison gummy worms.  I will use this to make the hole and drop the worms in...
B000RYL1NE Our problem is with moles.  With the soil we have here in SW Washington, this applicator works great and it hasn't jammed on me yet.  Using disposable gloves to load this applicator keeps human scent off the bait.  Very happy to have this applicator, I wasn't aware that something like this even existed.
B000RYL1NE This bait applicator is a quality item which will last for years. It is easy to operate, and the bait is easy to apply. I like that is it made of a coated metal, and that the handles have foam. We are using this for our growing vole problem, and I prefer to apply bait in a direct manner rather than  broadcast bait where non-targeted species might get at it.Recommended.
B000RYL1NE If you have a mole problem, this is a great tool to help rid the yard of this troublesome critter. This applicator has two main advantages over placing mole bait by hand. First, if you use latex gloves to load it, you can avoid human odor on the bait, which may render the bait useless given the sensitive noses of moles. Second, of course, you can apply the bait in various places around the yard while standing, and when finished simply hang the applicator in your yard shed or garage.I've found that, although the process is quite simple, it can be tricky to get the bait pellets in the right spot. The tunnels are easy to spot in most lawns and gardens, but placing the bait is important. Even if you happen to collapse part of the tunnel, moles love to reopen them if it means getting at some food. However, I think it is best to cover the hole left by the applicator with some dry leaves and a little soil on top of that. This way, the bait is somewhat protected from other creatures and the weather, plus it is easy to see where bait has been placed if you wish to check on whether it's been eaten.Bottom line: if you have a mole problem and tried a number of approaches to getting rid of them, this applicator may help. In my opinion, traps are effective if they are placed just so (I've had little luck with them), but bait and mole-killer &#34;worms&#34; work best.
B000RYL2CY This does a great job of allowing me to use my front yard hose without crawling through shrubbery to get to the house spigot.  The shape and support leg are a benefit to stability.  I hadn't considered how I'd need a short extension hose to reach from it to the spigot, nor that I'd have to have a hose hanger next to it and have had to buy both to augment this unit.  But one benefit from having the extender separate from the hose holder is that I don't have to worry about the weight of the coiled hose tipping it nor will I have any issue accessing its spigot through the coils of a hose hanging over it.The unit goes into the ground pretty easily (I used a small sledge hammer on the support leg) and sinks far enough down to make it very sturdy.  It is a hollow square shape that allows dirt to fill in the middle of the buried part as you sink it.  You get better purchase in the ground than with a single rod structure.  Both my extender hose and regular hose attached with no leaks.  That's especially key with the extender hose since the spigot at the house is always on so you are counting on this unit to stop the flow when not in use.I had such an arrangement in the past but the extender was very low to the ground, where this one is about 18&#34; out of the ground and an easy height to access.  Its color is muted and blends in with the shrubbery so doesn't attract attention.
B000RYL2CY This would have been a great product if it didn't leak. It is all metal and has brass fittings. There are no plastic parts. I used some of that white teflon tape where the hose connection goes, but the part that connects the fitting to the pole also leaked. I had to use one of those plumbing/welding products to stop that leak. So far it is holding up.
B000RYL2CY Our hydrant is practically at ground level in an area that's frequently overgrown, so groping around for the handle in tall grass, stopped over, has always been unnerving (Kansas is spider country). This extender is great for keeping my off my hands and knees and away from the creepy crawlers.I do wish it came with a leader, but I was able to make a custom one of just the right length in about 5 minutes with some scrap hose and a couple of menders (like this one: http://www.amazon.com/Gilmour-Polymer-Male-Coupling-01M/dp/B00002N66T and this one http://www.amazon.com/Gilmour-Polymer-Female-Coupling-01F/dp/B00002N66U/--I went with the cheapies because I've used them before and I won't be taking the leader on and off, and they're not in direct sunlight). I used teflon tape at the connectors, and added a splitter (I used this one, which has big, easy lever handles: http://www.amazon.com/Nelson-Rezimar-High-Water-Kink-Free-50315/dp/B0015AOEYC/), so now I have two hoses in a stable base at a good height. Hooray!The fittings are nice brass fittings. I did use teflon tape, but didn't replace the old hose gaskets, and I had no leaks at the input or outputs, even under pressure. The frame looks to be powder coated steel in dark green to camouflage in bushes, square tubular metal, nice and heavy.It's a bit hard to push in and not 100% stable in really rocky soil (ours is basically gravel held together with fine topsoil), but that's tru of pretty much anything jammed into the ground around our building, since you essentially have to rock it in--just giving a warning if you have really rocky soil.
B000RYL2CY Unfortunately I'm not able to recommend this product as it appears to have poor quality control. This arrived with a broken handle/hose bib despite no evidence of wear/tear to the box or packing. Basically unable to use in current condition and trying to find a replacement hose bib that fits to repair isn't worth the time or effort of driving across town with this thing in tow. AVOID.
B000RYL2CY I'm using mine next to my vegetable garden.  I am a square foot gardener so I have raised beds & I have to keep them fenced in with chicken wire or the rabbits will eat everything.  The fence has always been a problem when watering because the hose hangs over/on the fence & causes it to sag.  But with this yard butler, I can get enough height to clear the chicken wire.It was easy to set up.  I used a block of wood on top & then pounded it into the ground with a hammer.  Don't use a hammer on the metal butler itself or you will likely cause damage.Mine has been working for 2 weeks so far with no leaks.  From reading other reviews, it seems there are good/bad ones; I guess I got a good one.  I'll update my review if it goes bad.
B000RYL2CY I have two gardens, one off of each end of the house. They need a lot of watering. It's always been extra work adjusting the water flow from the hose. (Walking back and forth to the house each time). I tried the hose \"Y's\" which have a switch to adjust the flow at the garden, but they're on the ground, generally upside down and are hard to adjust since the levers are very small.The Bib Extender has been placed next to the garden with the hose attached. With the faucet on at the house, it is an easy and convenient way to adjust the water flow.  It is up a couple of feet and has a good faucet handle. The shaft which goes into the ground is very solid and the whole unit is simple. I did find that it is important to use a pliers to tighten the hose connection onto the Bib Extender to prevent leaks. I also find this true on the house faucets since the \"rubber\" seals are generally plastic, not rubber anymore. I have had the water on at the house for a few days and see no problem with leaking. I will just leave the water on at the house and use only the Bib Extender for turning on and off the water and making adjustments.As of May 24, 2014 the on/off handle broke off in just normal use. The product should not be purchased.
B000RYL2CY When driving this into the ground, I would recommend instead of pounding on the top of the main stake, use a stone or small cement block to pound on the perpendicular welded piece of metal that's attached about six inches from the bottom. The metal was welded on well enough there was no danger of deformation or detachment when I did so. A little paint did chip off, however. Because of this perpendicular piece of metal, you can only drive it down about 6\". If your soil is a bit looser on top, it's not deep enough to keep the stake from wobbling a bit, but enough to keep it in place.The connection threads are really short - less than half an inch for both sides. I would have liked it to be a little longer since I just feel as if there's a better, more secure connection that way. If you leave the included washer in on the incoming connection, the length to connect shortens to about 1/4 inch. I used teflon tape where I could, and have had no issues with leaking around the connections.The faucet points more horizontal than vertical so if you add connections (I attached a 4-way manifold), it juts out, I would estimate, about 70 degrees from the stake. Besides being unsightly, the water shoots out from my manifold mostly horizontally instead of down. It makes it difficult if you're just trying to drop water down from the faucet into a bucket or watering can. With a little testing, you can learn to open the faucet just enough with a low enough flow the water will flow mostly down, hold the bucket up next to the faucet, or just figure out where to place your bucket on the ground wherever the water ends up falling. More guesswork than I would like to bother with.This bib extender works for the basic need of placing a faucet in another location.
B000RYOAHS To cut to the chase - this isn't worth the current $35 price for my uses.I really like some of the design features on this cultivator.  I like how the rotary blade assemblies are modular and can be replaced one at a time, or simply removed one by one to allow for a different tilling pattern in your garden.  That's pretty cool.  I also like the twist-lock feature on the extendable handle, versus other tools that I have that screw to tighten.  At least for me, the handle was very easy to lock/unlock in position, and it didn't come loose when I was using it.While I do love the twist-lock on the handle, one downside is that you can only go between the two lengths of fully-retracted or fully-extended.  You can't customize the length anywhere in between.  The length worked for me, and I'm 5'9\".The reason for my rating this as just \"OK\" with three stars is that it didn't churn up my soil very well.  Yes, I put my back into it.  :)  I tried it on my lawn before reseeding, which was essentially compacted top soil, and also on a couple of other areas that have more loose dirt.  I wasn't too impressed by how much effort it took for so little turnover on the soil.  Now, that might just be because my soil is more compacted than most and that I really need a powered tiller, but unless you have looser soil - you might experience the same thing.So, I was impres
B000RYOAHS Everything about this product is well made and works well except for one thing...The handle bar collapses too easily during use.  The handle bar is a simple twist lock, much like my pruner's bars (which work very well).  And if you want to have a 1/2 length bar for tilling, then this product works great.  But, I suspect most people will want to stand while tilling, and the handle bar, even though well tightened, collapses too easily under regular use.So, while everything else about this cultivator is nicely made, this one fatal flaw prevents it from being truly useful.
B000RYOAHS I used this cultivator for my existing flower gardens and for a few smaller sections of hard-packed yard.In both areas, the cultivator worked well (though to be honest, if I needed to work hard-packed areas of the yard, I would use my electric cultivator).I found that the adjustable handle worked well. I initially had problems where it would collapse as I was using it. It turns out that you need to turn the handle until you hear a soft click. Once it clicks, the handle stays in place.Configuring the blades was also very easy. Each blade is screwed into place with a bolt that&#8217;s large enough so that it&#8217;s easy to turn. It took less than a minute to add or remove a blade.Overall, I liked using this cultivator.
B000RYOAHS This tool is great for loosening the top 2-3 inches of soil in the garden. It does take a lot of muscle power and you certainly will get a workout with it. The more compact the soil, the more difficult it will be to use.I would recommend this product for gardens where the soil is not too compacted and hard. In that case you may need a power tiller. This product is great for small areas. It helps to break up weeds, but not the kind that send long roots.
B000RYOAHS A bad back is a problem when you like to garden since pretty much every gardening task puts a strain on your back. While this is not a perfect solution, it provides for less back strain than using a hoe for weeding.The build quality is pretty good. It feels solid, but is lightweight to handle. The telescoping action of the handle is easy to use (simple twist lock) and stays put when extended except for the most severe pushing. The tiller blades (or prongs, actually) are sharp and each can be removed to configure the tool for specific tasks, such as edge weeding. The blades are held in place with a nut that goes right through the blade frame, which is far better than a friction fit that other similar tools have.The catch is that this is not something that will replace a digging hoe or tiller. It&#8217;s for light weeding on ground that has been well-worked. For that task it performs well and offers the advantage that you don&#8217;t have to use a lift and chop motion as you would with a hoe, but rather a back and forth motion. I find that easier on my back.It also works well to help spread out pine bark mulch, avoiding the need to bend as much during that task. The rotating tines even out the mulch better and easier than using a bow rake.The handle grip is plastic and comfortable. No need to wear gloves to protect your hands when using this (although gloves are never a bad idea when gardening).I&#8217;ll give this 5 stars since, for light weeding on worked ground it performs very well, and has good build quality for the price. I would not, however, recommend this for more strenuous tasks such as breaking new ground or tilling.
B000RYOAHS I have 5 raised garden beds and used the &#34;Yard Butler RC-3 Garden Cultivator&#34; to help me get them in shape for this summer's crops.This cultivator is light weight and will only be useful for fully established gardens. I had to pull the weeds that have grown over my beds since last autumn's harvest and the Yard Butler did a good job afterward in cultivating the soil.One thing I noticed was the small roots (from both the weeds and last year's vegetables) immediately got wound-up around the wheels. However, I was able to correct this by removing the middle wheel.The wheels, when all three were in place, rolled nicely forward, but tended to get stuck/bogged down on the return motion. Again, I corrected this by removing the middle wheel. Each wheel has a little screw-knob for fast and easy removal.At the end of the day, the Yard Butler did an acceptable job for a light-duty hand-powered tool. My garden is planted and I am happy with this product.
B000RYOAHS I do a fair amount of gardening -- previously, I'd been using a ho or a shovel to till the soil before planting.  This cultivator does a much better job of breaking the soil up into smaller pieces.  The handle could be better to hold (it seems sometimes like it needs to be at more of an angle or something, to be able to jam it into the ground).  I do have very hard, clay-like soil where I live, so that may not be an issue for everyone.  Generally, this does an ok job, at a good price.
B000RYOAHS This has good use if you have a planter with soft soil but don't expect it to do much in harder dirt.  For the amount of muscle I'd have to use to get this thing to work in hard dirt, I might as well just poke it with a fork.
B000RYPZQ8 i was so excited to get this until i saw that lowes had it for less.  was kicking myself for my impatience as i had just ordered it that morning and it was already too late to cancel.  the kneeler itself is great though hard to pull the spring to fold and open it
B000RYPZQ8 WONDERFUL TO USE WITH THE SUPPORT HANDLES ON EACH SIDE AND THE PADS KEEP MY KNEES FROM HEARTING AND EASY TO LIFT MYSELF UP.
B000RYPZQ8 I can't say enough about this Garden Butler.  It is QUALITY MADE and easy to use.  The side rails fold up easily but lock in place for a secure handle that you can raise yourself up with.  The kneeling pad is made of a thick foam that absorbs the pressure when you kneel down on your knees.  Makes it easy to plant and get down to ground level.  Well made and very much worth the price.  I really can kick myself for not getting one sooner.  Anyone with knee problems will love this thing.  I recommend it.
B000RYPZQ8 I have one of these that was given to me years ago, and it is still my favorite gardening 'tool'.  The paint still looks pretty good, the hinges still work, and the cushion is still soft on my old knees.  I love that in the kneeling position, the side rails give me help in getting up.  Also, I can quickly flip it over and it's a seat for taking off my shoes or just taking a load off.  I know my green-thumb daughter will love hers.
B000RYPZQ8 I bought this kneeler when I was having serious back and knee problems, since managed with physical therapy. But I still use this whenever I'm planting or weeding in the garden. It takes a load off my knees, protects them from cuts and scrapes, and helps take the strain off my back.After three years of use and storage outdoors in my garage, one of the foam pads fell off. Considering that it lives in a plastic bin on my rear deck year round, this is not too surprising; the temperature cycling, heat, and humidity probably dissolved the original thin glue layer. I re-attached the pad with  Gorilla Glue and it's good as new again.
B000RYPZQ8 The arthritis in my feet and knees has advanced enough in the past few years that I find it difficult to get up if I have to kneel down for something. Additionally, I have a bad meniscus in my right knee that often makes it painful to put my entire weight on that leg to push myself up to a standing position unassisted.I was putting my garden last month and was excited to find this Garden Kneeler and Seat here on Amazon. Turn it one way and it is a small elevated seat. Turn it the other and it is a low kneeler. The benefit of this kneeler over those ones that are just a free-standing foam pad is that this kneeler has sturdy steel \"arms\" that you can use to push yourself up from a kneeling to a standing position. You could easily use it in the house as well, for when you drop something and need to get down to pick it up. I found it to be stable--not wobbly at all--when I was pushing myself up from the kneeler.The kneeler comes folded up and you just have to pull the legs out to open it. This took a LITTLE doing but not bad. I actually keep mine in the out position all the time now instead of folding it and unfolding it all the time. My kneeler (in the seat position) sits just inside my garage door with my garden bucket and supplies on it, so I can quickly grab them and head out to the garden.When my kneeler first arrived, I found the material used to make the seat/kneeler part of the device to be odd. It feels like a dense version of the foam you use to make flower arrangements. As such, it does not give much when you kneel on it, but there is some give. I sat on the seat when I was out in the garden last week. Since it is so narrow, it would not be comfortable for me to sit on it for an extended time (as my behind is not narrow) but it certainly was comfortable enough for me to accomplish the task at hand.My concern about this foam-type substance used in the seat is that it may be difficult to clean if it became stained.  That remains to be seen.Please note that this seat/kneeler is never to be used as a stepstool and that the weight limit is 250 pounds. The kneeler itself weights 8.5 pounds.Definitely recommended.
B000RYPZQ8 I love this garden kneeler! I've been using it for two years and the hinges are still tight and strong. I use it both ways - sitting and kneeling. I have bad knees, so sometimes I find that it's hard to get up off of the ground after weeding. The Yard Butler is very sturdy and it's the right height, so I can push myself up smoothly without any issues. I don't always kneel on it, sometimes I'm beside it, but I still make sure it's within reach to help me get up.  It folds up for storage, so it's easy to tuck away when not in use. I have it hanging in my garden shed. When I bought this one two years ago, it was to replace one that I had for many years that disappeared. I can't imagine weeding without it.
B000S61YO2 The Yard Butler Roto Planter works beautifully in soft or tilled soil for planting bulbs, herbs, tomato plant and the like.  It can be used in harder, more compacted soil, but that likely will take more effort than it is worth.  I like to use it in a tilled garden for setting plants.Watch out when using this around roots.  If you have not set the clutch on your drill to give/let loose at a certain level of torque, the Roto Planter can become locked in roots, causing the drill to twist violently and suddenly in your hands, possibly wrenching your wrist.Use this for lighter duty planting such as that described above and you will likely be very happy.
B000S61YO2 I was looking for an auger that would be wide and long enough for greenhouse posts but not require special equipment. I used this auger with my corded drill to dig holes for the posts for my greenhouse. My drill isn't special, just your typical home depot drill and it connected to it perfectly. It dug very easily through my rock-hard clay soil with each hole only taking about 20 seconds to dig.  The trick to prevent it from getting stuck is to bring it up every 4-6 inches to clear the hole from debris. This will be a keeper for all the bulb-planting I have to do in the spring.I would definitely recommend this auger.
B000S61YO2 Not sure what more to say about this. Does what it's meant to do, and does it well. My only concern is that the shaft that you put into the drill is round, and my drill is meant to hold square drill bits. I was afraid it wouldn't work, but it seemed to work just fine.
B000S61YO2 I bought this for tree fertilizing not for bulb planting. I have a 19.2 volt drill. Using this in tough conditions. But unless I flood the ground it makes almost no headway. And when I flood it, it still doesn't go down quite enough.If you intend this for fertilizing at least in clay soils, it might not work so well. I was looking forward to some deep fertilizing and unfortunately has not worked as I had hoped.
B000S61YO2 We bought 100's of bulbs last winter thinking we would get to plant them before winter hit.  However, as was the case across most of the country, winter hit hard and lasted forever.  Beginning in October the temperatures stayed in the 30's and lower and only finally got above freezing a few days in March, 2014.I was worried the bulbs might not be good any longer if I waited until this fall to plant them, so we went outside yesterday (May 1, 2014) and started the planting.  I expected it to take hours to plant all these bulbs, but with the Yard Butler it was so quick and easy.  We were done in less than 2 hours including a couple of breaks, and now I just hope the bulbs will bloom next spring.  I just won't know how successful we were until then.As far as the Roto Planter is concerned it is a super helpful garden tool.  Be sure you have a drill that will accommodate 3/8\" bits...a 1/4\" drill (which is most common) will not work.EDIT:  May 19, 2014We bought some annuals to plant in our flower garden this past weekend, petunias, marigolds, impatiens, and verbena, and because the yard butler had helped plant all the bulbs so quickly I purchased flats of 48 of each of those varieties.  Hoping this would work as well as the bulbs we went out on a Saturday morning at 9AM to begin planting 196 flowers.  Normally this would be a several hour job.  Between digging a hole with a trowel, breaking the plants apart from their containers of 4/tray, planting each one, and filling the holes with miracle-gro garden soil to replace what was displaced by the yard butler, it took us (two of us) less than 1 1/2 hours to do it all.  One of us used the butler, the other followed with the plants and covering their new home with good soil.  Now, we will wait and see one absolutely gorgeous garden in a few weeks!This is an essential garden tool!
B000S61YO2 I thought this product would help me quickly plant the hundreds of bulbs I wanted to plant, and looked forward to using it to get the depth and width holes needed for my many different bulbs.Boy was I disappointed.First, I was trying to plant many of the bulbs in soil next to perennials, many of which had great root systems.  When I tried to drill next to the plants, to plant the bulbs, I destroyed the root system.  Not good.Second, I couldn't get this roto planter to drill deeply into the clay soil we have here; the roto planter would freeze while drilling.  My HAND bulb planter worked more effectively than this product did.  It also didn't work in soil that had any small rocks in it.Third, this roto planter's shaft is difficult to secure in a drill.Overall, I think this product is great for  \"perfect\" soil, but wouldn't suggest it for anything other than rock-free, clay-free, root-free soil.
B000S61YO2 We planted about 50 bulbs in under an hour with this planter.  Our soil was relatively loose with some roots from the hostas.  We used a Panasonic 15.6 Volt drill without any issues with pop-out.  The roto planter easily dug the holes.  However, some of the loosened soil did fall back into the hole even when we reversed the drill.  So, we did need to use a small hand trowel to push out some dirt before dropping in the bulb.  We look forward to using it for weeding and planting bulbs next year.
B000S61YO2 This very easily fit into the drill bit and we were able to dig smaller holes big enough in our hard ground to be able to put up a small fence to keep the chickens in their yard. Very happy with the reduced work load.
B000S61YO2 i was very patient and practiced a lot of hole drilling with it. now i can do it real good. it works great for mixing up soil in my big nursery pots... in my compost heap... in my sandy soil.  i aerated my front yard with it using my electric corded drill and it was fun. i loosened up some potting holes for some hedge plants. it works great for me. thank you.
B000S61YO2 Buy this as opposed to the Awsome Auger in the made for TV adds.  It is strong, and not a rip off for shipping and handling.  It is a great labor saver for bulbs, annuals and loosening dirt in flower beds. Use a good cordless drill and let it do the work. Don't expect it to get thru roots.  And if the dirt is loose and dry, the dirt will tend to fall back into the hole.
B000S61YO2 My husband tried using this to dig a few holes in the yard. He said it did get a bit tangled on some roots, but if you just lifted it out you could start again. It uses the charge on the drill (battery-powered) pretty quickly. I can definitely see some uses for this, such as loosening soil in a flower bed each spring; churning the compost, digging holes if you want to plant a LOT of bulbs, etc. With that in mind, remember that you will need to store it somewhere and take the time to find it and hook it up (which probably tells you how messy our shed is). I expect we will use it sometimes (e.g., for bulbs in the fall) and just rely on old-fashioned muscle power the rest.
B000S61YO2 I have less than ideal soil and I needed a better way of digging holes than one at a time with a hand spade.I came across something like this at a local garden supply store but it was only 8\" long and dirt got all over my power drill. No local garden supply carried anything longer so I bought the 24\" version from Amazon.I used a hand file to create a triangle on the end of the bit so that the auger wouldn't slip in the drill.  With my soil, I have to use a powerful electric drill.  In the areas where I've been using good soft soil, a battery powered drill worked fine.What would have taken all day using a hand spade took only minutes.  Great tool.  Wish I knew about it a few years ago.
B000S61YO2 We have a fairly large garden and have been wanting to plant flower bulbs around it, but the idea of digging all those holes was daunting to say the least.The Yard Butler made it so much easier! It's basically a small auger, that you connect to your drill and it digs the holes for you.  It was easy to use and works really well. Recommended!
B000S61YO2 This is  a great tool and has many uses but they need to make one slight modification. In my hard soil I could not get the chuck tight enough to grip the shaft of this roto planter without slipping. I took it to the grinding wheel and ground some flats on the shaft at the end that slides into the drill chuck and that took care of any slippage. An easy enough fix but every one who buys this might not have that option available to them. Now that I took care of the slippage I am finding many uses besides the intended bulb planting. I really think it would be difficult though to dig under a sidewalk with it, as mentioned in the description. I docked it one star because I think the manufacturer should have put the flats on the shaft...not me.
B000SDKGC6 Very easy to set, just insert in tunnel and STEP on the cocking mechanism. GOT ONE THE FIRST NIGHT. The double scissors means they are caught no matter which direction. This particular mole was making it dangerous to walk without twisting an  ankle.
B000SDKGC6 Ordered this trap and was impressed with 
B000SDKGC6 This is a well designed product, strong and sturdy. It is easy to set and remove. Unfortunately in six months I haven't caught a single gopher yet. They are tearing up our lawn. I'm switching to a different product.Perhaps I'm not using these properly. The other thing is our lawn is mostly hard clay which might not be the soil in which this works best. We've found the trap tripped a couple of times but no joy. I know others have had much better luck with this model.
B000SDKGC6 Easy to set and works!  I have tried other products to get rid of the moles, poison worms, deterrent spry and granules, and other traps.  Trapping seams to be the only thing that works and these are by far the easiest I have found to use.  I've even bought a second one I like them so much.  Make sure to find and active tunnel and keep moving them if your are not getting anything.  Good Luck!
B000SDKGC6 This is hard to rate as it has never been tripped. I catch a lot of moles with a cinch type trap, but these have not worked for me. I'm sure they work, but my moles go around them. It must be too large or something, but they apparently sense it. I'm not sure.
B000SDKGC6 Maybe because the clay soil is like a rock or maybe because my moles have become highly educated but I've not snagged one mole in three weeks. I have tunnels everywhere and holes all over my yard but no dead moles. The trap seems like a good idea and it's well constructed but I don't think it's made for my area of the country. It's difficult as crud to set with the hard soil but once set it has never tripped. I've moved it to different locations but still no luck. The design seems like a good idea so maybe it'll work in your area. I'm going to keep trying and if I get positive results I will correct this review. Not recommended for clay soils.
B000SP2JLU Three years ago, at the recommendation of a friend, I bought a squirrel-resistant bird feeder (Brome 1015 Squirrel Buster Classic). It worked so well that even the heavier bully birds couldn't feed from it. I have all kinds of birds who feast from this feeder, so I decided I should get a second one. This Perky Pet feeder became available, so I was happy to give it a try. It is much cheaper than my other one, and the difference demonstrates that you do indeed get what you pay for. The squirrels figured out how to get into this one pretty quickly. So did the starlings.This feeder has a nice design, and it looks like it should work just fine. It has a spring mechanism that pulls down the plastic shell over the feeder holes when something heavy sits on one of the perches. Unfortunately, a couple of the feeder holes on this model are high enough that the squirrels just have to hang down from the top of the feeder - without putting weight on a perch - and feast away. I do have this on a tall metal shepherd's hook, so *that* deters many of the squirrels. And I have considered covering up the higher feeder holes to keep the rest of them out. I certainly wouldn't recommend hanging this from a tree or post or anything that squirrels can easily climb. Because of where I placed the feeder, most of the bird seed is actually going to the birds, but it's not because this feeder is squirrel-proof.
B000SP2JLU I've been wanting a bird feed for years, but never got one because I didn't want to lure the birds in and then have them end as cat treats.  But this little thing will keep the cats off (esp. using a shepherd's crook) and keeps the local raccons and pussoms out of the feeder!  I love watching the bird eat and flutter around the feeder.  Will buy this one again!
B000SP2JLU This is the perfect birdfeeder for my front yard.  I mounted it by hanging it from a Live Oak tree, using a \"hook\" similar to this Petco Green Bird Feeder Hanger and a thin, strong chain something like thisDroll Yankees LC18 Locking Chain.It's heavy enough when filled to hang well & the smaller birds like sparrows now get to eat more, since this is a bit small for our coveys of doves.  Occasionally, a young dove will land on top of the feeder, trying to figure out how to get some seed, only to close the doors for the other birds.  So far, the squirrel hasn't tangled with this, probably due to my precarious Rube Goldberg setup.I like the unobtrusive look of the feeder & I like that it holds enough seed for about a week of feeding (it's getting more popular; first it was 2 weeks, then a week, now about 5 days!).  It's relatively easy to fill; springs hold the lid on and can be tension adjusted for the \"right\" amount of feeder restriction if you do have a curious squirrel.  A winner!Have questions?  Leave a comment & I'll help you if I can.UPDATE 5/2/13:  Yet another advantage of this feeder is that its slim design handles windy conditions better than conventional feeders.  I live in Texas & springtime can get WINDY.  I briefly exchanged this feeder with a square one & immediately noticed strong swinging and spinning motions that were keeping the birds from perching.  Changed back to this feeder the same day & noticed how much less this feeder's affected by wind, due to its leaner profile.UPDATE 6/8/13:  A squirrel braved the Rube Goldberg setup yesterday & made it down the hook, down the chain, and onto the feeder.  Only to be TOTALLY frustrated, since his weight closed off all the feeding stations, just as promised : )
B000SP2JLU I've had this feeder for a month and really like it! I saw other reviews that say it doesn't last or doesn't work against squirrels, so I'll update this later, but so far I like it a lot.It was easy to fill and the hanger is a stiff wire, so I could reach a high hanger without it flopping over. The internal spring is adjustable, though I haven't needed to do that. There are multiple perches for birds to feed (6), and when I watched our pesky neighborhood squirrel defeated by it, I was very happy. That squirrel drives me nuts! It holds a fair amount of seed (2 lbs. according to the label), so I've only needed to refill it occasionally.
B000SP2JLU We have tons of birds AND squirrels around our house. We can open the back door and see them all over hunting for food. We've even watched them from our back door stealing dog food off the porch. Many times!! We hope the poor things don't choke on it.That said, we can't seem to attract any birds or squirrels to this thing to even test it out. I've even moved it around the yard a bit and watched from my back door. They don't even come close to it.So, I can't tell you how well it works as far as keeping the squirrels away, since I can't seem to catch anything eating or trying to eat from it.As far as looks, it's pretty. I like the way it looks in our yard. It's a little hard to fill with the way the top goes on. As long as you expect to spill some bird seed(the birds will eat it anyway), it's fine, though.
B000SP2JLU A simple yet extremely effective design for  keeping squirrels out of the wild bird seed. My only two concerns are at the two separate ends--the top does not open far enough/easily enough to effectively fill the feeder and the bottom while designed I'm certain to make cleaning it easier also makes it easy for it to be dislodged and all the seed pours out on the ground--something I discovered after a strong wind storm blew the feeder off the pole it was hung on, dropping it 4 feet to the ground. These two issues are extremely minor in comparison to the extremely attractive and effective baffle mechanism for keeping the seed away from the squirrels--if there was a way to rate this as a 4.9 out of 5 I would not hesitate. My 91 year old Father-in-law spends many hours every day at his dining room table watching the squirrels get frustrated that they can not get to the seed, no matter how hard they try. The mechanism for setting the \"weight\" allowed to gain access to the seed is extremely well designed and made--adding value. Again two very minor issues that other wise would make this an outstanding squirrel proof feeder! christina & bogie
B000SP2JLU I love this bird feeder.  I have several squirrels who constantly manage to invade my bird feeders, but not this one. The Perky-Pet Wild Bird Feeder is double sided with the interior tower made of sturdy plastic and the outer tower made of metalwork with tiny spings hooked to it. The feeder has six feeding ports with metal perches that let  birds  feed, but not the heavier squirrels. When the squirrels try to feed their weight causes the metalwork to move down and block the feeding ports. When the squirrel leaves, the spings bring the feeder back to the original position.  The feeder holds over 3 pounds of seed and the birds love it.
B000SP2JLU I love the beauty of this feeder, the birds love this feeder!  Well made with a heavy fixture and very clever spring that allows only light birds to pick out the seeds,Cardinals, Woodpeckers and the very small ones have a shot of the seeds.I used to have to fill the old feeder at least once a day!  As the birds threw out the seeds that were in their way to select that one perfect one!  Now, the birds select the perfect seed and cannot throw the rest out!I fill this feeder about once a week!Highly recommend this Perk-pet Bird Feeder. 5 stars
B000SP2JLU OUR OLD ONE FELL & BROKE BEYOND REPAIR.  COULD NOT FIND ONE AT THE USUAL RETAIL PLACES.  GOT THIS ONE FROM AMAZON AND IT IS THE SAME KIND.  WORKS WELL AND AT A FAIR PRICE.  THEY ONLY MODIFICATION I MADE ON MINE WAS TO TAKE THE CLEAR TUBE OUT AND USE CLEAR PACKING TAPE TO SEAL OFF THE TOP 4 OPENINGS.  OTHERWISE, THE BIRDS CAN EMPTY IT IN A MATTER OF HOURS.  IT WOULD BE NICE IF THE FEEDER COULD BE OFFERED WITH PLUGS.
B000SP2JLU This is a light-weight feeder with plenty of space for seeds and birds, but I'm unsure this is really squirrel proof because of the crossbars.  Others have submitted photos showing squirrels on theirs.  The top deflector isn't big enough to be squirrel proof.  Since we live in the high desert, squirrels aren't a problem for us.  (They live higher in the foothills).  Our problem is neighborhood cats!This could also use some anchoring in a strong wind, but mine is hanging right in front of my south-facing window, high above the ground where cats can't go.  This feeder is easy to fill by removing the top where the metal wire is.  The design prevents seeds from flying out.
B000SP2JLU Here's the thing... I happen to love squirrels. They are my favorite animal. I don't mind feeding them, I actually enjoy it.  What I don't like is when my birdfeeders get broken due to gluttonous squirrels perching precariously whilst pigging out.  So many of my bird feeders have been destroyed by the squirrels and so much food wasted as it falls to the ground while they hang swinging upside down trying to feed.I moved my feeders out of the trees and onto shepherd's hooks a few years ago and that has also helped to hold off the majority of my fluffy tailed friends.  This product, so far, seems to be baffling and deterring my remaining stubborn squirrels.  So far they haven't figured out how to get to the food.I have only had this feeder for a couple months but I am happy to say I have yet to see a squirrel or a chipmunk feed from this feeder. I have seen a few try, and easily give up.It has taken my birds a while to get used to this new feeder and they still prefer the other feeders I have out there, but my regulars are coming back to the new one and I see the food disappearing faster.  I am hoping to see more and more birds - less and less squirrels.It seems like a sturdy birdfeeder and I think it is priced appropriately.  I like the look and the finish and so far have no complaints.  It holds a lot of food and I would buy this feeder again and purchase it for a fellow bird lover.Cherise Everhard, April 2013
B000SP2JLU I found the PERKY-PET SQUIRREL-BE-GONE FEEDER to be somewhat of a mixed bag.  While the concept is sound - springs lower the feeder when a squirrel gets on it such that the outside feeding holes no longer line up with the inside ones - the actual application leaves a little to be desired.  Since the springs are out in the elements and are relatively small, I don't give the feeder more than one or two seasons before water, dirt, feed, and bird waste fouls up the springs causing them to rust and seize up.  Admittedly, I have only had the feeder for about 6 months and it still works as good as new (as far as I can tell), the writing is clearly on the wall.The other problem I have is when larger bids land on the feeder, such as woodpeckers or a random crow, the cage drops just as if a squirrel got on.  So far no smaller bird had its head in the feeder whole when the larger bird landed, but I can see some mini-guillotine action going on if some unlucky Nuthatch was feeding the same time as my Pileated Woodpecker came along.  Obviously that would not be good for the bird - or make me very happy.All told, I'm not sure I'm going to keep the feeder too much longer because of the issues above.  It's pretty and appears to be working well now, but the drawbacks clearly out-weigh the good points.
B000SP2JLU I have two of these things.  Once is a relatively recent purchase, the other has been in place for close to a year now.  I have mixed emotions about these feeders and have had mixed results.  It was interesting to me that other reviewers here have had very similar complaints as to the effectiveness of this feeder that I have.Overall this is a good feeder and the concept is great.  It should be noted though that almost ANY feeder that claims to be \"squirrel proof\" is stretching the facts just a bit.  Squirrels are bright animals and if there is a way of getting around all the devices we humans attempt to discourage their raiding of feeders, they will find a way.  That is a fact.  Now I will tell you that this particular feeder is better than most I have used in the past.  We have been feeding birds at this particular location for well over thirty years now and have gone through a lot of feeders; both commercial and home made.  While it is extremely difficult to count squirrels, I estimate that we have at least 30 to 40 of the little critters living on our place - we live in the woods.  We have a very large number of bird feeders...always have.Anyway, while this feeder is better than most, it does have a couple of flaws.  First, the squirrels quickly learned that if they shake the feeder seeds will eventually fall out...not a lot of seeds, but never-the-less than manage to get a share of them.  Secondly, the springs which run the squirrel proof portion of the feeder are located on the outside of the container.  They are constantly exposed to weather condition which does the springs no good what so ever.  I keep mine treated with 3 in 1 oil, applied in very small amounts which seems to help not only with the actual working mechanism, but does inhibit rust and corrosion.  I have not had the problem others have had with the varmints chewing on the holes and enlarging them as of yet.The feeder is easy to load and is attractive.  It is more effective than many like products and I will continue using them.  I don't begrudge the squirrels a meal now and then actually as I enjoy them and their antics but to be quite frank, with the cost of feed and seed these days, feeding a herd of hungry squirrels had become a bit of a financial burden.Overall I am giving this one four starts but can well understand why some have ranked it lower.Don BlankenshipThe  Ozarks
B000SP2JLU I have many styles of bird feeders all around my yard. This seemed like it would be a pretty addition; one that I thought would look lovely outside my window.  I loved the idea that it closed when something heavy landed on it. I have other feeders that do this so I thought that this would be made the same way and react to weight the same way as the others.It did NOT.  When anything heavier than a goldfinch landed on it it would close---and STAY that way.  At first I thought I just had very stupid birds - they would land on the feeder and then hop around like they were looking for a port they could eat out of.  But when I went out to see what was wrong, I saw their dilemma. They just couldn't find a port because the whole thing just closed and stayed closed.It was this way not matter how I adjusted the springs.I don't want my feathered friends to starve, so I will be taking this down right this minute.
B000SP2JLU I filled it with bird seed and hung it out in a tree where I have a couple of feeders with bird suet and three of the bird socks filled with thistle seeds.  Then I waited.  It ususally takes the birds a few weeks before they will try a new feeder, but the squirrel only waited a few days.  The squirrel that likes to frequent our bird feeders stopped by one morning and his antics as he tried to get to the bird seed made my family laugh till we cried.  He jumped on the feeder from a tree branch and he held on until it finally stopped swinging.  Then he tried coming down to an opening to get to the bird seed, but of course the opening closed.  He kept trying all the openings, but no luck.  Then, he scampered back up the tree and down the branch to the feeder and holding on to the perches at the openings (which closed from his weight) he tried shaking it back and forth.  I guess he thought he could spill it onto the ground.  That tactic didn't work either.  He still hasn't gotten any bird seed out of that feeder.  I think the birds love it as I have seen them out there eating and I have filled it up numerous times now.  The feeder keeps the squirrel from getting the bird seed and it is a lot of fun to watch!  I highly recommend this bird feeder to those who love birds and also share their yard with squirrels.
B000SP2JLU I like this feeder and it is currently hanging in my yard and has not yet been broken into by squirrels. The one comment I would make is that if you hang this too close to a bush or tree with a near-hanging branch, those crafty squirrels will reach out from the branch, grab the hanging feeder and pull it sideways without closing the feeder stations to dump the seed out on the ground. However if you position the feeder so that the only way for the squirrel to get to the feeder is to climb up and on it, then their weight will close the feeding stations and preserve the seed for birds. For a hanging feeder, this one is relatively squirrel proof--if you can hang it away from other vegetation, preferably from its own pole. Recommended.
B000SP2JLU Have always had a problem with large birds pigging out on the bird feeder that we retired several years ago.  When you are buying a 40 lb. bag of bird seed every several weeks you know it's out of control.  We miss having a feeder in our back yard....The Perky-Pet 336 has at least for now reduced seed consumption by a huge margin.  Large birds like doves etc...shut down the openings while the little ones can enjoy!  Had to adjust the springs so it would take a lighter weight to shut it down, we do not have a squirrel problem.  Bought a five lb. bag of seed at the grocery store, the feeder took less than half to fill and it's lasting like I can't believe!  The larger birds feed off the seed than falls to the ground under the feeder.  So, for us, this really provides the enjoyment of the birds while keeping bankruptcy at bay!  Hope you enjoy feeding the birds as much as we do.....I would recommend this product on our very favorable use.
B000SP2JLU The Perky-Pet 336 Squirrel-Be-Gone Wild Bird Feeder has turned out to be a great feeder. I have not seen a squirrel even come close to the seeds. The unit is easy to fill and the spring adjustment is useful also. Great product.
B000SP2JLU Squirrels are the bane of people like me who enjoy feeding their backyard birds. That's because, of course, is that if squirrels had their way they would consume far more seed than the birds.Because squirrels are very smart and crafty animals, there are epic tales of the extent human beings go to keep squirrels from getting seed from their bird feeders. My personal efforts are approaching epic. I spent lots of money, to me at least, for a bird feeder that tosses the offending squirrel into the air and unto the ground when they slide down to a perch. But the squirrels responded by simply swinging my feeder, spilling seed onto the ground, and then climb down to enjoy a meal.So Perky Pet has come up with an alternative bird feeder that might be what I need. The \"Squirrel Be Gone Wild Bird Feeder\" holds two pounds of seed and has six feeding ports. The feeder has an outer shell that slides up and down, opening and closing the ports. The default position is \"open\" so birds of any size - except eagles, hawks, black birds, doves, etc. - are free to feed at their leisure. If a squirrel or unwanted larger bird rests on the perch, the outer shell slides down slamming shut the opening to the seed.I am not mechanically inclined and cannot describe this next function properly. But it looks like the chutes by each port are designed in such a way that it will prevent spillage when the feeder swings back and forth. So this might be my solution. I am sure the Perky Pets company has very smart designers of feeders and other products; I just need actual evidence that they are smarter than squirrels. And my squirrels won't give up until a year of trying.
B000SP2JLU Update weeks later:  We didn't re-fill the feeder for several weeks, and only a few seeds remained at the bottom. Still, the birds kept flocking to this feeder (despite another one, full, about 25 yards away and similarly situated). I can't figure it out, but they really seem to love this feeder. When the other feeder is empty, there's no activity around it.Yesterday, we refilled, and man, they're going nuts! They seem to squawk a lot more at this feeder -- flying around and staking out a position, and making a whole lot of noise in the process. Again, it seems to be the same birds who frequent the other feeder but aren't so noisy. It's not really a problem; just funny how different feeders elicit different responses.Update several days later:  Still no squirrel, habitually demoralized or otherwise. But one thing I notice: Even though the birds are flocking to the feeder (mostly finches and titmice), it's hard to see them from 20 feet or so. They blend into the color of the feeder and the seeds. This might be a good thing if it thwarts the hawks known to frequent our pine tree but it does make it harder to enjoy seeing the birds.---This feeder is not as sturdy or as well-designed as our current squirrel-proof feederBrome 1015 Squirrel Buster Classic, but it's also less expensive.I'd say that this model is more appropriate for small, sheltered gardens where aesthetics and a more compact size are more important than rugged durability and functionality. (It's currently hanging in a mostly shaded area; I don't think the plastic liner would last long where our other feeder hangs, in full sun.)I see the feeder from my desk, and I've seen only one squirrel so far attempt it. It was quickly discouraged and went away.  Of course I can't attribute this to the feeder. Our squirrels might simply have been easily discouraged after too many failed attempts at the Brome feeder.
B000SP2JLU I have been watching this feeder for a few days now. The birds land on the feeder, take one beak bite out of the feeder then hop off and repeat. So the birds are using it but it seems to be slow going for them.
B000SP2JLU It took a while for the birds in our yard to \"catch on\" to how this feeder works.  But when they did, they  loved it.  Today there is light snow on the ground(not very often in Arkansas) and they are absolutely creating a \"bird mob scene\" on this feeder.  Thank goodness it holds a lot of seed and has a lot of perches.  And it's so pretty too....an extra plus.
B000SP2JLU I feel horrible about watching squirrels slip off of the Perky-Pet Squirrel-Be-Gone Wild Bird Feeder.  The handle is flimsy so I hold my breath each time a squirrel pounces on the feeder.  The reason I rated the feeder at a 4 is due to the fact that blackbirds are not deterred.  If anyone knows of a blackbird AND squirrel-proof feeder, please let me know!
B000SP2JLU The Squirrel-Be-Gone Bird feeder is a creative solution to an annoying problem, but unfortunately our squirrels seem to be smarter then Perky-Pet's designers.Prior to this feeder the only method we found to keep the squirrels out of our bird feeders were large plastic dome coverings. We put this feeder out without a dome, and for about a week the squirrels were stumped; they hung on the feeder, the metalwork shifted down, and they couldn't get any food. (Luckily, during that time they didn't try to chew out the plastic, as some other reviewers experienced.) However, they soon figured out that if they hung from the wire suspending the feeder, the metalwork wouldn't shift and cover the openings, and they could eat. We also had one small squirrel who figured out how to sit on the bottom ledge without pulling down on the metalwork. Squirrel party time! So, the dome returned, and now this is just a large and fancy looking feeder.The feeder is large, and wide instead of especially long. It holds 3+ lbs of feed, something to consider if you might have trouble lifting it overhead. It seems well-made; it stood up well to the week or two of abuse from the squirrels, and a variety of birds, from cardinals to starlings (unfortunately) have been using it since. It has only been up for a few weeks, but during that time it has both snowed and rained, and we haven't had any immediate problems with rusting or leaking, however time is really the test on that front.Overall, this is an attractive feeder with multiple perches, and is quite large. Whether the squirrel-proofing will work for you seems highly dependent on your local squirrel population.
B000SP2JLU I am a life-long avid bird feeder and I'm in the heartland of the country so I feed in all weather conditions. I also have to find a way to feed seed to birds without bankrupting myself feeding squirrels and deer or replacing flimsy feeders every year. Having said that, here's my review of this feeder:Pros:* It's pretty. And that's not utterly unimportant, as anyone who loves her garden would rather have a pretty feeder than an ugly one.* It holds a reasonable amount of seed.* Because of the design of the feeder holes, the seed doesn't spill much as it's being filled or moved.* The birds took to it immediately. Of course, as my yard is what my husband refers to as the \"All You Can Eat Bird Stuff-a-thon,\" they know the location of my feeders and so didn't need to \"find\" it.* It does, in fact, appear to be squirrel resistant. I hung it on a shepherd's hook without a squirrel baffle and only about 3 feet off the ground (thus, I did not need a neon sign that said, \"Squirrel Food Here!\")  And the next day saw two fat-tailed friends (and a chipmunk) on the ground under the feeder (Why they were finding much seed there will be explained under \"Cons.\") Had the feeder not been squirrel resistant, I assure you my little furry buddies would NOT have been on the ground!Cons:* The innards seem flimsy. The spring that makes the squirrel resistant closing mechanism work is small and seems not terribly sturdy. And it's  _inside_ the feeder, which is going to make cleaning the feeder problematic and, I think, will make the spring mechanism vulnerable.* It's not terribly easy to fill as it definitely requires two hands - one to hold the lid aside (resisted by the spring) and one to pour. (I also note that this took me a bit of figuring out as there is nothing in the directions that tells you how to fill it.)* While it does appear to be squirrel-resistant it is NOT deer resistant so, if your bird feeders are right next to a deer superhighway as mine are, they will get their tongues in the feeder holes and will empty this baby in very short order! And while they are at it, a lot of your seed will end up on the ground under the feeder where the squirrels will get it anyway.Having said that, if deer aren't a problem in your neighborhood, then you might not find this a \"con.\" (The only truly deer-resistent seed feeder style I have found is also by Perky Pet - and this is just one example; they have several styles:No/No Bronze Hourglass Bird Feeder  BZHG00325) However, without a squirrel baffle on your feeder pole, you'll be back to square one with those little beasties. So, if you get a squirrel baffle and a deer-proof feeder, you'll have spent a bit more, but will save a fortune over the long-haul in seed (and destroyed feeders!)Woodlink Ltd-Woodlink Audubon 6-Inch Torpedo Steel Squirrel Baffle.Conclusion: If you are a sometimes, only-casual bird hostess who doesn't want to spend a fortune on a squirrel resistant feeder, you may like this. If you are at all serious about your birdie buffet, this may not be the best choice.
B000SP2JLU A lot of \"solutions\" for bird feed loving squirrels are either ugly, ineffective, or both. This feeder hits a nice compromise of being both attractive and effective for discouraging squirrels. It is sturdy and well built and holds a good amount of feed. A good choice.
B000SP2JLU As with all squirrels ours are pretty darn resourceful. We have tried several different approaches. We have tried the urine scented tablets and granules without any success. and various different types of feeders with varying degrees of success. So far this one is actually working. the spring loaded cage that covers the feed holes when to much weight on them is a good idea and has worked perfectly so far. The only issue I have with this is that the springs get in the way of filling the feeder. Only time will tell how long the springs will last.I received this product free of charge to try through the vine program.Would I spend my own money on this? Yes
B000SP2JLU Considering this is a 20.00 birdfeeder made in China it seems to be OK. Obviously the construction is low end, but the birds are finally eating out of it. It took them almost a month to use it which is very unusual for a bird feeder here in the winter. Have not seen any squirrels attempt an invasion yet and I hope they don't as I doubt this will hold up to many heavy attacks. Very decorative. This would be a nice bird feeder for an in town situation. Not too sure how well it will do here in the country.
B000SP2JLU [Please see the update at the end of this review]I'm an avid backyard bird watcher, so I've had considerable experience with various types of feeders (including those meant to dissuade squirrels).  The PERKY-PET 336 SQUIRREL-BE-GONE feeder is much less expensive than some of the ones I've tried, so I was intrigued.  If it works, it will be a real find.The feeder arrived in one piece -- no need to do any assembly (that's a very positive thing -- anything that works right out of the box is great by me!).  It consists of a slender plastic tube to hold seed, surrounded by wire and metal leaves designed to prevent squirrels from reaching the plastic.  There are six perches for birds, with feeding ports that will close up if a squirrel (or a heavy bird) tries to access them.  The mechanism is controlled by a small spring, which can be adjusted to allow or deny larger birds access -- squirrels shouldn't be able to get to the food no matter how the spring is set.Well, I've had it up for about a week now, and so far the squirrels aren't interested in it -- but neither are the birds!  I watched a few birds circle it during the first few days, but they invariably went to one of my other feeders.  One did try one of the perches, but then immediately flew off.  It's possible the thing just looks strange to them, and they prefer the feeders they're used to.  But this is the first time I've put out a new feeder and had no takers after this long a time.So far, after a week of use, here's how things stand:POSITIVES:1)  Low price for a squirrel-proof feeder -- can't beat that2)  Arrives fully assembled3)  Attractive, slim design -- looks nice hanging out on my deck4)  Squirrels don't seem interested in it (so far!)NEGATIVES:1)  Very small feeding tube, holds only 2 pounds of seed -- if my birds start flocking to it, I'll be filling it every day!2)  Thin plastic feeding tube doesn't look like it will last very long, even if the squirrels do leave it alone3)  Spring that controls the squirrel-proof mechanism is very small, and it's located on the outside of the feeder, meaning it's likely to rust or otherwise deteriorate -- if it breaks, the feeder will be inoperative4)  Perches aren't large enough for cardinals to feed comfortably -- they prefer a feeding tray (if you're more interested in finches, this feeder should work)I will certainly update this review if things change over time.  At this point, I can't say this is a winner.  As for what HAS worked for deterring squirrels, the only thing I can swear by isF.M. Brown's Bird Lover's Blend No Squirrel Just Birds, 7-1/2-Poundbird seed, which contains hot pepper.  It totally keeps the squirrels away, and the birds don't seem to even notice the pepper.  It's expensive though, so if this feeder ends up working with my birds, I'll be happy.  We'll see.UPDATE 3/12/2013:  I decided to let my other backyard feeders run dry, just to see if the birds would start feeding at the PERKY-PET.  Sure enough, once the other feeders were empty, smaller birds began to give the new feeder a try.  I re-filled the other feeders (so the cardinals and other larger birds could feed comfortably), and the finches, sparrows, and nuthatches are still frequenting the PERKY-PET.  So, I guess it just takes time.I still think the small seed capacity is a detraction from the feeder, as is the lack of a feeding tray for cardinals.  But birds -- even in Maryland -- will get used to the PERKY-PET.
B000SP2JLU I had this same bird feeder many years ago.  It deteriorated with age (springs went bad) and squirrels eventually chewed the interior plastic up.  Why then would I get another?It's attractive, holds quite a bit of seed and doesn't allow \"junk birds\" (grackles, starlings, etc) easy access.  Is it squirrel-proof?  Absolutely not, but that type feeder just doesn't seem to exist, even though so many (including this one) advertise themselves as such.  One or two squirrels may not present a problem, but avid bird feeders or those who live in settings with large squirrel populations know just what I'm talking about.For the past few years, I've taken a different approach.  It's not the feeder that's the problem, it's the squirrel.  Expensive baffles now surround all our feeders and squirrel populations gets thinned out periodically.  We have gray, black, red, flying and fox squirrels, and they're all Harry Houdinis.This time around, I'm not giving the Squirrel-Be-Gone feeder a chance to get squirrel tested.  It hangs from an unused basketball hoop, and is used exclusively by smaller birds, although I can attest it is not their favorite feeder in our large yard.  Next to it hangs a cheap platform feeder, used by a variety of birds.  Next to that hangs a small peanut dish, which is actually the most popular of all three.  Even Red-bellied Woodpeckers love peanut halves.  The whole set-up looks tacky, but hooray, no squirrel can reach any of them.The Squirrel-Be-Gone bird feeder definitely does not live up to its name, but if used creatively, it's an inexpensive feeder (especially if found on sale) that does keep out seed-hogging big birds.  I just hope the springs last longer than the first one we had, and maybe an occasional lubing will help.
B000SP2JLU I have been feeding birds (and thus squirrels) for a long time. I've had all kinds of feeders, and I have come to respect squirrel ingenuity. They are geniuses at figuring out a feeder's design flaw and getting what they want.Still, this is a nice addition to my feeder collection, and so far I've only seen birds feeding from it. I'm not, however, so naive to think it will always be like this. While the feeder is attractive, I can already see that squirrels will probably solve this temporary puzzle. Perhaps a better name for this might have been Perky-Pet Squirrel Deterrent (At least for a while) Wild Bird Feeder.
B000SP2JLU I like the look of the feeder.  It's attractive, and I really love that it holds over 3 lbs of seed.  It was good for about a week and a half.  After that, the squirrels chewed at the plastic, just making the seed openings larger, and the springs stopped working consistently.  The idea is great, the execution just needs a bit of work.  Our dog, however, was overjoyed, as it became the popular neighborhood bar for the squirrels.  He loves chasing them and got a good workout daily.  Made the dog and squirrels happy, the birds were less than enthused.
B000SP2JLU I have a few bird feeders in our yard, ranging from a hanging umbrella-top thing with a pan bottom and a simple plate on top of a stand, but when squirrels take over, and they often do, the birds get bullied out of needed feed. Weeelllll...Perky-Pet is a long (somewhat over 2 ft) plastic tube feeder. It holds 2 lbs of seed and each perch is a U shape, supposedly the kind birds prefer (who knew?). So, squirrel tried to nail it from above, but the surface is slippery... and it bounces.  Entertainment at an affordable price while feeding the birds that civilized people prefer.UPDATE: This is THE lure for birds in our neighborhood now. It does hold a LOT of seed, and they now flock and eat it up in a few days... much faster than before, so expect to keep refilling weekly. But oh, how cool!
B000SP2JLU I had a lot of success with the previous Perky Pet bird feeder I requested from Vine. During the fall migration, we had a lot more feathered visitors than usual--and by \"more\" I mean both in terms of sheer numbers and variety of species. Since we also have a high squirrel population (cute, interesting, ubiquitous and greedy) I thought the Squirrel-Be-Gone (SBG) would be a perfect addition to the yard.So, because we didn't have an extra feeder hanger when the SBG arrived, we took down the reliable feeder and replaced it with this.  In the meantime, I bought food that was a much better quality than the generic stuff we'd been using, hoping to reduce the waste.The SBG hung for DAYS and remained full.  Occasionally a sparrow would hop on one of the little perches and then fly away. We couldn't figure it out. Did they not like the feeder openings? Did they prefer the cheaper food? Maybe the cheap seed was the equivalent of fast food, and they were \"junk-food junkie\" birds.A squirrel did jump onto the shepherd's hook hanger and try to access the food, but after bouncing around for a few minutes he left in frustration.  So, the SBG does discourage Shadow-Tails.Then, we installed another hanger and filled our original feeder, and the birds rediscovered our yard. The feeder emptied within hours. So, they obviously liked the food.The full SBG hung there, still full, still ignored.Eventually, though, maybe out of desperation, the birds started to sample seed from the SBG. Mainly house sparrows, but you have to start somewhere. Maybe they'll spread the word that poking their heads into the little feeder openings will not get them guillotined.We have seen nowhere near the enthusiasm our original feeder triggered. But now that spring migration has started, along with a cold front, it will be interesting to see if we get more avian traffic.Perky Pet is a good company. Both feeders are well-made and attractive. The Squirrel-Be-Gone is easy to set up and adjust so that birds can get the food and squirrels can't. It's also easy to fill and clean.I am still not sure why it's taking so long for this feeder to become a hit with the birds. But if they start mobbing the feeder, I will post an update.
B000SP2JLU I received this bird feeder one day before we got a snowstorm, so we had cause to put it in the yard immediately. Almost as soon as it went into the yard it quickly became the most popular feeder in the yard. Weathering the storm the next day really showed this feeder's strengths.This feeder is marketed as a squirrel-proof feeder. It's not, exactly - too much plastic instead of metal so a squirrel can gnaw through it in time. I would call this feeder more \"squirrel-resistant\". That said, being squirrel-resistant is actually not this feeder's strength though it is a big positive. The way this feeder's anti-squirrel strategy is implemented is by spring-mounting the wire sheath on which the feeding ports are mounted. When a squirrel gets on the feeder, its own weight works against it and the wire sheath slides down, closing the feeding ports. It does work, though the enterprising squirrel may find ways around this depending on how the feeder is hung.Adjusting the sensitivity of the sliding mechanism is easy. The springs that control the tension can be moved to increase or decrease the tension with one hand in about 5 seconds (if you're slow). This is nice - it does not require disassembly or special tools.Though this is a squirrel-deterrent feeder, that is not where this feeder's strengths lie. This feeder has two very good features that make it better than a lot of other feeders of its type.First, this feeder has six feeding ports, and each has a short perch that is suitable for small songbirds and very awkward for larger birds like grackles. We have more troubles with grackles than squirrels and as such this feeder is already doing well in comparison to the other feeders we own. Second - and this is very important - the feeding ports are designed to avoid giving up all of the seed in heavy wind. In the middle of a storm, it is not unusual to see all of the seed blown out of a feeder in a short period of time, requiring more frequent refills.The biggest evidence that this feeder is well-designed is how it attracts the songbirds. This is by far the busiest feeder in the yard now. With no squirrels or grackles chasing off the other birds and no wind blowing all of the seed out on the ground, this is a feeder that allows us to watch birds instead of continuously refilling the feeder.I am very pleased with this feeder and heartily recommend it. With this feeder in the yard, you will spend more time birdwatching and less time maintaining the feeder.
B000SP2JLU Although I purchased this feeder at a local Ace Hardware store several weeks ago, I stopped putting seed in it... I was only feeding the squirrels.  Apparently, here in Florida, the squirrels must be too light-weight to close the feeder, (I've taken several photos), and the birds (Blue Jays and Cardinals) are too large to stand on the very small perches and bend their heads into the cups... it's too difficult for larger birds and they fly off.  It would probably work well in an area where little Finches flock!
B000SP2JLU The funny thing about this birdfeeder is that out of the 5 I have in my yard, this is the only one that still has birdseed in it after a week.Now I can't tell if its because the squirrels can't get to it or because the birds don't particularly enjoy it either, but it works to keep seed in there longer!I have seen it in action, the squirrels try to hang off it and eat but cannot. We have it on a shepherd's hook so there is nothing else for them to hold on to while eating. I have also witnesses some pretty big birds on it, too, eating without a problem.The birdfeeder itself is fairly light. The metal is thin and the inside is made of plastic. My only concern is the squirrels who get desperate enough might gnaw at the plastic and render it useless as a deterrent.It is super easy to fill and while the rubber hanger seems fragile, it has held up in plenty of storms and birds, so I suppose its good.
B000SP2JLU I got the bird feeder on a whim thinking it would be a fun addition to the yard.  However, I have to say that the design is a bit clunky and not very eye-pleasing.  We haven't had many visitors to the feeder...just wondering if it might be the time of year or our location.  It's a great idea and it's constructed very well, but like I said, the look of it is a bit mechanical to me.  If you have a tree/bush/or garden area to place this within, it would work great.
B000SP2JLU This feed is very nice looking and it is designed to keep squirrels away from your feed by closing the access doors due to the weight of the squirrel. Unfortunately, all my birds are avoiding this feeder for some reason. I have filled my other feeders twice and they have not taken the feed in this one down by a quarter. I have watched them looking for a reason, even let the other feeder go empty for a bit giving them no other option, but aside from a few sparrows, the other birds won't even land on this one.I don't know why?
B000SP2JLU My biggest problem is that of squirrels and large birds infesting my bird feeder. I have heard mixed reviews about squirrel proof feeders, so I thought I would give this a try. I adjusted the tension to prevent squirrels from entering. Thus far it appears to be working; however, some of the larger birds are still able to access the food. I may need to adjust it a little more. I will provide updated posts on this as well once Spring arrives. In any case it is a nice larger feeder that looks nice and is easy to manage.
B000SP2JLU I was surprised by how light this birdfeeder felt. It seems that the inner part is made of lightweight plastic which it first has me concerned because I've never seen a squirrel be detoured effectively by plastic.  The idea is, you fill the center part with bird seed. As the birds come to feed they rest on the metal bars just above the leaf design. Because they are lightweight the birds do not affect the position of the LEAVES, which if you haven't figured it out, act as barriers to the openings.  Therefore, when a squirrel comes a calling, their weight, pulls the \"cage part\" down so that the leaves cover the openings. Pretty ingenious. It also has kept away the sometimes pesky Magpie birds that often try to dominate the feeders.You have to place in a way where the squirrels can't hang from it and chew through the plastic, of course, if they're hungry enough, NOTHING can stop a Squirrel from getting through. The feeder is attractive and if you can take the time to fiddle with the loading of the seed and giving it a drop of oil every now and again, it could serve you well.  It's hard to beat that price (it was just under $20) for a feeder that could be an moderate squirrel deterrent, it's not bad.  Some people have reported having this one for 6 years, and that is pretty impressive. I suspect our squirrels have bigger teeth!  But the Birds love the support and it's worth the extra effort for that alone!
B000SP2JLU I would have rated this feeder a \"0\" or - 1 star if available. I bought this feeder about 9 months ago and should have taken it back then. The birds liked it at first, then stopped feeding from it even though it was 3/4 full of seeds. When I took it down, I saw that the remaining 3/4 of the seed were wet and matted together in a moldy \"brick\". It took about one hour to \"clean\" it and clean up the mess in my kitchen. Neither the lid nor the base is removable for cleaning, so there's no way to remove and clean the seeds from half way down to the bottom. To prevent the squirrels getting the lid off, it's designed to pull up a little way and tilt to the side for adding seed.If you turn the feeder upside down to shake out the old seeds, the lid (spring mechanism) pops back in place. That doesn't really matter because the seeds are wet and compacted into a brick anyway. I had to push a 13\" screwdriver into each port and try to loosen the seeds while running hot water through the top (cold water didn't work). I must have used 10 gallons or more of hot water and ran the garbage disposer the entire time I was attempting to clean this horrible \"feeder\". I bet it cost me $5 to clean the feeder.It's impossible to reach downward with a screwdriver to force the seeds loose, and you can't clean it because you can't get a brush in vertically. It's a HORRIBLE design. Once I flushed and poked most of the seeds out, I soaked the feeder in a big bucket of soapy water, then flushed it again. I still did not get out all the old moldy seeds.Since I could not get inside to dry it, I had to set the feeder on the floor near a heat register for THREE DAYS to dry it out. The birds left my yard and it took a couple weeks before they came back.After all that work, I decided that the wet seeds must have been a fluke -- perhaps the result of a heavy sideways rain or snow. So instead of returning the \"feeder\", I filled it again. Duh!! Within a week, the same thing happened. I took it down.It's been 9 months since I bought it, but I'm returning it to Lowe's tomorrow.This bird feeder is readily available for $19.99 at ANY big box store, yet online stores still try to sell it for much more. This feeder isn't worth 50 cents EXCEPT...for the fun of watching the squirrels try to get the seed. They cannot, and after less than a week, they gave up and went away. After that, I couldn't even use the feeder for fun.Buy a Brome feeder, and buy a 16-18\" diameter clear dome to hang over the top. It protects the birds from the weather while they eat. Of all the feeders in my yard, birds prefer the one with the dome. 10\" and 12\" domes don't protect the birds or the ports.UPDATE:  I never complained to Woodstream Corp. about this feeder. However, Woodstream saw my review and a Customer Rep. sent me the nicest letter! She said \"Your comments concerning the design and experience cleaning this model feeder have been shared with our product development team.\" I believe Woodstream genuinely cares about customers and making good products. To make up for my inconvenience with the Perky-Pet 336 Squirrel-Be-Gone Wild Bird Feeder, Woodstream sent me a Perky-Pet 337 Squirrel-Be-Gone Wild Bird Feeder as a replacement. It has three tubes so I can use 3 different kinds of seeds, and the lid comes off by unscrewing a large knob on top. Much easier! I didn't like the Perky-Pet 336 Squirrel-Be-Gone Wild Bird Feeder, but I LOVE Customer Service at Woodstream Corp.!! It's top notch--more than a 5-star rating. THANK YOU, Woodstream.
B000SP2JLU We have had this birdfeeder for many years and had great luck with it, so I just ordered another.  It absolutely does work to deter squirrels.  All birds seem to enjoy the feeder, including our larger woodpeckers.The downside of this feeder is also the upside.  The squirrel-busting mechanism for this feeder is the wire external structure, which is mounted on adjustable springs.  When a squirrel attempts to grip or jump on the feeder its weight automatically pulls the metal part down, closing off access to the bird food.  It is 100% foolproof.On the downside, I have read reports of small birds having their heads guillotined if they are feeding when a heavy bird or squirrel lands on the feeder.  I have never seen that happen, but I did at one time find the head of a small bird near the feeder.  That possibility really unnerved me.  Right now I have my feeder set to be as unresponsive as possible to weight, so that only a squirrel will close it (so it does not close for woodpeckers, starlings, etc.).  I also have it mounted in such a way that squirrels are unlikely to be able to reach it.  I am comfortable using the feeder with those caveats, but I do think the rapid closure and deep feeding holes could create a dangerous situation for small birds.
B000SP2JLU We have a feed tray outside that a squirrel is always getting into, then kicking off of (leaving the tray swinging/smashing into our window), so we're eager to give this a full test this season. The design looks solid and feasibly squirrel proof, so we can't wait!
B000SP2JLU I already had a bird feeder when I got this, so this is feeder #2. The first one is quite different in style.Here's the linkfor the first feeder (for comparison). When I added the new feeder, I filled both feeders. The birds completely ignored the new one while they emptied the original. However, once the original was empty, they discovered the new one and seemed to have no problems with it.Here are the positives for the new one:(1) It's fairly sturdy.(2) Small birds have no problem using it.(3) There was minimal spilling when I filled it.(4) The birds do not empty it as quickly as they do the first one, so the seed in it lasts longer.Here are the negatives:(1) It comes with minimal directions and no directions for filling. As best I can tell, to fill it, you pull off the top (easy enough) and push it to the side. However, as the top is attached to a spring, it tends to snap back. Keeping the top open is not easy, though I finally figured out to hook the top over the corner of the eave.(2) Because the perches are small, larger birds may not be able to use the feeder. I have doves that come by, but I have not seen them on the feeder. Typically, they sit on the ground anyway and eat the seed that the smaller birds spill.I'll keep using this feeder, but I'll keep the other one out too.
B000SP2JLU The huge blackbirds cannot steal from this one.  I feed big birds and even squirrels, but needed a feeder that the finches and smaller birds could utilize.  This is it, and I love it.  It is also very attractive.
B000SP2JLU Over the years I have tried several squirrel-proof bird feeders but to no avail. Chipmunks and baby squirrels can still go at it, especially in spring. These small critters appear from nowhere and go at my birdfeeders faster than humans can outsmart them.The design of this feeder is unique and built sturdily. It has six feeding ports with U-shaped perches and the feeding ports have sturdy metal to prevent squirrels from chewing the ports. When squirrels perch on them, their weight causes the entire metal casing to slip down, completely blocking the feeding ports and the seed. The adjustable weight activated springs allows me to change to any of the four different tensions, giving me the ability to choose what size bird I want at my bird feeder. Currently I have adjusted to the lowest tension allowing only small birds like sparrows can use them. After few weeks, if chipmunks can't get at it, then I will raise the tension level to two so that slightly larger birds can get at it. I have been using this for the past two weeks and so far it appears to be working.With regards to the durability, I don't know if the weather, in the long run, has deleterious effect on the materials of this feeder mainly from sun, heat and rain. If something comes up, then I will update this review.1.Perky-Pet 337 Squirrel-Be-Gone III Wild Bird Feeder2.Birdscapes 735 The Preserve Wild Bird Feeder3.Birdscapes 351 Squirrel-Be-Gone II Wild Bird Feeder4.Heritage Farms Squirrel Proof Bird Feeder5.Contech SquirrelStop Automatic Spinning Squirrel Deterrent
B000SP2JLU I like the capacity of this feeder and the number of feeding holes it has.  It is easy to fill, I use a wide mouth funnel and a small coffee can.  The spring loaded sides shuts off the feeding holes when squires or large birds try to feed.  I have purchased three before this one. The only problem I have had with the older one is that the springs corrode and stop working, then I just put a wedge to keep the holes open.Rain does work it way into the feeder holes and once a year I have to take the bottom off the feeder and clean it out.  Small birds lover this feeder.
B000SP2JLU This is a nice looking squirrel &#34;proof&#34; feeder. It is on the large side so ensure you have room for it.
B000SP2JLU PLEASE READ UPDATE AT BOTTOM DATED 5-2-13I have resident squirrels that love the bird feed - and many bird lovers can confirm that we come near to ripping out hair when the grey rodents take over the eating stations, we'll do nothing short of standing guard w/ guns to keep them away!Anyway - the squirrel has yet to breach this one.  It works well and the springs on the side are adjustable but I have to mention that it seems a bit flimsy and doesn't look as nice in person as in the photo.  The inner sleeve that holds the feed is plastic but it's grey and not \"new\" looking.I have this hanging next to a BROME squirrel buster feeder.  The birds congregate around the Brome feeder first and when empty, they will venture to this one.Two things - I think it's harder for the birds to get the feed from this Perky-Pet feeder HOWEVER the plus side ---- there is not an abundance on the ground under the feeder either.  My original squirrel buster is the favorite feeding station but guess what???  There's seed all over the ground under the feeder.I suppose, if I had to make a choice, I would go with the Brome squirrel buster feeder.  While I go through feed rather quickly - the spread on the ground allows tons of birds to eat AT the feeder and UNDER the feeder at one time so it's quite the site.The original is Brome 1015 Squirrel Buster Classic and retails (with PRIME) for approx. $50.  I can say that is what my daughter paid for mine at the local Agway store too so Amazon's price is comparable.The PERKY PET Squirel-Be-Gone retails for about $20 (with PRIME)but as I said, the PP feeder doesnt' seem to be as durable or sturdy as the more expensive Brome.  Birds do not know the difference between the cost but I don't know that the PP feeder is going to last more than a year or two...where the Brome is going on 2 years and holding tight.There's more to consider.  Come fall we have a big bear that loves to rip the suet and feeders down, destroying everything in its path.  So do I want expensive feeders in hope to remove them before the bears' surprise visits or do I want cheaper feeders that I won't be sick when I wake in the morn to find them torn up???  These are the things to keep in mind when purchasing.  Currently the Brome and the Perky Pet are keeping the squirrels at bay, so you choose how much money you want to invest.I know this review is back and forth - but consider everything and in the end, throwing feed out the door will bring in the birds and spread far enough that both the squirrels and the birds can eat with no competition!  Have a great day !5-2-13 -- BEAR came this Spring.  There's a 3 wk time frame from when their hibernation ends and the berries are ready to eat so they come calling for seed and suet.  Well I'm sick of them. As for the feeders - the BROME came through without a problem.  This Perky Pet feeder snapped like a dead stick.  Springs were sticking out all over like hair gone wild and the inner sheath was out and empty.  Oh yeah and the solid metal stake was twisted like a curly fry.  Anyway - the Perky Pet feeder did keep out the squirrels for the time we had it but now, it's no more cuz it couldn't last the bear beating it took.
B000SP2JLU Well, although it works like its supposed to (so far) when a squirrel climbs on it, the squirrels jump on it to swing it and when they jump off, the spring loaded gizmo pops back into place and seed falls to the ground, giving the squirrels what they want.You also need to hang this up much higher as its on the long side and some squirrels jump from the ground and climb up it. I also don't fill the feeder to the top because its way too heavy and the way i have it hung really droops the rope making it hang too low.As for the construction of the feeder, its just a matter of time before either the springs rust and don't slide up and down anymore or the tiny pins the springs click into will fail. Even when this happens its still a nice large feeder that plenty of birds can share. I honestly do not think that there is anything out there that truly keeps the squirrels away.
B000SP2JLU The Squirrel-Be-Gone lives up to its billing of resisting the actions of squirrels while still allowing small birds to enjoy the seed contained within.We have well over a dozen squirrels in the area that have become experts at defeating most all of the measures I have taken over the years to prevent them from devouring every sunflower seed I put out. Powdered red pepper works with limited effectiveness, but I've found that some of them have a taste for spicy things.Baffles and oversized pole covers only slow them down, and the only thing that works without fail is to use safflower seed instead of sunflower. However, some birds still like variety and offering a variety of seed increases the number and variety of birds that visit the feeders. This feeder seemed to be the answer to that need.Right out of the box, this is an attractive feeder. The bronze color and the leaf motif makes it a nice addition to any backyard, or front yard for that matter. The seed hopper is clear, so you can see how much seed is left quite easily. The feeder is suspended from a coated wire, which should hold up to the elements well, and might even sustain attempts by squirrels to chew through it in order to dump the feeder. The proofing part of this feeder comes from the wire and leaf outer portion of the feeder that is spring-loaded.During normal use, birds are able to land on the U-shaped perches and eat from the cutouts in the seed hopper. When a heavy animal tries to access the seed, its weight loads down the spring-loaded portion, which then covers the cutouts, blocking access to the seed. See the photos I have posted for visual reference of each kind of activity.I have to say, watching squirrels get denied is just as enjoyable as watching the birds at the feeder!With only a few weeks of use, there's no way yet to know how the feeder will hold up to normal use as well as the continued attempts by animals to get at the seed. While squirrels have been denied, raccoons can be more motivated. The effects of weather can also take a toll on plastics and metals alike, so time will tell and so will I if there is anything more to report at a later time.
B000SP2JLU It really works!  We have about a dozen or so different types of bird feeders, and had pretty much given up on trying to keep squirrels out of the seed.  The buggers would hang from their hind legs upside-down on the fence so they could reach in and steal bird seed from the feeders.Don't get me wrong. I have nothing against squirrels. We even put seed corn cobs out for them to eat.  They are cute little critters and fun to watch, so long as they aren't destroying something I own.  But I got tired of having to replace bird seed in my feeders every few days because the squirrels were feasting on it at will.Well, it's not working for the squirrels anymore!  The moment anything puts the slightest amount of weight on the metal frame around the outside of this feeder, it pulls down and closes off the holes, making the contents inaccessible. Within a day we noticed the squirrels weren't trying to hang upside- down anymore from the fence, and they have resorted to foraging on the ground below the feeders to get seed. Success!There are other nice features about this feeder also such as the small vent holes at the bottom, which allow water to run out of the seed tube.  The bottom is angled up in the middle to prevent water from pooling at the bottom, causing seeds to rot or grow/ferment.  The top lifts up for easy filling.Another bonus is that the tension can be adjusted on the spring that allows the \"cage\" around the outside to move up and down.  By adjusting where it hooks, you can adjust the tension some.The birds are happy, the squirrels may not be as happy anymore, but my pocketbook is happy to know that the money we spend on seed is going for actual birds, not just squirrels and other critters.
B000SP2JLU I received this bird feeder for free to review from the Amazon Vine program.  A house in our neighborhood has this same feeder hanging out on a tree in their front yard.  It looked very attractive whenever we would walk by and always has lots of birds feeding from it.  I was happy to be able to have the same feeder on our yard.  We hung it up in the back yard and so far it has indeed been squirrel proof.  Mechanically this feeder has weighted springs that shut the feeding windows when anything heavier than a bird tries to eat the food.  In our yard this design seemed unnecessarily complex.  The wire handle is too thin and slippery for the squirrels to climb down, which prevents them from getting at the food, though they have certainly tried. It actually seems kind of mean having all this free food out there where the squirrels can see it but not reach it. I think if you wanted a squirrel proof feeder for less money you could just buy a less complex design and hang it from a thin wire the squirrels could not climb down and it would be just as squirrel proof. But all in all, this feeder is very attractive and makes a nice additional to our back yard.
B000SP2JLU Construction is pretty flimsy, and I don't know how long it will last in the elements, but I didn't expect much for such a low price. The tension on the anti-squirrel system is easy to adjust, and it does seem to deter the squirrels somewhat. The squirrels now hang from the branch the feeder hangs on and get the seed that way. I may try adding some wire to move the feeder away from the branch. Cleaning is a little more difficult than some of my other feeders because of the greater number of parts. Ease of filling is about average, similar to other cheap feeders that I have. Overall, worth the money, but there are higher quality feeders out there for only a modest increase in price.
B000SP2JLU This arrived decently packed and intact despite some delicate parts.  The feeder has a brass finish but is made out of very lightweight materials - it looks good from a distance but the lack of quality is apparent once you have it up close.We have VERY smart squirrels in our area - and they are quite territorial and eager to feast on the bird feeder seeds.  In fact, they feast on everything - from Halloween pumpkins to anything we try to put in the garden.  Nothing survives our plague of squirrels.I was skeptical of this feeder due to it having a plastic barrier.  The squirrels here chew through everything so plastic isn't going to stop them (as I found with my garden vegetables and various covers I used to protect the veggies).  So I know this isn't going to last very long as a bird feeder.  On the plus side, perhaps the seeds will keep the squirrels out of the vegetables (and not eat my son's halloween pumpkin before it even gets to be used for halloween).Interesting concept but needs a little more development.
B000SP2JLU So far, I am pleased with my Perky-Pet 336 Squirrel-Be-Gone Wild Bird Feeder.  It's attractive leaf motif matches all of my exterior lighting.  The spring-loaded product design which 'closes off' the feeding holes from the weight of a squirrel is clever.  So far, I have not had an issue with a squirrel robbing the feeder.  The birds seem to enjoy the feeder.  In the week since it was hung, I have noticed a definite increase in bird activity.  Overall, I am pleased with the product.
B000SP2JLU I always get compliments on this bird feeder and it is quite pretty where I have it hanging. My old bird feeder had the same capacity as this one and needed to be filled more often so I'm not sure if the mechanisms are working properly. And because I seem to have more birds since my cat stopped hanging out by that window, I think it must be that only one or two of the openings is working properly. (I'm choosing to view this as a positive attribute at this point since bird food is expensive.) This feeder is easier for me to fill than my last one, but that's not saying much. My neighbors have feeders that seem to be much easier, but not the high capacity of this one.I cannot attest to the squirrel-proofness cause we don't have a squirrel issue in our neighborhood for some reason. Chipmunks, however, are everywhere. I've been keeping my eye out for the scavengers on the feeder, but haven't seen any yet.
B000SP2JLU I don't have a huge problem with squirrels normally.  The few I do have are not bothering this feeder at all.  They did for the first few days and then gave up.  If that changes or I have other problems, I will update this review.  The one thing I do like is the fact that the larger birds have difficulty using this feeder.  Living in the city, means dealing with pigeons.  They and similar large birds are too heavy for this feeder.  Now maybe the smaller birds can get some food.  I am happy with the feeder so far.
B000SP2JLU I've used a feeder like this before and was glad to give this one a try. We have lots of birds and lots of squirrels. Lots of squirrels. This is designed so that if a squirrel manages to get onto it, his (or her) weight will cause the portals to close (spring-action) and they can't get at the seed. The other one I had like this lasted for several seasons. Highly recommend this feeder.
B000SP2JLU It's an interesting design but has a major flaw: The feeder tube is plastic and squirrels chewed through it in just a few weeks. Now the seed just pours out and the feeder useless.
B000SP2JLU This feeder is easy to fill and holds about 3 pounds of mixed bird seed per fill.  The adjustment springs are easily accessible and simple to operate.  Lengthening or stretching the spring increases the weight required to close off the feed ports and shortening the spring by hooking it in the highest adjustment hole causes the feed ports to close with less weight on the perches.I hung my feeder on a 6' tall shepherds hook well clear of tree branches and no squirrels have been able to get at it.  I have set my feeder on the shortest spring travel in an effort to keep flocks of blackbirds from emptying the feeder before the smaller birds get a chance to eat, and that worked for about 10 minutes - - - until the large birds discovered they could support their weight on the flange at the bottom of the feeder with one foot and grab the wire of the sliding cage with the other.  When 2 or 3 blackbirds do this they can feed until they are full.  If more birds land on the perches, the ports do close and all the birds leave, but then they return and repeat the process.  It slows the blackbirds down but does not stop them, so only 4 stars.This feeder does work well with cardinals, song sparrows, chickadees and similar birds when not harassed by the larger more aggressive birds.  I believe the flange around the bottom of the feeder would allow squirrels to get at the feed as easily as the blackbirds did however, if the feeder was placed in a location accessible to the squirrels.
B000SP2JLU From far away this is a nice looking bird feeder.  It works on a pressure system, if something weighs to much and is on the perch the plastic covering will slide down and block the hole to get the feed.  My issue with the feeder is that the little metal figures attached are very flimsy and bend way to easy and I have already had one come off my feeder after only a few weeks of use.I would give 5 stars for appearance because it is a nice looking feeder but it gets 3 stars for just feeling cheap.
B000SP2JLU We don't have squirrels, but this is a nice feeder anyway.  The birds have accepted it well, and it doesn't dump much seed on the ground.  Just fill it and hang it up.  No problems so far.
B000SQ32MY About as simple a device as one good imagine.  Only holds about 5 3&#34; chlorine tablets, but it does the job.  I use two of these in place of an in-line chlorinater and it keeps chlorine levels stable in a 20,000 gallon Florida pool.
B000SQ32MY Had to replace a floater that had cracked up due to years of sun exposure.  This one was a very good price and looks to be sturdy enough to last as long as the last one.  Easy to use, screw off cap, fill with chlorine tabs, put cap back on and toss in pool.  Would give it five stars but it is not as \"deep\" as it looks in the picture---thought it would hold more tablets but that is not really an issue with the item, just how the picture appears onscreen.
B000SQ32MY For my inground pool, I went through 2 offline chlorinator systems in 20 years.  The parts didn't actually break, but I was not able to get the lid off of them.  The glue used to hold the chlorine tablets together eventually coats the screw on lids (since they're filled to the top with water), and even with an incredible amount of force I wasn't able to open them after a period of years.  I bought this one in order to get away from that problem and it appears to work well.  I'm a bit surprised at how little chlorine actually gets dissolved in this unit.  I put five 3&#34; tablets in, and after a week there was still about 2.5 tablets left.  It isn't summer yet, so algae isn't a problem at the moment.  Then again, the water isn't very warm.  Perhaps when the water warms up the tablets will dissolve faster.  I would go through 10 tablets a week in the offline chlorinators in the summer.
B000SQ32MY If you own a swimming pool I think it's important to own a Floating Chlorine Dispenser.  It's a great place to keep your chlorine tablets.Plus, whenever you head out of town there's a greater chance you will come home to a better-looking pool if you choose to put two or three chlorine tablets in this floater.  As you know, chlorine is important for swimming pool water.  Putting chlorine tablets inside this floater will make the pool water clean and safe.However, I recommend you tie the floater to the side of the pool instead of letting it float around.  That's because, if the pool is running, the floater might get stuck in the filter.  Always make sure the chlorine floater is tied to the side, away from the filter.
B000SQ32MY I like this product so much it was a life saver because I wanted chlorine in my pool it didn't have a solution until I found this it is a simple solution to chlorine dispensing. Very inexpensive. Opens easily. Dispenses the chlorine effectively.It even has a sliding &#34;door&#34; that allows you to increase/decrease the amount of water flowing through the chlorinator; I've left in on &#34;full open&#34;, but this is a nice feature, I would think, if you need a slower dispersal rate.I haven't elected to tie it to the side of my pool as one reviewer suggests, but simply let it float around the pool and it doesn't seem to get drawn to the skimmers as I think the reviewer was suggesting it might. Just floats around the pool doing its job. ThanksMay 7, 2014 Update I tied this last to side of pool with string the floating around didn't as I though it would work for me .
B000SQ32MY I used to buy the expensive animal-shaped ones, but they always die within a year in the Arizona sun. I will update this review once I know how survivable it is, but in the mean time for the price you can't beat it. Easily holds 4 regular (3\") chlorine tabs.If I was going to nitpick, and it isn't enough to adjust my rating, the fact that it's so well balanced means it doesn't start to tip when the pucks are almost used - I used to consider that a feature of other models so I didn't have to fish it out and check the tab status.
B000SQ32MY Before they get so ratty and discolored that I want to replace them.  I am happy with it and I would order again if I had the need.
B000SQ32MY I have an 18' round pool and bought this to replace an old one that the lid wouldn't stay on anymore.  This one works great but it is about twice the size of the one I had previously (8 or 9&#34; across)  It still works fine but I guess i was expecting this to be the same size as the last one.
B000SQ32MY I fired my pool guy who loved to over chlorinate and never acidified my pool &#8230; that is, when he showed up, if he showed up at all.  This, a creepy crawley, and a little muriatic acid are keeping my pool sparkly clean.
B000SQ32MY It's only been one season so far. It holds the 3&#34; tabs easily, floats around the pool without real fuss. We had maybe 10 kids in there and it didn't split open or otherwise get damage. now it's just about longevity I guess.
B000SQ32MY Does the job, but sometimes the lid doesn't stay on.  I like to fill it up with 3 chlorine tablets and then throw this sucker back into the pool.  Unfortunately throwing it sometimes causes the lid to disconnect, open up, and tablets at the bottom of my pool.  No more throwing!  Other than that, this works well.
B000SQ32MY This item was a great buy. It was reasonably priced and seems to be lasting longer than other similar products like this that I have owned.
B000UGT94C Peat Pots.... not much to say.  Hold their shape well, and slowly disentegrate over time once planted.  Work great for transplants and plantings.
B000UGT94C Have to get more of these!The only thing is they get stuck to one another from I guess how they make them so don't try to pull them out with a wrench like my husband tried or they will tear!  Other then that they are great!
B000UGT94C Always a useful item to have around the garden. Just throw in some potting soil and it&#8217;s ready. The entire pot is planted, reducing stress on seedlings.
B000UGT94C These are so easy and work so well for me. I start the seeds in the Jiffy Pellets and transplant the whole thing into the 3 inch pot with Jiffy seed starter soil and in the spring, I plan the whole pot in the ground, or put the transplant pot into a ceramic pot for inside.
B000UGT94C I love these - they are holding up quite well. And I really like the idea that you simply put it in the ground with your plant. MUCH better than all those little plastic pots!
B000UGT94C It's hard to say bad things about these pots. You plant your seeds in them, water them, and when you see the roots start to poke through the bottom, you transplant the whole thing into your garden (or a larger pot, if you'd like). You can start plants with even the most delicate roots indoors, and transplant them out without killing them by breaking the roots when tapping them out of the pot.The big problem is that the pot material wicks moisture out of the soil. I have to water seedlings in these pots two or three times as often as ones in reusable plastic pots. The best solution i've found is to buy plastic pots that are exactly the same size as these, and nest the peat pot inside the plastic one. That way the moisture stays in, but i can still transplant the seedling without disturbing its roots.
B000UGT94C When I germinate seeds in peat pots, I put the pots in cooking trays and keep some water in them which effectively becomes a self-watering container. The Jiffy pots held up well. These basically fell apart when I tried to plant the germinated plants.I would not use again.
B000UHDDJI This is my 3rd purchase of all different sizes.  None of the hoses had any issues when used for the past 2 years.  The recent one I bought had a small leak when connecting the male end into a hand sprayer.  I used plumbers tape to create a tight seal within the threads and it fixed the problem.  I think it was the hand sprayer that actually had the problem and not the hose.  I had purchased a hose from Home Depot before I purchased these hoses and that hose looks like it got stung by mosquitos.  There's bumps all over the hose which indicates a weak inner casing.These platinum hoses have been sitting out in the Summer Heat and have also sat out all Winter long.  No cracks, bumps, or signs of wear and tear due to the elements.  Although the hose does kink it is easily fixed if you handle and store it correctly.  I don't think there's a hose out there that doesn't kink and has these great qualities and materials.  The large rubber grip and spring are a plus.  IMO it's easier to tighten and loosen than using the standard metal coupling on standard hoses.  I can see that all of my hoses will last for years to come.
B000UHDDJI I ordered two of these hoses plus a hose reel IN THE SAME ORDER.  I emphasize the order as the hose is fine...reel is great...but the hose feature..the Trip Grip Collar..would be great if I was hooking to the hose to a faucet....but the collar is so big around it won't fit on the male connector on the reel.  It took two hours to cut the molded plastic collar from the hose to give enough room to hook it to the reel.  I don't blame the hose..or the reel...I blame the guy who pulled these things off a shelf to ship them or someone up the line from him/her who should know their products well enough to realize if I ordered the hose and reel together I planned to use them together.  This was not a pleasant experience.The hose reel, by the way, is a Ames Sidewinder and this makes my second, replacing a couple of Suncrest that just broke where connected to the house. The plastic was not intended to work with a 100 foot hose, which is what was advertised.  It not only did not easily hold 100 feet but was too heavy for the plastic reel.
B000UHDDJI This is a very substantial hose, that is, it doesn't feel cheap.  It is thick, which you'd expect with the extra plies.  I think that makes it just a bit heavier than a standard hose, but I think it's worth it.  I don't have any trouble moving it around the lawn or garden, and so far, anyway, there is not even a whisper of a kink. I don't see how it could, the walls are thick and smooth.The first time we attached it to the faucet, it leaked a lot from underneath the black covering.  But we took it off and made another try at screwing it in, and the second time it seated right and now there is no leak whatsoever.At 5/8\" it carries a LOT of water. This also means filling up the watering can quickly.I couldn't wait to throw our old kinked-out hose away and couldn't be happier with this one. Really an excellent hose.//////////////////////////November 1, 2011Adding onto my review just to say, I've been using the hose all summer, now, and it is truly a wonderful hose. Not a kink in sight, either.
B000UHDDJI UPDATE- Year later even nastier at the one connection - now to do as one person did and break the collar............ The COIL/Spring there already shifted out.....6/9/2012 Originally there was Much aggravation on my second of the same hose rec'd today - tried 9 times at spigot - and then even unto the other one - adding pictures - only difference is less leakage when ** connecting to the 1st one **  - Yet not acceptable as more from under collar also -UPDATE: 6/17/2012: picture after a Gilmour* washer inserted - Zip fix*********************************************************************It does loop/link if you don't watch it when walking with it but impressed with the weight and durability reviews - this will not go on a reel or into a hose house as they can damage a hose big time.
B000UHDDJI If I had known how much I'd like this hose, I'd have hooked it up a lot sooner. The tri-grip collar made for one of the easiest and most secure connections I've ever had with a hose. The large collar is easy to grip and allows for plenty of manual torque. The other end with a metal coupling also allowed easy nozzle attachment.So far I've experienced no kinks and winding up the hose has also been a good experience. The next time I have to buy a hose, the Gilmour Platinum will be my first choice.Gilmour backs this hose with a full lifetime replacement policy and no fine print.
B000UJZCBS I have used the peanut butter Suit cakes from this company with great success to the point the birds fought over it, HOWEVER this Suit DD-24 melt into a blob in 90 - 100 degree temperatures we have been having and the birds take one peck and leave it for seeds. Now I'm stuck with 11 more of these things.If my birds become active (I'll give it another 2 weeks) with this I'll update and make an edit but right now it's thumbs down and I should have ordered more of what worked before (peanut butter suit).
B000UJZCBS The woodpeckers stole this off the porch they love it so much. Ordered a holder so it won't happen again
B000UJZCBS We bought this case of suet cakes to supply our new Stokes Select Squirrel-Proof Double Suet Feeder.  Within a few hours, the feeder became a most popular place for the smaller-sized bird species.  While the feeder holds 2 suet cakes, we&#8217;re loading the feeder every 3-4 days (which is rather impressive.)  At $1.50 a cake (with free 2-day Prime member shipping), the case is a good deal to man and bird.
B000UJZCBS I used to make my own suet for my winter birds. I found this had everything I like in my suet. I did some pricing and found out that this was a better deal.
B000UJZCBS My wildlife loves this.  One will last about 3-4 days and only overnight if the raccoon comes.  When they like it I keep buying it.Since we take up more and more of their environment I think it's only fair to give them a helping hand.  It's getting cold out there and a full belly helps them stay warm.
B000UJZCBS We have used this for years.  While the peanut version is a bit more popular, this one is good an is cheaper.  Recommended.
B000UJZCBS I get a number of different bird species with woodpeckers being my favorite. This suet, as many others have noted doesn't hold together very well. You have to be extremely gentle with it when taking it out of the package or it falls apart. Aside from that, the birds like it, and it's reasonably priced.
B000UJZCBS So nice and super cheaper then one by one at the store's.I like it. I keep it all in my freezer so it stays nice and handy anytime I need one for my bird feeders.
B000UJZCBS Well I don't eat it but the birds sure do! Very popular with the woodpeckers and many other birds too.
B000V1UU6M This doesn't take on the tough stuff but it will do good as a light cleaner. I will stick with simple green in the future and just rinse good.
B000V1UU6M Works great on grease and grill grime. Add water with your grill pro cleaning brush and your grill is much easier to maintain. Received  packaged in plastic bag separated from sprayer with capped bottle. I would recommend
B000V1UU6M Like anything else that cleans, you usually have to use a little elbow grease to make these cleaners work.  If you leave this product on for a few minutes and then brush grill with a steel brush, most (not all) of the junk comes off.  A second coating usually will do the trick unless it is super gross black oil/charcoal stuff baked on.  At least you don't inhale all kinds of naseous fumes like some products.
B000V1UU6M I used this product to clean the grates in the kitchen sink. The scent is rather strong and I would recommend cleaning outside if possible.
B000V1UU6M This product can e used only on cool grill grates. I use it periodically to \"fine tune\" my cleaning.I remove the grill grates from the grill, spray this on, let it penetrate for a couple of minutes, and then use myGrill Brush 18\" - Heavy Duty BBQ Tool, which I dip repeatedly into water while scraping. Afterwards I use paper towels to wipe down the grill grates. Although the directions say to use papers towels in the first instance, using a grill brush first is much more effective.I agree with the leading negative review that this product will not make a dent in \"carbonized food\", i.e. those sections of the grill grates that now have a smooth black finish. But that's only a small portion of my grill grates. With this product and my grill brush I have been able to restore the rest of the surfaces to looking brand new--though lots of \"elbow grease\" is required. I'm not really that concerned with the carbonized sections, though I can use Easy Off if I want to on them.But unlike Easy Off, this product is non corrosive and non toxic. It's a lot safer to handle.Bottom line: Except for sections of grates that have carbonized food, this works really well provided you use it with a grill brush.
B000VC1AOM This little gizmo has saved my @$$ on several gigs, when it located pins I needed, to do surveys. It also found a very expensive, very small, specialized tool that another crew member dropped in the tall grass.  Highly recommended.
B000VC1AOM I purchased this metal detector because of its simple use for the beginner and tha attractive price. Out of the box I installed two fresh Duracell 9 volt alkaline batteries. Started to scan my yard and uncovered 2 quarters that were down about an inch. Also found an old token. Not bad for the first few minutes. I gave the unit a 4 star for the following reasons. 1). The unit started to randomly go off after the second day of use. There was no low battery signal but I checked the 9 volt batteries and they were at 8.46 volts. I replaced the batteries and the unit was fine. 2). There is NO volume button. So, if you are using it with the speaker everyone around you will know you are looking for treasures unless you use headphones. 3). The unit is extremely lightweight; however, the plastic screen on the LCD readout is flimsy and can damage easily.  4). The coin setting will also pick up other metals, like aluminum. Nice starter unit; however the battery consumption needs to be looked at. I will most likely invest in one of the more advanced units at some point.
B000VC1AOM The metal detector I received isn't what I ordered. When I go to the orders page there's no Seller Feedback button to contact Amazon to find out what I have. The area where the model name/number is usually placed is blank and the only indication of it's identity is where &#34;Bounty Hunter&#34; is printed on the face of the control box. The Owners Manual says Quick Draw II BUT the face of the control box isn't the same as the Owners Manual or the pictures of the Quick Draw II on Amazon, Kellyco or Youtube videos. I don't know what I received because it doesn't have a model name or number on it and Amazon doesn't have a seller feedback button on my &#34;Orders&#34; page to contact the seller. It may be an upgrade from the original model I ordered but so far I can't figure out what I have. The control box face is the same as the Pioneer 202 but the name isn't on the face. Looks to me like they repackaged a bunch of stuff and sent it without thinking about the Owners Manual not being the same as the model they sent. I'm a little irritated with Amazon for not leaving me a way to resolve this issue. The product may in fact be OK but I'd like to know what the product is and get the correct Owners Manual for it so I can adjust it to it's best performance.
B000VC1AOM It appears to just randomly beep!Sweeping the same area gives different results very time. No volume control, so when it beeps its very annoying.I tried to locate some buried copper wires without success. They are buried 1 foot deep and this thing missed them and then beeped in other areas doing one pass but not the other. I even went over an area that had the clear line of where the ire was buried, and it didn't beep once.Yawn. Waste of time.
B000VC1AOM I really dont know what to say about this detector.  Thats because I never had a chance to use it. After unpacking it, I find that the face of the detector is cracked.  I decided to see if it work, to get an idea if I wanted to replace it or just get a refund, it did nothing but hummmmm.  So I cant really give a honest review on the workings of this detector. The packaging was standard.  Cardboard box with slots to hold the detector in place. So I dont know if the box was dropped during shipment or if it was packaged that way. I have nothing but high marks for Amazon, so Im hoping it wasnt package with the equipment broken.Ive decided to buy one around my home town, so when I do, I will come back with an update. Till then, keep shopping with Amazon.
B000VOECSG Before I start this review, I do need to preface it with the fact that I ordered this from the Warehouse deals section here in amazon.  It was used, so I don't know if that is a factor or not.That said, we had to return this saw.  It never did cut through anything at all.  The chain kept falling off, no matter how many times we put the thing back on, it just wouldn't stay on.  Even took it to our neighbor, who is quite the handyman to look at and well, his opinion of it - you really can't say those types of words here!  I suppose if we reordered it again, new this time, that it might be different.  I'm not taking a chance, however, and I'm ordering the McCulloch here on amazon instead.  We've had 50 years of success with their chainsaws and well, guess I should have ordered that one in the first place.My purpose for writing this review is a bit of a beware if you're ordering something like this from Amazon's warehouse deals.  They don't check them very well sometimes when someone returns them and you can really wind up with a \"dud.\"  Something as dangerous as a chainsaw can be, that could be quite worrisome.  I've had other items from the warehouse that had mismatched parts and after I returned them, they put them back online for someone else to buy!  Brother!  Just be careful, sometimes you really get what you pay for, or don't, in this situation.
B000VOECSG This chainsaw is very reliable and does a great job at cutting down thin trees, branches and firewood logs.  Don't expect this thing to be able to cut down huge oak trees in your backyard - it has its limitations.  Not only is that not advisable without a professional, but it will likely overwork the motor and signficantly cut down the life of your chain saw.  Have used this chain saw extensively and am very happy with it for minor projects and really an important tool for every homeowner to have.
B000VOECSG I had a 30-foot-tall pine tree fall in a recent storm and bought this 14\" Remington Limb & Trim to deal with it. The maximum diameter of the trunk was maybe 8 inches.Despite my lack of any chainsaw experience, in about 30 minutes, I had all the branches in a nice pile, and the trunk was cut into manageable, firewood-size pieces.The saw is lightweight and very easy to use - just fill the oil reservoir with a little motor oil, push the oil bulb a few times, plug it in and go. I never felt like the saw was going to kick back and it feels very solid in my hands. That said, I can't imagine this would be of much use to someone cutting up huge, 14-inch diameter trees, but for light-duty cutting and limb trimming, it seems perfect.Even though it's a small saw, always wear eye protection and ear protection (it is somewhat loud, though quieter than a gas saw.) And read the manual - it's not like a TV, you can actually maim yourself if you're not careful!I will revise this review if I find that the saw doesn't last long.
B000VOECSG This is a very nice saw.  While it is not meant to do big jobs, I cut down an Ash tree that was 12 inches in diameter at the base and this little devil just cut through is very well.  A gas powered saw would do the job better, but it worked just fine for me and is great for what it was designed for which is trimming limbs, branches, etc.
B000VOECSG I originally purchased this saw to do some pruning and that's what my original review was based upon. I'm updating that review now after using it for nearly 18-months. As a general purpose chainsaw it has a few issues but they seem much more minor now than when I first used it in 2012. The two most notable issues are that the chain pops off easily and the oil system leaks. The more I used it the better I got at not doing the things that bind the chain and cause it to pop off... you can't angle the bar at all once you start cutting but my gas saw is much more forgiving on that point. I have a 20\" gas McCulloch chainsaw from the 80's that I was using most of the time but it's heavy and I don't like to use it sideways and/or near the ground because it's a beast to handle and if the chain hits the dirt I have to stop to sharpen it. I had some large stumps I wanted to cut even with the ground so I wanted something lightweight to do it and that's the only reason I purchased this and it did what I wanted it to... even on stumps over 12\" in diameter by walking it around the stump. I was prepared to put up with some of the criticisms other reviews have mentioned and it's because of those that I didn't recommend this as a go-to saw for all cutting. However, I reach for this saw first now whenever I have to cut within 100\" of my outside outlets... there's a drop in torque which is expected but it still performs adequately. I would recommend this saw as a general purpose tool and I use it for cutting all my rounds because it's lightweight, I can use it one-handed and it's quick to sharpen the blade... though it's hard to keep the cord plugged in tightly all the time. I feel a bit safer with my gas saw because it's built well, the weight of the saw makes horizontal cutting easy and the chain has never popped off... but gas, difficulty in starting and the weight of it are issues... but once you get about 100' from an outlet that's about all I can use. If you run this saw on more than 100' of cord it will likely not last too long and I use a 50' cord whenever possible by dragging the trees closer to the outlet.I use this saw whenever possible... and definitely for low horizontal cutting and whenever I'm on a ladder... because it's so lightweight. It's also very easy to use when trimming off the branches after a tree is down because you have a hand free to maneuver around. I paid about 42 bucks for it and it was a good deal... I cut about 2-cords of wood before I had to sharpen the blade and the blade on mine was a decent one from Oregon. I was using a reciprocating saw but this cuts much faster than I thought it would so I use it all the time now. I think the best feature is that it's always ready to go... no issues with gas mixing, gas pouring, spark plugs, clogged carburetor, dirty air filter, starting issues, pull chains or weight issues. The standard rounds I cut are 6-10\" and there's no way this saw bogs down doing it... and the oil is standard 30-weight automotive so that's also easy to handle. Some love it and some don't but I cut a lot of wood for my two wood stoves and I don't have a serious negative about this saw.
B000VU222S I had lower back disk fusion surgery 3 months ago. In my post-surgical state I have trouble bending and lifting heavy objects. But I can work the Toro Power Shovel! I bought it with low expectation, thinking that either it will not work well or that I will have trouble with it due to my current physical limitation. Surprisingly, neither concern materialized. Toro easily chopped through 10 inch snow bank left from 18 inches that fell a few days ago, and I was able to push it through the snow as well as move it up and down the stairs to the house. In some areas I was able to push it one handed which was an easier position on my back, and sometimes I needed the second hand to get through a tougher spot. The handle is adjustable so with the highest position I don't have to bend too much.Wet snow update:I am updating this review after the first wet snow. Toro power shovel handled it well! It was a little harder to push, but I found that I could brace the handle on my thigh and that allowed me to push with my leg rather than my injured back. Then it was easy!The hardest thing to deal was not the show shovel itself, but the 100 feet of electric cord, which was heavy, unwieldy and became almost unmanageable to coil back, especially when it became cold and covered with snow. The electric caddy was not much help, it was hard to control. Putting back the cord tired me out more than shoveling itself.I found that the Toro power shovel was stable without having to lean it against a wall when I put it a big plastic storage bin (see picture). This way when I bring the shovel in and the snow melts I will not have a puddle on the floor. The caddy with the electrical cord fit nicely on top of the shovel in the bucket (see picture).This product is build for a right-handed person.Update:I found a solution for an electric cord winding - it is called Green Leaf WW-1 Wonder Winder Hand Crank:Green Leaf WW-1 Wonder Winder Hand Crank Extension Cord WinderAli Julia review
B000VU222S Our neighbor has an ancient Toro power shovel and has been kind enough to loan it to us on several occasions.  Each year as we thought of getting one, they were sold out, and snow wasn't imminent.So this year we ordered one and while it is not as wide a span as our neighbor's older one, it did seem to have more power.A few days after our purchase and initial use, our Consumer's Reports mag. arrived and rated this shovel 15 out of 100!  We also experienced a major snow storm with accumulation in some areas of 30 inches.But, we do find it does help quite a bit.  It is not one of the highly touted power models, but neither is the price.  We don't have a huge area to clean and it assists with our regular shovel to help clear the snow away.There is definitely a knack to using it and its most difficult feature is manueverability in small path areas since you have to use it on a slight curve.All in all we are keeping it, using it, but consider it just another welcome adjunct tool in removing the dreaded snow accumulation on our property.
B000VU222S One of those products that again, makes you wonder, \"What took them so long?\" When you hear of how many people have had heart attacks shoveling snow, this just seems like one of those \"obvious\" inventions. Not everyone has enough space to warrant purchasing a huge snow blower so well, what to do? We grabbed this machine the first year it came out and boy, has it been awesome! We've been bad too - blowing more inches that it was supposed to at at time but no matter, this guy just keeps on going! But one of the best things we've noticed is that it really comes in handy when looking for something for your elderly grandmother or grandparents to use. You just plug the thing in and go! No more worrying about them falling on the ice and snow, this thing just pushes like a vacuum cleaner and they have clear steps. Of course, you can do it yourself to really make sure but sometimes, that isn't possible in snowy weather. The kids think they're pretty fun too - they don't mind helping out with the shoveling when you have this thing around.  It shoots snow 12 feet into the all, making it look like a blizzard.  Lots of giggles on that!  But make sure you keep them out of the way of it though - too easy to pick up projectiles if you're not careful.All-in-all, this machine is really a lifesaver, one that we've appreciated for the past 10 years. Recommend!
B000VU222S This is review written with Montana winter experience.The reviews were generally good with this item so I bought one, mainly for the convenience of easily cleaning the drawbridge, walkways, entry, and in front of my garage without a shovel.This device is pre-assembled, easily carried, easy to use, fast, quiet, and very user friendly.  The only drawback is not with the machine; it is getting a low temperature cord that remains flexible in the cold.  I suggest the yellow Solar cord that is good to about -50 offered through Amazon. To keep the cord out of the way always completely clean the area closest to the electrical outlet and progress forward; do not go way forward and back-track.  I use it like I use a vacuum.Overall excellent!!  It takes the snow right down to the ground and even gets the hard compacted snow from where the cars enter the garage without a problem.  Very fast, and you can easily change the length of the shaft so you do not have to bend over.  The blade is plastic but seems very durable; it has run into some small objects, plant edges, and small rocks and I notice no wear after several uses.  My wife is happy to not shovel, and it is easy on her bad back, and mine.I give it 5 stars easily, and and am buying one for the office with a low temp. 100 ft. cord.  So far I highly recommend this device for the easily accessable areas of traffic when you don't want to haul out the gas driven blowers, or shovel, or snow plow.  It will even tackle drifts with ease if you take your time and start waving it across the top.  It is fast and simple to use.  The Broom model is more expensive but is only needed if you decide to change the blade and use it for summer-time dirt blowing.  This model is a great one for just snow and is at a great price.  Don't expect it to be durable for heavy slush, ice, deep snow, or large areas like driveways.Hope this helps.Update 12-29-07Excell
B000VU222S We were getting snow about 5 days before Christmas so my wife asked me if I wanted one of my presents early.  I knew she meant this one and I was quite pleased. We got about 5 inches of light powdery stuff before I went outside to start this up. I can report it worked very well on that type of snow.  It shoots it out mush further than I thought it would, at least 12 to 15 feet.  You have to work with whatever wind there is, but this was a great tool to have around. We haven't had any further snow, but I would recommend this for dry snow falls with no reservation at all.
B000VU222S I read all the reviews and decided that the Positives had it! It arrived, already opended. I waited for snow and got excited to use the new tool to save my back. Wrong, it about broke it. Made sure I had it right. Had to pick it up and sit it down every inch then it only spit the snow at me no matter which way the wind was blowing.Clogged with 2 inches of snow and stopped altogether. I guess I got a deffective one thank goodness Amazon is paying for the return. Would have been good if it worked.I gave it a 3 since mine didn't work :( Maybe others will have better luck.
B000VU222S This is one nice tool, as long as you're using it for the purpose intended.  It's not going to handle a snow accumulation of more than six inches without doing other work to reduce the accumulation to six inches, and six inches is going to be pretty slow going.  Its nominal twenty-inch swath means that it's going to take a while to clean off a big driveway of any size.  It shoots snow out its front; if you want to change the direction that the snow is going, you have to change the direction that you're pointing the snow thrower.  It has, however, cut the time for me to clear a 70' X 20' driveway of a couple of inches of snow by about 50%, and that's been well worth the price for me.
B000VU222S Never thought of Central Virginia as a haven for snow, but the Winter of 2010 and this Winter (2013/14) have proven to be just that. Not snows like Upstate NY mind you, but multiple snows this year of four or more inches, and in 2010/11 we had snow walls (resulting from shoveling and snow plows) approaching five feet tall.This little snow shovel was on sale a few years ago for about seventy bucks with shipping included, so we grabbed it up. Excellent deal -- it is not a big shovel, only cutting a path about one foot wide at a time, and only dealing with about six inches of snow depth at a time. Still... that has been exactly what we needed, and it throws the snow 15 to 20 feet forward.To be effective with it, I have been clearing our 60 foot long x 20 feet wide driveway off at an angle, throwing the snow forward toward our yard and our neighbor's yard (shhh... please don't tell them!). Most of the snow we have been receiving has been of the light, fluffy variety and this blower works perfectly with that stuff. All you have to do is make sure that you are not blowing the light snow into the wind or else it will blow right back in your face. Blowing with the wind is optimal, if you can plan it that way.The driveway job averages about 45 minutes, give or take a few. Moving the snow off of the driveway allows the sun to get to its surface, heating the surface up helping to further melt the remaining ice/snow which allows the driveway to dry off a bit. Nice to end up with a dry, clear driveway instead of having to worry about slipping and falling all the time. Thankfully, I have a slew of commercial grade extension cords that allow me to plow the entire driveway and even about 30 feet or so of the cul-d-sac we live on. Good deal.The blower is fairly lightweight so I never felt like my arm was going to fall off, even though I would use it for an hour or more at a time. The handle is also nicely placed to allow easy pushing and balancing, which surely helped keep the fatigue away.Is the blower perfect? No... we have an aggregate stone driveway and, once you get down to the base level past the snow, the blower does become very difficult to push along and its skid plate shows associated wear & tear. If it had some sort of small wheels or a skid plate that was thicker, it might help. On asphalt this is not an issue at all. If the thrower portion had built in louvers allowing me to modify the direction that the snow was being thrown, jobs would be a ton easier as I could just go straight down the driveway - directing the snow as needed. Other than those two things, this blower works well for the snow amounts we typically have here in Virginia.If you are looking for an electric snow shovel of this size and style, and if your conditions are like those that we experience as described above, then we would recommend this unit to you.  If you are trying to move large volumes of snow in a high snow region, then a bigger unit is probably better for your needs.Recommended
B000VU222S The power shovel is very narrow; much narrower than an actual shovel and with only a half inch of snow it struggles if you go too fast.  I'd guess this is a tiny improvement time-wise over shoveling manually but it does eliminate having to throw the snow so if you have a bad back you might like this little machine.  I used it once, and after that used a shovel.  By the time I got the extension cord out, plugged it in, and then put all that back together I just didn't feel like the job was much easier (if at all) or took much less time (if at all).  This is a purchase I regret - even though I got it on sale for $50.
B000VU222S I really so wanted this to be a 5 star rating, but!I ordered this after the snows of last year to be ready for the new year snow.  I only needed it now because some neighborhood boys made me an offer I could not refuse and they shoveled me out the last snow.But the Mid Adlantic storm hit us hard in Jersey and I could not get any takers so I dug out my new machine.I bundled up with scarf and hat and I was ready.I was so excited to try my new toy.I pluged it in and nothing!!! Not even a whirrrr. Nothing.I changed outlets, a different cord still NOTHING!!I had to shovel what I have 'cause another one is coming tomorrow, urgh!I took it back to our local place I got it from and asked if they possibly had another, no.There were 5 standing in the corner, dare I ask? They all did not start and were going back I am not too angry, in fact I am going to try again since I believe it is a good product in general.If I hear anyone mention that granny (that is me) should not use this because it is heavy I will scream. They can come to my house and try out how heavy it is to shovel 2 feet of snow with a hand shovel.  I know I would have to shave the snow blah blah blah, but I know it would be a lot easier than what I just did.Don't even mention condos (been there done that) and nursing homes (will never do that), I can probably shovel faster and longer than any youngen'  :)If I get another one that works I hope I can up the rating, I am happy it works for most of you. Happy shoveling
B000VU4KM8 I saw this until on a TV show that sells items....looked really handy as I have a lot of landscaping and I already had the WORX EDGER with the lithium battery I am crazy about...SO I knew about WORX quality already...and the price and reviews on their web page was really good.....Almost got it but decided to check AMAZON.COM first....low and behold it was priced LESS and FREE SHIPPING...ordered it in less than a minute from AMAZON...arrived in 2 days! Gave it run and it was so much better than my old Black and Decker vacuum.....and much handier with the shoulder bag....They weren't kidding about the force of the blower either....So Nice to have both a Blower and Vac together that mulches great....already putting free mulch in my garden beds.....
B000VU4KM8 I'll just write this review and then go out and clear my neighbor's yard of leaves! That's how much I like this product.First off, I like the size of the collection bag.  When you're petite like me, those huge bags from other makers are just too big.  Another plus is the lever that lets you quickly switch from vacuum mode to blower.  The blower power and vacuum suction are impressive, and it does an exceptional job of mulching leaves for my Winter garden.This is the second WORX yard machine I've bought, and I'm enjoying both of them.  I think they produce a quality product that makes yard work more fun than drudgery.
B000VU4KM8 I have two gas powered blower vacs. While both work great, they are heavy and cumbersome to use for small jobs such as clearing off the back patio. So, thought an electric would be the way to go since I could store it by the back door without any concern about leaking gas/oil.Looked at serval models, and settled on the Worx for two reasons: 1) I have one of their chain saws and have been very pleased with it; and 2) they offer the quick-shift ability from blower to vac. I have that on one of my gas blowers and absolutely love it. While the quick shift design does rob some blowing power, it more than makes up for it with ease of use.There are a couple of other quick-shift electric blower/vacs out there (models from Ryobi, Troy-Bilt and Yardman) but the Worx seemed to be better-built, and has a more user-friendly bag design.After several uses I am 100% satisfied with my purchase. The blowing power is adequate. It won't compete with a good gas blower, but it gets the job done, especially on hard surfaces. The vac performance is excellent. Pulled in all sorts of leaves, twigs and mulched them up very well. Even held its own when it came to wet leaves, which are a challenge even for a gas machine. Took longer, but Worx snarfed them up.Weight is great - compared with a gas model, this is a featherweight. Also love the fact that you can access the impeller to clear out clogs without using any tools. Nice, thoughtful design feature.I have mixed feelings about the bent nozzle. On the plus side, it comes in handy for some tasks, such as using the vac under a table or to get the leaves that pack around the base of bushes. But, on level surfaces it is a bit of a pain since you have to stoop a bit. I'm 6 ft 2in, so if you're shorter that won't be a problem.The bag construction is decent. Not as robust as the bag on my Stihl, but seems like it will last for some time. The collection bags on any blower vac are its Achilles heel. I've found that extending bag life is possible if you take it easy with the zipper, don't fill it to bursting, and leave it open to dry when not in use. Plan on replacing the zipper after a couple of years. It's easy to do - just cut the teeth off the old one, and sew the new one (a long, heavy-duty jacket zipper) over the old. It won't look tidy, but it's fast, easy and works. Done it a few times with other bags on other blowers.While I'll continue to use a gas blower in the fall for the big jobs, this guy is much lighter, quieter and easier to use for the smaller jobs. Highly recommend.
B000VU4KM8 The good news is that this vacuum really sucks. It gobbled up the leaves and sent them into the bag just as it was intended to do. The blower feature provides a decent blow although not overwhelming. It is easy to switch between vacuum and blower.The bad news is that this unit is fairly heavy unless you are young and in excellent physical condition. A strap is provided which apparently is intended to assist in carrying the unit. However, I have not been able to situate the strap in a way that keeps the bag in its proper place. If I put the strap on the shoulder opposite the side where the unit is held then the bag is all wrapped up around me. If I put it on the shoulder of the same side as the unit then the strap slides right off. Very frustating.I am a Worx fan and have purchased all of their lithium ion battery operated cordless devices and plan to buy more when/if they become available. My only issue with Worx has been that they provide very lame user guides. However, this TriVac has been put on the market prematurely IMHO. This product has potential but needs more attention to detail by a savvy engineer. I cannot recommend this product in its current configuration.
B000VU4KM8 A twin-barreled blower/vac .... switch between functions on the fly ... it sounds great, doesn't it? It sure does!I took the plunge. I have a 1/4-acre lot with 6 maple trees, in a neighborhood full of full-grown trees of various species. I am also on a cul-de-sac, on a sloped property, with terraces and walls, and a privacy fence. I have a *ton* of corners and crevices that suck up leaves every year.And every year, I haul out a rake, a mower, a trash can, and a corded blower ... multiple times. My usual routine is to rake leaves onto lawns and mulch them in. A great mulching mower makes short work of them.I bought this unit thinking it might speed up my routine, and be an easier way to suck leaves out of corners, and allow me to bag mulch for easy, targeted composting.After an hour's use, I returned it.Why? Let me counts the ways ....1.  It's a compromise ... a blower and a vacuum that does neither well. The blower is serioudly underpowered compared to the $30 weedeater model I have. The vacuum can only pick up smaller, drier, freshly fallen leaves, and only manages that slowly. If the material has been in place and had a chance to lock together, forget it. After the first bag full, I resorted to shoving the barrel into a pile, letting it get a hold on a (small) handful of leaves, raising it, and using my other hand to coaxing them in.2. Plastic impeller ... if you do decide to try this Trivac, get the -502 model. The plastic impeller does mulch, but not terribly finely. Even at it's slow feed rate, this unit filled it bag every 5 minutes or so.3. Horribly awkward, and short. Typical blower/vacs have to be reconfigured. When setup for blowing, they are pointed at the ground. Use this Trivac for 10 minutes, and you'll see why. Due to it's design, it avoids the need to reconfigure .. and creates a new, worse problem. As the bag fills, the center of gravity shifts farther back, and in no time you're forced to *force* the nozzle downward, constantly. I finally started holding it by the bag and/or cord. Not good design at all. The taller you are (anything over 5'4\" or so, I'm 6'), the worse this becomes.4.  Storage. It's much larger than blowers that outperform it. And has an ungainly configuration. It's even a pain when you *aren't* using it!To sum up, 2 stars because it does--technically--work. However, it's a complete failure as a power tool. The point of a power tool is to amplify human effort. While using this, I got *less* done. Raking them and mowing them is much faster.So who is this thing good for? I don't know, really. It's too large and heavy for someone who has trouble clearing leaves by other means. Perhaps if you have mostly paved ares, and a very minor leaf burden, or are very limited on green areas you can mulch them in ... perhaps. If you have to bag your leaves, I honestly think you'd be better off renting a standing unit, and feeding them in by hand. You'll be done much faster.Unless you have very small hands ... !
B000VU4KM8 The Worx TriVac is an awesome blower / vacuum although I mostly use it for the vacuum feature. It sucks up and grinds up leaves and clippings without hesitation. The bag is big enough to accommodate a lot of material so you are not constantly needing to stop and empty it, while at the same time it is not so big that its uncomfortable while working.My only complaint is the cord. I know that batteries are getting better all the time and will eventually get to tools like this and I look forward to that. I have a fairly large yard and linking up extension cords and whipping them around during leaf cleanup can be a bit of a task in itself. That is not a fault of the product though, the tool works amazing and is the best I have owned (previously owned 2 Craftsman models, 1 Toro) and they all broke in some manner that was unfix-able within a season or 2 of light use.
B000VXYV6K I liked this because it didn't need a collar around the animal to work. I thought that it would, therefore, be good to keep raccoons and possums away from the chicken coop at night. I knew I couldn't turn it on during the day when the chickens were near it but I didn't realize it would injure any animal under 30 pounds.For me that was too dangerous. I wanted to protect but not kill the stray little cat that wanders my yard nor my little dog when I come to visit the chickens...didn't want to electrocute all the birds that landed on the fence either.Things I hadn't thought about.I can't hardly fault the fence...this is what it's made to do. but I do wish that somehow I could adjust it as it's made for animals 30 lbs and over but not safe for those below it.And that's lots of animals. Yes, it would protect against what I wanted it to but a bit scary that it's unsafe for the rest so it's nothing something I can use unless I know a predator is in the area.So let's get to how it works. It's a great size fence for the area...can go on for a mile. It is basic but a little tricky to set up.It does work and for someone protecting their animals from predators I have to love it for that. Many electrical fences wouldn't because they won't work without a collar. If someone is losing pets or chickens or whatever to a known predator I believe this would be a good fence.For example, to keep coyotes away.But for me there are too many other gentle creatures it zaps to be able to use it day to day. However, because it does have its' uses and because I have spotted predators and this could help me sleep nights in those times, it serves what it needs to for what we need to protect.
B000VXYV6K This is great either as a small animal type fencing unit or as a starter kit for something bigger. With the wiring and the battery pack provided we were able to create our own, operating barrier that mounts across our privacy fence to help as a deterrent for deer. So far we are really pleased with the adaptability of this product.
B000VXYV6K I put this on hubby's \"to do\" list and after waiting for over a week, I finally bit the bullet and decided to put this together myself. I dread putting stuff together (I thought that was a perk of getting married!). I was surprised that, with careful reading and patience, I was able to do this myself.I was a bit doubtful that this would work but was quite surprised that our dogs who love digging in our garden tried to get into the garden ONCE and since then, they don't even go near it. FINALLY!!! I'm really excited because next year I can go wild in the garden and plant the new things I held off on, knowing the frustration of having the dogs trample through the veggies/herbs.I think it's priced quite nicely and wouldn't hesitate to recommend to anyone. If I can put this together, anyone can!
B000VXYV6K SS-750RPX is simple, effective, easy to install, unless the ground is hard, and ugly. It is good for dogs, which are easy to train and remember, but not as much for cats, if highly agitated, excited, or intent on hunting. The thrill of the chase coupled with the desire to kill may erase any memory of the electric shock. An intensely chasing cat is likely to break through an electric fence, despite the shock. Some cats are easily startled or frightened, and the survival instinct of escaping a threat may push them through the fence far away from the threat & ensuing shock. Once shocked, the cat may not want to come back for being afraid of another shock.
B000VXYV6K Hooked up this electric fence around my garbage cans that something keeps knocking over.  Figured an electrified, bare 120v AC wire would do the job quicker, but I didn't want a bunch of charred critters laying outside.  Using this electric fence, I am absolutely certain that I won't have any charred critters around...even if they took a nap on the wire.The system is pretty easy to setup; it would have been nicer if it would have came with a bit more rebar for each of the plastic fence posts, as they're kind of flimsy and you're just supposed to bury them a couple inches deep.  It's really not very secure to begin with.  Alas I hooked the thing up in a big box around 2 trash cans and a recycle bin.  Nice tight, tense wire was almost invisible unless you were looking for it, and hooked up to the power box, which was hooked up to the ground...plugged it in, and the light started flashing.  BINGO!  Next time something comes to knock over a trash can, *ZAP!*Not so much.Like any man would, I figured I should test it out.  I didn't feel a thing.  Absolutely nothing.  I could have snorted half the wire up my nose and hacked it out of my mouth and not been any worse for the wear.  I checked to make sure nothing was touching to short/ground out - everything was tense, straight, the ground was hooked up correctly...and...maybe I just have remarkably thick skin, I thought to myself.I went to bed able to see the obnoxious flashing light telling me that my trash can was protected.  I woke up to a knocked over trash can, with one of the bags dragged over the wires, bending it quite a bit, and leaving the wires resting nicely on the cold, moist ground.And now the thing never flashes.It certainly didn't work for me.  Re-stringing the wire doesn't work, the fuses aren't burned out, all the connections are fine, it just doesn't work.  If it DID work, I think it'd be a pretty nice little fence based on the easy of installation and price.  Wouldn't recommend...unless wherever you buy it has a generous return policy, just in case.
B000VXYV6K This kit comes with basically everything needed to set-up a small electric fence deterrent including the main unit, wire, stakes etc...however, even though the description indicates a 1 mile range, these are a lot like walkie-talkie radio's...the range is always grossly exaggerated. This is one of the smallest electric fence kits available but as such, is perfect for our needs which is to keep neighborhood cats, raccoon's and opossum from running along the top of our privacy fence.Next, it should be noted that we purchased new stakes to attach to the privacy fence. The shock is light but annoying; a lot like a super-charged static electric shock which should be of no danger to smaller creatures although I'm still a little concerned about birds especially for use on a fence. I've not seen a problem yet but remain alert to the possibility.I'm a big fan of the Havahart products; this is a small but useful kit.
B000VXYV6K I thought this would be great around a front yard flower garden.  It may not be the most attractive thing to look at, but it  will work with Biscuit, our Bishon and our 5 pound Yorkie, Zoey.  .  But for DJ, our 100 pound Golden Retriever it was a whole nother  ballgame.  This is definitely just for small pets.
B000VXYV6K While I love the fact that this comes with a complete set, I have one complaint: the zapper could be a bit harsher, or at least have an adjustable level. I was having trouble keeping in the most stubborn; but otherwise it works well.It comes with the entire set: poles, wire, zapper, you name it.  That is a huge plus.  It's easy to set up, easy to get going, and gives a mild zap to your animals, training them to stay where they are supposed to.  Keep in mind that you want any grass or bushes to NOT touch the wire, or it will ground it out.  Also, if you have your typical eastern or moister mid-western soil you will have a good zap from this thing, so it works well. But if your soil is dry or sandy it won't be as strong. So if you have a stubborn dog and you live with soil like that, it may not work well for you.  Since we are in Kansas and it's a bit dry, that's probably half the reason why I didn't think the zap was strong enough.  We ended up going to a local farm store and getting a stronger zapper and using it instead, which worked well. But I bet if we had better soil the included one would have worked just fine!So with your typical dog and typical soil, I give it a glowing 5 stars!
B000VXYV6K What I've been using this for is to keep unwanted pets out of my garden area.  I think that for a small area it works pretty good for that, but for any sort of larger area, you're going to end up spending more money and needing to make some revisions.  It's not the sturdiest product around and you sort of have to use additional supports to get it to stay in the right spots.  I think that it's a good concept but maybe needs some fine tuning.  For what I need it for though, it works pretty well.
B000VXYV6K While this may be effective it isn't exactly what I was hoping for. The posts go into the ground fairly easily but the wire is above ground and is a little unsightly. I'm not thrilled with this item, but it's partly my fault for not reading the entire description. I'd thought it was an underground fence and not an above ground one. This makes mowing a lot more difficult. While it does work at keeping my dog inside the boundaries I don't think I'd get this again.
B000VXYV6K In fairness, the description does say for Pets and Small animals. I was hoping that my very large, stubborn Cane Corso Mastiff would feel the buzz and back off from running away. He just plowed through the fence like he was a bulldozer and didn't even blink or look back. But then again, when we rescued him from the pound he had a 9\" long ratchet wrench in his gut that he ate. I guess he is impervious to physical pain. But, he will back off when I wave the kids butterfly net in his face.I'll try to salvage the fence poles and use it around the garden to keep the feral cats from digging. But it just seems like a lot of work because the feet have to be grounded and the body touching the wire. I'm sure the squirrels will still be getting my peaches.
B000VYGDL0 This contraption is amazing. It sprays out and amazing mist. It simulates a fine rain, and my plants are very happy with not getting pounded! Barely disrupts the dirt :)
B000VYGDL0 Works great and the fittings are all top quality.  Very fine mist spray is great for the birds. Glad I got it.
B000VYGDL0 Heavy and solid. Dramm products are usually very well made, and this one fits the bill. Good for seedlings and cooling down plants in heat of summer.
B000VYGDL0 this thing will last forever. it screws right onto the end of the male garden hose fitting very nicely. it has a wire screen on the inside to filter the water. it comes inside of a clear plastic card that just pops apart and you can grab this piece right out of it with no frustration. it has a real nice rubber washer already inside the female opening. and most of all........  man it works great! i am using this thing a lot now. it will save me from wasting a lot of well water and pump running time on my well pump by it preventing so much wasting of my water. i am very happy with this product and the quality is superior. you can't go wrong with this item.
B000VYGDL0 Very fine mist and LOTS of it.Three little outlets spray a fine mist but quickly get the small plants watered.Will see if it clogs up after some use.  Right now, it is PERFECT.
B000W496PO At 48\"Lx16\"Wx22\"H this outside storage bag is a good lightweight alternative or supplement to more permanent outside chests for lawn furniture. The size is right because if this Terrazzo bag were much larger, it would be hard and awkward to move around.  It is not large enough to hold all of our oversized porch couch and cushions for 2 oversized chairs but it nicely holds the cushions for our 4 outside dining chairs and extra towels and pillows for around the pool. The size permits the convenience of adding tablecloth and napkins. It would not easily be stackable with another Terrazzo case because other than the dimensions, it is free form and a little cumbersome to get in and out of the bag for everyday use.I am particularly happy to have weather protection from our harsh sun and unforgiving dust and monsoon storms.  Made in China, the canvas is a good medium weight (typical grill cover weight) and the zipper is made with plastic teeth and metal handle. Given our extreme hot weather, I expect this to last 2 full seasons. That also means that my lawn furniture is protected and longer lasting.I recommend the Terrazzo cushion bag particularly for people with limited outdoor storage spaces. This would be particularly well suited for apartment terraces'. Kudos for PRIME free shipping.
B000W496PO I got this bag in order to store my patio dining chairs' cushions during bad weather.  It holds my 4 cushions easily (I don't think it would hold 6 unless they are very thin) and is made of a durable canvas.  But the question for me is: where to store the storage?  In other words, if I have to bring it inside, why do I need a bag at all?  And if I leave it outside I have to worry about that fact that it's only about 98% waterproof (no zipper cover) and it takes up a fair amount of room.PROS:+ Durable and water-resistant+ Free form in nature, so you can shove oddly shaped things inside+ has a handle for carryingCONS:- Free form in nature so ungainly when not full- Not 100% water proof (no zipper covers)BOTTOM LINE:  It does what it says it will do, but the rub is - do you want a cushion bag?  I am keeping it on a patio shelving unit and it does take up a whole shelf (when cushions are inside).  It has a big footprint and can be a bit ungainly - furniture covers may be easier.
B000W496PO This is a nice, roomy unreconstructed canvas bag that can be used to store patio furniture cushions during the off season or to hold towels and other pool or spa paraphernalia keeping it dry and out of weather elements. The bag has a water proof inner lining and handles that can be used when moving the bag from one place to another. My main issue with it, however, is what to do with the bag when it's empty! It is a big hard to fold up and then must be put away somewhere within reach if you want to be able to use it frequently. For the most part, when I take my cushions out of storage after the snow melts, I just leave them out all summer long so the bag needs to be put away until its time to store them again for winter. Then I decided to just put my towels in it to keep by the hot tub and store the bag under the deck. So far everything inside has stayed nice and dry during the spring thunderstorms! Although you can machine wash this, the manufacturer suggest that you don't use soap because it will reduce the waterproofing finish! I'm sure I will come up with other uses for it as time goes on.
B000W496PO Okay, it could be a little bigger, or maybe I should have a couple of these for the many outdoor cushions we have. We have two full patio sets plus several other miscellaneous  cushions.This bag is well made and is very convenient to use, keeping all of your cushions protected and in one place. A quality product that I can recommend with confidence.
B000W496PO I got this to supplement a storage container that I already have. My lawn cushions seem to be breeding and there is never enough space for all of them. This is a good size. Even the chaise cushions fit in it. Very heavy material. A little hard to carry if isn't sstuffed full because there is no rigid support to it, but all in all it works great.
B000W496PO This is a very sturdy cushion storage bag with handle. It holds my love seat cushions, both seat and back, and I can slide in two more cushions from one of my chairs. I would have to purchase another to store my other chair and footstool cushions. The problem is that I have to find storage space to put the container, space I really don't have. And I would not store them on my deck either as there is no place to put them despite protecting the cushions from the weather. It's a lot easier to cover my patio furniture - with the cushions still on them - with patio furniture covers, then I don't have to worry about storage at all. With this product, I'd still have to purchase furniture covers.So unless you plan on leaving your cushions outside in bad weather and don't mind the bags taking up additional space along with your furniture, I don't really see the the necessity of these covers. If you're bringing your cushions inside for the winter, you don't really need this bag to store them. I think I'll stick with my furniture covers instead.
B000W72GBC Isn't the main feature of this gas can supposed to be that it cuts off automatically? Well, it does NOT do that and I am amazed at the rave reviews others have posted. Yes, it can be no-spill, but you have to cut the gas off manually. If you expect it to cut off automatically you will have gas everywhere. This is a deal-breaker for me and the source of my deep disappointment and disgust with this product.I followed the instructions and watched the videos on the manufacturer's site and the first time I tried to fill my edger's tank it overfilled and gushed all over and I had to quickly release the pushbutton to stop it.I tried again on my mower and it also never shut off and flowed over the sides of the tank. This gas can is a ridiculous waste of money.I bought three of these having blindly believed the good reviews, the videos on the manufacturer's site, and what seemed to me to be the soundness of the concept. Well, I now have some expensive gas cans that are no better than the traditional ones they were supposed to replace.I contacted the company and tried all their suggestions. These included making sure the cap is on super tight, making sure the spout is vertical down into the opening, and pushing the green button fully. Do those things and the gas is supposed to stop flowing when the tank is full. That would be great except that the gas continues to flow at an alarming rate as gasoline gushes everywhere. They do not shut off; they never shut off until the button is released.I have three of these silly over-hyped gas containers and truly wasted my money on them. If you are expecting them to shut off by themselves as advertised, you will be very disappointed, as I am.
B000W72GBC This is a well built gas container and serves its purpose well. I use it to store fuel for equipment that requires a gas/oil mixture. It is easy to pour without spilling and the spout is helpful.
B000W72GBC A very sturdy gas can.  The pour spout is great.  Easy to control precise amounts of fuel and avoid spills.
B000W72GBC I am very pleased with this gas can.  It doesn't leak and fills my lawn mower without spilling gasoline. Of course, you still have to watch the lawn mower tank level to prevent over filling.  The nice thing about this gas can is being able to tip the can without gas pouring out before you get to the lawn mower tank.
B000W72GBC If you are tired of junk fuel cans then this is the one to buy. The fill is easy and the wide fill mark on the can is great. This is not like the other gas cans that you have to twist and pull this is very simple and works very good. Do your self a favor if you need a gas can then buy this because it's the best on the market it does not leak and it shuts off if the nozzle gets in the fluid like a gas station pump. I have thrown away many gas cans because of the poor design, but this is a keeper.
B000W72GBC Bought this for my gas/oil mix since my old vented can finally bit the dust.  I have several 5 gallon no-spill and loved them, so getting this was a no-brainer.  Having a push-button to fill small machines is fantastic, since the small tanks tend to give you little warning before they're overflowing.
B000W72GBC I've gone through a lot of cans in the last 20 years, and this one is, no question, the best.First note - make absolutely sure you tighten the black collar even more than you've ever had to tighten any other one, because if you don't you'll end up with gas all over like I did. ;)But once it's cranked down, it works wonderfully.No gas comes out at all till you push the button, and then it comes out in a great steady stream, no glub glub surges as it transfers air for gas inside the can.Let go of the button (which is not hard to depress by the way, very smooth action) and gas cuts off, instantly.The plastic of the can is much sturdier and more solid than the others I've had, seems thicker and better made.I'm glad I finally got to throw away my nasty 5 gallon beast I've had for the last few years.
B000W72GBC The gas can is great and have been using it for about a year now.  Easy to open and close.  The plastic tab that locks the unit broke but we can still use it fine.  No issues and absolutely no spilling when filling up!  Love the quick release valve button that makes it easy to use and to control the flow of the gasoline!
B000W72GBC At least this container makes it easier and safer. But you do need to also buy the extension,  \"No-Spill 206 Flexible Spout Extension\" unless what you are filling has an absolutely ideal opening which my vehicle certainly does not. Possibly your lawn mower might, though.Even when you read the instructions, it is not crystal clear that you must turn the black ratcheting collar until it clicks, before you pour. Otherwise the fuel will spill out of it and you will think your container is defective.This whole business of handling combustible fuel aftermarket is unpleasant (to me) but if it is necessary, this container is probably the best of the lot. Yes, for the money it should have another handle on the back side. I had to brace the heavy full container with my knee in order to have adequate control of the pouring function. Another strategically placed handle would definitely have helped. The hand that was on the top handle was also able to press the button that allows the fuel to flow. You wonder who designs these things...
B000W72GBC Seems to be one of the better designs of the new government mandated ideas .  this design does work well and easy .
B000W72GBC I'm pleased with this gas can, and so far it hasn't leaked. It also seems to be more vapor tight than my old can because I can't smell gasoline in my storage shed the way I used to with the old can.
B000W72GBC Not a bad item - it fits the bill and gets the job done - it has a child safety but is still easy to use. Worth the buy but be sure to buy the extended nozzle or it wont be much good.
B000W72GBC Item is CARB Compliant and said to be made of break-resistant material.  Rode home from the village gas station with this newly filled 2.5 gallon can: no fumes and no spillage.  Will be curious to learn how this poly gas can handles the extreme New England winter weather temperatures.  Amazon had the best online price for this gas can; but, based on cost of its readily available simple materials and its manufacturing process, it is rather expensive.
B000W72GBC I don't think there can be many opinions out there on gas cans, but this one holds gas and pours it easily. I guess that it is a no-spill can and appears to be constructed as such, but I have never notched over a gas can before and don't plan to with this one. Good little can though.
B000W72GBC This gas can is the best one I have ever used. Because I live in new York City we are forced to purchase the newer Emission Friendly gas cans. I have purchased at least 6 other ones over the past few years and they all had different problems. Some leak when filling small engines and actually push to much gas at once making the fuel splash out of the gas tank. Others have had flimsy construction at the funnel which have broken and others had a cap which had messed up threads. This can is very well made, the locking ring works fine and the push button regulating the amount of fuel coming out is the perfect solution to fill small engines. This is my second one purchased because I need two different sizes. I purchased my first one last year and have used it daily with no problems at all.
B000W72GBC I find most CARB-compliant gas cans to be difficult to use and cause more spillage, but this one is easy to use. The 2.5-gallon size is perfect for me for typical small home gardening equipment like gas trimmer and lawn mower. I find the bigger 5-gallon size too heavy, so I use two of this 2.5-gallon size. This allows me to always keep one can filled with gas if one goes empty, and gas lasts longer because of less air space in the smaller can (less air = less moisture = less water contamination).
B000W8VCXY These are great chairs, if you never take them outside, or let them get wet.Both of the ones I ordered rusted within three weeks (see pic posted in customer images), so I sent one back for a refund, and kept one.The reason I kept one is because I really do love the chairs, from the color, which is unique, and a perfect match for pool water, to the comfort, which is amazing.  REALLY comfortable, and I personally had no problems with the locking mechanism (it IS very cheap plastic, though, so I doubt it will last more than a couple years if that).BUT, the rust...big problem.  Obviously they didn't coat the hardware (screws and such), as these rust first.  Next the metal to metal contact areas of the chair rusted (they just spray the powder coating on, so this is just a poor spray job, since it IS possible to get this right).  This is a major problem since this is all along the frame, and immediately visible.Based on recent reviews vs. first reviews, I also believe Strathwood either changed manufacturers mid production, or the manufacturer themselves changed the process, or machinery...because the more recent reviews complain about rust quite often, but older reviews do not (and some of those even state they have left outdoors no problems).
B000W8VCXY The Strathwood's anti-gravity recliner is both comfortable and good looking. After owning it for a week, here are my observations:1. There definitely is a \"sweet spot\" for each person, most likely having to do with your height and body weight. When I use it, I recline all the way back, and then slowly move it up until I get the \"weightless\" feeling. My wife uses it almost totally reclined for her to feel weightless2. I weigh 170 and it supports me well. Even though it says it supports up to 250lbs, I'm guessing that people over 200lbs should probably look elsewhere.3. It is heavier than it looks. This is good because it's pretty well made, but you probably wouldn't want to lug it down to the beach. It also sits too high to be a beach chair.4. It could have benefited by having a cup holder of some kind.5. Like other reviewers have mentioned, the box it came in was pretty beat-up. In fact, the chair itself is slightly askew and I attribute it to the shipping. Be sure to check it thoroughly when you get it out of the box.All in all, it's a good product and I think the reasonable price accurately reflects its quality.
B000W8VCXY This chair is very nice and well constructed.  The webbing seems to make it superior to similar chairs I've seen in stores.  The frame is steel, nice for the strength, but it will rust and be heavier.  I wish it was aluminum, that would make it perfect.  Mine came with a few pain nicks on the sliver frame 
B000W8VCXY May 19, 2011:  UPDATE.  It's time to get the Recliner out and go for a third season of use.  Without exception this chair looks almost exactly as it looked in 2009 when it arrived.  Two seasons of use and it's still like new.  After sun, rain and lots of wind I am delighted with the Strathwood.Do not use this if you have work to do.  If you have the slightest bit of sleep in your system and relax in this recliner you are going to go to sleep.  I set this up on the deck with the intention of reading a while and then finishing some other tasks related to spring cleanup.  Whoops.  Some fairy sprinkled sleep dust in my eyes and away I went.  Thank goodness our street is populated by a pack of fools driving Harleys who believe they can take the curve out front at 50 MPH in 2nd gear.  I don't know about anti-gravity but the recliner-chair is really comfortable.This recliner is one of those items that far exceed expectations.  Having been an ally of old fashioned cheap recliners I was taken aback with the quality and weight of this recliner.  It is heavy enough not to get blown away with a breeze or even a strong wind.  Unlike the old fashioned cheap ones it will hold with ease those of us who have managed to exceed normal weight limits.  You'll have to determine those limits.  It holds Blubba and me with ease.  Not both of us together.  Just one or the other.  Maybe both.  Later.  March 26 update:  It is later now and I forgot to include a comment about the included pillow.  I was so excited to try out the recliner I forgot to empty the full contents of the packing box.  Lo and behold the pillow was there and it sure adds a nice touch to an already nice recliner.  Please permit one other comment.  The craftsmanship for the recliner is perfect:  not rough edges or annoying sharp edges.  It's well made.  Can't use now:  too rainy.  Later
B000W8VCXY This chair is very comfortable to lounge in.  But it definitely can't be left outdoors.  After a few weeks of me leaving it on my porch, it has begun to rust in a few spots.It's also not the easiest thing to lug around because once you fold it up, there's nothing to stop it from unfolding if you don't use two hands to carry it.  Some sort of clip or buckle to hold it closed would have been a big plus.I still give it 4 stars with those caveats because of the comfort and appearance.  It would make the perfect chair for taking to the beach or for an enclosed patio, but certainly not a good choice if you plan on keeping it outdoors.
B000W8VCXY What a comfortable chair! Just the kind of thing you want to recline in on a sunny day.It could be a tad easier to set up, but that's a minor quibble once you figure it out (it's not hard, esp. since people here who have already gone through it give instructions.)If you have back issues, you will LOVE this chair! Almost makes you feel weightless, takes pressure off the sore spots.Extremely comfortable, and a good price - we liked it so much, we're getting a second chair for a matched set.
B000W8VCXY We love to lay outside at night and watch the stars and all the light ships overhead but we need loungers which fold up so we can bring them inside. We'd love to have permanent loungers outside but we have no where to store them during the winter months so this has become our go to chair for the best entertainment in the Galaxy. The chair is made extremely well and the fabric is wonderfully smooth and strong. The head pillow is a really nice plus and it removes easily if you don't need it.The chair is simple to lock into position and it stays where you want it. Having a foot stand is also a nice touch and helps to maneuver the chair into the right place. I can pull my legs up in the seated position and read my Kindle for hours without any discomfort. Amazon did a great job making this chair and I will recommend it to many.It comes perfectly packaged in a strong box and there's no problem with delivery. It's an all around a fantastic product, and very reasonably priced. Thanks for making this affordable and durable !
B000W8VCXY This is a trick for grill owners that also works well on this unit.My grill has lasted years as a result of the trick, so it works, but it is debatable that you should have to do this with an \"outdoor\" recliner.  In all fairness, the description does state \" the recliner is not meant to be left outdoors year round in all weather\".  The thought is you will put it away when done, and not too many people will recline in rain and snow.You should also realize that the chair is a reclining chair and is relatively light weight.  It will blow away in a strong storm.  My deck chairs are quite heavy in comparison.  So, I would not leave this out intentionally.However, if you are like me, you occasionally forget.  And the next thing you know, the chair is drenched by a thunderstorm.So, apply the grill trick.  Apply a bit of petroleum jelly to the joints where they move.  It helps make them move more smoothly and it protects them from water.  WD40 is a cleaner faster trick also used on grills.  I use the petroleum jelly trick on screws on my grill and not one has rusted.  I use the WD40 on the surface periodically and that works remarkably as well.I have accidentally left the chair out in rain several times over the last two months and there is not a single sign of rust.If you do leave it in the rain and have not applied the trick above, as soon as you can, spray it down with clean water from your hose and leave it in the sun to dry.  If your tap water is heavily mineralized, though, this may not help for long.I want to thank those that posted reviews warning me so I could deal with the problem.And I want to say, this is an incredibly comfortable chair.But from a quality perspective, I cannot give it above 2 stars because of the rust problem.  A slightly more expensive set of stainless steel parts would make the chair unbeatable.  Other chairs, however, appear to address the problem with plastic, and those break.What is is.  I have to live with the fact I bought this chair, so the fix makes it unlikely the days I do forget to store it, that it will rust.
B000W8VCXY After 30 years of sitting on the grass, it finally came to my attention last July 4 that ours was one of the very few families not carrying a lawn chair to the annual band concert and fireworks activities down by the lake.  Thanks to an Amazon Gold Box deal that deprivation should now be a thing of the past.  Since this apparatus is likely to show again in a Gold Box, you may as well know that:1.  It comes without any instructions but is fully assembled.2.  It's both heavier and more solidly built than I might have expected from some of the other descriptions. (Probably good enough reason not to order a second.)3.  Don't make my mistake and sit in it before knowing how to get out of it.  (Simply pull the two small rings at the end of the arm rests to collapse the device.)4.  Besides making a decent lawn chair, it's surprising how relaxing it is to recline in a manner that places your feet above your heart.  Once in it, I had no desire to get out of it (even before realizing that I was unable to do so).5.  If, as other reviewers say, it rusts out, let it rust I say.  The last thing I need is one of those gargantuan padded leather recliners costing several grand.  Eventually that stuff has to be dealt with by someone.  Much easier to put this on the curb for the early morning scavengers than a recliner that's the weight of a piano.
B000W8VCXY This was definitely worth the money. I love my chair. It looks great and is very comfortable. Especially at night when you want to lay on the deck and look up at the stars
B000W9JN4S - Large can holds 5 gallons of gas- Didn't spill in my experience filling it, the nozzle seems to be designed better than previous cans I've owned.- Perfect for a storm/generator situation when you don't want to go out and fill up gas cans every few hours.- Reccommended.
B000W9JN4S This \"No-Spill 5-Gallon Gas Can\" is good quality and does indeed shut off if the tank is going to overflow. We ordered two of these to hold gas to run a generator during Hurricane Sandy and they worked well for that purpose. The nozzle is a little short so it is good for yard equipment like lawn mowers and the generator, but it would be more cumbersome to fill a car's gas tank.The nozzle is activated by pressing a button and there are two handles to help get the right angle, which is good since when full this weighs about 40-lbs and it can be difficult to hold up (at least for me) without assistance.These worked well for our needs, recommended!CFH
B000W9JN4S I bought two of these, one for my lawnmower and another for my chainsaw.  The spout is great, it actually doesn't spill any gas which is very nice when you have to fill engines with very small diameter tanks.  Seems heavy-duty enough to last quite a while and it is easy to mark up with a felt tip marker so you don't forget which tank has oil mixed in.
B000W9JN4S I have owned my share of gas cans over the years but this is the best one yet. The two that I am using presently are somewhat tall and narrow and tip over easily. The square shape gives this replacement can more sturdiness. Another feature regarding the height size is that it fits nicely on the bed of my pickup under the bed over. The spout is a nifty feature and works well for most of my uses. I did purhase the spout extension to make it easier to put gas in some of my equipment that is more difficult to refuel. Now that I have seen and used this excellent can I am going to purchase a replaement for my other tall one.Kudos to No-Spill for selling quality products made in the USA and contributing to our labor market.
B000W9JN4S I have one four of these gas cans in three different sizes and they all work great. The large mouth makes it easy to fill and the no spill spout work excellent.
B000W9JN4S Ever since the vented gas cans were eliminated, I have hated every gas can I could get my hands on.  This is the first one that is head and shoulders above the rest.  This is easy to fill, easy to hold, and easy to pour.  Being able to tip the can without pouring is great when you find yourself in awkward positions (like around a bulky riding mower) and the push-button control is fantastic.  No gimmicky spring loaded spouts to balance, no twisting or bending safety mechanisms while holding a heavy can.  Just push the button... so simple.This does pour a little slow, but I don't mind given the control and easy of pouring with this can.  I haven't spilled at all, which is great when gas is north of four bucks a gallon.
B000W9JN4S 5 gallons of gasoline is heavy.  This doesn't make it more so by adding an unnecessarily heavy can.  The can has a nice sized fill opening so you can see the end of the nozzle when filling the can.  The pour spot itself is a bit odd to use, but it works.  I have a syphon tube that I tend to use instead of the spot, because it is easier than lifting a 5 gallon can of gasoline in the air.
B000W9JN4S There are no leaks with this gas can at all.  It is air tight.  Push the button to open the spigot.  Let go of the button and nothing spills.  I've been using mine for a couple years and don't know how I did it without this.  Such a great concept.  save your gas for doing work, don't spill it.
B000W9JN4S I bought this for use on my whole house generator. It's a Honda 6500 and holds 4.5 gallons, so this can is perfect.
B000W9JN4S Expensive compared to the cheap can at the hardware store, but worth every penny. I hope it last for a long time but so far no leaks and no over filling and spilling! Should have bought a long time ago.
B000W9JN4S Well built and guess what....there's definitely no spill.  I would buy more if the price wasn't so expensive.  I do recommend this gas container.
B000W9JN4S Best of all the new gas cans. This one has the best pouring mechanism of any of them. Really good price too.
B000W9JN4S I wanted a can to fill my ATVs better. All the other cans I have seen and used have a stupid nozzle that you have to press against the tank cap threads to open. This would cause the nozzle to leak from the can if you accidentally put too much pressure on it. Then when the gas came out of the nozzle it flared out of the end causing it to hit the edges of the tank and splatter out. Then once the air pressure was changed in the tank it would start to glug and slow down and then surge when more air bubbled in causing a mess. They were just horrible.Then I found this tank. It solves all of the problems with the other crappy tanks I have used. I don't make a mess. I can precisely control how much gas I put in and stop the flow easily. I like it's boxy shape that makes it more stable. It has two handles so when you tip the tank for filling you can still hold onto it easily. This is the best tank/nozzle that I have ever used.
B000W9JN4S Not only do I like the No-Spill can's no-spill spout, which I found much easier to use than the &#34;push nozzle in to activate&#34; spout on another gas can I have, I also liked its squat shape which made it more convenient to store and carry.
B000W9JN4S This is a plastic container, not a can, and as over-priced as anything else but there's few alternatives to paying too much. I picked up two of these at a local store for about 19 bucks each but I have the same issues with them as others. The spout is too short to reach my vehicle's gas tank and though I use a funnel it's hard to hold both without spilling fuel. The spout is also not rigid enough to hold the can on the fill tank while you lift it and if you don't lift it you're not getting much gas. They also swell quite a bit when it's hot... as with most summers here in the desert... and though never kept in direct sunlight they do leak vapor and need to be vented often. I'm in a rural area and have purchased a few old metal gas cans at yard sales and they run circles around these things. Someone commented they like the screen to protect their generator but where are they getting gas that could be so dirty? I don't like storing gas but since I'm about 20 miles from a gas station and have lots of gas operated machinery there's not much else I can do so having cans that swell & leak are a concern... but that's just me. honestly... isn't 30 bucks (today's price here on Amazon) a little too much for a plastic gas container?
B000WB13QC I saw a chipmunk in my basement and ordered a live trap for it. I saw these cubes and not realizing they were as small as they are, decided to order them too because they are pretty well priced and I figured having a variety of traps would be good.Well, I set my chipmunk trap and the next morning the bait was gone and the trap wasn't sprung. Although these traps seem like they would be too small for a chipmunk, I decided to put one with bait inside the chipmunk trap, hoping maybe he would work to get the bait and spring the trap.Well, to my surprise, I checked the trap a while later and there was a mouse in it! I didn't even know I had mice! So took the little bugger out to a distance field and released him and then set all 4 of the traps. A few hours later, they were all full again.They work wonderfully, but I appear to have a larger mouse infestation that I am thankful to have discovered. I just ordered a multiple catch trap as well as 2 more packs of these so I can get rid of more at a time.About the traps: I use a small piece of cracker smeared with just a tiny bit of peanut butter in each trap. The traps have a flap door which I believe allow for sufficient ventilation. The traps must be checked each day or the mouse could expire, without access to food and water.Some people have questioned why teh traps dont have holes in the solid plastic for ventilation. I am personally glad they don't have holes because the mice produce a disgusting amount of urine and feces, which can spread diseases to humans. I'm glad all of this is contained within the trap and not leaking out on the floor or cupboard. I always wear disposable rubber gloves when handling these traps. I do not wash the traps between use because it is winter and I would not want to use my sinks for this. You are actually supposed to wear a face mask when cleaning these mouse droppings as some of the viruses contained in the feces (havanta virus) become airborne when vaccum or swept.
B000WB13QC I have reviewed a couple of other mouse traps (the green plastic Smart Mouse Trap & the Havahart 1020) which work perfectly - this trap sat in the same garage where I am catching a mouse per day with the other traps, and its caught nothing in months.  It is a novel idea that I appreciate as an engineer, but mice avoid it.
B000WB13QC I love these things! They work. They're simple. And they're humane.Okay, some complain about the 'stress' it places on the critter. Hey! Try a mouse trap! Sheesh! Check the darn thing daily for crying out loud.Here's my technique:Place the cube upside down in a corner with a few bits of dry pet food. Mice travel along wall/floor joints, so a corner is a good place.Leave it upside down (door open) for a day or two. This gets the mouse attuned to the idea of free food.Day 3 - flip the cube over.Works every time!Oh, and don't just let the critter loose in your back yard or s/he WILL be back.
B000WB13QC I want to start out saying that anyone that wants to save a mouse is borderline retarded.  They are disease carrying vermin on the bottom of the food chain.  When caught by a fox, cat or other predator, they are slowly torn apart live or chewed live.  Setting one loose in the woods thinking you are saving it will likely do one of two things.  1. Sentence it to a much more violent and cruel death.  2. Allow it to breed so you can have hundreds (yes, hundreds) more in its place.  And many of these will find their way into homes.I tried these traps along side much much cheaper glue traps and snap traps.  The glue traps and snap traps were effective.  Not one of these caught a gosh darned thing.  When placed adjacent to traps of other types, they never touched the bait on the door entrance and never went in, but were snapped or glued instead every time.The mice choose the death traps over and over in favor of these useless pieces of plastic junk.  And now that I have them, they will likely end up at a local dump for 50000 years before they break down.Nice.
B000WB13QC Useless product--didn't work for me at all.  I trap mice all the time in the metal cages and thought this would be a good alternative, but never caught one critter.  Sorry, charlie.
B000WB13QC I bought these contraptions because I was scarred at a young age hearing a mouse trap &#34;snap&#34; and seeing a writhing mouse in it's jaws so I wanted to give something humane a try. I was surprised at how well these things worked! Within a day I could hear the scratching of a mouse caught trying to get out. We tried various baits but dry rice seemed to do the trick. If it works for you, use it.The mouse can push his way in but can't get out... I can't believe I didn't think of this before! After we caught one we could drive them to a field several miles away and release them. After catching 3 we are rodent free and no animal was harmed! I recommend these to anyone who has furry, uninvited guests!
B000WB13QC For small mice like we have on the Outer Banks of North Carolina, these mouse cubes are priceless and work where other traps have often failed.  Would highly recommend you try these because these ridiculous looking hunks of plastic DO WORK and work well.I bait mine with a small cracker smeared with a little peanut butter. Our mice must be gourmets because they seem to love Skippy Chunky!!!?  Leave trap out for a few days to weeks but check every morning or else they will not survive and leave a mess.  I drilled a few small holes in the ends of mine but this only helps a bit with the cleaning.
B000WB13QC I previously rated the Kness Tip Trap, so there is more info there.  These are pretty simple and look like they should work.  But in my case they didn't catch the mice.
B000WB13QC I've spent a lot on mouse traps: at least a dozen models--some humane, others instantly fatal, others torturous and injurious but not lethal, others primitive (the slow five-day death of rat poison), and others occasionally effective or little more than \"mouse feeding stations.\"  The Mice Cube is the simplest and possibly the best.It's a lightweight plastic rectangular container with an end that opens like a door (except the hinge is at the top).  But that end is slightly longer than the other end, preventing it from opening in the other direction.  It's an entrance only, not an exit.  Simply place a small cracker with a dab of peanut butter at the other end of the \"hallway\" and then sweeten the invitation by smearing a bit of peanut butter (for scent) on the door.  In the morning you should see Mickey, looking pensive and somewhat regretful after enjoying his little meal (hopefully Mickey won't be sharing it with a relative--set out more than one of these inexpensive traps if you're overrun with the critters).  At that point resist the temptation to keep him as a pet (mice perspire and expire quickly in such tight, poorly ventilated quarters).  Simply walk him away from your house, flip his house over so that the door opens up, and set the container on the ground.  (Some mice leap instantly for freedom; others require a bit of patience and even some nudging.)I've ordered a couple of the humane plastic greenhouses (Smart Trap), but the mice had no trouble gnawing through the latch and escaping.  A solution might be the metal \"Hav-a-heart\" trap, but it's a considerable nuisance to set it up each time. The same was true even of kill traps like the Victor Electronic trap (effective for the first week, before the mice started shredding it and jumping out) and the Victor \"Kill and Seal,\" which is effective 40% of the time (it either failed to attract the varmints or the lever refused to be set or, once set, the kill bar was never released).  If you don't mind the thought of the animals suffering for a while (I doubt such a thought even occurred to my father, who grew up on a farm), there are the glue traps, the water traps, and the poisonous pellets (you'll suffer too when the smell comes through the kitchen walls about a week later).As for all of the snap traps or the rubber girdles that literally squeeze the life out of the creature, they're undeniably effective but also \"medieval\" when compared to the Mice Cube, which gives you the opportunity to meet Mickey \"in person.\"  (Now my only problem is determining what to do with about twenty bucks worth of unused kill traps.)
B000WB13QC This is a terrific product.  Within three hours I caught both mice in my house.  My house has been \"clean\" ever since.
B000WB13QC These may work great for some, but for me they did not work that great. They are a little small so the idea of catch and release was only an option if I was fast. Meaning, I had 2 of the 4 traps have dead mice in them because I did not get to the trap quick enough (we are only talking a day probably). Not sure why exactly, I can only assume the small space and lack of water and food other than what I put in there to attract them.The product does work exactly as expected, I was just bummed that I was not able to release 2 of the mice and they had to perish in the trap that was intended to be reused and them released into a nearby field.
B000WEIHPO I love how there is a handle ontop of the cover allowing me to easily remove the cover for immediate use. There is a gap below the cover thus it will not reach the ground, but I do not find this a problem.
B000WEIHPO I was hesitant ordering this cover for my Q320.  The Q320 has a slightly larger grill surface and Weber doesn't make it easy to discover that the  Q6553 cover fits the Q320 - but it does - perfectly.  The cover is well made, has a vented mesh panel on the back side to eliminate moisture build-up.  It has a handle in the center top that makes it easy to remove and is flexible enough to be simple to slip over the unit. Weber quality - no doubt.
B000WEIHPO This is a very nice cover and it fits the grill well. It does not cover the grill if the side tables are up however.
B000WEIHPO After my experience with the cover on my old kettle BBQ I wasn't sure if I was just wasting my money. Needn't have worried, this isn't the same sort of thin plastic thing. This is a substantial cover which fits the Q-320 perfectly. It has a well attached handle at the top so you can hold it with one hand while arranging for the bottom edge to drop over the grill. The ventilation at the back is good for releasing moisture and any gas that might leak from the system while it is covered; we don't want to light a BBQ full of gas/air mixture, that would void the warranty in a hurry. Not a lot else to say about it, if it fails over the next several years I'll be sure to let you know.
B000WEIHPO This cover (Model #6553 Premium Cover) fits the 2014 Weber Q3200 perfectly with the side tables folded down.It's a nice heavy cover with a handy handle on the top.  Covers & protects the grill well.One thing it's missing are Velcro straps like my other large Weber grill covers.  Those Velcro straps anchor the cover to the grill so it doesn't come off in the wind.  I may have to modify this cover but in the meantime, I'm using a large binder clip on one side to make sure it fits tight.  Not exactly \"Premium\" if you ask me.
B000WEIHPO Well made, high quality. I am using this with my Weber Q 320 grill. Like other reviewers have said, you need to put the 2 side tables down before putting on the cover. Then it literally fits like a glove! Easy to put on, yet fits snugly...no drawstring included or needed! Looks very nice too. I am thrilled!
B000WEIHPO There is nothing to secure this to the grill. It blew off during our recent storms and into neighbors yard leaving my new grill exposed. I went to Walmart and purchased a cover for a Uniflame grill which fits and has velcro straps.
B000WEIHPY Easy quick replacement that keeps your grill new and lasting long. Had my Weber 9 years now. Replaced grates and flavorizers this year and I'm sure to get another 9 or ten years maybe more!
B000WEIHPY I've had my grill for six years and started noticing that the grill wasn't getting as hot and food wasn't coming out as well.  Decided it was time to replace parts on the grill.  Can't really say much more than that the bars fit perfectly on my Weber Genesis Silver.  After replacing other parts as well, grill cooked like it was brand new.
B000WEIHPY Finally had to change the flavorizer bars.  We've used our grill almost daily since 2003 and I have replaced these twice.  The new bars totally end flair-ups!
B000WEIHPY We love our Weber Silver C grill, but the old enameled flavorizer bars were rusty and disgusting. Amazon offered a terrific price -- considerably less than the Weber website -- for these stainless steel replacements, which we purchased with new ss grates. We feel like we have a new grill -- they were easy to install and operate perfectly. We're sure these will last a very long time, as do most Weber products.
B000WEIHPY Like other reviewers, I purchased these stainless steel flavorizer bars to replace my rusted enameled bars.  After two years of average use (grilling once a week or so during the summer), as I was cleaning my grill I realized that these stainless steel bars are rusty...quite rusty, on both the top and bottom.I was surprised, so I contacted Weber customer service about the rust on the stainless steel bars.  They explained, and I quote:\"The flavorizer bars will rust within the first year of use. This is normal due to the amount of abuse they take protecting the burner tubes. We recommend that you replace the bars once they break or fall apart. I would suggest rotating the bars for a longer longevity.\"Fine.  No problem.  Based on Weber's recommendation, I assume the flavorizer bars are still doing their job, even if rusty.  However, I now believe I was too hasty in replacing my old bars.  And, when it's time to replace the stainless steel bars, I may just replace them with the less expensive porcelain enameled bars.
B000WEIHPY Purchased these to replace the enamel flavorizer bars that came with my Weber.  They fit perfectly and will provide years more of service.  It's like having a new grill!  For anyone that isn't sure of the fit of specific Weber parts simply go to:  [...] and select Order A Part in the lower right side of the page.  There is a guided search process to identify your grill and what parts fit.  Then you can come back to Amazon to order for the best price.
B000WEIII0 Finally tools I can toss in the dishwasher without destroying them. I wish the spatula had a cutting edge on one side but hey, dishwasher safe tools are so hard to find I can over look that part. 5 stars all the way.
B000WEIII0 I bought these, and many other Weber products, when I purchased my first Weber grill.  These seem to be very well made and work as I would expect them to.
B000WEIII0 I like weber because I know the product will be simple to use and high quality, this is no exception.
B000WEIII0 I replaced my schrade set due to the hanging hooks breaking off and I must say that these are heavy gauge and well made. They have hanging loops for usage on my grill and they are Weber so they match my grill.  They were a little pricey but the construction is very heavy and solid.
B000WEIII0 Nice heavy, and high quality barbecue set. We are sure this will last us for a long time. We have no issues with the product and it works just as expected.  Excellent purchase!
B000WEIII0 please buy this , its worth every penny very long great for the grill nice an long an built to last 9/7/13
B000WEIII0 Quality crafsmenship and style combine to make really nice BBQ tools.  Hanger hooks are really nice and most importantly useful.Tools have a heft to them and hang from the grill's tool hooks without a problem.  Cleanup is a snap in the dishwasher.Tongs do lock closed for easy storage in the dishwasher or drawer when not in use.Would definately purchase again.  This is the real deal, not some B.S. junk found in the stores.  This is worthy of the mighty Weber name.
B000WEIII0 These are amazing quality...great weight and have a nice rubber grip area.  Would HIGHLY recommend...I bought these as a gift and will be getting a set for myself
B000WEIII0 These Weber stainless steal tools are just great. They have a decent weight and substantial feel when in use, and they clean up well in the dishwasher.
B000WEIII0 The Weber grill is great and we bought almost every accessory.  These are very easy to clean and great to use.
B000WEIII0 The Weber Style 6445 Professional-Grade Stainless 3 piece tool set is very well made, like all the Weber products. I bought the set to go with my new Weber Genisis Grill and am very satisfied. Great price and combining to get the free Super Saver shipping is the way to go.
B000WEIII0 This is my second set for a second BBQ. The first set I bought over 2 years ago still looks as good as when I bought it. Great quality you would expect from Weber.
B000WEIII0 This is the perfect set for grilling and it does not feel cheap. I think the quality of the material is the best thing I love about this product. Must have.
B000WEIII0 Very pleased with this set of tools.  I've had many sets of barbeque tools.  These seem to be among the best of them. Very sturdy and comfortable grip.  Will see how they hold up over time.
B000WEIII0 This is a really nice tool set.  I find the spatula much heavier gauge than many on the market and love the fact that they are dishwasher safe. Once again Weber demands quality from anything bearing their name.
B000WEIII0 I take great pride in my Weber Genesis Silver grill.  It treats me well and I enjoy the Weber name and quality ... so I decided to splurge on the Weber grill tool set.  They are awesome.  They are weighty, ergonomic and durable.  Worth every penny whether you grill on a Weber or not.I highly recommend this set!
B000WEIII0 I grill a lot.  When I got married, one of the gifts received was a grill tools set from a well-known high-end cooking shop (I don't know if Amazon wants other companies mentioned by name).  They are beautiful, work well, but they have rosewood handles, that while pretty and functional mean you can't leave them outside and the dishwasher is off-limits.  I've always admired  people that clean up immediately after eating and entertaining but try as I might, I will never be one of them.  I would love to leave my tongs hanging off the side of the grill until I'm good and ready to clean up and put stuff away- usually the next morning as I tend to enjoy many adult beverages while preparing said BBQ feasts!  I came to dread pulling out my very pretty BBQ tools because I knew it meant I'd be washing them in the sink and I can't tell you how much I hate that.  When I switched from cooking on a gasser to using charcoal and wood, I began cooking on the grill more and more.  And I started hating my grill tools more and more.  When I saw these, they looked like it would be the answer I needed.  They are solid.  They feel good in the hand.  The tongs open widely, are spring-loaded and have a lock on them to lock closed.  The spatula has a beveled leading edge which makes it easier to slide under your burgers.  The fork is a fork, don't know anyone that actually uses these but whatever, it's included.  All three have hooks to hang them on things and rubber where your hand grips the tool.  And they are DISHWASHER-SAFE.  Yeah, boy, I love these things.  Toss them in the dishwasher when you are done and they look as good as they did the day you bought them.  I guess they are relatively expensive but I've never minded paying for quality and I feel they are worth what they cost.  They should last a good long time and expect to use these for many years.
B000WEIII0 I have owned them for approximately 2 years and they still look new even thought they have been in the weather the entire time.  Many other tools of lesser quality have already met their demise because of rust or by simply falling apart.  This is one instance where paying a little more for quality was well worth it.
B000WEKLTE As with all things Weber, these pans serve a great purpose and were well designed as part of the Genesis (and other I believe) series grills. It makes it extremely easy to clean the drip pan and all the grease that pools at the bottom. A pack of 10 should last you for a few years. I change mine about 2-3 times a year and I grill at least once a week. For the cost, it is well worth picking these up.
B000WEKLTE Awesome deal when bought from here to begin with and these pans are super durable and last LONG!I would definitely buy these again and would recommend them in a heartbeat! We are very happy with these!!
B000WEKLTE Does its job, fits my Q320 Weber Grill perfectly. Ships with a set of 10, and trust me, 10 drip pans can last a long time!
B000WEKLTE Great little catch all tray.  Easy to insert in holder and keeps that clean.  The trays if kept washed are reusable.  I like that.Also easy to remove for easy cleaning.  I like the whole concept.  A lot better than the cups sometimes on the other grills.
B000WEKLTE I have reordered (2) this item and use them primary to catch bacon drippings to flavor other food. One at each end of the Weber griddle and one in the drip pan at the very end of the Weber Genius National gas grill.  They are light weight and must be handled with care,
B000WEKLTE I needed some more drip pans for our Weber grill and I was sad to not be able to find any locally (at grocery stores). These fit my Weber just right but they are a little pricey at about fifty cents each, especially since you throw them away so often.
B000WEKLTE It catches greasy drips. It was delivered on time and the price was fair. Saved me a trip to the store. And it works
B000WEKLTE it catches hot meat fluids and can hold a lot.  i am surprised how much fluid this thing can handle.
B000WEKLTE It fits well and its inexpensive
B000WEKLTE I use these drip pans for the grill.  I also for use for taking meat/vegetables off the grill.  Very convenient size.
B000WEKLTE Perfect size to help catch drippings or to fill in order to help keep meat moist while grilling and smoking.  Would purchase again.
B000WEKLTE These are easily to install. I covered with foil and now have very little clean-up. This supply should last for awhile.
B000WEKLTE These are effective drip pan trays for the small portable Weber grill.  It just helps keep the grill clean and fit well into the grill.
B000WEKLTE These fit perfectly in my Weber Q240 electric grill. A single pan lasts me at least a dozen cookouts, and when it's about half-full of grease you just slide it out, throw it away, and insert a new one.Would recommend. Do not try to use a washable dish!
B000WEKLTE These were cheaper on amazon than they were locally for me. They last a decently long time, and I tend to replace the pan just a couple of times per year.
B000WEKLTE These work very well. I had a hard time finding replacements until I looked on Amazon. My original ones started to denigrate and it was not pretty.
B000WEKLTE The trays work great and depending on how often you grill or use sauces you can get quite a bit of use out of them because you get 10 of these in a pack.
B000WEKLTE This is a thin aluminum drip pan, probably the exact same one that came with your grill. Do yourself a favor and pick up a pack and swap in a new one every now and again. That way you can pitch the one you've got that's all full of sticky, greasy, grill drippings before you have to clean it or it turns to rot.
B000WEKLTE This is the same drip pan that comes with a Weber Genesis. However, any aluminum drip pan will do just fine as long as it's the same dimension
B000WEKLTE This product makes cleaning up grill drippings an easy job. It is well designed to hold it's shape and be easily removed for cleaning or replacement.
B000WEKLTE Weber makes an aluminum pan that fits their Genesis model grill so I bought a set of ten. They work as designed. YeaH!!
B000WEKLTE I owned a WeberWeber Q100for several years until it was stolen.  I went right back and bought a 200 Q and I have had it for several years now.  I really like the Weber Q series and use my grill often.  The removable drip pan that is built into the Q series catches all of the nasty, greasy, little bits that fall through the bottom of the grill.  You can clean it but you would have to do it every time that you use you grill otherwise you might a new form of life growing in the muck accumulated in it.These little disposable pans make cleaning the drip tray a breeze.  I have to admit that if one is just a little dirty I will rinse it out and use it again.  As long as you are careful it will survive the washing process.  They aren't cheap but what is?  I really like them and buy them from Amazon all of the time.
B000WEKLTE Than you need the tins.  When food cooks in your Weber grill, the drippings come out of the bottom and are collected in these drip pans.  Most of the dripping are fat which is flamable.  If you don't clean or replace the drip pans, you have the potential for a real fire hazard -- espciallly if your grill is near your house.  My Weber grill is quite a distance from the house and is on a cement slab so I don't need to worry too much.  My main concern is that the hose from the propane tank might catch on fire if the drip pan ignites.  This is a good way to make sure that your grill is safe.
B000WEKLTE You can use aluminum foil to line the drip pan of your Weber gas grill, but these are the perfect alternative. They fit snugly into the drip pan and hold up well over many weeks of use. It's very possible to clean and reuse them. The Amazon price makes them affordable, and much less work and mess than tearing up foil and fitting it to the pan.
B000WEKLTE I have had my Weber Q for about 3 years now and could never find the replacement drip pans in stores. I have been using the same original pan and covering it with aluminum foil.  These are a MUST have for any Weber Q owner.  Great price too.  Thanks Amazon.
B000WEKLTE These fit my Weber Genesis 310 grill perfectly.  You cannot beat the price either.  Ten should last me quite a long time but I'll purchase again when needed.
B000WEKLTE There isn't much to say about these drip pans. If you have a Weber gas grill that uses these, you need to keep them on hand. Nothing worse than a drip pan full of greasy gunk, and unless you want to wash them out by hand (a messy proposition), you need to keep these \"in stock.\" The quality is fine and Amazon's price is always better than my local hardware store.
B000WEKLTE These are heavy enough gauge that one can scrape excess grease or whatever out and re-use but inexpensive enough to make replacement every so often a good alternative.
B000WEKLTE During the work week I discovered that my original pan had actually disintegrated. Not having time to go to the store to buy replacements, I ordered these online from Prime so that I could continue to use the grill during the work week without having to go to the store.
B000WEKLTE These pans are small but they get the job done. They are deeper than your average alum pie pan so they can easily handle drippings from a chicken or side of ribs. The best thing about Weber drip pans is they are reusable after a quick wash.
B000WEKLV2 These are Weber products, in a Weber box and likely identical to the ones that came with your Weber grill.  My Weber Genesis Silver B is about 10 years old and these match perfectly.  The bars I received were made in the U.S.A.These are porcelain-coated.  They will last a few years before they start to disintegrate.  Some people suggest the stainless steel version, but I don't think the Weber warranty is any longer on those, and some people complain that they rust as do these.  Personally I stick with these.  These are my first replacements in 10 years; I leave my grill on my deck all winter with a Weber cover, and I live in the northeast.  I probably needed these a year or two ago, but didn't really realize it until now, when I went to thoroughly clean the grill in preparation for grilling season and noticed the old bars were shot.If you aren't sure which size flavorer bar, or any other Weber accessory, fit your grill, it's simple to determine.  Visit [..] and just answer questions about your grill type, gas versus charcoal, 2 buttons or 3, wheeled or stationary cart, etc. and your responses to the prompts will determine your grill model.These are a perfect replacement for your Weber grill.  some people feel they are unnecessary.  I think they do help return a little flavor from the smoking fat drippings which hit them.  But where I think they are important is they form a protective canopy for the burner bars, so instead of grease hitting the bar, it falls on the bars, burns off, or rolls past the burners into the drip pan.I highly recommend using flavorer bars and these are a perfect replacement, as they are made by Weber.
B000WEKLV2 I boiuyght these to replace my old ones.  These were the cheapest price I found.  Season them as the instructions state and you're good to go.  I buy another set once from here once these wear out.
B000WEKLV2 They fit perfectly and seem sturdy enough to last. I would definitely buy these again in the future as needed.
B000WEKLV2 I was surprised when I went to clean off the crud on the bars of my older grill and found they had rusted through.  I was happy to find the replacement cheaply on Amazon.  I went to Weber's site and followed their easy steps to get the correct part number then bought them here.  I actually got them through Amazon Warehouse as \"used - like new\". They were obviously a return. The box had been opened but the bars were still sealed in the original bag.  I am very happy with my purchase and glad I took a chance on the scary \"used\" label.
B000WEKLV2 My last Bars finally gave out this past month. One of them basically broke in two from rusting through.  These new bars fit perfectly and I'm back in business. Since these are designed to basically create the smoke (and therefore most of the barbecue flavor) from falling grease and juices from the meat, they are an important part of the grill. Shouldn't have waited this long to replace them. If yours are rusting through, do yourself a favor and replace yours.
B000WEKMLG For years I've been struggling with the whole barbecue sauce application process while grilling. Putting the sauce in a bowl or measuring cup and brushing it on with a brush was the best system I could come up with. I've been using a brush with silicone bristles for a few years, and that was a huge improvement. But I still had the problem of the brush falling out of the bowl or cup of sauce. What a mess! This Weber Saucing System finally solves that problem!! The container is sturdy plastic and dishwasher safe. The basting brush is high quality, heavy stainless steel with silicone bristles. It holds the sauce very well and is long enough to make applying the sauce very easy. And, of course, the best part: The brush rests perfectly across the sauce container, and any sauce left in the brush drains back into the container. No more brush falling out of a bowl full of sauce and onto the ground. No more mess. No more worries!! This Weber product is a must for anyone who grills and uses barbecue sauce while doing so. Great product, sleek design!!
B000WEKMLG Container is smaller than I anticipated.  While it is certainly large enough for everyday saucing needs of the normal amount of feedings, larger parties with a loaded grill need something bigger.  Words of caution, not negative remarks.Secondly, I think a glass container would have been much nicer and have more longevity.  I often use a Pyrex measuring cup for saucing purposes.  What they lack is place to lay down the utensil without making a mess or risking a tip over.  This Weber container picks up on the Pyrex's shortcomings.  Just a suggestion.The silicone basting brush is nice.  Not too long and touristy looking but not too short that your burn your arms.I would purchase again.  Quality of the brush itself makes it worth a solo purchase to have a few on hand for other duties besides the grill basting.
B000WEKMLG I received this as a gift recently, and decided to christen it with some baby back ribs on myWeber Style Rib Rack. With that specific rack, being able to \"paint\" all the areas is an important, but often difficult task. Not so with the awesome brush in this kit.The brush could probably be used to club someone, if the need ever arose. It's extremely heavy, which I happened to like a lot. And the silicone brush itself did a respectable job of holding (and letting go of) the sauce... but more importantly... didn't shed all over my ribs like a normal brush would.The brush holder on the sauce cup is a brilliant design that lets you keep every last bit of your sauce as it drips from the brush, and keeps your grill clean. My only gripe (and the reason I didn't give this five stars) is that the instructions explicitly say that it isn't dishwasher safe.My guess is that the brush probably corrodes with dishwasher detergent and that the cup really is dishwasher safe, but both are easy enough to clean, it isn't an \"I'm not going to use this\" kind of problem. But it really would have been nice to be able to toss it in the dishwasher.
B000WEKMLG The basting container feels cheap. The brush however feels industrial. It makes a weird combo and I rarely use it. I melted the container slightly.
B000WEKMLG Very attractice.  Very handy.  Large enough for barbecue sauce.  Perfect silicone brush that brushes on with ease and washes off easier.  Perfect.
B000WEKMLG This system is great. The measuring cup is made from very sturdy plastic and the brush itself is very solid and heavy. The brush rests in the top of the cup so you don't make a mess anywhere. The handle is also long enough to allow you to sauce your meats while they are still on the grill without burning your fingers. If you don't care about the convenience of the measuring cup you can save a little bit of money by buying the brush separate and just using a bowl but the measuring cup is very useful so I think it's worth it.
B000WEKNMY I wanted something that could hold lava rock directly below the heating element of my Char-Broil Bistro. It took some twisting and patience but I finally got it to fit tand put the lava rock from my yard on it.
B000WEKNMY great to find a replacement for my weber, I thought when my old one rusted away, I'd have to get a new weber, but instead I got the replacement at a fraction of the cost of a new weber.
B000WEKNMY I bought this as a second grate for my 22.5&#34; WSM. I use lump charcoal and some of the pieces are small.If you use a second grate and turn it perpendicular to the bottom grate, you get small squares, so less chance of fall through.This grate is actually smaller than my bottom great and it happens to fit perfectly inside my charcoal ring.If you use lump charcoal, you need a second grate, and this one does the job.
B000WEKNMY Very good grate
B000WEKNMY After 14 years of owningWeber 761001 22 1/2-Inch One-Touch Platinum Charcoal Grill, Black, the charcoal grate finally needed replacing. To be honest, it probably needed replacing some time ago, but it never bothered me enough to do something about it. Since the rest of the grill was in pretty good shape, I decided that it was time to replace some of the wear items, so I purchased aWeber 7436 Replacement Hinged Cooking Grate, a new coverWeber 7455 Premium Cover, Fits Weber Performer Grills, and this charcoal grate.Replacing the old grate showed just how far gone it was when compared to the new one. The old one had bowed several inches, which means that charcoal had a tendency to collect in the middle, and it was no longer resting on all the supports, so using a chimney fire starter (excellent, by the way) was a balancing act. I might have to adjust my cooking style now that the charcoal is 3\" closer to the food!I'm sure that I could have saved a dollar or two by not getting a Weber-branded grate, but this grate is well-built using heavy-gauge wire and I think it will hold up better than a knock-off brand made to sell at a cheap price.
B000WEKNMY This shelve is perfect for placing a water pan below the meats in my Acorn Kooker by Grill King.  Will order a smaller one to hold small pieces of lump charcoal.
B000WEKNMY Purchase this as an add on to my new Weber grill.  I crisscross it on top of each other to save the charcoal from fall off to the bottom too soon.  It is less expensive order from Amazon at the time of purchase and save me a trip to the home improvement stores.
B000WEKNYW Great light, the beam of light really covers the entire grill and is nice and bright. Love the instant on/off feature so you dont have to fiddle with the light every time you open or close the grill. Does not obstruct or get in the way when the grill is covered like other brands will.
B000WEKNYW Installed on my Weber NG E310 and it provides plenty of light to cook with even in the twilight. I purchased 2 of them as I do a lot of grilling after the sun hides behind the earth's curvature. It also has 2 bar holders; 1 for a straight bar & 1 for a curved bar. Just a minor problem; be sure you have 3 AAA batteries available to install in light.
B000WEKNYW Overall this is a pretty good product but it has some issues, especially at this price point.1) It just barely has enough light for a three burner Weber 320. For $25 I don't think it's unreasonable to expect the thing to light up my grill clearly. I can see why so many people here have installed two of them on their grills but then that's $50 just for flashlights! Weber should have at least two more LED's on this puppy so one unit is enough even if that means $10 more on the price.2) The instructions are horrid. I am usually very good with cryptic instructions but it took quite a bit of fooling around for me to determine that I needed to ignore what the instructions appeared to say and use brackets A1 and A2 to mount on my Weber 320.3) If you don't turn off the light it says in semi-on mode until your battery dies. Stupid plan. When the lid is down it should go all the way off, and when the lid is up it should turn on; it shouldn't even have a power button for water to get inside. I think the semi-on mode is so you can find it in the dark, but I still say it is a bad design. That or they should have added a small LED on the front to let you easily see when it is powered on from a distance.All that said, once installed it does work okay and it looks good. The auto on/off when you move the lid is a nice touch and the way it mounts it stays out of the way when the lid is closed so you can put a cover on your grill without an issue.The minimal light is my major gripe and if you have a grill with 4 or more burners you may as well just buy two of these from the get go as I may even end up buying a second one with my three burner grill...
B000WEKNYW Purchased WEBER E-670 (see my praising review).  Two of these lights in gray came with the grill.  They work wonderfully.  They attach to the handle with ease.I liked those two little lights so much I wanted a third.  So I ordered this light.  Now I had two gray lights and one black light.  I didn't like the look so I ordered two more black lights.Again, necessary brackes (A) or (B) are supplied to attach to your grill.  Weather sealed plugs nest the batteries.  The lights are well built and stay put.  Easily wiped clean after grilling.  They take the heat well.  No issues what so ever.  They provide suable light to the grilling surface for those after hours cooking marathons.  They are not whimiscal but practical, well engineered, and solidly constructed.  Nice job Weber!One word of caution. I have seen these lights with a more yellowish light color (3000K) and the bright white (5000K) tone.  I was partial to the brighter white light.  I believe the difference may have due to different production dates.Purchase again?  YES
B000WEKNYW So easy to install and perfect for the grill.  Open the grill and the light goes on automatically.  Love it.  I believe you can shut it off too if you don't want it to go on automatically.  Just turn it on yourself.
B000WEKNYW This is a great little device. It is easy to put together. Does not com with three AAA batteries and has an auto on that works great. The light really lights up my meat at night and who does not enjoy looking at their meat with the light on?
B000WEKNYW Use it on my Spirit E-320. Easy to install, provides very bright light. Conveniently turns off when the lid is closed. Very thought through device. Highly recommended for any Weber owner.
B000WEKNYW I bought a Summit and it has two of these lights on the handle. Their light is too weak to be of much use. Better to get a gooseneck, attachable version.
B000WEKNYW If you prefer cooking out in the weather, this no effort (auto on when you lift the grill cover) grill lamp sure beats the heck out of headlamps, flashlights, etc..., and has great a great battery life; over a year so far!  Would be nice if batteries came with it, but hardly a deal breaker. It does come with two different attachement clamps for the different Weber grills and extra screws.
B000WEKNYW I had one of these on my beloved Genesis Silver B. When I gave the grill a new home to upgrade to aGenesis S-320, I ordered this the same day.If you're grilling after dark, this light is just flat out awesome. It's just bright enough to cover your grilling area, without attracting every bug in the neighborhood. And because the lights are LED's with a gravity switch, you're never burning through batteries. In fact, I never used the power switch on my old one, and the three AAA batteries kept the thing going strong for at least a year.Seriously, once you use one of these, you will never, ever go back.
B000WEKNYW I was concerned that there may not be enough light output to actually see the food being grilled.  But it's a Weber on my new Weber grill so the quality had to be good.  Installed quickly.. and the first time I used I had my flashlight handy thinking I still might need it.  Well I didn't and very happy how well this lights up the grilling area.
B000WEKNYW The last time I searched for lights many moons ago, non of them allowed the use of a grill cover without dismantling/removing the light. These are so well integrated with the grill, I hardly notice they are addons.  I should have bought these years ago.  No more grilling by flashlight for me!  I strongly advise buying two if a single light is deemed insufficient.  It certainly won't light a movie set but is totally adequate for grilling.  Will update if I run into any hiccups in the future.Hmm, it just occurred to me that it might NOT be a good idea to leave them on the grill over winter.  Extreme cold temps and cycles of condensation might wreak havoc on the electronics.  Anyone have experience on durability over 4 seasons?
B000WEMFQG Fits perfectly of course. Like that it snugs along the bottom so it isn't dislodged by wind. Pretty durable vinyl.
B000WEMFQG for years we had larger grills on wheels and they always lasted about 4 to 5 years because we had no inside storage for them. Living on The Oregon Coast can ruin a good grill in a couple years, even the so called stainless ones. They rust faster then the painted ones unless it made of 316 grade  marine stainless which runs into the thousands. This small weber grill works great ,cooks fast and just stores on a garage shelf during bad weather. And the outside is made of aluminum that holds up great . An added plus is we can take it to the beach as wellRuns on 1 pound tanks or purchase a separate hose as we did to use you 20 pound tank(a lot cheaper)
B000WEMFQG I used to own a Weber Q-100 but it was stolen.  I then purchased a Q-200 but I replaced it after several years with a Char-Broil TRU Infrared Grill2Go X200.  I wanted a cover for it and this one fit perfectly.  It keeps my grill dry, clean and free of dust.  I will buy another one when this one wears out.
B000WEMFQG This cover fits easily and perfectly over the Weber Baby Q grill and protects the grill from rain and dirt. The snug fit ensure that it won't be blown away by the wind. Two draw cords let you snug it in further if you want. Seems well made and should last for several seasons.
B000WEMFQG This cover is very well made and should last a long time with care. It is roomy enough to cover the BBQ even with the attached Weber tables.
B000WEMFQG This cover is well made of a very heavy vinyl.  It fit my Q100 perfectly.  It goes on and off easily, and looks nice.  It's a very reasonable price for this quality.
B000WEMFQG I am replacing the exact cover I bought 7 years ago.  My old one is still in one piece, but it has been through, rain, snow, hail and 110 degree summers.  I thought it was time to retire the girl out.The cover fits absolutely perfectly and is made of high quality material, or it never would have made it this long!As for the Weber grill, it is still working great also.  I just love it!
B000WEMFSO Bought this for cleaning Cuisinart CGG-200 that comes with enamel-coated grates. Works great and still no rust on grates yet! :)
B000WEMFSO I am a charcoal grill kind of gal and this is the first time I've used a grill brush other than the old-school square-headed brush with very stiff, dense bristles. I like this 21-inch T-brush better than the old kind in terms of having a wider brush head and a longer handle; THEORETICALLY, it seems like it would make grill cleaning faster and easier (especially if one wanted to clean the grill while it is still warm). Unfortunately, it doesn't work as well as I had hoped, which is a bummer as I kind of hate those square brushes.From reading the description on the product page, it seems that this brush is intended more for cleaning gas grill grates but it doesn't say that outright and doesn't say it shouldn't be used on charcoal grills. In fact, one of the product pictures shows it being used on a charcoal grill.I also have an infrared grill, though I don't use it much, and perhaps this brush would be better for that. For the charcoal grill, however, I felt that this brush would have been SO much more effective if it had denser, stiffer bristles. I'm guessing that this brush was made \"gentler\" for those with ceramic grill plates.It's too late to send it back as I've already used it, but I don't think I'd buy another one. It did fine on the larger food bits stuck to the grill tines, but did not clean the tines otherwise as well as I'd hoped.Can't recommend this for charcoal grills, but it may be fine for grills with other cooking surfaces.
B000WEMFSO I cant begin to tell you how many brushes I've bought and thrown out. Bought this baby and THIS IS THE ONE!!!I use it on my stainless steel round grates and it works great getting not only on top, but in between. The extra long handle and sturdy wooden handle saves the hair on your hands from getting singed off if you've got it on high burning off the residue.  I also use sideways motion for the really stubborn burned off foods and it works like a charm.  You can really apply decent pressure with this brush too. So stop looking... and buy it. You'll be happy you did.
B000WEMFSO i cook either on my smoker or grill at least once a week all year, used this grill brush everytime and its still in great shape.  Every other grill brush ive ever used seems to only last maybe a season if that, I would buy this again in a heartbeat.
B000WEMFSO I grill on my Weber charcoal grill three seasons.  Typically I go through two or three brushes from the supermarket each year.  I bought this one a year ago and it is still going strong.  It is also far superior at cleaning the grill grates.  The long handle keeps mu knuckles from the hot coals and makes short work of the toughest mess.One thing I do that I'm not sure is obvious - I use it vertically (the short pointy side) to get between the grate slats.  It fits perfectly and you can get all the gunk on the sides and bottom of the grate.
B000WEMFSO It cleans the crates ok. You will get about 70% of stuff removed from between the crates, too.The only negative that I can think of is that the handle is too flexible so it'll take more strokes to brush the crates than if the handle was sturdy.Maybe they done so for a reason which I don't understand?
B000WEMFSO It is the typical high quality Weber product we are used to. The price is right and they hold up well.
B000WEMFSO It's long enough to reach the back of the grill.  Fairly stiff.  For heavy stuff I think I shall need a bladed scraper.  The bristles do not come out and leave dangerous bits on the grate.  Knocks off the easy stuff.
B000WEMFSO I've been using this brush now for approx. 3 yrs.  I replaced the first one after about 2 years, which is good, because I grill out almost evey night.  The brush design cleans great between grates and makes this job of cleaning grates a breeze.  Good quality product and have not had any issues with the wire bristles coming out and potentially ending up in the food.  I've used many style brushes over the years and this is by far the best designed grill brush!
B000WEMFSO The Weber brush arrived and worked as expected. The brush in the picture is what I got. It definitely works best when the grill is still warm.
B000WEMFSO The Weber grill is great and we bought almost every accessory. This does amazingly well cleaning the grates. I'm a big fan.
B000WEMFSO This brush is well made and is fine. Nothing spectacular. There are so many brushes out there but it seems like this one will last longer based on the materials used to make it.
B000WEMFSO Using this on my Weber Genesis Grill, it works good, but it doesn't get completely through the grill cross, I have to use a different brush to get completely through the edges. However, during mid grilling cleaning, this works perfectly, the arm is long which gives me leverage and distance from the heat.
B000WEMFSO We use this brush to clean our grates of our Weber Q300, 200 and charcoal grills. Works great. The 3D effect of this brush cleans well even between the bars.For Weber larger grills like Spirit and 22.5 inch charcoal use this one; for smaller BBQs the short one.
B000WEMFSO When I purchased this, I thought it would be great for getting between the grates on my grill.  Though it's well constructed, the head is a little wide and doesn't fit in the crevices as well as I expected.
B000WEMFSO I originally contemplated purchasing the grill daddy clean brush for about $20. I decided on this after reading a few reviews in a BBQ forum. I know the name Weber has quite a history and tradition for good products.The brush itself is definitely long enough for all of my needs. It can easily reach the back of my grill without me having to bend over it or risk burning my hand(s). The handle is sturdy and comfortable to grip. The bristles of the brush are rough enough to remove all of the gunk from my grill while not scratching the grates.Yesterday I poured some water over the bristles and cleaned the grill to somewhat replicate the grill daddy experience. The water seemed to make it easier to remove the grime from the grill.In the end, this is a great brush that does exactly what it should. Definitely worth the price paid (so far).
B000WEMFSO Purchased the top of the line Weber Summit E670, had to out fit it with nothing but the best in accessories right?OK, this is a nice brush.  Does a pretty decent job of cleaning the grates after high temp baking.  My only gripe is that the flexible handle has a tendency to bend after prolonged scrubbing.  Easily remidied by just turing it over to bend it back on the second round of scrubbing.  Having used the flat head styled brushes before, I wanted to try this one and I am glad I did.I think this used in combination with the flat replaceable styled heads is a sure win.  This tool is especially nice for getting in between the individual grates.Will I order again when it is no longer effective? YES.  Will I also be ordering the flat syled heads?  YES.  Is this a quality product?  YES.
B000WEMFSO I thought this would solve all my problems.  The traditional brushes seem to \"waste\" a lot of their surface area in that the bristles on the leading edge get squashed down pretty quickly and you end up using the wood (or in some cases) plastic to smear things around.  This looked like it would not have that problem.  But the bristle density leaves a lot to be desired and they tend to get squashed very easily.  I don't think this is any better, or in fairness, any worse than the traditional design.  I do find that I miss the metal scraper part that is found on traditional brushes, especially if it has the little cut out on the side to scrape each individual \"rung\" of the grate.  So I'll keep using this until it doesn't work but I doubt I'll get another after that.
B000WEMFSO I picked one of these up and I'm happy with it. The bristles aren't as sturdy as other brushes, but the fact that it gets between so many grates at once is awesome, and worth a few extra passes. Plus, being Weber, I didn't have to worry about it messing up the \"porcelain enamel\" grates.Update: After many months of use I find it doesn't do the job as well as when it was new. Maybe to be expected but for the price I wanted a longer life.
B000WEMFSO A bit pricy but probably worth it because it works great and still looks like new after a dozen uses.........seems to be very compatible with the Weber SS grates.........don't know how it would do on Cast Iron but probably OK.
B000WEMG24 $8.00 for golf tees?  I must be crazy, right?  I think these are totally worth it.  First, the part the ball sits on is just the same as regular zero friction tees.  But these have a second part that can slide up and down the shaft and then lock on at the height you want.  It isn't infinitely adjustable, there are 7 or 8 \"stops\" that give you as many tee heights.  You could use one tee for the whole round and adjust it as needed or carry one for your driver, one for your three wood and one for irons, or whatever.  What I like is that your ball will be at exactly the same height for every tee shot.  Hitting a golf ball has infinite variables and this tee makes it infinity - 1.  Could you do the same thing with some tape or marker on a regular tee?  You could, but in my opinion this is easier and somewhat more elegant.  I have never broken one but the zero friction tines get pretty beat up after 2-3 rounds.  My dad belongs to a private club and I get to play with him 4-5 times a season.  They have a basket at the first tee filled with wooden tees free for the taking.  I used to always stock up on a bunch when I played so I never had to buy tees.  Now that I use these, I haven't taken a single one.
B000WEMG24 I bought this to go along with my recent purchase of a weber BBQ grillWeber 751001 22 1/2-Inch One-Touch Gold Charcoal Grill, Black, it does what it's supposed to do and keeps all my other tools in close reach. For such a small price tag, definitely worth it.
B000WEMG24 I got this for a barrel (UDS) smoker.  Fits great is very handy for brushes, tongs, and other BBQ tools,
B000WEMG24 Not much to say.  It's made specifically for the Weber grill.  It fits fine, and functions fine.  There is no reason to buy a more expensive version. Make sure you take it off before you put your cover back on though.  I can see the cover tearing if you forget.The item functions best if your tools have a string or piece of rawhide to hang them up.  My tongs had lost the rawhide long ago.  They wouldn't hang well, so I just tied a small length of string where the rawhide used to be.  Problem solved.
B000WEMG24 This was an add on for an order and I am happy with the purchase.  Hubby kept dropping the tools and it was a struggle to keep up with washing them constantly while he grilled. rather than spend tons more on more tools, I got this and now he has a place for them so they do not slide, drop or get lost while he is cooking.
B000WEMG24 Convenient...handy....fits good on the Weber Round Grill.  You just have to make sure that all of the utensils you wish to hang on it have a hole in them the right size and not too small.  The tongs I bought didn't fit so I'll have to either improvise or look for other tongs that do fit!
B000WEMG24 The holder mounted perfectly on my weber grill.  Now I don't have to get my table messy with sauce from the brush.  It is also great for  storing my cooking tools and grill brush when I'm not grilling.
B000WEMG24 Since Weber seems to abhor putting anything more than the two side handles on the kettle, this appeared to be a handy addition for hanger tongs, etc. while cooking. Works well enough, but if you have the lid off and try to remove a tool, certain ones can catch on the hook and easily pull the whole thing off and either into your food or onto the ground. Perhaps I will put a squeeze on the hanger tabs and make them fit tighter.
B000WEMG24 If you grill outside you'll need one of these.
B000WEMG24 Not only is it easy to hang on the side of the Weber to hold all required tools, it allows air to feed the fire just enough to allow the top vent to be closed completely. Closing the top vent keeps the majority of the heat in, giving a good roasting action on chicken and turkey. It's a must have for any Weber grill!
B000WEMG4W I bought these to replace a similar set that was many years old and was failing.  The failure was with the welding between the pieces, not the pieces themselves, so Weber could probably do a better job if they wanted.  Anyway, they are long lasting and rust free, so well worth what they cost amortized over their life :)
B000WEMG4W This is my third set of grates for my Weber. The porcelain grates seem to start to fall apart after about four or five years. Went with stainless hoping they will last longer. Loved the bright finish, but after grilling two times, they are changing to black.
B000WEMG4W My original, porcelain-coated grates had chipped and were starting to rust.  Since the rest of the grill is still in great shape (after changing the flavor bars to stainless steel too), I decided to try these stainless steel grates.  I was concerned at first because they were so much lighter and thinner than the iron ones.  But they seem to work fine.  I still get a good sear when the grates are hot and the meats don't seem to stick to these grates any more than they did to the originals.  So I'm happy with the purchase, and I think these grates will last a long time.
B000WEMG4W 98% fit with my Weber Genesis Silver.  It's a shade more narrow than the original piece, but not wide enough to have food drop through.  It's a bit different than the stock cooking grates.  Far lighter and more like tubes than grates.  In combination, with the replacement burners, the grill as a whole gets as hot as I originally got it, but I have noticed that the hot spots are relatively even hotter.
B000WEMG4W I wish they put these in the grill as part of the original equipment. The original grill had rusted just about through and was falling apart in big chunks.These grates won't rust and are much easier to clean. They will discolor with age but not a big deal.
B000WEMGM4 I am really enjoying using my Char-Basket Briquet Holders in my Weber Kettle. It is great to be able to have focused direct heat in one section of the grill and indirect heat in another. The holders are heavy and sturdy.On Memorial Day, I was cooking burgers and dogs. One of my guests likes her burgers medium rare, so I was able to put hers on the indirect side while I continued to cook the others to medium well or well over direct heat. Since the hot dogs grilled much quicker, I could also move them over to indirect heat so they could continue to cook inside but not burn outside.The only downside to the holders for me is that I didn't see the one line in the product description that said they were for use with the Weber 22 1/2\" grill. I have an 18 1/2\" Weber so using them both gives me a very narrow field of indirect heat. However, when I am just grilling one steak for myself, I could just use ONE of the holders and have the rest of the grill cooler for veggies, etc.It is likely that I will upgrade to a Weber 22 1/2\" grill at some point since my 18 1/2\" is starting to show signs of wear. Then I'll be able to use both holders as intended. Despite them not being intended for my smaller Weber, I still find them to be useful. Because there are 2 holders, you can customize their configuration to work for you despite grill size.4.5 stars
B000WEMGM4 Love these baskets. They make moving the coals around much quicker and easier. Cleanup is extra snappy. The baskets are made of a decently heavy gauge sheet metal and look like they are built to last a long time. When you first handle them be careful a some o fthe edging is sharp and may cut a finger or two.
B000WEMGM4 Perfect for indirect or direct grilling.  You cannot go wrong with the purchase and works like a charm.  Weber makes some really good stuff!
B000WEMGM4 These are awesome for indie t or direct cooking. Easy to move around with grill tools.  These get plenty of air and clen up easy.
B000WEMGM4 These charcoal baskets are a must if you want to do indirect cooking.  They fit the Weber kettle grill perfectly and keep the charcoal in place.
B000WEMGM4 (Third set over about three decades!)With only two of us to cook for most of the time, a pile of charcoal is not only overkill, but like burning money.  With these, I can put seven to nine (not Seven-of-Nine) briquettes in each one, depending upon how much is left of the previous cook, and I can grill a couple of steaks, five or six burgers, eight Nathan's hotdogs, or two huge chicken breasts with ease.  I can move them toward the edges and add more charcoal for indirect cooking, or dump them out when cooking for a crowd.
B000WEMGM4 This will help anyone who wants to indirect grill on their weber become a master of their grill space.  Suggested that you get the hinged grate as well for easy access during a long, slow cook.
B000WEMGM4 I like using these for indirect heating on 1 side or split. The only issue I have is they don't hold a &#34;full&#34; load of charcoal; at least in the quantity I typically use which is 1 chimney full.
B000WEMGM4 I'm pleased with the Weber charcoal baskets.  I've had them for a month or two and used them 4 or 5 times.  They work great for cooking chicken with indirect heat, and they work pretty well for creating a sear zone for direct heat.  They also allow me to use less charcoal when I'm just grilling for two, which is often the case. I recently made a custom charcoal basket using expanded metal in an effort to get a really good sear zone, but the Weber baskets work better.  In hindsight, it looks like my homemade expanded metal basket was a waste of time and money.
B000WEMGM4 These baskets make indirect-heat grilling very easy.  They fit perfectly on either side of the Weber kettle with a drip tray in the middle, making perfect grilling of longer cooking foods, such as roasts and large pieces of meat, nearly foolproof.  These and my Weber chimney starter are the grill accessories I use most often.
B000WEMGM4 Bought these for my boyfriend who is an avid griller/smoker. They worked great on his weber kettle grill! A+! Would recommend!
B000WEMGM4 We used these Charcoal Holders in our new Weber grill and they worked great!! We followed the indirect cooking method, and these holders keep the coals neat and separated to allow for the water pan to be placed in the middle without any problem. The holders are highly recommended for anyone using the indirect cooking method, or if you just want to keep the coals on one side of the grill without much effort. Thanks!!
B000WEMGM4 I'm very satisfied with this product.  The holders allow me to easily place the coals where I want them and actually use less charcoal than I used to use.  We purchased the Weber Rotisserie at the same time and find the briquettes holders an excellent compliment.  I would not hesitate to purchase either item again!  Together, they produce an excellent meal.
B000WEMGM4 I originally purchased this to grill indirectly but now I use it for all grilling.  It allows me to easily control placement of the charcoals.  They still haven't rusted after years of use.
B000WEMGM4 These are some of the simplest yet most useful Weber accessories I own! They make everything easier, from lighting your charcoal to controlling how the heat in your grill is applied to your food for cooking.I have a Weber kettle grill (charcoal) with a gas ignition system, and all I have to do is place the desired amount of charcoal in each basket (or in one if that's all I'm using that day), position the baskets over the gas igniter outlet in the center of the grill, and wait a few minutes (about 5). By then the coals are pretty well lit and I can kill the gas, and in a few minutes more, they're ashy and ready to use. Then it's just a matter of repositioning them where I want them for cooking, whether in the center for direct heat or on the sides for indirect heat, and well I wish it were more complicated because I like making people read long reviews, but that's it lol. It's that simple!If you cook over charcoal, you'll love these, in fact you'll probably conclude that they're worth twice as much for the convenience they bring to the cooking process. I hope some of you find my review helpful in making a more informed decision as you consider your buying options! Peace :-)
B000WEMGM4 The perfect answer for indirect cooking, no more coals rolling wherever they want. Use in conjunction with the hinged grill. This certainly make more sense than having to remove the entire grill. Coal baskets are large enough to hold plenty of coals and are vented to keep them hot while cooking.
B000WEMGM4 These are pretty straightforward - today I used them to indirect grill some baby-back ribs and had excellent results! I really noticed the difference when I used the hickory wood chunks; they smoked much longer than they ever did when I would just use a modified garden hoe to rake the coals into two piles. This in concert with the hinged grill grate are excellent, practical accessories for your Weber kettle.
B000WEMGM4 We use these baskets frequently for direct and indirect grilling in our 22.5 kettles. About halv of a Weber chimney fit in the two baskets. They can be moved around on the charcolal grate depending on there heat is needed. After many uses they do not look nice by will last long time. After three years still no rust on them.This is a must!
B000WEMGM4 I have a Weber kettle grill and when I dump a batch of coals in they spread out all over. With these I can contain the coals to heat a specific area - nice for a couple of steaks, or a couple of slabs of salmon, or a couple of burgers. And still there's enough residual heat to warm a pot of beans or grill some veggies. Nice accessory.
B000WEMGM4 Probably not better than a pair of bricks.These don't hold very much charcoal, and when full, the charcoal sits just under the cooking grates. If you want to sear before or after you indirect cook, then you have to really be there to watch it as the coals are so very close.A pair of bricks will section off the charcoal better, giving you more room (and you can adjust the spacing from the wall) to drop coals, without them piling up so high.
B000WEMGM4 Though I really didn't need this to create indirect heating, organizing the fire is pretty easy.  I like being able to shake the ashes (cold, of course) into my ash can.  The design makes it easy to dump the contents (partial to completely full) of the chimney starter into the baskets.  Two things to improve the product:1. Make one SLIGHTLY smaller so they nest in each other better2. Not have sharp edges.
B000WEMGM4 I've owned a Weber One Touch Gold for almost 8 years. I finally decided to take the plunge and buy this product.  One of the advantages of this product is it keeps the coals isolated in one location. No need to worry about adding more briquettes and watching them roll off the hot coals down to the middle of the grill where they are wasted.  It also is the perfect tool for indirect cooking.  If you want to make ribs, just use one of these and throw your ribs on the other side of the grill. It definitely makes grill cleanup easier. The vast majority of the ash gets preserved in these things, thereby minimizing the wear and tear on the grill, enhancing it's lifetime. I would highly recommended this to anyone
B000WEMGM4 These are a must when indirect grilling.  I grill chicken at least once a week and these are perfect for keeping the coals on the sides.
B000WEMGM4 Will do what they were  designed to do but they are a little large for the Weber 18.5&#34; grill.
B000WEMGM4 These do do a good job for indirect cooking.  As at least one other reviewer mentioned, push them together and you get a really good sear too.  For thick steaks, I'll put these side by side and sear the steak on both sides.  Then I put the holders on opposite sides of the kettle and finish the steaks indirect.  That works very well.  The baskets are decent quality.  They look like they will last for a good while.  I think these are a very good purchase for Weber users.
B000WEMGM4 I have the smokenator for really slow indirect cooking with little coal.  Incredible ribs and pork shoulder. When not using the smokenator and just a few of us, I put the basket on the other side.  It is easier to stack up coal on the side for medium and high grilling surface and smaller lump coal will not fall to the bottom as easily. This is a great product.  If I do not have the smokenator, will use it for indirect grilling also.  This is a great product.
B000WEMGM4 They hold charcoal.  They are easily moveable. Will not rust. But I have had as much luck just piling up the charcoal where I want it.
B000WEMGM4 I have been grilling with a Weber Kettle for a long time and my standard procedure was to dump the charcoal out of the starter chimney into a pile on one side and cook on the other side of the grill - - - and that worked pretty well.I have been using these briquet holders for just over a month now and they work VERY well for indirect grilling.  Placing the briquet holders together in the center of the grill is the easiest way to fill them from the starter chimney and leaving them there allows hamburgers to be cooked around the perimeter of the grill - or after filling, the briquet holders can be moved to the sides of the grill and the center of the grill can be used for chops, brats, hotdogs, pork steaks etc. and a pan with sauce can be placed in the center to season the meat with out burning.Bottom Line - These are well made, reasonably priced, and work very well for indirect grilling. I would recommend them to a friend.
B000WEMH3C This grill cover is not very durable...I've had mine just a few weeks and it already has a tear in it.  I would suggest buying either the Weber Premium cover or the Veranda Grill cover as I did.  This grill cover wasn't very expensive....I guess lesson learned is that you get what you pay for!!
B000WEMH3C I bought this cover to replace a good cover that lasted for years.  I got this one because it was cheap.  It's very thin vinyl.  I don't think it will last very long.  When this wears out it will be time to get a new grill
B000WEMH3C I love my Weber Silver, and wanted to keep her looking like a champ. She sits outside year-round in the cold Nebraska winters, so I wanted so protection. I bought this cover at a local box store and it didn't even last through the first winter before cracking and tearing to pieces. Go with the Premium - its supposed to be much more durable. That's what I'm buying after I finish this review! Good luck!
B000WEMH3C I have owned this cover for about two years and it is still going strong.  It is holding up well for a 'budget' cover.  I purchased a couple of no name brands in the same price range for other items and they have long since become unusable.
B000WEMH3C Its a little flimsy and prone to break after a little weathering. It does what I intended it to do so I'm happy with it.
B000WEMHGO Got a new Weber Genesis grill and bought this to go with it.  Tried it with a big pork loin basted in beer, it turned out perfect. I like the way it will lock the meat onto the rod plus the handle is ideally shaped.  Highly recommend.
B000WEMHGO It just arrived and took all of 30 seconds to install on my grill.I cooked my first chicken on it this evening and it was incredibly juicy and tender (I did brine it for about 8 hours) even the breast was juicy which normally ends up being dry with other cooking methods.The motor seems to have good torque, the spit turned very smoothly without jerking or jittering as I have seen with cheap rotisseries.I enjoy grilling but not necessarily when chicken is involved - steaks and chops cook fairly quickly but chicken needs slower cooking and you need to keep an eye on it - with the rotisserie I can get it going and more or less forget about for most of the cooking time.Glad I bought it.
B000WEMHGO Would be nice to have gotten it with more than 2 forks for the ridiculous price but the unit appears to be well built and works great so far in my first experience with a 6 lb chicken.  Wish it had a wooden handle like all of my previous rotisserie rods.
B000WEMHGO I purchased this product this summer with a Weber grill I also bought from Amazon.  After about 4 - 5 uses, one  of the forks on the rotisserie broke.  Apparently the weld on the fork came apart.  After sending the serial number of the grill and time of purchase, Weber sent me two new forks.They were very responsive with their customer service and I am very happy with their support.  I am definitely a Weber fan now.
B000WEMHGO The Weber Rotisserie is very well made, like all the Weber products. I bought it to mate with the Weber Genisis Grill and am very satisfied. Great price and combining to get the free Super Saver shipping is the way to go.
B000WEMHGO Sorry, but this did not rotate smoothly. It squeeked and chunked around at an uneven rate and just did not work on my relatively new Weber Genesis NG model. I called Weber and they said that each year the models change slightly, perhaps just a few centimeters which may prevent attachments from fitting correctly. The lady's final bit of information: &#34;Things aren't always perfect in the manufacturing process&#34;.  Many people have called attention to that ring &#34;handle&#34; at the end of the rotisserie. I too found it to be a terrible design flaw.You can't grab ahold of it to remove the rotisserie, it's very awkward, and very hot. Sadly, I had to this item.
B000WEMHGO Fits a Weber 320 perfectly.  Excellent motor, that doesn't \"jump\" through part of it's revolution if the meat is slightly off-center.  Well worth the money!
B000WEMHGO I got this rotisserie for chicken, which it excels at, but the design makes it less than ideal for other meats.  For chicken the spit and and forks work well, as the center of the bird is hollow and having metal forks pierce the meat has little consequence.  Larger birds won't fit due to the size of the grill and placement of the rotisserie.  As it is, you will need to remove the grates (or stack them on one side if only cooking one bird) to allow for rotation of chicken, but the flavorizer bars can remain.  Other types of meat may fit, but having a spit and forks pierce a roast will heat the meat nearest these metal pieces (due to conduction).  I'd imagine this isn't as much of a deal for pork, but I wouldn't want the center of a prime rib to be medium well due to the spit.  I'd suggest an E-Z Que for that.Back to the chicken.  As others have said be sure to truss or tie down wings and legs,as they will get well done due to their proximity to the flame.  This will also create more clearance between the chicken and the flavorizer bars.  In general cooking times are comparable to other means, but unlike \"beer can chicken\" withWeber 16128 Poultry Roaster, the chicken will cook from the outside in (due to steam on the inside with beer can chicken).  This along with better retention of juices (not many drip down) makes the rotisserie my favorite of the two.  The cord is woefully short, but the motor seems very solid, and it's not that noisy.  The spit seems to allow for a bit of balancing of weight, and it's relatively easy to clean.
B000WEMHN2 After years of use, the original burners for my Weber grill rusted out.  These replacement burners were OEM burner and work great.  Installation was quick and easy.  These should provide my grill with 10 more years of use.
B000WEMHN2 As noted in my ignitor review I am rebuilding an old Weber grill, this is just one of many replacement parts being used :)
B000WEMHN2 I decided to clean my 12 year old Weber about two weeks ago. When I took out the flavor bars, I found a set of rusted burners. The little bar that connects the three burners was rusted and broken. It was the original burners. I knew I needed new ones but was afraid with my limited mechanical skills I would not be able to accomplish an installation. I read some of the reviews on this site and was encouraged by others to give it a go. Ordered it using my Prime membership and got it in two days. I really love that service. I followed the easy to read instructions and using nothing but a wrench and a Philips screwdriver installed the burners in less than 30 minutes. Turned the grill back on and amazingly it worked. Yippee. I love Weber. I spent a total of about $150 getting everything but the flavor bars( replaced those about 4 years ago and basically have a new grill. I used to buy the $150 specials at Lowes or wherever and usually had to buy  a new grill every two years or so. With the new parts this grille is good for another 5-10 years. Wonderful.
B000WEMHN2 Inexpensive toy that is fun to play with; the magnets seems well made; not sure what else I can say
B000WEMHN2 This was easier to replace then I imagined.  I removed the old one , cleaned the entire BBQ and then installed the new one. No adjustments or worries at all.
B000WEMHN2 Was looking to replace the parts of my Weber Genesis Silver.  This part was the most complicated to replace of all the parts because you had to take parts of the grill apart.  First I would say is take your time and really read the manual.  It's not really intuitive until after you remove the coverings.  However, it 
B000WEMHN2 With this minor investment I was able to turn my well used grill into a brand new one!  The old one would clog up, so I had to clean every few months.  This new tube set was easy to install and has given the old grill new life!!  That and a new electronic ignition.
B000WEMHN2 I have a 2001 Weber Genesis Silver B, and last year it started being reluctant to heat quickly and all the way to 600.  Last week the grill never got hotter than about 400, so I knew something was wrong.  I took the grill apart and looked at the flame, and it was fairly yellow.  Also, the bar that connects the three main burners wasn't working to transfer the flame from one bar to another.I bought this set from Amazon and installed it today.  You have to take the grill apart, including taking the control panel off, the manifold off, disconnect the gas, take the flavor bars and grates out, etc.  After I had everything uninstalled I elected to drag mine out in the yard and pressure wash it.  After it dried I installed the new burners, new flavor bars, new grates, etc.  I went all stainless this time.  The flame coming out of the new burners is blue, and is very hot.  I also put a new starter in, and the grill starts so nice and easy and the bar that connects the three burners transfered the flame from one burner to another.  It reminded me of when I first bought it.  The grill heated up to 500 in about 5 minutes...a night and day difference from before.You might think I'm crazy for investing $160 in grill parts, after all some grills only cost $160 for the entire grill.  I know that my Silver B is good for another 5 years at least, and I LOVE this grill.  Who knows when they'll stop making parts for these grills?Anyway, my advice to you is if you have a Weber gas grill that is more than 6 years old and you haven't replaced the burners yet, and you are experiencing any of the symptoms I described, don't hesitate to put in new burners.  It's relatively easy, and it makes a huge difference.
B000WEMHN2 I asked my husband to install this, but he looked at the 2 sets of instructions that were in the box and said it was very complicated and he would have to do it later. I waited until he scurried off to the golf course, used the shorter instructions (which were very clear), and installed it in 12 minutes with just a screwdriver to loosen the old tubes. I had already replaced the flavorizer bars, so now the grill runs almost like new and is cooking evenly again.  I am very happy with this.
B000WEOOSS Used this on my grill after a bunch of BBQs and it really works well.  Like that it is stainless steel.  Can't beat that price either.
B000WEOOSS I bought this knowing that when you buy Weber, your buying the very best.  You will buy three lesser quality brushes trying to save money.  Buy it and forget it.
B000WEOOSS Takes care of the burnt on BBQ sauce but does not destroy the grates like the other brush I had. Really gets things clean, especially when the grill is hot. Good handle as well. Seems it will last me quite a while and at a good price.
B000WEOOSS It is exactly what you expect a wire grill brush to be. It is sturdy with just a little flex and does a great job scraping the grill. One note is that with this shorter model over a hot grill you may find you need gloves to protect yourself from burns.
B000WEOOSS This is an extremely effective and well made grill brush. I highly recommend it.
B000WEOOSS This brush gets the job done. It is very strong and is easy to use. The bristles are secure in the head of the brush, they do not fall out like the cheepie brushes. The nice leather hanger is perfect for hanging on the side of the grill. This is a must have for all grillers.
B000WEOOUG I bought this BBQ mitt because it was reasonably priced and made by Weber. Being a Weber fanatic, I had high hopes. But after trying to use it for the first time last night, I'm pretty disappointed. The mitt is very thick and heavy, which is great for protecting your hand from the heat. But it's so thick and heavy that gripping things with it is tough. Holding onto a wide-handled spatula was doable, although not super easy. But holding onto and trying to manipulate BBQ tongs was pretty much impossible. After much frustration, I finally took the mitt off and used the tongs barehanded. I'll probably use this mitt on occasion, but it won't be anywhere near the number of times I had expected to use it. Kind of disappointed with this one, Weber.
B000WEOOUG I bought this to protect my hands but the long fit protects my arms also.  This glove really comes in handy when grilling corn which requires many turns by hand.
B000WEOOUG I must confess that this mitt is somewhat stiff but when you learned to use it uding the first usage you will never be without it. I use the mitts for my charcoal and gas Weber grills as well as with my Dutch Ovens. They always have well protected my hands and lower arms from burning.The material is comfortable on the skin and I like very much using them. Good value for money.
B000WEOOUG The Weber Barbecue Mitt is very well made, like all the Weber products. I bought a pair and am very satisfied. Great price and combining to get the free Super Saver shipping is the way to go.
B000WEOOUG I was a little hesitant to use this since I have not had good luck with other mitts. This one does just what it says. Very safe to use and fits my hand perfectly. Good and smart buy.
B000WEOOUG Worth the money, very nice mitt for dealing with hot stuff. I need to order another one. a little long but nice mitt.
B000WEOOUG I got tired of dropping food when my old mitt let too much heat through. This works great. I wear XL gloves and this fits just fine and does a good job protecting my hand.
B000WEOOUG Do not buy.  The thumb is offset at a angle that makes gripping impossible. I boought some welding gloves instead.
B000WEOOUG Got to keep from burning the hair on my hand and arms while raising the lid on my green egg. I love how high up the arm it comes to protect the almost to my elbow. It's made of good quality materials and does a great job shielding your flesh from the high heat.
B000WEOOUG The Weber grill is great and we bought almost every accessory. The mitt works spectacularly. Does the job well would buy again.
B000WEOOUG Can't go wrong with this mit.  I use it to move my BBQ starter chimney when the coals are ready to dump in grill.  Fit is good and certainly keeps you safe.
B000WEOQK4 If you are as attached to outdoor cooking onWeber kettle grillsas I am, you'll know that over time the peripheral parts will show their age: handle covers (less so now that they've changed from wood to plastic), cooking grates, charcoal grates and the one-touch cleaning system eventually succumb to heat and weather.This is not a fault with these parts, just a testament to the long service life of the kettle and cover. The two kettles in my back yard are 15 and 10 years old. They are not pampered: they spend winters outdoors in the mid-Atlantic elements.This is a replacement one touch cleaner for the 10-year old one. It fit perfectly, was reasonably priced, and will keep the grill moving towards its second decade of service.We should age --and be refurbished-- so gracefully!
B000WEOQK4 Glad to find this product replacement, my old one rusted away a year ago and I thought there was no way I could replace it.  But I found it at Amazon by accident and bought it and it fit perfectly and couldn't be easier to install! Good price too, especially with the free shipment!
B000WEOQK4 Nothing like using manufacturers replacement parts for their own products. They always fit and work as they are designed to.
B000WEOQK4 Found an old Weber 22.5\" kettle grill that someone was tossing out and decided to take it home to see if she could be brought back to life.  This one had been abused and seen lots of work.  Aside from some cosmetic issues, she was missing the hook on the inside of the lid and the sweeper cleaner was just a rusty mess. The former owner had cut or twisted off the sweeper blades since the unit was frozen with rust.I bought this replacement sweeper knowing I'd fix it and waited for it to arrive before trying to remove the old one.  And, I'm glad I did.  I noted how this assembly goes together fitting into the Weber.  Very simple design using gravity and the sweeper handle at the bottom to hold the entire mechanism in place -  a thumbscrew holds the sweeper handle in place.  Remove the thumbscrew, pull out the sweeper handle and... voila!  The mechanism \"should\" just pop out!Did I mention that this old sweeper was a ball of rust?  Seriously.  It was so rusty that the thumbscrew was almost indistinguishable.I put the kettle upside down on a workbench and gave the mechanism an overnight soak of penetrating oil before working on it.  Just for yucks, I put a vise grip on the thumbscrew which of course promptly broke off.  I then used a hack saw to cut off the sweeper handle flush with the hexagonal \"bolt\" that extends out from the bottom of the grill.  Once the handle was cut away I used a hammer to easily tap the remaining fused mass of rust out of the grill.  This may sound a bit confusing, but really it isn't - reviewing how this thing goes together gave me an insight how to get the old one off.I also \"replaced\" the hook on the inside of the lid and bought a cover for the old gal.  The grill works great and it was fun to keep this from needlessly going to the landfill.My wife and I like to entertain and having a second kettle will be great to have when we need it.
B000WEOQK4 Extended the life of my Webers.  After 10 years had to replace the cleaning systems on both my 22\" grills.  Had to cut off old ones using a dremel and a hammer.  Installing the new ones took less than five minutes.
B000WEOQV8 I bbq at least once a week and i use my chimney starter every time.  This is a very well built product, alot thicker gauge metal than most other chimney starters have.  I wouldnt say that this chimney starter works ANY better then any other chimney starter would.. but ill bet that it will last a heck of a lot longer...I have yet to be disappointed by a product weber makes.
B000WEOQV8 I have seen my family start charcoal with lighter fluid as a kid growing up.  Now that I am an adult i remember the meat tasting funny, like it had a hint of lighter fluid.  I read on improving my grill and smoking skills.  I read the benefits of using a Chimney Starter.  Now when I use the chimney starter, my meat that gets cooked in smoker or grill does not taste any lighter fluid no more.  I now mesquite, applewood, cherry wood in my meats now.  Great improvement.
B000WEOQV8 Good lord, can this thing pack a punch, I used it outside to light a few branches and almost started the local forest on fire. How it works is easy, inside there is a cathrobe ray tube, when heated turns into phosphorus fibers and are propelled (with the touch of a button), to come out and into the vent shafts which you aim at a fire log or something you want to ignite. Be careful to not point it at small children or pets because they can light up like a Christmas tree.

B000WEOQV8 WORKS VERY WELL AND HOLDS PLENTY OF CHARCOAL. HAVE USED IT SEVERAL TIMES, THE CHARCOAL HAS FIRED UP FIRST TIME EVERY TIME. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT FOR THE BARBEQUER!!!
B000WEOQV8 this is a great buy , but beware it puts out a lot of smoke will set of smoke alarms for sure if close to your place .. not recommended for first timers please beware also it takes a little luck to get it going but it will burn like they say PERFECT 9/7/13
B000WEOQV8 First the obvious... this thing is magical in how it gets coals to light.  The description and majority of other comments are dead on; two pieces of newspaper in the bottom, coals in the top, set it down on your grill grate, light the paper (one match), and in 10 to 15 minutes the coals are blazing red hot!Implied is that you don't have to bother with charcoal lighter fluid or self-lighting coals.  That stuff smells bad and can't do anything to make barbecuing any healthier.  Similarly, having a flammable liquid near your grill can't make things safer.  :)One additional benefit (not that you need more reasons to get one of these) is that it allows you to use a consistent amount of coals each time.  That means consistent heat and consistent results.  Sure, you can \"eyeball it\" but with this you don't have to bother.I just wish I had got this sooner.  The saving in lighter fluid alone would have paid for the chimney and I could have avoided the petroleum smell.
B000WEOQV8 This thing works exactly as advertised and deserves all the positive reviews it got. I don't know how I lived without this for so long. This starter is simply fantastic and I was pleased from the very first time I used it to start a BBQ.No more lighter fluid, fanning, piling coals into a pyramid, and other nonsense. Just ball up some newspaper and stuff it in the bottom, light, and come back 10 mins later. Your coals will be glowing red.Very nice construction quality and durable build. And not a bad price too. It'll save you money on buying lighter fluid, or quick light charcoals. I prefer natural wood charcoal, so I don't have to add any unnecessary chemicals to my BBQ. This starter is perfect for grillers who don't want to use lighter fluid and stay all natural. Highly recommended.
B000WEOQV8 Saves so much time and helps me start my grill quickly. Very easy to use.
B000WEOQV8 This chimney works perfectly....lights your briquets in a very short time and you just use some newspaper and a match or lighter....that's all you need.  Be sure to wear an oven mitt when it's time to empty them into your charcoal grill because the chimney is very HOT!  A great buy at the price.  I was so pleased I ordered another for my son-in-law who is quite the grillmaster!! He was very pleased.
B000WEOQV8 This is a must have for any one who grills or smokes with charcoal.  Ball up some newspaper and shove in the bottom, fill with coals, light and let sit for 10 minutes or so, your coals will be perfect.  I have had 2 of these for years and they work great.
B000WEOQV8 This product is made to last a long time - - very good quality materials.
B000WEOQV8 Bought this for hubby, along with a new smoker for his birthday.  We were both surprised at the quality and size of this thing.  It is so much better than his old one, it got tossed.  He loves its, works perfect with the smoker.
B000WEOQV8 I think the side holes on the Weber chimney make a huge difference, combine those with the starter cubes and this thing is fantastic, used it with my lump charcoal, and was ready to go in no time.
B000WEOQV8 I really enjoy using this product. No aftertaste of lighter fluid at all. Very easy process to use and I also like that it catches the coals as quick as anything!
B000WEOQV8 This so much better then lighter fluid!  Even if you don't use fluid this item makes it much easier then piling coals high in a pyramid and coaxing it with pieces of paper to light.I used to put newspaper in the bottom, sprayed with pam, and light the coals this way.  It does work well but as the paper burns embers float away and leave a black smudge wherever they land.  I have since begun to use the lighter cubes and these are so much nicer.  No mess to clean up.It takes about 20-30 minutes for all the coals to light.  When flames are visible on the top your ready to go.The extra handle really helps when you have a full chimney.Be sure and use gloves when using this because embers to fly about for brief moment when you dump the coals into the grill.
B000WEOQV8 Like practically every other reviewer on the Weber Chimney Starter, I think it is a wonderful accessory for charcoal grilling. I agree that this method of starting charcoal is superior to lighter fluids, etc. My review will focus on comparing the Weber chimney to the others I've seen/used.I've used my Weber chimney for about 4 years without a problem. However, I have used a cheaper chimney or 2 when helping with a big cookout. I think the Weber is worth the extra money for several reasons.First of all, the Weber is made of a heavier gauge metal and is clearly a higher quality product. Most of the time my chimney sits outside, sometimes through the winter. No rust. Except for a ding or 2, it is in as good a condition as the first time I used it. However, it will not stay bright and shiney.Second, I like the heat shield. I rarely use gloves when using the chimney. The handle gets hot, but not so bad that I need a glove to dump the charcoal into the kettle. However, gloves are a good safety tool. You won't need anything special like welder's gloves. Regular leather work gloves should serve you just fine.Third, the \"wire handle\" is what truly puts the Weber above the cheaper models. It doesn't heat up and gives me lots of control when dumping the hot coals. Unlike the other chimneys, you can comfortably use both hands. As soon as the coals are dumped, I let go of the plastic handle and carry the chimney to a portion of my yard that is fenced off. No problems.I recommend this chimney over the cheaper models. In the long run you will be money ahead because it will last longer. Additionally, the features I mentioned make this easier and more enjoyable to use.Any chimney will get hot and needs to be handled with care. It is possible the Weber stays hotter longer because the metal is a heavier gauge. I put mine on a concrete slab in an old dog pen so that it doesn't get accidentally touched and can't burn anything. Just have a plan as to where you are putting the hot chimney and you should be fine.
B000WEOQV8 This is a great product but Weber if you read any of these reviews something like this needs to be constructed of stainless steel for longer life, not aluminized metal.eventually the heat will flake the coating off and let the rust commence. In the mean time I will enjoy this product until that happens. P.S. there are stainless starters out there but the handles aren't built well and renders them dangerous.
B000WEOQV8 Yes it only takes 2 pieces of newspaper to start your coals. No lighter fluids/paraffin cubes needed with this piece of grilling gear.
B000WEOQV8 Talk about being charmed at first blush, or rather first flame, this Weber starter was such a revelation.  Another reviewer said emphatically that the wire cone charcoal placement is the heart of the starter, well Amen.  I found out the hard way, using other starters that were only modestly cheaper, which all utilized a flat internal grate with large holes to allow passage of the flame.  I purchased a Weber 7416 because I wanted additional capacity (about 20% larger than house brand starters) and was stunned at the Ease And Speed of the Weber.  Using about half the newspaper that I was I normally had to use to start a full cannister, curled into a ring, this Weber was singing in moments without nearly the smokescreen that accompanied my Home D. knockoff.  I attribute the superb performance to the smart design of the cannister and the cone internal grate that fosters more efficient air movement augmenting the chimney effect.  Many kudos to this superbly designed item.
B000WEOQV8 This thing is just flat out cool! I have a Weber charcoal grill with a propane ignition system, and this chimney starter works great with it, but you can actually light it with just a couple sheets of newspaper placed under it too!At first, it seems like very little is happening aside from a lot of smoke coming out of the top of the chimney. Within a few minutes though, even the top coals start showing tiny specks of white ash, and 25-30 minutes from initially lighting it, your coals are ready to use!The unit is well built (Weber really is hanging in there with product quality), and I can't find any major problems at all with the design. One minor change I'd make is to make the side ventilation holes slightly larger to increase air flow inward and upward from the sides once it gets going, but I don't think performance would be more than marginally improved by doing so, and I certainly don't think air flow is insufficient as it is out of the box.Both handles stay surprisingly cool, but do wear a glove or mitt when using it anyway, as the top unprotected steel wire handle does get a little warmer than most people will be comfortable with on bare skin. No such problem with the main (bottom) handle.The bottom of the unit is made of heavy steel wire, which allows for much faster ignition than similar items with a bottom made of sheet metal with slots cut into it, and the well thought out design makes pouring your lit charcoals precisely where you want them a breeze.I bought this just to see if I'd been missing anything all these years, and I've concluded that I have indeed, just for the amount of hassle and messiness handling charcoals has involved. I wish I'd have bought one of these years ago, this is a much easier and cleaner way to get that grill sizzling!I hope some of you find my review helpful in making a more informed buying decision. Peace and happy grilling :-)
B000WEOQV8 This is a simple, great invention.  The coals burn hotter, faster than with lighter fluid.  I use two pieces of old news paper and they will light charcoal in 15 - 20 minutes.  If you use charcoal, give your neighbors your old lighter fluid and buy one of these.
B000WEOQV8 This Weber chimney starter was the first one I ever saw or used as my dad used lighter fluid on the coals growing up. This starter worked extremely well each time thus far. Add newspaper to the bottom, fill it up with charcoal, light the paper and place on the grill till they turn grayish-white. The item is sturdy and strong. Two issues: 1) as dumping the charcoals into the grill the handle area is extremely hot and if not done quickly you may require oven mitts while handling, and 2) the u-bar around the handle doesn't seem to provide any additional support when handling a full starter; I'm not sure if this is to help hold on to the unit if wearing oven mitts or what, but it doesn't seem to support holding the unit.
B000WEOQV8 I don't know how I ever got along without this. Nice evenly heated coals without dousing them in chemicals.  Just use some loosely wadded newspaper lightly doused in vegetable oil underneath to get the coals going.
B000WEOQV8 By far, the best way to start a charcoal fire. I can tell when others use treated charcoal or lighter fluid to start their charcoal. No need for that with this item.
B000WEOQV8 I'm a big food Network fan and my favorite guy is Alton. What I saw on one of his shows was the most awesome advice for this device. Take ONE, that's right, ONE piece of newspaper and sprinkle a few drops of vegetable oil on it; then put it under your chimney starter (outdoors, please, eggman if you're reading this) and fire it up with a full can of any kind of charcoal. You won't believe how well this works. One more thing; DO NOT set a chimney starter on a gravel driveway when you start it. For some reason, the heat transfers much easier through gravel than concrete. Just put the thing on your grill grate and wait for 20 minutes. You'll have smokin' hot coals that will be almost too hot for smokin' food. I even saw Alton searing tuna on top of one of these things.Follow up:  Use two pieces of newspaper that you ball up and light.  Works great!
B000WEOQV8 there's no reason to use lighter fluid at all. take your week's worth of junk mail, tuck it in the bottom of this, set it of fire. Presto, lit charcoals and junk mail obliterated.
B000WEOQV8 I just tried this for the first time.  I'd always used lighter fluid before.  This actually got the charcoal started *faster* than lighter fluid and you don't have to wait for that light fluid &#34;chemical&#34; smell to go away before you can start cooking.  Also lit the charcoal much more thoroughly and evenly.  Very impressed with the results.
B000WEOQV8 Webers Charcoal Starter has to be the creme de la creme of charcoal starters. They are of a very sturdy build with safe and well made handles! This one won't fall apart on you while handling hot coals! Had one of the el cheapo's and the wood handle came out of the metal straps holding it in place. Spilled coals all over the ground and lucky I did not get burns on my legs. If you got a cheapy....throw it away for safety sake!The funnel/cylindrical shaped coal grate allows for very fast start up of charcoal and as some others have stated, put a couple of drops of vegtable oil towards the top on crumpled newspaper! Helps make for a hotter and a tad longer burn to get coals going! Neat Trick!!!!
B000WEOQV8 Grilling season is here and trust me when I say this...buy this item. You will no longer need lighter fluid to get the grill going.Simply roll and put two sheets of newspaper at the bottom of the Rapidfire Chimney, fill it with your choice of charcoal, light up the paper and place the whole unit inside your grill (without the grilling rack). Eight to ten minutes later, the coals will be red hot with evenly distributed fire. The simply grab the chimney by its handles, pour the coals into the grill, set your grilling rack and start the party.Of course, as with any flamable material, caution should always be used when handling. Even though its handles do not get very hot, they'r still warm, so I recommend to always use gloves. After you have emptied the chimney, place it away from children and any inmediate area where the risk of burn exists. It will be extremely hot. Do not use water to cool it down, it might warp the metal; allow it to cool on its own.The quality of this item is superb. After countless uses, it's still holding strong and works as when new. Compared to cheaper versions found at local super markets, this is by far, the best I've used. Its design allows for plenty of oxygen to flow through, allowing the coals to burn evenly and rapidly. Once you use it, you'll never go back to the old fashion way and in no time, you'll be saying goodbye to lighting fluids.
B000WEOQV8 This chimney is large and holds a lot of coals. It's especially nice if you are feeding a crowd, but you can put fewer in for a smaller grill. No more need for lighter fluid with this chimney starter, which means no more off flavor to your burgers, steaks and veggies. The extra handle is a very nice feature, making it so much easier to place the hot coals in the grill box than other chimneys I've tried. I will recommend this product to others.
B000WEOQV8 This product works very well! Now it's designed to use one piece of newspaper and while that works... I don't get the morning paper so I don't have a stack readily available. So, what I do is I generally use the side burner on my propane grill to start the chimney and it takes only about 60 seconds to be lit.I realize using a propane grill to start your charcoal is odd, but I'm using the charcoal for my Smokey Mountain Cooker Smoker, not for actually charcoal grilling. I use propane for my grilling and charcoal for my smoking so for me it works perfectly and if you have a similar setup this will work well for you.I have also used it twice using junk mail :) and it worked using that. But my preferred method is putting charcoal in the chimney, putting it on the side propane burner for about a minute and pulling it off, works perfectly!The design of this unit is why it works so well, with a spiral spring giving the charcoal a pyramid shape in the bottom allows it to start faster. Weber removed the wood handle and put on a heat resistant plastic so that it can withstand the elements and you can tell when picking this thing up it's built to last. I highly recommend getting one of these if you need a chimney charcoal starter. I will say that I picked mine up at my local Lowes store for $14.99, saved a few bucks over Amazon's price of $18.99
B000WEOQV8 This chimney costs more than some you can find at Wal Mart, but it is better made (heavy duty). For anyone regularly cooking with charcoal, this is the best because it uses only a sheet or two of old newspaper to start the coals, thus no charcoal starter or petroleum odor when you are cooking your food. I would recommend this item as a must have for all charcoal chefs.
B000WEOQV8 I was skeptical having never used a starter like this but trusted the reviews.  I used it for the first time yesterday and all I can say is WOW!  Super easy to set up, light and dump the coals.  I was even surprised at the fact that the handles weren't that hot to the touch considering how hot the charcoal was.  I did use and recommend a mitt though, just to be safe.I'm sold 100% that this is the best and easiest way to light charcoal.  And I even used in in pretty high gusty winds which is not recommended.Not sure what else to say but this thing rocks, and for a price that I'm now convinced is a fraction of what it's worth.
B000WEOQV8 As with most Weber products it is made of high quality material and works just as it should. We have purchased two so we can have the second warmed and ready when we need it.
B000WEOQV8 This is one big, honkin' chimney starter compared to the cheaper brands. I'm able to light up lump charcoal with ease, even with just two lightly crumpled pieces of newspaper and a match! It has an extra handle that helps with dumping the coals, but I recommend wearing heavy gloves or mitts while dumping do to embers scattering about. Kiss lighter fluid goodbye!
B000WEOQV8 I just started smoking and this thing is excellent for starting the smoker.  The charcoal was fully lit in 10 minutes and ready to go. Very simple to use and worth every penny which I think this is a great price.
B000WEOQV8 I have seen friends use them and thoughtg why not get one for myself, I did and I am really impressed at the ease in starting and yes use newspaper which is best, Saves you from using the instant lite charcoal which is full of chemicals and also the chemicals in those starting fuids,  So to me it is better due to lack of chemicals and safer also,
B000WEOQV8 I am serious about BBQ and do not use lighter fluids to ruin the taste of the meat. Therefore I use a charcoal chimney. I have used the cheap models and only get a single season from it. Got this one and it looks like it will last years to come. Well worth it.
B000WEOQV8 Like most modern products from Weber, the quality leaves much to be desired. While their products work well, I question their longevity. This is no exception. I swear if you just look at it wrong it'll crumble like a soda can.Having said that, the thing works great. Crumble up a couple of sheets of newspaper, tuck them under the bottom, fill it with coals, add fire, and, voila, heat! It seems like nothing is happening at first. You get a bunch of white smoke for a couple of minutes, then it catches - first time every time.The handle doesn't get all that hot, but I use a leather gardening glove anyway. The wire bail is useless as charcoal is light and you don't need two hands to dump the thing.Except for materials and build quality it would be worth five stars. The jury is still out on that fifth star.Update - Still 4 stars, but it's worked perfectly all season. I removed the bail because it got in the way. Still seems cheaply made, but it's doing the job.
B000WEOQV8 Best charcoal starter I've ever used. The last one lasted for five years in the weather; it holds a generous load of charcoal (or wood), produces ready coals in about twenty minutes. No petroleum! A fine way to recycle newspapers!
B000WEOQV8 This is such a simple piece of metal, but it makes life so much easier!  I use it with a Weber Smokey Mountain smoker.http://www.amazon.com/Weber-731001-Smokey-Mountain-Cooker/dp/B001I8ZTJA/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&s;=home-garden&qid;=1248285453&sr;=8-2This product is great, because you don't have to douse anything with lighter fluid and allows you to light briquettes quickly and easily. Thus, you don't contaminate and smoke your bbq with lighter fluid for 6 hours.It is built well and should last awhile.  Any serious briquette bbq'er should have this.
B000WEOQV8 I'm a total Weber/charcoal fan, and I've always been the griller at my house.  So how did I manage for 25+ years using lighting fluid?  Who knows.Once I discovered the Chimney, it was all over for lighting fluid, wondering if the fire would really start, watching my ex go out and re-douse to coals because he was sure they wouldn't start (hey, we've all done it, just admit it...prepared to go up in flames just because we want to grill some burgers).  Now that I have a Chimney Starter, I'm pretty much assured every fire will start.  A couple of sheets of newspaper, new coals in the bottom, any old coals in the top, 15-20 minutes, and we are good to go. Kingsford remains the best charcoal in my area.  And there's one less toxic chemical in my garage.My Starter has been going strong for about 7 years now, with no problems. Combine it with a long Bic lighter, and you have a perfect gift for a griller!
B000WEOQV8 I love thiese things if you pack the paper correctly in the bottom the paper ash is less and produces a hotter fire.
B000WEOQV8 I looked at other chimneys before I purchased this one, and I must say, for the money, this one can't be beat.Others I looked at were thin, spot welded sheet metal that you can deform with your hands while cool.imagine what would happen when they are hot.This one is heavier gauge steel, the handle is riveted to the chimney and has a thermoplastic cap.The bottom grate is cone shaped, which helps the charcoal engage quickly.I have used this quite frequently since June with either newspaper or fire cubes to get the charcoal engagedand I haven't had a failure yet. It does have discoloration from the heat, but no rust yet.Personal note: If you have never used a chimney, and always used starter fluid or self lighting briquettes, then you are in for a pleasant surprise. Your meat won't taste like mineral spirits, or have the soot produced by burning petroleum. I personally want my meats to taste like meat instead of car exhaust. I also do not use briquettes because of the chemicals and filler used in their manufacture. I use lump charcoal, which burns clean and is healthier to use.
B000WEOQV8 It took me several years to come around to using a chimney starter, but now that I've gotten used to it, it's the only way I start charcoal these days.  I grill often, have had mine for several years now, have used it to light thousands of pounds of charcoal, and it's showing no signs of wearing out any time soon.  I got this one as a gift for my father as I'm trying to help him up his game on with the grill.
B000WEOQV8 What can you say really?  This is the single best way to start a charcoal grill.  Fast, easy to use, and works incredible.  I use mine with the Weber firestarter paraffin cubes and it work amazing.  One cube will light a full chimney of coal.  Will never go back to lighter fluid or any other method of starting coals again!
B000WEOQV8 Fifty years ago my father used to light his charcoal briquettes in an old coffee can, using what seemed like half a can of lighter fluid. That was the old way. Today, just about everyone burning charcoal, either briquette or wood, uses a chimney like this one, and uses a sheet of newsprint to light it. Sure, you can still use a coffee can, but this starter is easier, safer, and more reliable. The combination of the heat shield, bail, and insulated handle means you can use this lighter without gloves and still be assured you won't get burned doing so. I bought mine at the local HD when they first came out, which means it's what, over a decade old now? It's still in great shape and still starts enough charcoal for the average sized home grill in one batch.
B000WEOQV8 Well worth the money, cheap, easy to use. Don't buy a off brand because they don't have the holes on the sides which allows air flow.
B000WEOQV8 I think this was a great investment... I'm really glad I bought this size compared to most smaller brand chimney starters...When filling this all the way up with charcoal, it's plenty enough to put into a 22\" grill, but when using a smaller one like my gas & charcoal grill combo, you can put less in. When putting newspaper in bottom to start, I use approximately 4 smaller advertisement papers... I fold roll the paper long ways and train around chimney and leave a small hole in middle for air to flow free up into coals... this way it seems to catch fire a little easier & faster... my starter takes approximately 15min. to get going good... charcoals are generally almost all white and ready to empty... I love it and highly recommend, as a easier way to start coals without charcoal fluid.
B000WEOQV8 Nobody will ever convince us (never) that gas can do the same as charcoal. We were absolute charcoal starter fluid loyalists, too. We never did like the match-ready products and our grill wouldn't allow for the use of electric starters. We were determinedly set on charcoal and charcoal starter fluid - and that's the way it was going to be. Forever.As you can gather, we were Mr. and Mrs. Skeptical when our son went on and on about these chimney starters. We thought: &#34;Yeah, Right. You're the same kid who told us Napoleon Dynamite was the funniest movie ever.&#34; He asked for one for his birthday, so we obliged. You'd think we bought him a car or something. He went on and on about how much he loved it, and that we should really try it out.  ...never gonna happen, kid.Knowing how stubborn we are, he forced us into trying them by buying a pair (we have a very large grill) for his dad on Father's Day. We sighed, rolled our eyes, stood patiently and graciously by as our well-intentioned (but usually very misguided) son showed us how &#34;easy&#34; it was to use.Okay. You CAN teach old dogs new tricks! Our son was actually r...r...r...right! The chimney design gets the coals evenly hot and ready in almost no time. Better yet - I no longer have to pick up the phone in preparation of dialing 911, and cringe in terror as my husband approaches the grill with the starter and matches.If you don't want to buy one to try it, ask a friend who charcoal grills and see if they'll let you borrow theirs. Better yet, have them SHOW you how to do it. If they do it right, you'll be coming right back here to buy one (or two) for yourself!Now we need to figure out what to do with 4 big bottles of starter fluid....
B000WEOQV8 product does what it says.  fill it with regular kingsford charcoal, place crumpled newspapers at the bottom, and light the newspapers with matches or a lighter.  give it about 20-30 mins, and the coals will be ashed over.  NO COMPLAINTS!!
B000WEOQV8 The starter works great though I was a little disappointed when I read that it was made in china especially when I read in another review that it was made here thank goodness the grill is still made here anyway it works great some newspaper a few drops of cooking oil 12 min later they were glowing red and ready to go sure beats lighter fluid. Just be careful to not get burned the handle is very good and protects well but if you touch anything else it's an instant severe burn so an oven met is a good idea.
B000WEOQV8 I hardly ever used chimney starters before because it was a hassle. They were supposed to make it &#34;easy&#34; to start your charcoal, but inevitably, i always had to add more newspaper underneath in order to get the fire continuing and lighting the coals enough.  Also, by the time the top coals were lit, the bottom ones were already getting burned out almost. So i never bothered buying one.When i saw this item and the reviews, i thought, what the heck, i'll try it. It's not terribly expensive at about $15, so it wasn't going to be too much of a gamble.  Well, i'm glad i took a chance.  I don't know how Weber does it, but they just make things that work RIGHT.  Maybe its the conical grate at the bottom, maybe its the perforated sides that allow air to flow better. i can't say for sure.  but this sucker lights coals WELL.You just needs enough sheets of crumpled and folded/twisted newspaper to fill the bottom up, light it, and let it do its trick.  I've been really impressed with it.
B000WEOQV8 I wouldn't use charcoal if we still had to douse it in lighter fluid and wait for the coals to catch.  But with this chimney starter, I can start enough Charcoal to last for an evening of grilling.  It takes about 20-30 minutes for the Chimney Starter to get the coals going - about enough time to season the meat and let it come to room temperature.Don't cook with gas any more!  Buy a charcoal grill and a chimney starter and add flavor to your grilling!
B000WEOQV8 A long time ago a friend of mine made something like this from an old Maxwell House coffee can. At the time I though he could get rich if he marketed his idea. I was almost ready to give up on charcoal and switch to gas (yuck) because I am the world's worst fire starter. So I saw this Weber thingie at Amazon and for a few bucks thought I would give it a try. WOW! I took the advice of one reviewer and added a few drops of cooking oil to 2 sheets of crumbled newspaper. 15 minutes later the coals are BLAZING!!!!  Not just warm, not just hot, as hot as the sun.  Dump the coals out and toss your meat on the grill. The Weber chimney starter gives a whole new meaning to BBQ.  I have rarely been so impressed with such a simple gadget. It is worth every penny and you absolutely have to get one. If I could give a 100% satisfaction guarantee on any product this is surely one that I would give a totally perfect 5 to!
B000WEOQV8 Excellent item.  I no longer need to start these in old pots (coffee cans are no longer metal).  This allows me to start coals that need to be added when I am midway thru the grilling process as well as at the beginning.  Absolutly love it and strongly recommend it.  Construction is a nice weight, not thin metal.
B000WEOQV8 Oh boy.  My Weber chimney starter, this one, is now in year 5 and sits outside in the weather and is rusty and crusty.  But still very functional and has outlasted many other chimneys.  Also, I use one Weber firestarter cube to light the chimney and that is so much better than newspaper, etc.  No ash and no fuel smell.  Great way to get the grill going rain or shine.This is a very good product and may cost a little more than the competition, but it will outlast and outperform others.  Well worth the money.
B000WEOQV8 What does one of these chimney charcoal fire starters look like after couple years of use and abuse? I uploaded a picture for you to see... a bit battered and bruised but in great working condition. No lighter fluid taste or smell, quick even lighting, and all it takes is a match and a little bit of newspaper. Highly recommended.We have used these chimney-style charcoal starters for at least 20 years now and we grill something almost every weekend (or, as my wife seems to like to plan, whenever it is going to rain...) If just the two of us then we will do half a canister of briquets; if the kids are home, or if we have company, then we load 'er up.  This starter is fairly large as compared to others we have had, and it has great airflow. Never had the handle hot either (have never needed a mitt to handle it); of course the body of all these chimney starters gets blazing hot so you need to take care when handling them.The process is very simple: Stand the chimney up inside of your grill so you can operate in a safe place, add the desired amount of charcoal, place a couple wadded up pieces of newspaper just under the charcoal, light the paper through one of the air holes at the bottom of the unit, and watch it go. Once the paper is burned away, we will insert a couple more pieces to keep the fire stoked... might repeat that twice until the charcoal at the bottom gets going and the updraft takes over.If you would like to see the picture of this old workhorse, go back to the chimney's main sales page, scroll down to where the \"Most Helpful Customer Reviews\" section starts, then look to the right of that area for the \"Product Images From Customers\" section. Mmmmmm... smell that ribeye now!Based on our experience with this chimney starter, if you are looking for a starter of this size and style for use as I have described above, then we recommend this one.Go for it.
B000WEOQV8 I have went through several chimneys over the years.  Although they were only a few dollars cheaper they needed replacement after a couple of years mainly due to rust and failure brought on by heat.  I have owned this thing for nearly 3 years and I can say it is built like a tank.  One plus is it holds the proper amount of coals for a standard kettle grill.  It  also lights faster and more consistent than the other cheaper chimney's I have owned.  The reason is the design; it has a cone shaped grate that the coals sit on instead of a standard flat grate.Pay the extra $5 and pick this up because you will not be disappointed.  Two sheets of newspaper and a lighter is all it takes to get away from that nasty lighter fluid.
B000WEOQV8 This things works perfect! I use it for starting coals for my smoker and kettle grill. Has coals hot and ready in 15 minutes
B000WEOQV8 This is well designed and quality materials. I use to not like to charcoal due to all the time it took to start the charcoal. Now it is a breeze, I just place one fuel cube down and light it and place the chimney starter on top and 20 or so minutes later I have a roaring fire ready for cooking. I have showed this to all my grilling friends and they now all have one. A must have product to start your charcoal are the fire starter lighter cubes, just light and forget, much safer than lighter fluid. Cook on!
B000WEOQV8 Much too large for an 18.5&#34; grill. They also cannot be used with Weber starter cube, which fall through the bottom. You are forced to use newspaper.
B000WEOQV8 I have a Weber charcoal ignition grill that came with two small briquet holders that are placed over the gas ignition pipe. Unfortunately they don't hold much charcoal and wouldn't cook at the temps I needed to cook large quantities of meat.The Weber website had a positive comment about this Chimney Starter. I ordered one and was surprised at how large it is. Since this is a gas ignition grill, there was no need to use newspaper or other starter. The first time I used it was on eight 3\" thick ribeye steaks, cooked from rare to medium-well. The hot coals allowed me to sear everything first, cook the medium-well steak about half-way through, and then place it on the outer edge of the grill to finish by indirect cooking.  Then I did the medium orders, the medium rares and finally the rare.As anyone knows, it's hard to cook a large steak to medium-well without burning it or drying it out. But there was enough heat from this amount of charcoal to sear it and let it finish on its own.  Everyone was happy with their meal.  Happy family, happy cook.
B000WEOQV8 I bought this to start coals on a Hibachi grill. It's much bigger than I needed, but it worked wonderfully with just a couple of sheets of newspaper.  I was impressed with the thickness of the steel and the sturdiness of the handle.
B000WEOQV8 I don't like using lighter fluid and this works great.  Stuff some news paper in the bottom and in a few minutes you have hot coals.
B000WEOQV8 There is something about BBQ-ing your food and having this baby to help in starting the fire is absolutely fantastic!This Chimney starter helps bring the fire and coals to red hot in almost no time! This is a DEFINITE must-have at any BBQ and especially if one is braving the (cold) weather elements out in nature.Burn baby burn!Happy grilling! :D
B000WEOQV8 I can't say enough good things about this. I was skeptical of all the glowing reviews, but when this came I was blown away by its effectiveness. We will never use a charcoal grill again without this. I am going to give them as gifts to people who have charcoal grills.This makes grilling outside and instant affair instead of a drawn out process. If don't buy any other accessories for your grill, by this one.
B000WEOQV8 This is a great replacement for a charcoal chimney I got almost 10 years ago, that finally fell apart (due to leaving it outside year round).  This one definitely feels sturdier and the hinged metal handle is very useful when trying to slowly pour out charcoal for indirect cooking.  I certainly hope this one lasts as long as the last (it certainly seems like it will), though I will try to help it by remembering to store it away after use.
B000WEOQV8 I have been using a chimney started since my Dad showed me how to cook on a grill. The Weber 7416 is the best chimney started I've ever owned because of it's large size and stay cool handle. I could go on and on about what a good job Weber did on this starter.
B000WEOQWC Highly recommend you purchase this cover for your grill because without, anything else is really uncivilized!  Just buy it.  You will thank me.  It has protected my grills through storms and hurricanes and they stay outside all the time.
B000WEOQWC I purchased the web kettle 22 1/2 charcoal grill and the grill did not come with no cover.  My smoker did my not my grill.  Good thing i had purchased an extra one and now goes well with my grill.  Side thought:  Why would weber not include one in the grill?
B000WEOQWC The Premium cover is a cover that is more durable the Staglar cover and more expansive than the Elgar cover. This cover is a new syth-meth material made up of Kevlar fibers which are extremely strong and durable (they are used for helmets and bullet proof vests). My dog Homer attempted to bite into it one day and he didn't even tear it. It is easy to wash (simply go down to a river and use vegetable soap), easy to use (simply put it on top of your grille) and even light weight (16ou). This can even be used as a blanket if you are stranded in the wilderness like I was one night, very warm.

B000WEOQWC It's a cover and fits well.
B000WEOQWC This grill cover is long enough that it truly covers the whole 22.5-inch grill.  I like that it's not a bright color.  Instead it almost disappears once the cover is on.The cover has material that is strong and seems as if it will last as long as my grill.
B000WEOQWC I really like the cover.  It blocks the UV rays that would fade my black grill.  It also protects the thermometer that I installed from the rain.  It is very durable and I expect it to last for the life of my grill.
B000WEOQWC Thought is would be heavier material for the price. Will see how it withstands the seasonal temperature changes. Would rather it not be of a cheap type material as the sun will break it down in a couple of summers in my location.
B000WEOQWC I live in a place where we get all four seasons so I figured a cover was a good way to go. These are the brand name ones, fit snugly, and seem super durable. I haven't had any tearing or fading yet so I'm content.
B000WEOQWC This cover is nice and thick and will protect your kettle from wind and rain. Its so tough, I'm sure I will never have any problems with it tearing.
B000WEOQWC This cover looks nice and fits perfectly on my Weber grill. The fabric is thick enough that it'll take a few years' sun and weather to thin it out, and the thick stitching and elastic bands keep the cover firmly over the grill without soaking the grill in rain and wind.It's been on the grill for three pretty large storms (hail, rain and wind), and still looks to be in new condition. Time will tell, but the cover fits perfectly and is worth the ~$5 premium you pay for the name brand.A few tips:- You can spray the cover off with your garden hose if it gets dingy or coated with grass, pollen, etc.- Wait at least overnight before fitting the cover over your grill after you're finished grilling; the embers/coals can still be lit, and the grill will still be hot for a while!- Try to not catch the cover on fire... keep it at least a few feet away from the grill (I fold mine up and set it on a little table on the porch, near to a clay potholder where I set the charcoal chimney I use to get the coals fired up.
B000WEOQWC I bought this cover for my Weber 22.5\" and so far, it has done a great job at keeping my grill protected from sunlight, wind and rain.I live in northern California, so we get our share of windy, wet and dry days. This cover has kept my grill intact. I recently took it off and was pleased to see that my grill looked as good as the day I bought it. There was a dust layer of course, but that was about it. There isn't any water damage or rust on my grill.The cover is thick and well stitched. Made of heavy duty vynil, comes with two elastic straps at the bottom to keep it in place during windy days. Now, keep in mind that our windy days here in my area, may not be as strong as yours, but for what it's worth, I can tell you, mine survived the winter, windy, wet and hot days.After being outside for exactly one year, the cover does not have signs of wear or tear. It's dusty, but its quality remains the same. Strong and durable.It fits over my grill even with theWeber 6431 Charcoal Grill Tool Holder; the holder was on my grill the entire time.If you want to protect your Weber grill, look no further, this will do the job.
B000WEOQWC Fits perfectly and has some elastic inside that will keep it in place during a wind. Completely sheds rain but will not protect the wheels. If you keep your kettle outdoors, this would be worth the money.
B000WEOQWC It's a great cover that works as described and expected.  The complaint about wind pulling it off may be valid although so far, in high gusty winds mine has only shifted around a little but still covers as it should.  I don't know if they've changed it recently, but mine has elastic in a loose gathering at the bottom that may be why it stays on.  To get it over the top you need to stretch it open slightly.If I were to have to list what I'd like to see improved, and the only reason I gave it only 4 stars is that I would like for it to be a little longer, although what it doesn't cover really doesn't need protecting.  It could also fit better as although it fits over the top handle, it rests on top of the side handles.  Not really a problem but would look better more tailored to the kettle and the side handles.  That may help with wind moving it around where that's a problem.For me, it works fine and appears to be one that will last, as long as the elastic in the bottom doesn't prematurely age and fail.  It's not the same tough material that for example, a cover I have from Barbecues Galore (from the old days with the original company, not the new company since the Taiwanese company bought them out of bankruptcy) which has lasted unharmed for years in full element exposure, but it's also a fraction of the price.  But it may last just as long.
B000WEOQWC This is a very thick and durable cover. What I like most about it is that the fabric, despite being so thick, allows enough airflow to prevent mold growth.
B000WEOQWC My last cover for my weber grill only lasted a few years. This one seems to be built with much better materials. It seems like it can take on more intense weather.
B000WEOQWC This a well-made cover that protects my &#34;Weber 1351001 One-Touch Gold Kettle Grill&#34; really well (even during very windy storms). I only wish it was a little longer (8 inches) so it would reach the ground, protecting the base and the wheels from rain and sun exposure.
B000WEOQWC We purchased this cover when we ordered the grill.  It fits the grill perfectly and has an elastic strap to put the leg through so it won't blow away during heavy wind.  Heavy, durable fabric with rain repellent finish.  The water just beads up on the fabric.
B000WEOQWC I bought this about 10 yrs ago and it finally wore out after our last move ( ripped from rough handling). Decided to buy a new one and it is just as well made, as my original one. I thought about the less expensive ones offered, and decided to spend the extra on this particular one.  My friends got cheaper ones, and all the of them lasted less than one season. I feel the cost savings in the end will outweigh the initial cost.
B000WEOQWC Excellent to protect my grills from the harsh Nebraska weather.  Theses last about three years until they crack and need to be replaced.  I smart investment to extend the life of your grills.
B000WEOQWC It fits my Weber 22.5 inch grill perfectly. We've had some pretty strong winds and it hasn't moved. I don't know how it would blow off unless it is sitting out in the middle of a field or something. I suppose if it is on a deck you could get some up wind. But on my back patio it has stayed put.It is great quality, nice and thick, not that cheap vinyl. Keeps my grill clean.
B000WEOQWC I bought this from Warehouse Deals.  The package had a small tear that was covered by tape.  The cover was in perfect condition. The great thing about Warehouse Deals are the discounts they offer. I saved some money because of a tear in something I will trash anyway.  On to the product-it fits my Weber OTG like it should.
B000WEOQWC I got this to replace the grey, slightly thinner, version that I had purchased from Weber previously. I have the same material/style of grill covers for all my Weber products. These are perfect for rain, snow, and just about anything else mother nature wants to throw at it.
B000WEOQWC As I said in my review of the grill this cover is made for, I am not the griller in the family, my husband is, so I actually bought this for him.We have had grill covers in the past, that are made of flimsy material, or even a bit too big for the grill they supposedly fit, so I figured this one would be the same and we were just paying for the weber name.  Apparently I was wrong,  It fits snugly, so getting it on takes a bit of patience, but the material is strong and seems very durable.  This is our fourth grill in the 12 years we have been married, so I want this one to last...this cover seems like it will do a great job protecting our investment!
B000WEPFOA I just bought one at my local hardware store and was pleased at their size and quality. The picture doesn't do them justice. They seem to be heavy duty. I sprayed them with Pam to help with cleanup. They fit the baby-back ribs I bought at Costco just fine. I cut my ribs in half and since I had 3 sets of ribs put two in the rack and leaned two on the sides. If you cook them in the middle of the weber you could probably put up to 4 sets in the rack although they would stick out on the sides.
B000WEPFOA This rack works well. Using indirect heat, a drip pan with a little water in it to catch the grease and create a little moisture and you are set to go!  The rack holds more than you think it will hold.  Can be used for chicken breasts, quarters, etc. also.  I spray my racks with a little olive oil before I put everything on the grill...this helps with the clean up....makes that job allot easier.
B000WEPFOA I use this with my 18&#34; Weber Kettle grill in conjunction with a Smokenator.  It was a bit too long so I cut of the end of the base with a hack saw.  After this it fit perfectly.  If using this in an 18&#34; Weber kettle you will need to use the bottom grate to cook on and not the top.  If you try and put it on the top rack the lid won't close.I was able to smoke three racks of baby backs utilizing this rack.  Cutting each in half, I put three pieces on the bottom grate in this rib rack and three laid flat on the top cooking grate.  Switched the top grate ribs with the bottom grate ribs half way through the smoke and they all finished at the same time.  Delicious!
B000WEPFOA This rack works quite well. I cook ribs over an indirect fire after having briefly seared them over a direct fire. The rack works best if the usual baby back ribs are cut in half. The rack is well made (as Weber products are) and can go through a dishwasher.
B000WEPFOA They way I cook these racks just get in the way. I would not recommend them for large rib cooking.
B000WEPFOA These work well. I use them in my Weber Smokey Mountain 18.5&#34; smoker. I can place 4 racks of ribs in this and leave them on the top shelf. That leaves the whole bottom available to smoke a brisket or pork butt.
B000WEPFOA I typically buy baby back ribs.  This rack just does not have wide enough spacing.  Most of my ribs simply do not fit.  I like the stainless steel but not happy with the spacing.  I tried widening it but not the greatest results.
B000WEPH8Y This portable &#34;lug all&#34; otter skin drying rack is a great gift for not only those special people who like to save meat and skins from their avid hunt, but those who dry fruit in the hot summer months. Although it isn't that large, one can put 2 dry apples, one pumpkin, numerous raisins, oranges, peas, and a few pears on the rack. Can also be used to dry fish or smelly wet socks.

B000WEPH8Y I looked a number of places and could NOT find this product anywhere.  When I found this and it worked just like the original grill did, I bought a 2nd one to use in the future.
B000WEPH8Y Not much I can say.  Fit my Weber Genesis Silver perfectly.  Maybe not the highest quality steel (a bit light).
B000WEPH8Y I just wish Weber made stainless steel ones, the plating on these fails quickly and then rust sets in :-(
B000WEPH8Y Well made and a perfect fit.  It discolored to a more gold color after use but it fits and works fine
B000WEPH8Y Amazon offers a very good price for this stainless steel replacement warming rack. Along with the replacement grates and flavorizer bars, we have a grill that looks better than new, that will never rust.
B000WEPH8Y I decided to clean my 12 year old Weber grill. Ended up rebuilding most of it. The old warming rack had pretty much turned to dust. This new one looks so good.
B000WEPH8Y Exactly what I had before and it fils perfectly.  My husband does the grilling and he loves the new rack.
B000WEPH8Y Weber has a tool on its web site to let you find the correct parts for your grill which I used to select this particular warming rack and it fits my Weber Genesis Silver A series grill perfectly. I would recommend using that tool to find the part and then buy it at much lesser price, than Weber web site, from Amazon.The warming rack is supposedly made of stainless steel but it rusts in about three to four years for me.
B000WEPHBG I ordered this to replace the basket on my Weber that had become rusted.Although it says it is the correct replacement part on the label it comes up short. Beware when ordering this product. Not sure if the mix up is on the manufacturing end or not.
B000WEPHBG I ordered a new warming rack, burners and grates to rebuild my 12 year old grill. The basket was in better shape than the other parts so I originally didn't replace it. Once I got the other pieces installed I had to have this to match the other stuff.
B000WEPHBG Our warm-up basket was in bad shape and we found this on-line.  The grill looks new and most of all, my husband is happy.
B000WEPHBG Weber has a tool on its web site to let you find the correct parts for your grill which I used to select this particular warm up basket and its fit my Weber Genesis Silver A series grill perfectly.

B000WEPHBG A perfect replacement part for for my weber grill.  The old one got very rusty and this one &#34;seems&#34; to be made of stainless steel; but as I recall, so was the old one.  We'll have to wait and see whether this one also rusts (and is then obviously NOT make of stainless steel).
B000WEPHKM The table surface is made from very durable plastic, and it looks great attached to the grill.  The table surface is roughly 22\" by 15\".I have two complaints, however:1) Once I attached it to the grill, I noticed that NEITHER of the table legs touched the ground.  I am using the 22.5\" grill, and am also using the including leg extensions that came with the table.  Putting some weight on the table (hanging tools from it and putting a couple dinner plates on it) made one of the legs tough the ground, but the other one is perpetually lifted off the ground.  I suspect that this might be due to some minor warping if the table plastic, and might just be a problem with the one I bought.2) There is no way to move the grill once you have the table attached.  This becomes a huge nuisance if your keep your barbecue somewhere other than the spot where you fire it up, because you will be constantly removing and re-attaching it.  I may try to tie a string from a tool hook to the bottom of the front leg so that i can use the table as a handle to roll the grill around.
B000WEPHKM This could have been a great accessory, but it's awkward to use. First, the build quality is very good. Assembly is simple, but, once again, Weber provides NO written instructions. Unlike their grills, however, this thing is hard to screw up. I find the size useful. You can put a stack of plates and a few condiments and have room to spare. I find the hooks useless unless your utensils have lanyards.I've taken two stars away for two reasons. First, it attaches to a grill that has WHEELS, which implies movement. It's awkward moving the grill with table attached. So you detach it. Here's why it lost another star. If it's detachable it should have folding legs so it's stowable.Awkward to use, awkward to store. Otherwise, works well. Three stars.
B000WEPHKM Having a table nearby is key to grilling.  However, this table is simply too close to the grill to be useful.  By way of example, I had a plastic bottle of bbq sauce that I left on this for a few minutes, and it MELTED.It is also fairly small - barely large enough for two dinner plates.  The only really useful thing is that it has hooks to hang your tools.  Those hooks are far enough away from the grill that the tools don't get red hot - as they would with the Webber tool hanger.Also, I found that this got in my way when grilling.  I like to be able to walk around the grill and get at things from different angles.  This blocked 1/4 of the grill.Instead I now use a cheap wooden folding table that I keep about three feet away from the grill.  Anything within two feet of the grill simply gets far too hot to be useful.
B000WEPHKM This is a small price to pay than owning the Weber performer.  This table is not bulky.  It is light weight to move around with the grill but steady enough to give you space to prepare your ribs, steaks, marinade, seasonings for immediate access.  It also has hooks for your grilling tools.  It is a great addition to my 22.5 in weber grill without spending tons of money.  I am happy with this purchase and make grilling outdoor even more fun.
B000WEPHKM This was the perfect addition to the kettle.  it gives you a place to set platters, thermometers, etc. while cooking. Keep in mind that the cover for the kettle will no longer fit--so you'll have to get a larger on.
B000WEPHKW I got this for a smoker project (UDS) I was working on.  Weber quality can't be beat.  High quality grate.
B000WEPHKW I bought a Weber product so I was expecting to be impressed. Sadly these grates are made from cheap, nickel plated steel. Which means they will not last a full season without rusting and wearing away. I bought 3 of these as replacements for my Weber gold, performer, and one for a drum smoker I made. All three are rusting badly after a couple of months of use.If you want quality and a long lasting grill grate, you need stainless steel. I called Weber directly and they do have a stainless steel grate for about 20% more than the cost of the cheap, nicklel plated steel grates. I am much happier with the stainless replacements.
B000WEPHKW I had no idea that a cooking grate like this even existed until I was looking for Weber accessories on Amazon one day.  I really wish my 22.5\" Weber grill came with one of these in the first place, but I guess most casual grillers don't need access to the charcoal during grilling.If you use lump charcoal, like I do, then this cooking grate is very valuable, because it allows you to shuffle the coals around without completely removing the grate.  Also, if you use your grill to slow-cook meat, you can flip up the side of the grate and add more coals periodically without disrupting the food.
B000WEPHKW I suppose I wouldn't have to get a new one every few years if I cleaned and stored this properly between uses. As it is I love my Weber and it's a small price to pay to get something that works so well...
B000WEPHKW This is a Weber grate, so expect the Weber quality here. I grill a lot and it holds up really well. I grill 3-4 times a week and find these last me a year or so.For this price, I can get a little lazy and not buff the grates back to brand new - I just order another!
B000WEPHKW Works great!!  I would recommend this grate to anyone who grills.  It works great for adding wood chunks to the charcoal before cooking chicken, pork, or fish without having to lift the whole grate off.  I also use it with my Smokenator, and it works awesome for adding wood or extra charcoal without having to lift off the whole grate to get to the Smokenator.If you do offset cooking, and ever need to add wood or more charcoal to your already burning coals, you have to get this.  It is also a must if you have purchased a Smokenator to turn your Weber Kettle into a smoker.  I would never buy a standard grate again, as this works just as well and has the advantage of the two hinged grates to access the coals!
B000WEPHKW Makes adding charcoal while grilling easier, safer and faster.  A clever design, reasonably priced and built to last many years.
B000WEPHKW I picked this up when I needed a replacement for my no name 22\" kettle grill.  I found this grate at the local Home Depot and discovered the measurements were close enough that I could use it as a replacement.  The quality difference is night and day and I expect it to last longer than the grill.  The hinged access points are awesome and makes adding more charcoal super easy.
B000WEPHKW As advertised, this grate is the ticket if you need to add coals while cooking.  It's especially useful if you're cooking indirect with coals on either side of the kettle.  This grate is also a good companion to the Smokenator assesory.  It gives you acess to get at the water pan, stir,  and replace coals without removing the grate.
B000WEPHKW After using a hinged grate for several years, I would never go back to one that wasn't hinged. The ability to add a few lumps of charcoal or move some coals around is indispensable and worth whatever small increment in price there might be over the non-hinged variety.As I was contemplating this purchase, I considered going with the Stainless Steel version that is only available through Weber's web site. However, at twice the price after shipping costs are factored in, I didn't think it made sense just to get stainless steel. We'll see if this grate starts rusting faster than I think it should. If so, lesson learned. It's unfortunate that Amazon doesn't carry the SS version, as I would have paid some extra, just not twice as much.Another possibility was doing with cast iron, like theCast Iron Grate, Pre Seasoned, Non Stick Cooking Surface, Modular  Fits 22.5\" Grillsthat has been recommended in the comments of another review. I really like the concept of a cast iron cooking grate, but at almost $90, I find it hard to justify.Maybe I'll revisit these options the next time I have to replace this grate, but if it lasts as long as the original, that won't be for another 10 years, and I can't imagine the grill will make its 25th birthday... Weber makes good stuff, and I think that this grate continues that tradition.
B000WEPHKW I've had my Weber Kettle grill since 1996 and it has held up amazingly well for the treatment it gets.  Well it was finally time to get some parts to fix it up and bring it back up to spec.  This part fit perfectly and has helped with my refurbishing of my grill.  This and the other parts I purchased will help me get a few more years out of my grill.I particularly like the hinged grate and chose to continue with it over a fixed grate.  It is really useful when doing indirect cooking and need to add more charcoal along the sides.
B000WOOAQ4 I purchased this grill to replace a dying full-sized grill purchased at a local store 3 years ago.  Hesitant about spending around $200 on anything, on the Weber Grill site I did a bit of research and comparison to find just the right Weber Q model for me.  I settled on the 200 for the size of the grill and because I didn't want to pay an additional $30 just to have a thermometer on the front of it (the Q 220 has it).On a side note - my husband would've liked the 300 for the ability of the grill to get 'hotter'.  I chose 'slower and lower' cooking, but may be simply a taste preference that you should consider when purchasing your grill.The grill arrives assembled, so all you really have to do out of the box is put the very heavy cast-iron grill plate on and attach the propane gas to begin cooking.  Because I have a large propane tank I decided to by the 6' adapter hose along with the Weber Q 200 (sold separately:Weber 6501 6-Foot Adapter Hose for Weber Q Series and Gas Go-Anywhere Grills.  It attached quickly and easily to my tank and within fifteen minutes I'd unpacked and set-up the grill.  Firing it up for the first time was a breeze and it was quickly preheated and ready to go.The size of the grill is perfect for a family of 3-4 to do burgers, steaks and kabobs - all things we've done with great success, and still have room to spare on the grill.  I could also see cooking a nice sized salmon fillet or babyback ribs.  It's not going to be big enough to feed 10-20 guests burgers all at once, but if you did them in stages... it could handle that too.I like how evenly the grill cooks.  There doesn't seem to be one hot spot or cool spots on the grill.  I also like the side tables, which flip out and allow you a place to put a plate or a set of tongs for flipping.  Cleaning is also easy with a disposable drip pan in the bottom.It isn't lightweight - the grill plate is VERY heavy and makes the whole unit about 45 pound.  Add a propane tank and it's not light work, but it is fairly compact so it would travel well for a tailgate party or camping trip.I'm very pleased with the purchase of this grill and while I wish its pricetag was a tad lower, the quality tells me why it's not.  Don't hesitate to purchase this one!
B000WOOAQ4 The surfaces on this make it a little difficult to clean, especially when camping or tailgating and don't have a lot of cleaning products at your disposal.  It cooks well and is easy enough to set up and put away.
B000WOOAQ4 What a great little grill!  A snap to put together - took about 10 minutes from opening the box to turning on the gas.  It cooks really well/evenly & puts out considerable heat.  And then, it folds up & you can store it away!  Not too heavy but more than those cheap rectangle-shaped grills you see everywhere.  This is my second Weber grill this summer.  Bought a big one for leaving on the deck at home & this one goes to the cabin for those times we don't want to set up the Weber charcoal grill or want to have a picnic in a park.
B000WOOAQ4 perfect small grill, never have any problems, cooks on selected temp perfectly. i always get a compliment on my tasty meat.
B000WOOAQ4 I was a little worried about the small size of this grill. But I wanted to downsize from the huge four burner gas grill that I had. I found that the size of the Weber 200 was just right.The Weber 200 was very easy to assemble. I only had to install the lid with two pegs and pins and the handle. I placed a small propane bottle on the regulator and turned on the grill. I allowed the grill to heat up for the suggested 10 minutes. I grilled chicken thighs. I was pleased with the heavy grill grate and the temperature that the grill maintained. The chicken cooked evenly and had those wonderful grill marks.I think this grill would also do great for cooking a roast or whole chicken. Once the lid is closed, the temp stays very hot, even on a low setting. I will try different recipies using the grill since I believe roasting is possible with this Weber.Another nice thing is the portability of the grill. It is fairly lightweight. It would be great for a picnic or tailgating.So far, I am happy with this purchase. I would rate it a 10!
B000WOOAQ4 I had owned a Weber Q100 for a couple of years and loved it.  Recently someone decided that they were more worthy of owning it than I was and they \"liberated\" it from me.  Oh well.I thought about several other options for a replacement and settled on the Q200.  There is a Q220 but it looks like the only feature that you get for the extra money is a thermometer built into the lid (the lid may be built a bit higher according to the description but I couldn't tell for sure).  The Weber 300 is in a similar shape but it is more of a conventional grill with a cart and a 20lb. tank.  I bought the Q200 for these reasons:*  I can use it on a cart or take it with me if I go somewhere and want a grill with me*  It has enough grill space for a meal for 4-6 people, plenty for my needs*  The fold-out shelves are really convenient*  I really loved my Q100 and I thought that I should stick with a winning, proven designI bought the better cart for this and I use the big 20# gas cannister.  However, if it runs out at a bad time I can use the smaller cannisters as back-up.  Plus, when I travel with it I leave the big tank and cart behind.One more thing, now I use a bike chain to lock it onto my porch rail.  I not going to let this one go without making it a little harder for them this time.Weber 54601 Stationary Cart for Weber Q Grills 200 and 220Weber Q 6553 Premium Cover Fits Weber Q 300 Grill
B000WOOAS2 This Weber tool holder does as advertised. It attaches to the grill and holds 3 tools. Two things to note: 1) on the 18.5\" grill some of the Weber tools almost touch the ground (FYI), and 2) the lid doesn't fit securely over the grill with ease when the tool holder is attached. The lid does fit securely with the tool holder attached, but it requires a bit of additional attention to accomplish this. The carefree griller would not care as there is not even a gap between the lid and grill, but the picky person might not appreciate the slight offset between the lid and grill.
B000WOOAS2 Works well as advertised.Pros: Clips on easily, good build quality and looks nice on the grill. Holds most grill tools, even non-Weber ones.Cons: Sometimes gets in the way of hanging the kettle lid but slides around easily. Ironically the ease of sliding is periodically annoying when trying to quickly hang a tool.
B000WOOAS2 Not much to say that hasn't been said in the few reviews so far.  It really doesn't get hot, fits my 22.5\" kettle perfectly and does what it's supposed to do including looks good.The only thing I could say I'd like to see different is narrower \"hooks\" for some tools that don't have a strap but have smaller holes.  But I haven't been able to find ant tool that I use that doesn't work just fine with it though.
B000WOOAS2 These look nice hanging on the grill plus the ability to keep tools in easy reach while you are grilling.
B000WOOAS2 This fits perfectly on my 22.5\" One-Touch Gold and holds my coal tongs, grill cleaner, and food tongs.  Nice and solid, too.
B000WOOAS2 We did not have a place to keep our Weber grill brush so ordered this.  It works very well and does not get hot.  Well worth the price for the convience.
B000WOS9RA I just purchased this grill and have used it twice so far.  I had a large 4 burner, +Rotisserie burner.  After a few years of weathering the elements the internals was well rusted after the parts list crawled over $300 it was time to go shopping.  I've heard about the Weber Q grills and it gave me the options of storing it in the basement when not in use and taking it out camping with me.  I was worried about some of the reviews I read about the regulator and the grill not heating up.  No such problems here, but I'm getting ahead of myself.  Grill was shipped in the Weber box seemed packed pretty good and had no damage.  Was easy to get everything put together, was surprised that the cast iron grate weighs as much as the rest of the unit.  I used the adapter hose going to a full size tank.  Grill lit right up and heated up to 550 degrees.  First thing I grilled up was a couple large steaks, had nice grill marks and good flavor.  Second time I used the grill had the same experience this time I did some bratwurst.Lastly I'm impressed with how much grill surface is available for a \"portable\" grill.  I haven't taken it camping yet, so will find out how well it can pack up in my Jeep and handle a not so easy ride.
B000WOS9RA There is no better mini grill out there.  This will cook better steaks than most full size grills. There is one draw back. If you try to use this with anything but the non refillable tanks you will likely run into regulator issues.
B000WOS9RA I have not made up my mind what I think of this grill yet.  First, it seems very well constructed and has a super heavy duty grill surface.  Assembly was a breeze.  I am using a full size propane tank and I am having none of the regulator issues some have described.  The grilling area is plenty large for me and it lights and heats up very quickly.Still I am not sure this was a great buy for me.  The temperature goes down very quickly when I open the lid.  Also, I am not sure the heat is very even inside of this because of the burner layout. It is hard for me to get the temperature very high with my weber q.  Lastly, I am not sold on the work tables. They are pretty flimsy and made of plastic.  It is a hassle to wait for the thing to cool all of the way down to fold up the work tables and close this up.I am giving this four stars because I think I may have had unrealistic expectations.  I bought this to replace my full size grill.  It gave me the space saving and convenience I wanted, but there were some sacrifices I did not like.
B000WOS9RA I can't say enough good things about it.  First thing that I noticed when I opened was that it was good quality.  Another, I put it together myself which was so simple.  I guess that's why.  We ordered the converter for hookup to our 20 gal propane tank.  That was easy.  Nothing complicated at all.  To turn it on just follow the directions and it starts right up.I love the starter.  That works right away.  The grill warms up right away to whatever temp you want.  It grills very evenlyand fast.  I do the grilling in the family and I think that I am the only female that does for miles around.I just love this grill.  Compared to others I have this is the only one for me.  What a quality product.  It delivered fast.Thank you Weber.
B000WOS9RA This grill is actually much more than we expected! We LOVE it! Cooks beautifully! Nice and even ~ great cast iron grate ~ you get those perfect grill marks:~) You can fit a ton of food on this grill. We cooked about 5 lbs. of boneless chicken breasts on it without a problem. We got the adapter hose as well, to hook up to a normal size propane tank (not sure of the pounds of the tank, but it is your standard size). The drip pan is great and you need it. Some of the other models don't have this (or it's optional). Highly recommend. Just pull it out and clean it. I love my new Q220!
B000WOS9RA I'm giving this a 3 star because it has worked well for the last two years. It was a rough start & full disclosure: it may have been at least partial operator error. I bought this as a gift for my Dad (who does not live close enough for me to come see the problem). He bought an adapter to use his regular size grill gas tank with it & even seemingly tight fit, it would not consistently work, which was very frustrating for him.  When I learned he hadn't been able to use it, I visited, reviewed everything & followed the troubleshooting tips, still with no luck.  We bought a second adapter, which also did not work, so we assumed it was the grill. After speaking with several people about it from Weber, the local hardware store, etc., eventually a third adapter was purchased & the grill has been fine since, but as we were told by the company, it is designed to be used with a small tank and if you're planning on using it with a big tank, be prepared for possible issues as when adapters come into play, it opens the door to possible problems as the item isn't being used in the way it was designed for premium usage.
B000WOTUCI I tried this grill for the first time last night and am very pleased.  I cooked a large steak and a couple of chicken legs.  It cooked both great, although I think the manual suggested more time for the chicken than was necessary.  Assembly of the grill took a few minutes, most of that the unpacking.  I used one of the camping propane cylinders (Home Depot has the best price I've seen so far).  I had a little trouble threading the cylinder, it fits but it butts up against the grill so you need to apply a little pressure to get it to fit.  It started quickly with a couple pushes of the starter.  It's a bit difficult to tell it's actually burning, you don't see a flame (or at least I couldn't).  I cooked for about an hour on one cylinder (it's still not empty).  It heated up fast, and cooked very well.  Cleanup isn't a problem with a wire brush.  I plan to upgrade to a larger tank so using it's more economical.
B000WOTUCI First I would like to get to the 16.4 ounce propane issue. The Weber site and the manual clearly state that 16.4 ounce cansisters are fine. This seems to be contrary to people posting on the web reviews from years past. My guess is that if it was ever an issue it has now been addressed, which is good news since 16.4 ounce canisters are much easier to find. Mine arrived last week and it is no problem at all using 16.4 ounces. No modifications necessary it fits right in, right off the bat.As for the performance of this grill. Outstanding. The big difference I can see from other grills I have had in the past is a very heavy cast iron cooking grate, and the good construction of the lid. The grate conducts heat well and evenly. You end up getting a good sear, fairly fast cooking, and an even cooking surface. I have had excellent results. Assembly was easy, it took a couple minutes to put the handle on, attach the cover to the unit, and put the heat knob on.The grate does, however, lead to the unit being pretty heavy. It may or may not be an issue for you as a potential buyer, but I did want to point that out. Also, of course, there is not a huge cooking surface. However rectangular cooking surfaces you get more out of than a circular surface. For a family of 2 to 4 it should be fine. And it cooks fast enough that you can cook in waves and the first wave should still be hot.Lastly Weber gives you lots of verstility with this model. You can add the side trays later if you want. You can add a rolling cart. You can add a converter to use 20 lb propane tanks. Is it worth more than other grills? It does have a 5 year warranty which was impressive and it does produce excellent results. For me, after having it, the answer is a clear yes, it was worth the money. Recommended.Update 6/21/10. Having now used this for around 2 months I recommend it even more. I really like the taste of charcoal however this the results from the Q are extremely close taste-wise, sometimes better. Right now my family is just me and my wife. If I am not having people over, charcoal is a lot of work if I am just grilling for me and my wife. I get consistently great results from the Q 100 with much l
B000WOTUCI Although I have a full-size grill, a portable table-top grill is handy to have when cooking for just 2 people at home, or for taking along on an outing. I had been using a cheapo portable grill that was on its last legs (literally), so I was very happy to get this as a gift. What a difference!I'm very pleased with this both in terms of performance as well as construction quality. It heats very evenly -- I've yet to find a cold spot on the grill even when it's packed full. The construction quality is as you would expect from a Weber -- beefy grates, strong handles, and solid body construction. I expect this will last for quite a few years.Attaching the propane cannister is very easy, and lighting it is a snap. Although I'm only using it with a portable propane cannister, it has the ability to be hooked up to a large size tank.There are other models in the Weber Q line that provide additional features, such as foldable work trays for the side. This model is the least expensive, and I think it provides the best value. Still, any of the Q models should be on your short list if you're looking for a portable gas grill. Pricy, but the performance and construction justifies the cost. Highly recommend.
B000WOTUCI I live in an apartment, so this thing is perfect. After use, I just put it in the Patio cabinet. We take it with us when we go kayaking so that we can cook by the beach.  Wonderful product because of its durability and versatility.
B000WOTUCI Love it , perfect size. love the grill grates they are high quality , heats up fast cooks great. I tried a 16oz green propane tank , fit and worked great... I also got the 20 lb. propane cable too. All works great. Easy to to put together just a handle and a couple of screws so setup is easy and quick.
B000WOTUCI Last year when I bought this grill, over 100 people had written  4 plus star reviews. So I took their advice and bought this grill, you can see those reviews if you look for Baby Q.A year later I still love cooking on the Q. I cook for three plus leftovers. The heavy grate is fantastic, all the other grills had thin,flimsy grates. I love grilling with the Q, I can cook dinner in 15-20 minutes.I hooked mine up to a 5 lb propane tank. The five lb tank is the smallest tank you can buy, I can cook for a month on it.This grill starts out hot for 6 months, then to get it to grill hot with a propane tank... turn tank on slowly, over ten seconds, and then light grill at the end of two minutes.Lots of people use tanks with this grill.Weber does not like it, but the support women will talk you through set up if you ask nice. The weber hot line is veryhelpful with cooking suggestions, I had a temp problem they helped me resolve, but buy the book.Get a stop watch,a basting brush, tongs,grill brush and read the Webber grilling book. This makes a huge difference in the quality of your cooking, I mean it, follow a few directions to get sucess everytime. The weber book is worth is for the grilling time charts.Leaving charcoal behind took me way too long... this is superior.Support from Weber is wonderful....So buy this grill and have fun cooking this summer.Another  year later I am still in love with my grill. The heavy cast iron grate is what makes ths grill superior to other, cheaper grills. My friends bought the cheaper ones, the food sticks, and burns on.You must clean the grate when the grill is hot, after cooking, it takes about one minutes of scarping with the grill brush. My friends with the cheap grills never want to grill, their grills are dirty and a pain to clean. My grill is always ready to go.
B000WOTUCI Nothing cooks like a cast iron grill and you generally have to pay BIG $$ to get one. This little grill has a great one! It can be VERY hot but practice and \"lid open, lid closed compromise\" you get professional results. Yes, remember to turn on the tank for 10 minutes (not the burner, the TANK) when you switch tanks or if you shut tank off after use (chicken!)
B000WOTUCI Easy to clean!  Fun to use!  I swear even the food tastes better!  Very happy with this grill!
B000WOTUCI With a large propane tank adapter attachment and a table, this grill is an excellent replacement for a real grill.  It has ample surface area to cook for about 2 people, and provides a very high quality heat for grilling anything I've tried.  It stays lit even in strong wind, and has a wide range of temperature settings.  The grate is a very solid and heavy which provides perfect heat distribution and easy cleaning.  Often just a rub of the spatula will get it clean.  Its built-in igniter works flawlessly.I highly recommend this grill or one of its relatives in the Q series from Weber.  After owning it for several years, I've had nothing but good experiences with it.
B000WOTUCI Best grill i've had for camping or for home.I'm not really into writing the product reviews so adding this filler to satisfy the required number of works.
B000WOTUCI I've had my Weber Q-100 for almost two years now and I love it!  I moved into an apartment building a few years ago and I had to get rid of my large gas BBQ grill (also a Weber). However, I missed being able to grill at a moments notice.  Then I saw the Weber Q-100 at a store that sells mostly to RV owners.  They had several others on sale but the store manager said that the Weber was the only one to consider.  I bought one and immediately fell in love with it.  It works great with fish, steaks, chicken, veggies, you name it!  The grill is sturdy and well made. I've never had any problem with the electric starter as some have mentioned.  A couple of thoughts:* Use aluminum foil on the inside, or else it is a bear to clean* Use the foil tray in the drip pan for the same reason (I bought replacements at a hardware store that carries this grill)* Keep the burner ring free from grease or it won't light all of the way around* It does seem to go through gas quickly so either use an adapter for a large tank or have plenty of spare cannisters around in case you run out in the middle of a mealI keep it on the front porch where it hardly takes up any space.  I let the neighbors in my building use it as well.  We all love our little Weber!UPDATE 8/14/08:  Well... apparently keeping it on the front porch was not the best idea in the long run.  Although it was safe for two years someone recently decided that they deserved to own the grill more than I do and stole it late one night.  Still, I liked my weber so much that I decided to replace it with it's bigger brother, the Weber Q200.  You can see my review of it by using the link below.Weber 396002 Q 200 Gas GrillWeber 6508 Stationary Cart for Weber Q GrillsWeber 6552 Premium Grill Cover for Weber Q, Q 200, and Q 220 Grills
B000WOVZ26 I ordered the Q320 after exhaustive research and reading comments from owners, both at Amazon, HD, Lowe's etc.  Like others, I have had my share of the cheaper grills,  ones that rusted out, and frustrated us beyond believe at times.  The Webber  box showed up, weighing in at 84+ lbs.  One thing for sure, this thing is packed to prevent any damage; I have ordered generators that were not packed nearly as well.  After unpacking, laying everything out, the job begins.  I have to say the Webber Assembly Info is really poor - to say the least!  Follow the pictures, there is little written instruction....and pay close attention.  It took me about an hour to assemble.  I fired it up and it was super in every way.  We had ordered the Worthington 20lb tank, and the Webber brushes, scrapper, tongs, etc.  I cannot express my satisfaction enough to Webber for such a great product.  This will be the last grill I will ever need....thank you Webber.
B000WOVZ26 I have wanted to replace this for years, but just never really been unhappy enough to do it. It works well enough for what I do. But I've never really been happy with it.So the two faults that would make me switch are:1. Cleaning. A conventional gas grill has gratings above 'flavor bars' which are really burner guards to stop the burners getting blocked up with crud. These don't, they have slots in much of the surface and none where the burners are. So when crud gets baked on to the surface you can't really get to it to clean it, even a wire brush has trouble cleaning those parts, though I can get the slots clean easily it is a pain to scrape the carbon out of those shallow slots. Even scrubbing it with a wire grill brush doesn't get it clean.2. Lack of control. I can't have one side hotter and the other side cooler. Both burners cover the whole width. The larger burner goes all round the outside and heats everything. So you can sort of heat the middle and leave the outer edges cool, but that is limiting.So now I can get something different and recycle this one.If you disagree then write your own review. If you want to post comments to that effect then save your breath.
B000WOVZ26 I seem to purchase a new grill every two years at Sears, but they tend to rust out. I use covers, but we use them year round and I think the New England winters are hard on them. That being said, everyone said \"Buy a Weber if you want it to last\". I spent a day looking at Weber grills at various stores. I didn't want to spend a tremendous amount since my last grill was $800 and the \"stainless\" steel components rusted terribly after one season.The salesperson at a local high end grill store explained to me that my Sears grill more than likely was made overseas of poor quality metal, but that the Weber grills were made in the US of high quality metal. However, the cheapest Weber they had was a $750 Weber Genesis. I went to the local hardware store and saw a Weber Spirit for a much cheaper price, and was told the same thing by the salesperson that \"all Weber Grills are made in the US\". I then saw the label on the Weber Spirit that said \"Made in China\". This led me to call Weber, and they said their Genisis and Q lines are made in the US but the Spirit is made in China. I hadn't seen the Q, but fortunately Amazon and the helpful reviews led me to this grill.It is a wonderful grill and has aluminum and plastic parts that should avoid the rust issue. The light is terrific. It looks very attractive and I think more so than the Genesis. It has a large surface area which is more than adequate for my family of 5. It does take some getting used to as it is a VERY HOT grill, so I am cooking on low. I warmed it up two nights ago in a snow storm at 20 degrees outside, and within ten minutes the grill temperature was at 600 degrees. I think that is pretty impressive. I couldn't be happier.
B000WOVZ26 I looked at propane grills for some time locally. My last grill was (is) a Weber - a charcoal model and it still works well but I was ready to opt for more convenience. Weber quality is \"alive and well\" in the new model Q320.  I have multiple areas in my yard that serve well as a likely grilling site so I opted for the \"portable\" model.  Really it is a bit heavy to take too far and the handles used to lift the un-wheeled end of the unit are short (not much leverage) so it isn't amazingly easy to roll too far.  And, despite the aluminum cast lid, it is a bit heavy but I'm not complaining - you can't have sturdy and light in the same model.  It works really well, heats evenly and looks really nice.  I considered the Q300 but the Q320 has a larger grill surface than the Q300 and the handle light which I have found very useful and convenient - it turns off when the lid is down so it is hands free -- which is a good thing when trying to juggle all the grilling necessities. Assembly was not too difficult - took about an hour by myself following the pictures in the assembly manual. The grill surface is really substantial and leaves perfect grill marks on whatever you are grilling. A nice grill.
B000WOVZ26 It was very simple to build. I had no problems. Just make sure to spare time to building it. After using the grill a couple of times, it was very easy and simple to clean the grills with Easy Off (bought at the store).
B000WOVZ26 I really like this grill.I used to use a gigantic, heavy metal grill that I bought from Home Depot a few years back. Seemed like I was always buying a new grill every 2-3 years and at $150-$250 a piece I've probably spent $800-1000 on grills. Each grill had the same demise. Rust. Even when I bought the recommended covers the grill itself would last but the bottom where the cover didn't cover would rust. Wheels would fall off, the metal uprights would start to lose their integrity and the grill was unsteady. My last grill actually had the side burner fall off, and the heating of the grill wasn't right, all the heat was in the back right with little to none in the front or left side. So I decided the cheap grills were not working. I had already bought replacement parts for my grill and tried to fix it with new burners, flavorizer bars, propane tubing and it still wasn't heating evenly and the base was still covered in rust.I started looking for a new grill and I already own theWeber 2820 Smokey Mountain Cooker/Smokerand know Weber brands well. I like the fact that Weber is an American company and grills are made here in America. Given those two items (brand strength and made in America) I don't mind spending a few extra dollars on an item. And from Amazon if something was wrong with it I have free returns, no taxes and free shipping (2nd day for prime or standard free saver)Plus when I was researching looking for negative reviews, I really couldn't find any. All the reviews I found were positive with the exception of one item on the grill and that's that base made out of plastic. But at the same time that negative was turned into positives saying how it won't rust like other grills and the design is extremely steady once assembled. So even the negative reviews seemed positive.I'm a member of Amazon Prime so I opted for the overnight for $4 and to get a 125lb item overnight for that is a bargain! Placed the order on Wednesday, was grilling on Thursday! I also ordered the cover from amazonWeber 6553 Premium Cover, Fits Weber Q-300 Grilland ordered that 2nd day air (free on amazon prime) but it showed up the same day as the grill and this did come by UPS.Other customers have reported the grill arrived and the box was beat up, I saw UPS as the shipper on those comments but my Grill actually came via Fedex and the box was in perfect condition. I didn't see any dents or holes in the box. When I opened it I was happy to see the way they packaged the grill. Lots of cardboard buffers and plastic. I took a picture of some of it and will post it.I will add that when I was taking everything out of the box I was overwhelmed with parts. There was a LOT to put together at first glance. But then when I looked for the screws I found that there were only 16. It took me about 45 minutes to completely assemble the grill. Let me say that there were 2 items that could easily have been missed in the boxes if I wasn't careful. One was the grates, now they are the heaviest part of the grill but were at the bottom of the box in their own thin cardboard container. If you picked the box up to throw it away you would know there was something there but it was easy to overlook at first. Second, the bar that holds the wheels, it was in another box but under the packing material and I almost missed it. Everything else was easy to spot, and included with the grill, no missing parts.So how did the grill perform? Overall really nicely. So well in fact that night I started to dismantle my old grill so that I could start throwing it away each week piece by piece until its gone. I really like the grill. The light that comes with the 320 model is fantastic. One reviewer said it was to close to the grill lid, I didn't find that to be the case at all. In fact I had plenty of room so I don't imagine there will be any issues with the light getting in the way of me trying to open the grill.As for heating, it's very important for a grill to heat evenly and this Q 320 is perfect. It will take some getting used to for the zone's as all grills I've owned previously have used 4 heating zones and this only has 2, 1 down the middle and 1 around the edges. But then again most the other grills I've owned haven't worked well at all so I'm looking forward to a new design, perhaps this will be better.What about cleanup? It's a breeze. Crank the heat up and let it \"self-clean.\" And don't forget to remove the grease pan from underneath to empty it out! I love that Weber makes it so easy to get to, and unlike my old grill it's a reasonable size. My old grill the pan was HUGE, took up the entire base of the grill, weber using small aluminum pans you can buy almost anywhere to dispose of them or you could clean them and reuse them.Overall I am so far very impressed with this grill. Weber has done a great job in the design of this. It does LOOK smaller then my old monster, but the grilling surface is identical. The only difference is instead of a massive hood this one is about half the height. But how often do I grill entire turkeys? Never. I grill burgers, hot dogs and even veggies in theWeber Style 6434 Professional-Grade Vegetable Basketand I even tested that and it fits perfectly on this grill. If you have more room under the grill your simply using more propane, not necessary.
B000WOVZ26 We had a traditional Weber grill, super heavy-duty but no frills and it was great. But I replaced the burners, flavorizer bars, and grills every few years. The ignition had broken many years ago, the thermometer just blew out, it was ready for retirement (and recycling thanks to a local pick-up service!)So my husband (who is not the grill king in our house...) and I went looking for a new model. There were plenty of fancy stainless steel, triple burner, side grill, super duper manly models. All came with a big price tag, a large footprint, and way too many parts to break. So this was the model we decided on.It arrived from Amazon in a large box, not too heavy and nicely packed. It assembled in just over half an hour (but I had interruptions from kids and phone calls.)The grill is easy to move and sits nicely on our small side deck landing. It is not the thick, super heavy grill body that made up our old Weber so I would think that it may rust through easier but time will tell.The electric ignition is so convenient and is much smoother and easier to use than our old one (when it worked!). There is a light on the handle so that when you open the lid, it shines down on your grill. The grill parts are closer together and have some areas filled it so that you are less likely to drop food in between the grill bars. It heats up evenly and has a 'O' shaped burner and a center line burner with two easy turn controls.The only problem is that to turn off the propane tank at the valve, as recommended by Weber and the practice in our house, you have to reach around the front screen which is awkward. It is designed to hide the tank but it makes it more difficult to reach.The side tables are heavy duty plastic (our old one was wood, which didn't hold up over time) and have hooks for hanging tools and grill cleaners. They also fold down if you don't have enough space for one or both to stay up.Food cooks nicely and evenly and comes off the grill pretty easy, no leaving big chunks behind.
B000WOVZ26 I've been using a Weber charcoal grill for over 20 years, and though I think charcoal and wood are the best ways to grill, they're not very convenient, especially when you want to go out and quickly grill a couple of steaks or fish fillets. It takes at least 30-40 minutes to start the fire and preheat the grill. I decided I needed a gas grill.What I really wanted was aWeber 3741001 Genesis E-310 Propane Gas Grill, Black. I've cooked on them, and they're the absolute gold standard for backyard grills as far as I'm concerned. At the same time, $650 was a bit over my budget. I thought about theWeber 4411001 Spirit E-210 Propane Grill, Black, and then I saw this grill for around $50 less. I'd seen the smaller Q grills at home stores and they looked to be of pretty decent quality... so I ordered a Q320, and the optional cover.The grill assembled pretty quickly, despite all the parts. I was a bit concerned that so much of it is plastic, but then plastic doesn't rust, and we get a lot of snow and rain in Michigan. Plastic parts might break, but then, Weber's been around for a long time, and I'm pretty sure spare parts will be available for the reasonable future. If I keep the cover on it should last. I'm also just a little concerned about the disposable aluminum drip pan- it's an odd size, which pretty much locks you into the Weber replacements, but they're not very expensive, and should be available for a long time. If not, you could probably make something out of heavy-duty aluminum foil that would work in a pinch.The photos make it appear as if the Q320 has an enclosed lower section, which it doesn't. There's a flexible plastic sheet that hides the Propane tank from view, but there's nothing structural about it. If that's a concern, the Spirit 220, which has a steel enclosure under the grill,  might be a better choice. I'm already half tempted to remove the sheet, roll it up, and put it in the basement.The burner design on the 320 is a little different from most grills. There are two burners, but one runs around the outer perimeter, and one runs down the middle of the grill. Normally, both are used to heat the entire surface of the grill, but the outer burner alone can be used for indirect grilling- very handy for doing a chicken or turkey, or maybe even smoking. (The manual doesn't say anything about smoking but I suspect you could do it.) Another nice touch is the front mounted thermometer, attached with stainless steel hardware.So far I've roasted a half dozen peppers, and I was impressed with how easy the grill lit, and how fast it heated up. The construction- cast aluminum, stainless steel and plastic, for the most part- means it should be rust free for a long time. I'll try to update this review in six month or a year, but so far I'm pretty happy with my purchase.UPDATE: It's been almost a year, and I'm still very happy with the grill. Last night I grilled marinated shrimp and potatoes for two; a few weeks ago I grilled hamburgers for 30. The grill was able to handles all these jobs with no problems.Update 2: It's now been in regular use for over three years, with no problems, and it still looks like new.
B000WOVZ26 I purchased this grill locally to avoid any issues. None so far. Hardware store offered free assembly so I took advantage of this. I am so tired of cheap units that rust and disintegrate after 3 years. This is a much better grill which should last for a while. It fired right up and took no time to reach cooking temp. You have to keep a close eye on the clock not to overdue the food. I did order the grease pan inserts and lined with foil to make cleanup a little easier.I do not think I will be disappointed this time.  Update; Aug 5th. Now having used this grill for a period of time this has been the perfect solution to all grilling issues. I ordered from Amazon the plastic propane scale and secured it with cable ties to the tank rack. I cut a small opening in the wind rack for the button display and now all I have to do is take cover off and push a button to see the display of propane that is left  in the tank. After purchasing all the cheap grills over the years, I realize I should have purchased this gem earlier. Gee, all the money and frustration.
B000WU5GGQ I have purchased this item before, and it worked so well we are setting up our entire yard with this product as it really looks and feels like quality and with the name Rain Bird it is the real deal!
B000WU5GGQ This 1/2\" tubing is the back bone of a drip irrigation system, and it gets the job done. Rainbird tubing is relatively thinwalled, black, with two green stripes. Other than indicating twists, I don't know what the stripes do.I just laid out a system covering all of my 1/4\"-acre suburban plot. This product is rated at a total capacity of 240gph per run. Considering that the highest output 1/4\" fitting (that I know of) burns 16gph, This is more than enough. I laid out three runs, watering various sizes of shrubs, climbers, roses, a mature maple, 5 'teenage' maples, the lawn itself, and ... my air conditioner! All told, I used 400' feet of 1/2\" line. It goes faster than you think, even with careful planning. This line can be purchased in 500' lengths for ~$42. If you're putting in a comprehensive system, I'd recommend it. You'll need some for add-ons and maintenance.I strongly advise wearing gloves when working with this line. I used slip fitting from Orbit and Rainbird for tees and couplings. They work great and none are leaking, but you need an excellent grip on the tubing to press in the fittings. Also, puncturing the line for the 1/4's fittings and assembling the runs can be hard on the fingertips.My only complaint with this product is that it kinks. Easily. And, like a drinking straw, once kinked, the material is kinked forever. Once unwound, it lies flat easily (of course, i was working with it on a 105 day!), but you must take care when unspooling it. If going around a corner and you need a tight radius, put in an elbow. When pressing this line on to fitting, be wary of collapses.I haven't buried or covered my lines yet, so I secured them with wire. All of the brands offer some means of doing so, and all are pricey, considering how many tie-downs you may need on long runs. One reviewer suggested 1 every 3' ... that's overkill. In an assortment of parts from Rainbird, I got a 10-pk of heavy-gauge galvanized 'wickets', and those worked great, even in the parched earth of drought-stricken Oklahoma. But they retail for 70 EACH! That adds up. My solution? Buy a roll of galvanized wire, and make my own for a nickel apiece.In sum, great product. It's available at Lowe's for ~$14. If they drop it, I can always get more here.It interface easily with garden hoses and PVC. You're only limited by your imagination! My plants are happier, my life is simplified, I should have tackled this years ago!
B000WU5GGQ Five stars because I achieved my objective without some concerns I had based on some reviews I read subsequent to my purchase of this product. Some reviews stated that, &#34;The Dripline was very rigid and would no remain easily in place&#34;. However, my experience thus far was different. I cut the length I needed and placed it under some strain. It fitted perfectly with no major concerns.
B000WU5GGQ Super easy to use.  Best results when you let it sit in the sun to get warmed up - makes it much more pliable and easy to get on barbed fittings.
B000WU5GGQ I purchased the 500'Rain Bird T63-500 1/2-Inch Blank Tubing 500-Feetversion of this so I'm adding my two cents to this item as well because I found it a mistake to have purchased it in the first place. I would suggest if you're not familiar with this brand to check out my review because when installing a drip or micro-spray system it's important to be able to connect to a water system and purchasing the wrong \" fittings is easy to do with this hose.
B000WYOOQ0 This igniter is a direct replacement for the original one, which was still working but the 'gas catcher' part was rusting away.  I replaced it just as a preventative measure.  One thing though -- check your local stores and see if they offer this part.  Sometimes you can find parts for around the same price locally and you don't have to pay shipping.  But if you're already ordering other things from Amazon anyway, pick this part up too for the good price and free shipping.
B000WYOOQ0 Once I replaced the initial igniter in the grill, the grill sparked up on the first attempt. It worked like it was a brand new grill. This was a fast and inexpensive improvement to make and well worth it!
B000WYOOQ0 It's this kind of stuff that keeps Weber fans singing their praises: replacement parts are easy to find and install. This fit a 2003 Genesis Silver B perfectly. Weber fan for life.
B000WYOOQ0 This part fit perfectly on my Weber Genesis Siver-B.  The instructions provided were easy to follow and the installation was simple.  I did some research and found no better price anywhere.
B000WYOOQ0 5 minutes and a Phillips screwdriver was all I needed to install this igniter on my 2002 Weber Genesis Silver B gas grill.  The replacement is really snap-together simple, with the screwdriver only needed for removing the faceplate from the grill so that the old igniter could be accessed.My only complaint was that one of the two plastic tabs that holds the igniter in place broke off.  This was due in part to my own clumsiness, but the tabs did seem rather flimsy compared to those of the old igniter.  But learn from my mistake: I thought the tabs needed to be stretched out a little in order to hold the igniter in place.  Instead, all I really needed to do was put the igniter in place and turn it slightly.  Once turned, the tabs will hold the igniter securely.
B000WZ4KO0 I started out with mouse cubes, but got tired of having to empty them twice a day - I caught 54 mice in 2 weeks in my basement! I thought this trap would be perfect as it could hold more than one mouse - up to 20 the description says! I was excited. In theory, it sounds terrific.In practice, I've had this trap for a week and have caught exactly one mouse, one time in it. I continued to catch mice in the single mouse cubes every day however, so I know I am not out of mice. I think there are several reasons for this. I think mice prefer plastic to metal (which is probably a bit cool and unappealing on my basement floor). Also, mice tend to scout around maybe 1-3 at a time but they fan out. They are also not completely stupid and tend to notice if they buddy is suddenly distressed and &#34;stuck&#34; in the big metal trap, so they probably avoid it because face it, this isn't the Poseidon  Adventure and mice lack the same morals that humans have which might compel them to try to save the fallen.  I don't hate this trap, but I found the mouse cubes much more effective. If you have a really active mouse route and don't intend to check your traps twice a day, this might be better for you. The mouse cubes need to be checked at least twice a day to prevent mice from suffocating in the trap. It's inconvenient, but if you opt to live trap your mice, then I did find the mouse cubes much more effective.
B000WZ4KO0 I have always been interested in methods for trapping and removing rodents from chicken coops and goat sheds.My search led me to these 421CL Multiple Catch Mouse trap units... with the clear view lucite window on top.I normally just set the old fashioned Victor Mouse Traps... peanut butter (they can lick that off without springing the trap) tootsie rolls -best bait for the old &#34;snap&#34; style traps.  BUT, when you have chicken coops, the ol snap trap can't be placed on the floor as the chickens, guineas or even nosey cats would possibly just snap the trap and that's not good.LIVE CATCH has it's merrit... I've had the little darker plastic live catch traps (with one entrance) those have honestly worked, but are often just avoided or the mice walk right back out in some unseen clever way.  These units are larger (so the chickens can't move them around so easily) and they effectively keep what they catch inside.  I like that I can see them at a glance to know what is or is not in the trap.I baited them with regular chicken feed... this may or may not have been the attraction.  I also placed them so the entry holes are along a wall where mice would likely travel anyway.  After catching mice in them, I left that mouse scent in the trap so other mice would probably follow the scent of others out of curiosity.I was thrilled to find mice in all three of the Eaton traps after just one night of winter warmup.  Having mouse droppings in the chicken feed and on the drinkers (or worse in drinking water), is profoundly unhealthy and the mice must be removed.For those who can't stand the idea of snapping a mouse do death, these are handy... also very nice for field studies which would allow for examination of the unharmed specimens/species in your area.You have the option of relocating the captives elsewhere, or even using them to feed rehabilitating raptors and other meat eating wildlife that are recovering in shelters.Easy to place, easy to open (even with winter gloves on) and well constructed for years of dependable service.  You could also place them in gardens, though you may want something larger as it's been my experience that gardens attract larger vermin.So, when having something that snaps, kills or can hurt fingers if inadvertently tripped is not something you want to deal with, these are designed for YOU.  The enclosure also prevents cats, dogs and other opportunists from munching on a dead or trapped animal.I would definitely recommend them to my friends and fellow poultry enthusiasts.
B000WZ4KO0 This item was awesome.  I had my first mouse in 3 hours.  The second one a day later.  It worked perfectly.I'm not sure why people had issues with it working, maybe they got a defective one?  If you buy one, make sure you put the peanut butter INSIDE the trap.  I put it on the other side of the entry tunnel, so they can smell it through the air holes (maybe even lick it a little bit!) but so they had to completely enter the trap to eat it.  Maybe some are putting the food at the end of the tunnel, but not inside?  That was my initial thought until I thought about it for a second.  In fact, it was reading the reviews about the mouse eating and leaving that made me want to put it completely inside to ensure leaving wasn't an option.I've attached a picture.  The bonus with this product is that it also serves as cat entertainment.  I figured since they were the ones alerting me to the mouse problem in the first place, they should enjoy the capture.  (I released the mice in a field, maybe 5 miles away.  I didn't give my cats free reign!)I will say, the only thing that didn't make me happy...there are these holes on the bottom.  That means that mouse pee will leak out.  Yeah.  So the whole point of this trap is to keep the mice alive and presumably, release them into the wild.  You have to release them a few miles away so they don't find their way back.  That means you have to transport them there somehow.  (See where this is going?)  Be careful and put this in a plastic bag first.  It didn't occur to me that there would be holes in the bottom but luckily I put the trap in an Amazon box (what else?!).  The box luckily absorbed the pee without any leaking onto my car mat, but still.
B000WZ4KO0 These are almost identical to the much more expensive TinCat multi-catch traps.  Haven't caught the varmint yet, but one thing I suspect may reduce catch effectiveness is the see-through top.  Mice are more likely to enter a dark \"burrow like\" area and so covering the top of the trap I'm hoping, will increase catch rate.
B000WZ4KO0 I previously rated Kness Tip Trap, so there is more info there.  This trap looks good, easy to set up, etc.  However, the other style caught mice and this one did not.  This one is well made and should have worked.
B000WZCSTO Excellent shovel for the price. I purchased a cheap one for winter car use.  It isn't wise to save money and get cheap; broke 1st time, now I have spent more getting another.  Well made little shovel and reasonable price for the quality.  Highly recommend if you want a small shovel.
B000WZCSTO I came across this Gerber shovel in my Amazon recommendations recently.  I own the very same model that I bought at the LL Bean store in Freeport, Maine 2 years ago.  I was not as much of an Amazon shopper back then as I am today.  But I wish now that I was.  I paid $32 at LL Beans for this model, and that was 2 years ago.  At the time I remember them not having much of a selection, but this shovel seemed very well made, rugged, and easy to use.  I figured I could do a lot worse for the price.  As it turns out, I could have done a lot better. Forgetting the shellacking I took on the price of this shovel, I highly recommend you not only buy this model if you are in the market for one, but I also suggest you forget the shopping around and just buy it here.  This is probably the best quality folding shovel you will ever find for the price they are asking.  Especially, if you buy it as part of a package deal and get the free shipping thrown in.  If you are one that has ever visited hiking or outdoor gear stores than you know how expensive any survival type equipment can be.  They have a fool proof way of drawing you into spending as many bucks as you can on whatever it is they are offering by hammering home the point that it's your life and family you are talking about here.  The real truth is that a lot of people buy equipment that is far more expensive than they will ever have a reason to need, or even use at all.  As anyone that is an avid outdoor enthusiast knows, a folding camp shovel has lots of uses along on a camping or hiking trip.  Digging, prospecting, hammering, climbing, self defense, and even sometimes actual shoveling are all included on the list. Most folding shovels offered in retail outlets are not just expensive, but often time just too big.  This one folds down very compactly, and can be easily toted along with little room taken, or inconvenience met.  This Gerber model is in my opinion the perfect size and quality that most of us would ever have a reason to need along on a wilderness adventure.  Its solid, very rugged, a snap to extend and compact, and after two years of owning it, it is still going strong for me with little show for the wear.  I highly recommend the Gerber for your outdoor needs.  It is in my opinion all the shovel you should ever need, at the best price you will find...
B000WZCSTO Handy mini-shovel for camping and backpacking.  Very good quality for a great price.  The back of the shovel also has a flat spot for pounding stakes.  Comes in a handy bag.  Would definitely purchase again.
B000WZCSTO This is a great and useful pack shovel and I've been really happy with it.  It packs down extremely small and comes with a nice, heavy bag with drawstring and cord lock.  You could easily stow this thing under the seat of your car or truck.  The folded dimension is approx. 4.75\" wide X 8\" long.  Unfolded, it becomes 15.75\" long, so it really is a small tool and the handle gives you limited leverage.  It is heavy for its size and is well made.  Though the handle is plastic, it seems durable enough.  The blade is stout and is not likely to deform from use.  (anything is possible, of course!)The blade is not sharpened, but I prefer this anyway; the edge of the blade can easily take an edge from a large metal file, grinder, or grinding wheel, if that's your preference, but I find it just dulls too quickly anyway and makes it unnecessarily dangerous.  The dimensions of the blade itself are about 4.75\" X 6\".  It is tapered to a nice point, is slightly cupped, and has a folded-over edge at the top in case you wanted to give it some oomph with the heel of a boot.  It has a hammer function for use on tent stakes and such and is actually capable of performing that task without distorting or otherwise breaking the tool, unlike some other camp shovels I've used in the past.  This one is heavy and well-made.That said, this is an excellent and useful tool for car camping, camping with larger groups (where you have more backs to carry heavy little goodies like this), and for winter or desert duty with your vehicle where you may find a small shovel useful.  (It's small enough to leave under the seat and forget it until you really need it, versus forgetting to take a larger shovel that you wouldn't otherwise carry all the time)  When I'm backpacking, however, this baby is way too heavy.  Instead, I take along a much smaller, lighter plastic trowel for sanitary duties.
B000WZCSTO This little (VERY LITTLE!)is well made and comes with nice carrying case.  To me it is a bit TOO small to be really useful for anything but a camping/backpack tool where MINIMAL digging/trenching would be needed, but it is lightweight.Would NOT recommend for a emergency kit or vehicle emergency kit, you will a larger shovel to dig out from snow or mud or anything more than very minor digging.
B000WZCSTO This item was something I was anxious to get. But after receiving it I was a little disappointed.  Extremely small...smaller than expected.  the first time I used it, the handle jammed and when I tried to extend it the couple inches that it does extend, it was stuck. I dont like this item at all and would not recommend it. Go to the nearest hardware store and buy a small camping shovel. Does much better at 5 bucks or so.
B000X0170O This campfire ring is perfect for placing in the backyard or even bringing with you on a camping trip.I have thus far used it in the backyard, to contain a bonfire that we had one weekend several weeks back. It makes the fire that much more lovely with the horses seemingly jumping in and out of the flames.It's easy to assemble / put away at the end of the day.Is it a necessity to starting your campfire? Certainly not, but it sure makes things prettier and more welcoming!This goes without saying, but please be careful handling after the fire has been burning inside the ring.
B000X0170O I bought this in November 2010 and have used it for dozens of fires since.  It has rusted in some spots but i just take a wire brush and clean it off and repaint with krylon high heat paint.
B000X0170O This fire ring comes in a box in four pieces( the quarters of the steel ring) and a small bage of parts ( nuts and bolts for attaching the ring quarters) and two semi-useful little wrenches. If you have ever put together Ikea furniture than you will be fine at putting this together, takes less than ten minutes. I would recommend wearing a pair of gardening loves as the nuts and bolts are a bit greasy. I had a slight case of mechanics hands afterward.It's been continuously rainy this month so I haven't gotten to have a fire yet, the wood is kept outside and is still wet. I'm a bit worried how the black matte finish will hold up down in a fire so I'm thinking of building the fire ring up with a few courses of block and than having this as a decorative piece at the top so it's not getting licked directly by flame. The cut out horses are so nice it would be a shame to ruin them.
B000X0170O This is a really nice campfire ring! It's a beautiful edition to our yard, and now we're looking even more forward to making smores and telling stories around it with our boys. The horses add a bit of western flare to it. Although I wouldn't call our style \"western\", we still love it. I'd definitely recommend it for those who do like the western look, though.It comes in four pieces, so there is assembly required. It's super easy to put together, though! It's a bit bigger than I was expecting, and also a bit lighter than I was expecting, both of which were pleasant surprises. If you need to move it or take it with you when camping, the lightness and easy assembly are definite bonuses.Overall, this is a great campfire ring, and I definitely recommend it!
B000X0170O Nothing adds to the ambiance of an evening in the back yard than a fire and the CobraCo Horse Campfire Ring is a great way to showcase a small fire. Its three- foot diameter and its horse design around the ring make for a more stylish fire containment than other fire rings.This fire ring requires a small amount of assembly and it can be taken back apart. But the fact is, the ring is lightweight enough and small eno
B000X0170O This fire ring was a very pleasant surprise.  I had ordered this fire ring not quite believing that it could or would be as portable as it claimed to be in the product description.  However, when it arrived, I was very surprised to see that it did include everything needed minus the wood.So it went into our travel trailer and we schlepped it along with us this past weekend.Pros:+ 3-foot diameter fire ring is large enough to build a fire with several logs+ Horses are attractive in the firelight.+ Metal is heavyweight enough to feel sturdy but yet lightweight enough to tote along for travel.+ Hardware, instructions and 2 mini wrenches included in the box so this is truly a toss-in-the-camper product and is ready to go.Cons:- Would have liked a stout canvas tote bag to keep the pieces together when disassembled for transport. We are currently still putting everything back in the box to keep all the pieces together.- Would have liked a better wrench to be included in the kit.Recommended for those looking for a portable and attractive fire ring that is easy to aseemble and use.  Note that this is not a firepit. It is just a ring and does not have a bottom or a top.  Some places require an actual fire pit with bottom and some places require both a bottom and a top.
B000X0170O I was a bit worried that this ring would be cheap and flimsy due to the low price but it seems fairly rugged and has worked very well so far.  It ships in four pieces that you bolt together which is very convenient.  Great size for ~8 people to sit around.  I would suggest putting some rock around the base because the cutouts do allow some smaller sticks to fall out and catch drier grass on fire.
B000X0170O There's just something about a campfire.  It's better than TV.  A fire is a show that hasn't been written yet.  Whether you're with family & friends, or just sitting out by yourself, there's just something about a fire that feels great all the way through.  Plus you get to play with fire.My family has campfires in our back yard and out in the desert where we \"camp\" in our RV.  Most of the places where we camp already have rock fire rings, but when there aren't any rings already, it's a lot of work to go scrounge up enough rocks to make a ring.  A lot of people I know bring their own fire \"tubs\", which are the inner drum from old used washing machines.  They don't put out as much heat as a real ring, but they are simple and portable.  I like this ring better, because it actually sits on the ground like a real stone fire ring.As far as using this at home, it's kind of a mixed bag.  If you already have a portable fire pit, then you can add this ring as a decoration as a crown around the pit.  Otherwise, you really have to be careful where and how you use it.  You could literally throw it onto your lawn (if the grass is green), but it will leave a permanent scorched circle and pile of black ash that really never goes away.  If you're going to use it like that on your lawn, you need to commit to the location, because the damage lasts forever.As far as the quality and design goes, I was hoping this would be a solid one-piece ring, but I guess that's too much to ask for.  This comes in four pieces and you need to bolt on the hardware.  It's not as sturdy that way, so if you prop your feet up on it, you need to be careful not to push at all, because you'll bend the circle into an ellipse.All in all, I like this ring.  However, without any bottom, you are definitely limited to where you can use it.
B000X0170O I have a rudimentary fire pit right off my patio and enjoy a bonfire on cool evenings or when entertaining family and friends outdoors. I decided to order this because I thought it would be safer if my paver-lined dirt pit had sides to keep the tree branches and cut logs within. The ring works really well for that purpose, but make sure you understand that this is a ring and has no bottom so it will have to be erected or placed on top of some sort of fireproofed base. This was easy to assemble right out of the box - 4 curved black metal panels with 12 screws and nuts secured using the two wrench tools that were included in the package. The sides are about 9 inches high from the ground and the diameter is about one yard (36 inches) so keep that in mind when setting it up and laying the wood inside for the fire. I don't plan on disassembling it to take on any camping trips, but it seems that it wouldn't be too much of a hassle to do that if you wanted to pack it and haul it. The pieces fit inside each other. The metal pieces are painted black and seem sturdy, and look like they will resist rust.I'm sure I will enjoy this for years to come!
B000X0170O We love a good campfire in our household and really liked the fun horse look of this one.  Although dimensions were listed, it was much bigger than I thought it would be!  The four metal pieces are pretty easy to put together using the bolt and screws that are included (you do have to work a little bit to get some of them in due to trying to piece the metal together in a nice circle.  The metal is fairly bendy and not as sturdy as I would really like, but I think that is to be expected as this is advertised to be a good one to transport when camping (as in there may be better ones if you want to leave it at your home fire-pit).  I would recommend doing a smaller fire (not making it as big as the ring) to make sure the fire truly stays contained due to the holes around the horse decor.
B000X0170O Very easy to assemble, a great size for a fire ring.  While I plan on putting some flat stones in a circle around it and making it a permanent fixture in my yard, if you wanted to take it places, it'd be quite easy to do so.  In addition, I'll probably dig out a bit from the level surface a couple inches so I can have a bigger fires that don't go above the top rim of this.The design is also nice; I haven't rubbed my hands all over it (and don't plan to), but during assembly and movement, I didn't notice any jagged or nasty sharp edges.Would recommend - good quality and it keeps the fire contained well.
B000X0170O No way I would ever cart this with me on a camping trip.  Portable?  Carry it disassembled and assemble it at site?  That is a crazy idea:  Four foot-long panels with 12 nuts and 12mm bolts.  You'd need to carry a ratchet wrench also, because the tools provided are tiny and hard to work with.  I do better with rocks found at the site, and when I'm preparing a campsite, I have better things to do than screw together 12 nuts and bolts.  Bothering with something like this on a camping trip kind of defeats the purpose, doesn't it?Maybe there are camping locations that require a fire ring, but I'm not sure this would qualify as a ring that could contain a fire:  The sides are very low.  When you consider all the pierce-work, the sides are less than 6\" tall, and that is not tall enough to contain flame and sparks.This fire ring is made of fairly thin gauge metal, so it is flimsy.  Placed on its side, its own weight and gravity turns the 36\" circle into an oval.  A hefty falling log causes the ring to move and shift.I was hoping to use this in our yard to grill the way the Argentinians do, (check outSeven Fires: Grilling the Argentine Way (Hardcover)).  So I needed the metal to be strong enough to hold up a grill grate or a sheet of iron (kind of like an Argentinian chapa), but it definitely is not strong enough.  There is no reinforcing for the sides and even putting pressure on it with my hands causes it to bend and wobble.It is nice looking.  The horses look like horses.  It is stylish.  There is good coverage of the powder coating on the metal.  But that is all there is to say positive about this ring.  There is nothing else to it.  Why bother?  Natural flagstones are easy to find, less expensive, nice looking, and can be moved out of the way to remove ash.
B000X0170O This is a pretty cool item for your backyard. It sets up in just a few minutes. You just have to put in and tighten 12 nuts and bolts. The 4 connecting sides go together very well.  You can have this set up and using it with 5-10 minutes. Pieces seem to be good quality just wish they were a little more solid feeling. It's not like they will break just wish they had a little more metal in them. The fire ring works great and does a great job of containing the fire. I would place on a brick or rock base for best job.
B000X0170O I had been thinking about buying a campfire ring but also looked at building one. Then a couple weeks ago we went camping at a local state park and they had campfire rings; they are easy to use, easy to clean and cost a fraction of building (much less buying) a similar stone firering. So, when this came up for review I was thrilled; it's a great opportunity to try it out and see how it works in a home environment.Of course, it then went on to rain for several days straight so it took a bit of time before I could do a review. This ships in a surprisingly small box, easy of the pieces is easy to assemble with the supplied hardware. It literally takes a matter of minutes. You will need a proper place to position the fire ring which will take substantially more time than actually putting together the item. One the site is prepared, it's as simple as putting the ring down (we secured ours in sand and gravel), adding wood and viola...a great little fire ring that is ready to go whenever you want. I was a bit concerned over the large cut-outs but they are very pretty. Despite the attractiveness, I still found myself wishing there was a built-in screen or wire mesh like that found in other units. This isn't the most heavy duty fire ring and certainly doesn't compare to the commercial ones used at the park but is light weight, easy to handle and an affordable yet attractie design for home use or to pick-up and bring along thanks to the easy aseembly.
B000X0170O This is an unexpectedly nice fire ring! I am using it tonight around my front yard firepit (a scooped out dish in the ground, lined with limestone rocks).The design is not too 'cowboy kitch': the horses are stylized, and can mix it up with more than the bear-and-moose decor you often see around cabins.I like it for lighting a fire in my pit to watch as the sun sets over the red rocks. This is really pretty when flames are burning.It functions more for looks than as a windbreak, although it does help some with wind.SORT OF PORTABLEIt manages to be lightweight for a hunk of metal. It's easy to carry around, once assembled, and sturdy enough. It contains a fire nicely around a small to medium firepit. A large firepit, as in one containing wooden pallets, would be too big.Note that this fire ring is only somewhat portable. It does break down into four pieces that nest together, but you need to realize the pieces/bolts will be covered with soot (and possibly hot) and you need to use a tool to tighten and release the dirty (hot) screwbolts.With that in mind, you can still pick up the entire ring and toss it in the back of your pickup, which makes it 'portable'. It's not heavy or awkward to carry for a 5'4 woman like me.I can see cleaning it off and breaking it down at each season's end to store nicely in my RV for travel.There is no sack for the included bolts and tools (just a tiny ziplock), or for the four metal pieces that make the ring, so I will have to figure out some way to keep all the pieces together when disassembled in the RV basement. A canvas carry bag would have been a nice touch.NOT A FIREPITFor people who intend to set up the ring once and leave it alone, assemblage is a non-issue. Realize this is NOT a firepit. There is no top or bottom to the ring. If you set the metal on flammable materials, the fire will not be contained. Use your own best judgement with fire! :)
B000X0170O We spend allot of time in our back yard and get much use from fire pits and such. This one will require some work as I did not pay attention to the fact that you have to build a fairly sturdy rock base...you can't just sit it any old place on your deck or in your hard it has an open bottom.It's much bigger than I tought which is kind of good just beware of it large size.Some reviews said the horse art work is crude-I prefer to think it is rustic rigidly beautiful so I'm not bothered, it seems well built and fairly sturdy. They say it portable but I would not want to move it about too much not sure how it will hold up.We will purchase some rocks to sit it on and I'm sure we will get some good use out of it. Just know you probably can't buy it and get right to roasting hot dogs and marshmallows. It's nice but it would not make my top picks for family centered back yard fun-perhaps a semi-permanent camping spot would be best.
B000X0170O This is exactly what I needed.  I have a HUGE very nice firepit but it's often a pain to use because the folks down in the city look up here and then call the fire department thinking the mountain is on fire.  Sometimes I just want a tiny little stick fire.  I'm building a little walled fairy garden and this is just perfect.  It will contain a nice little occasional fire that won't alarm anyone.It was super easy to put together.  It's just a few pieces that come each in an arc.  They fit together well and it was a breeze putting the 3 bolts in each piece to secure it - and it is perfectly round.I put mine on a base of dirt with flat rocks I had from a deconstruction project, and a bag of play sand.If you wanted to use it to travel, The pieces stack and it would easily fit in the back of a trunk and takes only 10 minutes at most to put together.  They give you 2 little wrenches to tighten the bolts, and with two people it's super fast.The horses look like spirit horses to me.  That's one of the reasons I liked it so much.  They aren't nice, neat horses, there's a 'windy' quality to them.
B000X0170O This is a great fire ring. It comes unassembled in a surprisingly compact box which makes it easily portable. Assembly was a breeze, it was just a matter of connecting the four pieces of the ring together with a few bolts (included, of course). The metal panels have a decent weight to them 
B000X0170O Description: This RING is four quarter-circle shaped pieces of steel, with the horse pattern cut in them.  It has 12 nuts and bolts, so you use three at each joint to make it a circle.  Not high, no bottom, meant to sit on the ground at a place that's okay to put a fire directly on the ground.Best use - in my opinion: if you have a place in your own yard or camp property that you want to regularly use for *small* campfires, maybe to make smores.  I recommend smallish pieces of wood - the kind you can buy already cut and split, about six dollars buys enough for one small fire.  It's really too small for logs or brush.Portable: I suppose you could take it apart and take to other places, but I wouldn't and won't.  Most \"campsites\" already have a specific safe spot for fires.  Also, once you've used it, you've got black ashes over much of the inside of it, so you really need to clean it for travel.  Since the nuts and bolts get hot, they are likely to get difficult to unscrew (though to be fair, I haven't tried this).  Plus, if you use it different places, you end up with ash piles and \"scorched earth\" (so to speak) every place you use it - I say better to keep in one spot.For me: well, I assembled it (which was easy), noted that I can't use it on the deck, and took out to our \"fire pile\".  We regularly have fires for roasting hotdogs and marshmallows, or to sit by with friends and libations, or sometimes just to get rid of the amazing amount of weeds and downed branches we get here at home (we call it \"The Wild Acre\").  Well, the diameter of this horse fire ring is about half the diameter of our active burn area (outside which we have another two feet - kind of a safety buffer zone).So it's not going to work great for us, but that's not the product's fault.  It's fine for what it is - so you should make sure it IS what you want before you buy.  Because if it IS the right thing for you, it will work well, and it is attractive!
B000X0170O My daughter has been on us to build a fire pit for the past few summers. I hadn't heard of a fire ring before so this was the perfect answer to a portable, less permanent campfire area.It arrives in a flat packed box. Once opened, there are 4 curved panels, 12 nuts and bolts and a tool. It was easily put together, but not something I would want to do on a regular basis. For us, this wasn't portable for camping, but it works well enough in our back yard.We placed slate pieces in a large area and fitted them together as much as we could, placing the ring in the center. We found some wood and tested it out right away. It contained the fire and ashes as well as I hoped and the kids really enjoyed making smores in their own back yard.It has been outside for 3 weeks now and weathered some storms, rain, hail, frost and wind. It has stayed in place and the finish looks as good as new. My kids have kicked it on occasion, trying to poke at the fire and toast the marshmallows. The design is cute and it looks nicer than plain metal.We found this to be an excellent alternative to a fire pit, portable if need be and easily assembled.
B000X0170O It took me about 5 minutes to assemble the CobraCo Horse Campfire Ring - the company made it easy by providing two little wrench-like tools. Three nuts and bolts to connect each of the four sections.I placed the campfire ring inside a very large ring of large stones - this huge fire pit was born from burning several trees that I had to cut down around our property. The galloping horses look perfect in our fire pit, which is not far from our horse barn (recently converted to a sheep barn).We've had several large (very large) fires and the ring has retained it's color with no visible rusting after a few weeks. I like the fact that it keeps the wood within a comparably tight space so the fire burns much better.My family is looking forward to summertime when our fire pit and the CobraCo Horse Campfire Ring will get lots of use. We often setup and hang a Dutch Oven over our fires to cook up chili and the occasional pot of crabs or lobsters. This campfire ring will make that a more efficient task by keeping the wood from spreading out.You can certainly use this campfire ring without the stones around it like we have - that's just how ours was setup. It would be ideal in the backyard of any home just as it is: Place it on the ground and pile in the wood.I recommend the CobraCo Horse Campfire Ring.
B000X0170O In case you missed it, this is a campfire ring and not a fire pit. There are 4 sides that easily connect together with no bottom. Its actually pretty big, nice and tall and could fit a good sized fire.For camping this is a perfect way to contain your fire (its easy to put together and take apart once the ring cools down), and the horses are really cool. Sure they aren't perfect, but with the fire behind them they look great.Now lets talk about the backyard entertainment and Marshall roasting aspect. Obviously since there is no bottom you wouldn't want to place this on a wooden surface. Since we rent our house, we picked a spot in the yard and cut out the grass.Sod is pretty cheap so if and when we move its a easy fix. Then we got bricks to go on the dirt, enough to cover the inside of the ring plus about a foot around the perimeter.This looks great in the yard and adds a nice element to back yard entertainment. Since its not permanent it can easily be taken apart and put in my jeep for camping. Id recommend this product to anyone since it has many different uses.
B000X0170O It is very easy to put together. There are 4 panels, and each are connected with 3 bolts and nuts, for a total of 12. There are also 2 wrenches that come with it, either a spare or if you want to use both for tightening the bolts. It is a very nice size and very pretty. I really like the horses. It is a nice size and would work just as well as for a decorative planter as well as a fire ring.I have really been the fire ring at night. It well worth getting.
B000X0170O The first thing you need to know is that this is a fire 'ring' and not a fire 'pit'.  There's no bottom, so you can't use it on a deck, nor on anything you don't want scorched by a raging fire.We however, have quite a few areas around our property where we can use it.  And right now it's set on packed earth.  Later I plan to haul it down closer to the creek so we can sit out and toast marshmallows and hot dogs on sticks-- and possibly drive away a few mosquitoes.INSTALLATION was a breeze.  The four segments came wrapped in a box, along with 12 bolts and 12 nuts.  I took the pieces down to the our little natural area, stood the 4 curves pieces up and then nutted-and-bolted them finger tight.  Could not have been easier.Now some people might want a solid ring, but I definitely think the 4-piece arrangement is better.  For one thing, it will be easier to store during the winter.  And for another, we'll be able to disassemble it and carry it to campsites where I plan to use it to create a better fire/not fire boundary at the established sites.Nice rustic appearance.  If you are looking for a fire ring there are various artistic motifs to choose from.
B000X0170O It took less than 5 minutes to assemble this fire ring. I purchased some inexpensive cobblestone, dug down about 6 inches into the ground, put the cobblestone down, then put the ring on top.  TADA!  Now we have a gorgeous fire ring to enjoy all summer!
B000X0170O I was very pleased to see that the image of the fireplace was much nicer than that in the picture. The horses are not nearly as scrawny as they appear. Set up time was quick, less than 5 mins. with 4 sides needed 3 nuts and bolts, which are included. Material is nice thick steel, not able to bend easily. Comes in 4 separate pieces to make the circular shape. The ring sits nicely for a small backyard fire. The kids enjoyed their smores and I enjoyed the whole experience that this portable fireplace gives us.
B000X0170O This is a gorgeous campfire ring, and just perfect for what I wanted. I wanted something that would work on a hard-packed dirt area of my yard that was still portable enough to go on fishing and camping trips with my family.The ring breaks down into 4 sections that are about 30 inches long and 9 inches wide, each part is one quarter of the circle which is a nice arc shape for packing in the trunk of a car. They go together very easily to form a large 36 inch diameter ring. Even keeping the fire safely in the center and not too high, that's big enough for a decent sized campfire.After it's assembled it is strong and heavy enough to be fairly stable.It's very attractive, and the blackened steel horse pattern shows up very prettily against a fire.
B000X0170O As long as you know that it will suit your specific needs, I think this is a nice product. It's quite large in circumference, but low in height, so it's perfect for a low-burning fire you spread out so several people can stand or sit around it. Just be aware that it's only a ring with no bottom, so you need to have an area cleared for it on the ground. You can't use it on the grass, for example.They call it portable, and technically it is, but it's more practical for use on your own property. If you do plan to take it camping, it's best if you're going to stay in one place for awhile. Putting it together and taking it apart multiple times will get tedious. It's fairly easy to put together. Just be sure you have all the bolts in place all the way around before you start tightening the nuts. Otherwise it's hard to fit the later pieces together.The metal seems quite sturdy, but it has some sharp edges, so be careful if you have kids who want to help. Also keep in mind that everything's going to get sooty with use, so assembly will get messier over time.
B000X0170O The Cobraco Horse Campfire Ring is a great product. It is portable, light and easy to assemble. The horse motif which is cut out around the perimeter of the ring is very attractive and gives one the feeling of an old-time campfire in the wild west. We put ours in the side yard where we like to hang out during the summer months. While the ring is lightweight it is surprisingly sturdy. I was wondering if the brisk winds that came up would flip it over, but alas, it stayed in place and didn't budge.I highly recommend this campfire ring. It will be great all throughout the year. When I'm done using it (after it has cooled down) I can just take it apart and store it in the shed until the next time we want to roast marshmallows or have a yard party. I also plan on taking it with me when I go on road trips this summer. Be it to the beach, mountains, or the lake this campfire ring will be a perfect addition to my summer travels.
B000X0170O My son was so excited to get this for backyard marshmallow roasting and couldn't wait to try it out.I knew, from reading the description, that this unit didn't have a base, but I was a little shocked to get it in multiple pieces that needed assembly. And, while assembly isn't difficult, the resulting ring feel fairly flimsy and extremely lightweight (this would definitely blow away in the wind, easily) ... At least when taking into account it's supposed to safely contain something as potentially dangerous as fire. It also wasn't very stable and even, which is worrisome. (Metal slightly warped/out of alignment, making the bottom not level.) The metal top also bends under ANY weight, even a propped poker.Still, that all being said, we put it on a rock base, got a few logs and tried it out, and it did work, for the most part. The many cut-outs that go almost to the bottom of the ring, seem like an odd choice (again, given fire) and we had quite a few sparks and even some flaming kindling pop out of them, making me, as a mom, kind of nervous. Not to mention that while this is a very wide ring, the sides are quite short, even ignoring the cutouts, so your fire has to be absolutely tiny to be \"contained\" by this ring, meaning to roast, say, marshmallows, you have to stand about a 1/4\" from the (hot) sides of the metal ring in order to reach the fire that's either way in the middle or else much, much too big for the ring to contain.My main complaint is that, if we dug a small hole--even just 6-8\" down--and lined that with rocks and sand, it's be a much more protective fire pit than this is. There might be scenario in which this is a better solution, but, for backyard use, I just can't imagine what it might be.Also, in terms of portability, even after our one use, this isn't something I'd want to be hauling/carrying around as it got quite sooty and dirty. Can't imagine packing this up in an RV, or anywhere else, where you'd have to handle it regularly. You're far better off finding 8-12 large rocks at a campsite and using those. You'll actually get more protection that way than from this ring.
B000X0170O This lovely rustic fire ring is perfect for those wonderful summer evenings when you want to sit in front of a nice cozy fire and enjoy the feeling you get as the flames lull you into an almost hypnotic state of relaxation. At a little over 13 pounds, the CobraCo Horse Campfire ring can either be a nice permanent fixture in your yard or camp area, or it can be easily transported to the beach, campground, etc., so that you can set up a quick but safe ring in just minutes. No more concerns about rocks \"exploding\" or a piece of wood rolling out of the ring. Standing at about 9\" tall and 36\" in diameter, most wood will safely be contained with no problem.The CobraCo FRHORS369 Horse Campfire Ring comes in 4 pieces with 12 bolts, 12 nuts (mine had 13 each) and 2 small wrenches. It goes together quickly and easily, and it's easy to break down. When broken down, it doesn't take much room to transport or store when not in use.The only thing that would make this ring better would be some method to attach it to the ground.
B000X0170O This campfire ring works well. It is heavy enough that it holds up well and stays in place, but yet easy to assemble and take apart and transport.We go to a beach that allows small fires on the sand and this is perfect. I have always worried about logs rolling off and into someone sitting near. This solves that problem since it contains the fire in one place and the ashes too, for easy clean up once everything has cooled.At home we laid some paving stones in a square down by our picnic table and this is nice for atmosphere and warmth and better still it is more fun for the grandkids and us to roast marshmallows over and make s'mores. We do not have to all stand around a grill; we can sit and have some old fashioned fun and campfire stories too.
B000X7XQA6 These are not the strongest traps I use, theJT Eaton 409BULK Jawz Plastic Mouse Trap, For Solid or Liquid Bait (Pack of 24)are probably the best, but these work just fine.  I keep un-baited Jawz along the outside of my garage to catch mice running by.  It is amazing how many get caught that way, and un-baited they don't attract birds.  I have never caught any un-baited in these traps, but plenty with a little peanut butter.  These don't work well for liquid bait as there is nothing to hold the liquid, but work great with peanut butter, which actually gives the best results for us.
B000X7XQA6 This product gives me nightmares. Unlike the mostly successful Rat trap from Tomcat, this trap does not kill the mice but maims them instead. Whereas the rat snap trap would have an occasional rat that would get caught in with a paw instead of the entire body, this trap doesn't actually have enough power to kill the mouse. This means that you will have to do the job yourself if you catch a mouse in the trap. To add to that, the mouse in the trap will be bloody, in pain, and in a lot of shock from possibly being stuck in the trap for hours.This is just not worth it. Stay away!
B000X7XQA6 We have a problem at my house - no, it isn't the mouse, it is my husband. He sets the traps, and 9 times out of 10 manages to trap his fingers when he is trying to set the trap! His poor fingers.We actually started using these a couple of years ago when mice first appeared in our home (gasp). They are as easy to use as a clothespin - you open and put the peanut butter on the yellow tab, then clip it open as you set it down. It is just as easy to empty, pressing the ends to drop the mouse into the dustbin, meaning you don't have to buy new ones.If you struggle with setting mouse traps, I recommend these.
B000X7XQA6 Grateful for this solution with this Tomcat 100-33505-3 2-Count Mouse Snap TrapCategory: Pest Control itemNot having to touch a  mouse is a bonus to me!This is simple, easy to use and a must have in case you spot a mouse!
B000X7XQA6 Unlike some traps, these are very easy to set. You squeeze them like a clothespin and they lock in the open position. You really need something sticky like peanut butter to bait these with, as there is only a small spot to place bait, but something like cheese or fruit probably won't stay in place.I don't know if it's the traps or theMotomco Mouse Attractant Gelbait that I used, but I have caught no mice with this trap even though I've seen evidence that they've been around.Based on my examination of the trap, I am not too impressed with the build quality. I would be leery that these traps are strong enough to actually kill the mice.I will keep trying these, and will update if I have any new information.
B000X7XQA6 I've had this set next to my vehicle for the past several nights.  The bait hasn't been taken, but no mouse caught yet.  I see the droppings, so I know he exists.  I've seen him out of the corner of my eye.  This appears to be an easy to use and set mousetrap, but I've not had success yet.  I will update if/when we catch the mouse.
B000X7XQA6 Either we have a smart mouse or none of our traps are any good. I've seen the mouse in our kitchen and my husband saw him in the den. There are mouse droppings in the pantry. Ick! So I was happy to get a couple of these traps to evaluate and review.First thing I did was snap my finger while trying to set one. It didn't draw blood so I got over the shock of it pretty quickly. We baited the traps with a combination of mouse attractant (which has worked for me before) and peanut butter. Ten days have gone by and we have not caught the mouse.In fairness, our other traps have not caught him either. I have live traps (mouse cubes) set up along walls in three rooms, a couple of plastic traps of a different model, and a couple of old-fashioned wooden traps. They are set with various popular types of bait. None have caught this mouse.I am not at all impressed with this trap.
B000X7XQA6 We live in a wooded area and always have 2-3 traps in the garage and 2 or 3 more in our storage shed.  We find that most traps break after 2-3-4 uses.  These don't, they seem to last and last.  They are easy to bait, safe to use and not too expensive.  Very sturdy traps, these do what they are made to do.Summary:  while not the most famous name in rodent control (Victor) these appear as good, last a long time and are relatively inexpensive.
B000X7XQA6 This is a set of 2 plastic spring-loaded mouse traps. To set one of these traps, you simply press down and backwards on the back of the lid and the trap opens. While holding the back of the lid down, place your bait on the bait plate. Then place the trap where you think your mouse might find it. Sit back and wait. Quite soon, you'll probably hear the trap snap shut, killing your pesky mouse instantly. To empty the trap, simply press down on the back again and the dead mouse will fall out--no need to touch either the mouse or the plastic teeth of the trap.I set up a TomCat trap in a hallway where I know mouse like to frequent. Within 12 hours, I had a dead mouse in the trap. I emptied the trap, then set it up again, this time right beside an Intruder Better Mouse Trap, which I've always found to work well, and a Jawz black plastic slamming bar mouse trap. The next morning, both the TomCat and the Intruder traps had dead mice, so the TomCat trap appears to work at least as well as the Intruder trap, and mice seem to prefer it to the Jawz. I like the easy action of the TomCat trap for loading and unloading. I really like the bright yellow bait plate inside the trap because it makes it easy to see at a glance whether you've got company in there--if you see the yellow bait plate, the trap is empty, but if you don't, then the trap is closed and needs some attention. Overall, this is a clean, fast and effective way to deal with nuisance mice. In my opinion, it's also more humane than a glue trap (where the mice have to wait in glue for you to bonk them over the head with a hammer), or a live trap (where the mice either starve to death or get transported to some unfamiliar territory already patrolled by other mice). Incidentally, my bait of choice is sunflower seeds glued down with peanut butter--mice love it!
B000X7XQA6 Seems like it either works and the mouse dies quickly, or it doesn't go off at all, so at least the mouse isn't suffering for hours.
B000X7XQA6 This thing is quite strong and should definitely do the trick. Just squeeze down on the lever to set the trap, put in your bait then carefully set it down. This style of trap comes closest in function and effectiveness as those old wooden spring loaded traps we've all seen and know. However, this one feels more sanitary since it would cover more of whatever it's caught and shield it from view. Haven't caught anything with it yet, but my sense is it will work as good as the old fashioned kind.
B000X7XQA6 Pros and cons:1. If baited correctly, these do work. It took a lot of trial and error until we learned to make a peanut butter and bread paste and press it firmly into the bait area of the trap. Why does this work? The mouse has to tug on the bait to get it out. This does set off the trap.2. But there was a HUGE problem for us, even if we caught any mice. Much of the time the traps did not instantly kill mice! This meant that we'd hear the gruesome sound of a poor mouse, unable to get out of the trap, and probably suffering a great deal. Most recently, a mouse was caught behind its head and somehow managed to keep breathing for the better part of a day. We discovered this after first seeing the mouse in the trap and assuming it was dead. We were in a hurry and decided to throw it out in a few hours. To our horror, the mouse was actually alive in a few hours! It hadn't managed to get out of the trap but it was definitely caught and unable to free itself. We had to put it out of its misery before disposing of it and I never want to go through that again!3. In our first time using the trap, a mouse was firmly caught by one leg and part of its body. Like the other mouse, it tried to free itself. After two instances of having traps catch mice but not instantly kill them...well, this was more than we could stand. We don't want to live with mice but we want them to die as quickly as possible.I do want to caution people against buying live trapsHavahart 1020 Two-Door 10-by-3-by-3-Inch Cage Trap for Mice and Rats. Yes, these catch mice while alive. But if you don't put the mouse in a car or truck (still in the trap) and drive far enough away, you'll have those same mice returning to your home, spreading germs and potentially serious diseases (you can do a search for those diseases online). Another trap that was a pain to use? The NooskiNooski Mouse Trap, New Design Reusable Ring Trap, Safe, Clean, Easy. Unless you are willing to deal with the frustration of trying to get a strong rubber band in place, this trap is more trouble than it is worth. If you check it out, you'll see a video that makes it look simple to use. It is not! It has one advantage: it can't hurt children and pets.I haven't found the ideal mouse trap yet. The older, wooden ones have the same issue as the Tomcat one: they catch mice but don't always snap over the mice heads, killing them instantly. Maybe there is NO trap that is 100% effective, even when it catches a mouse. Suggestions, anyone?
B000X7XQA6 I love to garden especially my flower gardens.  What i do not like are the chipmunks that get in and dig and destroy certain plants!  This trap works like a charm in getting them.  These little critters, though may be cute, are real trouble makers!  Glad this trap works on them!
B000X7XQA6 Well, I can't give this product a super negative rating because it did catch two mice. It is easy to reuse, bait and empty... but both of the mice were still alive and I had to have my husband take care of them so they wouldn't suffer more. I am not sure what would be much more humane, as I've had this problem with other mouse traps that snap shut. Thankfully, since catching the two we haven't had anymore sightings, but I don't think I'd be using these again anyway.
B000X7XQA6 This is a simple, but great idea for a mousetrap; it makes you wonder why this isn't the most common type trap on the market.  It works in exactly the same way, but is much easier to set: you can set it one-handed and without misfires.  Also, you can just pick it up, dump the remains, and reset.
B000X7XQA6 Of all the Tomcat products, this one has to be the worst. If it works at all, it tortures the poor mouse victim.  If you're a sadist into torturing little animals, this is for you.  If you're a decent person, get something that's more humane to take care of any rodent problem.
B000X7XQA6 These work so well and are especially easy to empty and reuse. They are my favorite traps for mice. Put some peanut butter or cheese inside and then just set the trap--you can do it with one hand it's so easy. They are inexpensive comparatively when you realize that they are reusable and that you don't have to get anywhere near touching the dead rodent. Simply squeeze it and it releases the critter. Even children can use these without fear of being injured. They work well and kill every time.
B000X7XQA6 I've had these out for several weeks and they've been licked clean once and then left alone for about a week after re-baiting them with peanut butter. I really liked how easy these were to set, but they don't seem very easy to trigger. I put these in the barn along with 3 other traps (the 3 way victors) and caught 4 mice in those. I like them because they are designed to be reusable, but so far that hasn't been necessary.
B000X7XQA6 We live in a rural setting and mice are an issue this time of year. However, we have not been very successful ridding ourselves of these rodents. I was excited to try this product, as I hate setting traditional traps. These traps are very easy to set, however we have yet to catch any mice in them.
B000X7XQA6 This trap is fairly light weight and the snap seems quite strong. However, no mouse caught (only ants found) yet even after using peanut butter as bait for a couple of nights.
B000X7XQA6 Our shop is bounded by acres of pasture on one side and woods on the other. As we have homes for rescue dogs under the same roof, the field mice consider the shop to be their own Eden: fresh water, lots of (dog) food, and many places to hide. Unfortunately they are also destructive and their bad potty manners have caused damage to metal cabinetry and tools. I'd happily put a bowl of food outside for them if they'd stay outside, but they don't, and so they must be thwarted.We've used a lot of mouse traps over the years and these are working quite well. They are easy to bait and set (well out of the reach of our canine guests) and so far effective. They feel safe to bait, something I never felt with the old-timey wire on a piece of wood traps.If you have a similar problem, or just one or two who've ventured into your home, I think these will work well for you.
B000X7XQA6 I really like the Motomco Tomcat Rat Snap Trap version . . . powerful, easy to set, and well-designed for a reliable catch/kill.  I looked forward to good results from this Tomcat Mouse Snap Trap, and in fact had a ready test subject targeted, as my daughter had been reporting a mouse intruder in her 100 year old Victorian home with dungeon like basement.  I told her to hold off on deploying her old wood traps so I could  try out these just-received Tomcat Mouse Snap Traps.This mouse version of the trap was indeed, like the rat version, easy to set.  Just push on the heel of the lid, and it pivots and locks open.  That was where the good times ended.First problem was stolen bait.  I didn't have any of the recommended \"Tomcat Mouse Attractant Gel\" in my possession, so I tried pressing on a little glob of trusty sharp cheddar.  Problem is there's really nothing to press the bait onto but an essentially smooth plastic bait/trip platform.  I suspected the bait might get stolen.  It was.  And the second try also.  By this time, I was sure the mouse would be back for try number three, as this trap was just essentially functioning as a feeding station.This third try, I fashioned a paper clip to slip over the edge of the bait/trip platform and help hold the bait in place.  It worked.  A successful capture this time, but . . . .It didn't kill the mouse.  I was left with the task of having to put a trembling badly injured mouse out of its suffering.  I felt as sorry for the little guy as I would have a suffering dog or cat, and felt terrible for having put it in this state of injury.  I have trapped many mice over the years with the old-fashioned wooden Victor type traps.  Nine out of ten times (or more) they produced an instant kill.  That's what I'm looking for.I give the Tomcat Mouse Snap Trap a star for being easy to set with no pinched fingers, and they are indeed not likely to injure your children or pets.  But I consider these traps unacceptably inhumane and will not use these Tomcat mouse traps again.
B000X7XQA6 After using the old wooden mouse traps for years, I discovered they just don't seem to work as well as they used to and mice would often lick the traps clean.  So, I began buying different traps to experiment and see if I could find a better trap.  The TOMCAT REUSABLE MOUSETRAP was one of the traps I tried.  The traps say that they offer a \"clean to-touch disposal\" whose \"patented design is guaranteed effective\".  I should have contacted the company about that guarantee because these traps do not work at all. I tried using these traps for a week. Each morning I would awaken to find the traps still set, but licked clean of the peanut butter and cheese. After trying to catch mice for a week using TOMCAT REUSABLE MOUSE TRAPS I gave up and threw the traps away. Even though the wooden traps aren't as reliable as they used to be, they at least caught a mouse eventually. These traps are a waste of money. DO NOT buy.
B000X9DZQ4 Great looking base, but does not fit Q100 grill. Fits all of the others, but not the 100 model. Stupid! I will probably end up rigging a base platform for the Q100 to sit on, maybe out of cement backerboard. It is good looking, and does a nice job of hiding the propane tank. Some of the nuts weren't machine right resulting in a trip to the hardware store.
B000X9DZQ4 this stand holds my weber 200 grill and i put it together rather quickly.  was cooking for the gang and it was a bang.
B000X9DZQ4 A little complicated at first in putting it together but it is a quality product.  It goes well with my new Weber 220Q.It's easy to maneuver but you have to remember to grab the handle to the cart not to the grill.I like it a lot because it is easy to reach the turn on knob to 20 lb tank of propane.It was delivered on time and secured in it's packaging.  Thank you.
B000X9DZQ4 This grill stand is fairly easy to put together, although it does take two people. The stand is very well constructed. Once the bolts are in place, it is one sturdy unit. The Weber grill fits right into the stand. One thing I wish it would have is some sort of clamp or strap to hold the grill in. I say this because it is quite easy to grab the grill handle and not the stand handle when moving the cart. The height of the cart is just right. The propane tank sits securely on the grate at the bottom. There is a plate on the bottle grate that sort of locks the tank in place, I like that.This cart comes with the hose for the using a full size grill propane tank. I have read in some reviews that there has been problems with the hose and the LP rate. So far I have had no problems. There seems to be sufficient LP delivered to the burner. I am happy with this purchase to go along with my new Weber grill.
B000X9DZQ4 I really like the Weber Q series of grills and now that I am on my second one, a Q200 (my Q100 was stolen) I decided to get a cart for my new, larger grill.  Weber makes two carts for it, the 6507 Rolling Cart and this item, the 6508 Stationary Cart.  The reason one is called \"stationary\" and the other \"rolling\" is because the 6507 folds up and includes a strap so that one can use it as a caddy for transport.  Since it folds you can put it in the trunk of your car.  If the folding feature is not important to you, they both function the same as far as moving them around when the 6507 is fully upright.  The 6508 Stationary Cart includes a hose adapter for the 20 lb. LP tank and the other does not.  It also seems better built and includes a screen that blocks the tank from view.The cart was fairly easy to assemble, even though I hate to put things together.  It took me about 30 minutes and I only used one or two bad words.  I would have spent more money for a cart that had more metal and less plastic, but it is what it is.  It still seems well built and sturdy enough.When you fold out the shelves on the 200 or 220 this portable BBQ pit transforms into a really nice, small, full featured gas grill.  I find it easy to move around I think that this is a good compromise for someone who wants both a portable grill and standard-type one.Weber 6507 Rolling Cart
B000XSF3YM I am not the strongest fellow in the world -- to be sure -- and so I had to scrap my plan to strap a chainsaw to the end of a broom stick to trim my trees.This little guy is light weight, strong, and can be used to either saw off larger limbs or chop off smaller limbs. The rope-mechanism for pulling the chopper works really well.
B000XSF3YM This is good for trimming branches up high.  It is light enough in weight that anyone can easily use it.
B000XSF3YM I bought this from Home Depot.  At first I was skeptical and didn't really think it would work.  I had myself all prepared to try it, put it back in the box, and take it back.Much to my surprise, the product did exactly what it claimed.  Pruning back branches with this gizmo is a cinch; it takes very little effort.  The saw blade is also amazing.  I was able to cut 4-inch diameter branches at the base with ease.Some people have mentioned the black handle falls off easily.  Yes, this true...but so what?  You don't even need the handle.  Just wrap the rope around your hand and pull.  This is a lot easier because you don't have to keep wasting time adjusting the handle.  Only caution is to wear gloves because that rope rubbing against your hands can lead to blisters.One other caution: don't go crazy with this tool.  I spent a good hour pruning a big cedar tree and I could barely move my neck the next day.  Take lots of breaks and spread the work over time.  Your neck will be grateful.
B000XSF3YM I scarfed up this tool while browsing through an estate sale.  It had already seen a fair amount of use, but the saw-type blade was still sharp.  Two years later and we're still using it on the many, many trees on our lawns.  It continues to work well.  It is sure the safer way to go--no trying to balance and then climb ladders to cut limbs for us!When I saw this tree pruner in the garage at that estate sale, I knew I wouldn't be taking a chance buying it.  Fiskars makes great products and we've been Fiskars Fans for many, many years!
B000XSF3YM With the house next door being vacant for 4+ years and no one to take care of the yard, the giant oak in the front yard has continued to grow to the point where its limbs were touching the eaves of my house (second story) as well as the roof.  Since the limbs needing trimming were at least 12' up, I knew I couldn't rely on my existing tools to trim them back.  After a short search, I came across this 14' pole saw.  Priced well below many other offerings, I decided to give this item a try.  I'm really glad I did.I received the pole saw very quickly, and it was in a very large package.  Not really intending to start a major job, I decided to test it on one of the lower limbs.  I was surprised at how easily the power level pruner cut through one of the tough oak branches.  Excited by the ease of use of my new tool, I decided to take a moment and study the best approach for trimming the multitude of branches jutting toward my house.After coming up with a plan to minimize the cuts, I started with a bigger 4\" branch.  The pole saw quickly and cleanly cut through this branch.  Used the correct way, gravity causes the branch to fall in a way that does not bind the saw.  When the branch was dangling, I made a few quick passes at the bark holding it on and it fell free to the ground.  I was amazed at how easy it was to remove this large branch.After quickly cutting through some smaller branches and trimming some odds and ends with the pruner, I had all the trimming done.  Unfortunately, I was also left with a very large pile of debris to clean up.  In all, it took 15 minutes of cutting and 2 hours of cleanup to finish this daunting task.After trimming this tree, I moved to the other side of the house where a wild cherry tree had started to reach toward the roof line.  The pruner made quick work of removing the 1\" branches.I was greatly impressed by the efficiency of this tool.  In less than one afternoon I was able to complete all of my trimming tasks.  This saved me a bundle versus getting a tree-trimming service to do the work.As for the tool, it does feel somewhat heavy, but it is sturdy.  At its fullest extension, it is somewhat wobbly on smaller branches but feels solid on larger jobs.  The pastic piece on the rope fell off shortly after I used it, and I never bothered to thread it back on.  Other than that, the tool has held up remarkably well and looks as if it has been barely used.  Since there isn't that much to trim in my yard, I will probably just keep this on standby until next Spring.  Great tool.
B000XSF3YM I read quite a few reviews about this product and really scrutinized the negative reviews. I found the product to be the complete opposite of what those writing the negative reviews documented.First, the pole is fiberglass, a 7' expandable pole to 14'. I didn't find it flimsy at all, actually, I found it to be quite firm as I was expecting more play from what I read. This isn't flimpsy, but this also isn't an aluminum pole. Actually, you want it to have some flexability as it made it easier to work the saw. I cut for two days straight and had no issues. I was at the maximum extension most of the time with no problems.Durability was found to be fantastic. I dropped the saw several times, the blade was caught in falling branches and I never once had an issue. Actually, when cutting a huge branch, the branch didn't cut though fully and pinched the cutting blade. It had the blade bend so far that I thought it might snap, but surely retain a bend in it, but to my surprise, the blade returned to form with no indication of any issues.Rope: Pulled just fine with minimal give. I would like to see some sort of guides to hold the rope when your not using it, like a fishing rod to keep the rope out of the way, but the rope was more than adequate. Even if the rope slipped off of the pulleys at the head of the unit, the cutter still engaged and the branch was cut.I cut some serious branches. At 14' plus most of my height, the brances don't look as big as they are. I was very shocked as I dropped brances that were 5\" easy. The cutting could not be any easier. The blade cut though the wood with little effort and I was more tired from holding my arms up than I was from trying to execute a proper stroke.I strongly suggest this product. My yard looks great and I am happy with the purchase.
B000XSF3YM Being available at Amazon at a great price is only part of the advantage.  This is a LONG  tool, and would have been tricky to get home in a Corolla.  Amazon made it usual terrific to-the-door delivery.  The tool-user of the group took it in hand and proceeded to spruce the property, with a snickety-sharp blade that is a pleasure to use.  It is presently stored in a clothes closet, which is not ideal and not expected to be permanent, but that conveys what is possible.  No assembly was required.
B000XSF3YM The unit operates very easily, and does a great job getting the overhanging branches out of the way. It also has a detachable saw, when you just want to clip smaller branches high up. We have saved so much money doing this job ourselfs.Having these smaller branches professionally removed is very costly, and this device makes this task simple and saves $$$ too.
B000XSF3YM Until  got it right, I thought this Fiskars Power-Lever Tree Pruner was impossible for my weakling arms to handle.  Now that I've figured it out, it's not bad at all.  I've felled some pretty big branches.The saw blade is best either on or off.  Switching back and forth is not quick and easy.  It's screwed on with a wing nut, which gets stuck on me and requires the use of pliers.The saw blade is sharp and cuts quickly and easily.  I find it best to make the cut when I'm off to the side and not nearly underneath -- for safety's sake and also ease of use.The saw blade will get in the way when I'm trying to use the pruning feature.  If I were going to use it strictly as a pruner, I'd remove the saw.  Although its pruning blade cuts better than theFiskars 9234 62-Inch Pruning Stik, I like the Pruning Stik better.  The rope and pulley design of the Power-Lever Tree Pruner just doesn't do it for me.  I find it hard to use, especially when the branches are very tight.  The lever near the head gets stuck on the branches.  There just isn't room to pull.  I use this pruner when my Pruning Stik won't reach.  The telescoping pole is easy to adjust and set.Although it has some shortcomings, I do like this product.  For a woman with weaker than average arms, I'm cutting big branches off my oak tree without much effort.  That's saying a lot.
B000XSF3YM Works as I would expect. VERY sharp blade, and extends to a length that I need. Pruner is a plus.
B000XSF3YM I've read other reviews about the pole bending when trying to loop off a limb, having to be careful about cutting limbs directly overhead, etc., and while all the remarks were true, they all stem from improper use of the tool.  This is a great, mid-range, appropriately priced pruner that does exactly what it says it will do.  I've used it to loop off small limbs up to about 1 1/2 inch in diameter, and used the saw function to saw off limbs up to about 3 1/3 inches in diameter - all done with relative ease, and the tool performed almost perfectly.  The only two things I can find lacking in design, is the short pins that lock the blade in place (need to be a bit longer) and the way the rope handle engages the rope and refuses to easily let go (makes it difficult to adjust length while in use).  Short of those two minor imperfections, I find this to be an excellent tool, and IMHO, the only real problems you might run into would be caused by improper use,i.e., the pole bending when looping off a limb.  This is caused by trying to loop off a too darn big limb - use the saw!
B000XSF3YM I have had great luck with Fiskars products except for this pole saw which has been a disappointment. My main gripe is that when the saw is extended, the pole lock (which is a simple switch) does not hold the saw in position. As you begin to saw, the extensive pole starts to slip, making it impossible to get the saw to work. Aside from that, it has a very sharp blade and cuts really well. Of course this only works if you don't have the pole extended.
B000XSF3YM Received this as tree pruner as a Christmas gift and have used regularly over the past nine months, so feel that I know this tool very well now.We have about one acre of land in a subdivision, and two-thirds of that area is wooded (and a creek runs down through the woods). The wood line is full of old hardwood trees, new volunteers and tons of shrubbery -- so there's always a hefty amount of maintenance to be done.The first thing we did when Spring rolled around was to break out this tool and trim many of the low-hanging limbs to a level that would allow me to safely mow along the tree line again. Our 14 year old son was helping, and our first impression was WOW! the pruning saw blade is very, very sharp and easy to use. Without that saw our job would have taken weeks instead of a couple days!At the same time we noticed something that other reviewers have knocked this pruner for -- the telescoping handle tended to slip from time to time, always at the most inopportune time (like when the blade was 12 feet up in mid-slice of a limb). However, this was an easy problem for us to solve... we just trekked back to the tool box and found the right size socket wrench, then tightened the two bolts on the locking mechanism until the slipping stopped. Tightening involved a bit of trial & error work, we tightened them too much at the onset but got the tension just right within a couple of minutes.Sawing limbs with this thing is a fast and easy job; just make sure that you are sawing on as much of a horizontal plane as you can and it will go right on through like cutting butter. Do not recommend sawing with the blade in a vertical position, like when standing just under the limb, as this makes it both difficult and dangerous for you.Cutting smaller limbs with the pruner was just as easy too, and the leverage provided by rope & pulley system is amazing. Very little effort is needed as long as you have the limb properly perpendicularly lined up and as long as the limb is not too large for the shear.Had not problem with the nylon rope; yes, it has some stretch but the handle is made to slide along the rope and can be set wherever you need it to take up any slack. Good design and easy to use.Bottom line: One of nicest yard work related gifts I have received and it gets a lot of use. Recommended  if you are looking for a tree pruner like this one and have the patience to make a couple tweaks to it along the way.
B000XSF42S The Fiskars Composite Soil Scoop works great. It's well made. I'm pleased with it. I've used it in the garden, the greenhouse, and now I'm using it as a dog-food scoop, not all at the same time, of course!Notice the way it's designed, so you can scoop the material out and move it without spilling as much.This is a good, well-made, economical soil scoop. I recommend it.
B000XSF42S As it is not metal, I would not use it for digging. It works great for scooping loose dirt which I love but I had hoped I could use it for digging also.
B000XSF42S Fiskar's has offered many products that I have purchased and this # 7068 Composite Soil Scoop is another I am happy to have purchased.  It is a solid cylindrical shape to reach into the tilled soil to scoop out a perfect hole for a planting.  I plan to use mine differently as a birdseed scoop.  Each use is ok though, if you would like to dirty up this nice looking little scoop go ahead as it can be cleaned up with soap and water and it should look as good as new.  Another quality Fiskar's product.
B000XSF42S This dandy scoop fills a need for me that has nothing to do with gardening, although I can see that it would be great for filling small pots.  I was interested by another reviewer's comment that the scoop was smaller than expected and I've had a devil of a time finding something to scoop bird seed into a particular tube feeder without scattering it all over the place so I decided to give it a try.  This is perfect.  It is no bigger around than a standard sized soup can although the scoop part is somewhat taller.  Because of the rounded shape it holds a good amount of seed and deposits it into the tube of the feeder quite effectively.  I need several scoops to fill the feeder, but the seed goes reliably into the feeder and not all over the ground.One of my feeders is constructed so that I can use a canning funnel for filling, and another is bigger around so a regular scoop works fine, but this one has defied efficient filling.  Although I tried the bird store scoop that has a lever to open so the feed will funnel down the hollow handle into a narrow tube feeder, I found the larger sunflower seeds often created a log jam over the small opening and stopped the flow and even at best, the process was tedious and slow so I've been searching for a scoop that was smaller around than normal but had a decent capacity.  This one really fills the bill.All my plant containers are large enough that a bigger scoop is more useful, but this would be good for smaller pots for say, kitchen herbs, as it's only about 3.5\" across.  I can also see it would be handy to scoop and fill my small dog's dish with kibble from its storage bucket, so I may purchase a second one for that purpose.  The handle on this scoop, at 5.5\" is long enough for even a large gloved hand to hold and maneuver easily, and a slight depression in just the right spot to use as a thumb pad helps with leverage.  The whole thing is the same sturdy plastic and won't mind being left out in the weather, plus will rinse clean easily.Bottom line: This scoop's narrow mouth fills some unexpected needs really well, but if you want to fill large gardening containers you may want to look for something bigger.
B000XSF42S It is a handy little scoop.  I use it for scooping out chicken feed.  It is strong and can work for lots of things.
B000XSF42S I bought this to scoop Miracle-gro garden soil on garden. It can hold more soil than my trowel and it has become my new favorite tool.
B000XSF42S Not terribly big, but gives good accuracy when you are trying to pour out of it.  Pretty much a scoop that works like a scoop.
B000XSF42S This is another winner from  Fiskars. It is well made and comfortable to use. I do a lot of tinkering with the plants in my raised garden bed and this is one of the tools that makes my tasks much easier. It is a perfect size for my needs and when I need to move some soil around this scoop comes to the rescue. Very fine tool.
B000XSF42S I use it to fill my bird seed, thistle, and it works well without the seed spilling. Just what I wanted. It is plastic, so I don't think it would take hard use on hard soil.
B000XSF42S I use this all the time for scooping mulch, compost & dirt. It is sturdy and rust free but I'd like it better if the scoop part was wider / bigger.
B000XSF42S I have a fiskars hand shovel, but what I really wanted was a larger soil scoop with more capacity, this isn't it. It was smaller than I expected.  It's very well made, I do like this material for hand tools (lighter), and if you do not already have something to transfer soil for smaller job I recommend this scoop. I can transfer more soil with my hand shovel so this one hasn't seen much use at all.
B000XSF42S This is good ad sturdy however not as big as it looks on the photo, stilll I will give it a five as it does the job and comes in handy fr me,
B000XSF42S It'sturdy, the handle is comfortable and it holds a lot of soil or mulch. It made my gardening much easier.
B000XSF42S I use this scoop to remove soil from bagged soil, either to a mixing container or directly to a plant container.  It is perfectly suited to the task.
B000XSF42S This unassuming scooper is one of those rare tools that makes so many different tasks just a little bit easier, you'll ask yourself, &#34;Why didn't I get this sooner!?&#34;Potting/transplanting plants, spreading grass seed, filling a bird feeder - basically any task that requires scooping a small-grained material - is infinitely easier with this cheap little scoop.It's light, seems durable, has a hole for hanging... you can't go wrong. Buy one.
B000XSF42S Nice product to have. It's plastic but feels very durable. I recommend getting all Fiskars products since they have high quality and offer good value.
B000XSF42S I leave this scoop right in the compost barrel and have it handy when I need it most.  Never rusts and it is perfect.
B000XSF42S as with all the Fiskar tools I've bought, it's a good buy and I'd buy Fiskar again just because of the good products I've already gotten from them......
B000XSF42S This is great scoop for general gardening use such as making your own soil mixtures as I do. (I use homemade compost, vermiculite, peat moss and decomposed granite sand plus recycled potting soil, added Epson salt, iron and powdered sulfur to get right pH for specific plants. ) It is perfect sized for mixing up to about 3-5 gallons of soil mixture and pots of up to about 1 to 1.5 gal capacity.  For larger mixtures and large containers/pots a larger scoop is definitely better.  Something like an large cast aluminum scoop -- example:Winco 12 oz Aluminum Scoopthese come in several sizes 12 oz to 85 oz.  the 58 and 85 oz ones are truly MASSIVE!!!  I like the 24 oz for gardening use.This Fiskars scoop is well made and sturdy enough for all but very hard packed soil work.  Best of all, being a composite material I never have to worry about it ever rusting!  Yes, I do sometimes leave scoop in soil mix or forget and leave it out in work area area of garden & don't clean right away.Recommend highly for uses I have listed above.
B000XSF42S A very sturdy scoop.  I have had metal scoops corrode and plastic scoops crack, this one handles it all.  This is an excellent size for potting plants and I recommend it highly.  I only wish they would make a bigger size for larger tasks.
B000XSF42S Fiskars 7068 Composite Soil Scoop is part of their line of garden implements, made of lightweight plastic.  While plastic tools certainly aren't as tough as metal, in certain applications they can work almost as well, and you don't have to worry about corrosion.This round shaped scooper, works particularly well with loose soil, mulch, and gravel, and is able to hold a good amount of material.  The oversized handle is very sturdy, and provides a good grip, even when you are wearing gloves.  Because it is plastic, this tool is not ideal for digging in hard soil, and it will definitely crack, if too much force is applied, so resist the urge to do so.The price at Amazon is very good, but I got mine on sale at a garden shop for $1.50, so you might want to check locally for a better price.
B000XTH1GY I use this to wash cars.  So far so good.  Durable constriction and nice adjustability using the sliding pin.  Ive used Zip wax, Megs NXT wash, and other car washes and they all foam up nicely.  Add a few ounces of wash in the container with water so you dont spray away all your carwash so quickly.
B000XTH1GY This foamaster foaming gun is the best gun for a regular hose since it uses metal connections instead of plastic.  Prior to using each time make sure all connection are tight so it doesn't come loose during use.
B000XTH1GY I really like how its mixture adjustable. Really gives you good control on how you want to mix and how much foam. I use this to suds up cars and it works really well, with the right detergent of course. I wish it were cheaper, like everything else, of course. Sometimes it takes a minute for it to start picking up soap and mixing right, haven't figured out if there's a problem or just how its designed to pull it up not working well.
B000XTH1GY I think the only thing that could be better than this is to spend the 3x $$$ to get the foam cannon for the pressure washer.  This was MUCH cheaper than buying on the Auto detailing websites and the job it does is phenomenal!!  Used with Chemical Guys (CWS_101) Maxi Suds II Superior detergent, this makes a great combo!
B000XTH1GY I wouldn't rebuy this since my only use is for car cleaning. Even on the thickest ratio, car soap does spray out but it doesn't cling to the paint. I use it sometimes to pre-rinse the car if it's very dirty, but then always use buckets (one clean, one rinse) to actually clean the car. The quick disconnect is a nice feature though.
B000XTH1GY I bought this because of other reviews on Amazon, and I'm glad that I did. This gun was considerably cheaper than others, and does a very good job. It's a piece of cake to change the ratio, and appears to be durable.
B000XTH2FY Nice and heavy for a spray nozzle. Good grip but needed to be adjusted so water wasn't coming out when shut off, about a full turn but it was almost turned to take it off. For what I need too many spray patterns but very good for watering flowsers or small trees.
B000XTH2FY I usually go with another type of nozzle but could find exactly what I was looking for and I saw this one. It had good reviews so I went with the flow. It works great and has several different sprays which I love.  I think I will like it after continued use and will be perfect for my gardening needs. Prompt delivery and seems like a very good product that will last, well made.
B000XTH2FY This item does NOT &#34;hold up&#34;. .  .after several weeks, it starts leaking and some of the 'functions' do not work like when it was new. . . AND when you screw it on a metal hose end .. there is something in the 'composition' of the female end that permanently 'bonds' with the hose, making it impossible to unscrew! It is like a chemical reaction between the nozzle and the hose end that cements the two together !! NOW, I have to cut the end of the hose off, to change out the nozzle. . . UNACCEPTABLE !!
B000XTH2FY Great hose nozzle. Has a pistol grip and several different spray settings. from a full stream to just a mist. Comfortable to use.
B000XTH2FY Good features, light weight and easy to use. Easy to use and materials of good quality.  My elderly mom loves it.
B000XTH2FY I actually prefer another brand that I bought previously. I dont particulary like the spray patterns on this one and it leaks at the handle and hose connection. I am using the wsher it came with. I also do not particalrly like the feel of the handle. It is ok if all you want to use it for is washing a car, but using it on delicate plants is iffy.
B000XTH2FY This thing works great.  It has many different spray patterns, feels good in the hand, connects with a non-plastic connection, and doesn't leak.  What more can I say?
B000XTH2FY I have 2 of these nozzles, they work great!  Have lots of spray options and best of all they don't leak!
B000XTH2FY Gilmour guarantees their products so save the card.  The nozzle is good quality and has all the setting needed for gardening and normal use
B000XTH2FY i purchased this nozzle due to the reviews and it is pretty well made and I expect it to last for several years to come.  Very comfy grip and easy selection of patterns, would recommend it
B000XTH2FY This is what my son told me he wanted for his birthday.  I couldn't believe he had never had one with multiple spray patterns.  It was ridiculously expensive compared to similar models.  We all know \"free shipping\" means that expense already has been added to the price ... but he is my favorite son (only-lol).  He told me he loves it.  He told me what he uses each of the setting options for, except one, but he assured me he would find a plant or purpose for it sooner or later.  Since they are in NV, the watering season is longer than average, and I have every confidence he will.
B000XTI5Q4 Great hose, but not a 5 star. This hose still kinks, not like the original Flexogen Hose. Time will tell.
B000XTI5Q4 Without exaggeration, I can say this is the best hose I've owned! We always got whatever Home Depot carried--NeverKink, I believe. My husband calls it Ever-Kink because those hoses were CONSTANTLY kinking up on us. I ordered these based on the reviews and they're phenomenal. You can really tell the difference in quality just from looking at the two hoses (the NeverKink and this Gilmour). I haven't had it kink ONCE on me in a month or two of use. I tried it out in the 50 ft then ordered the 75 foot for another area. I use them for regular watering and also to hook up to my soaker hose, and both are great. They roll and unroll nicely, no holes so far, no kinks. You can just tell it's quality! Highly recommend.
B000XTI5Q4 hello,well, we will all learn that sometimes the latest lightweight product like the curly hoses just do not last very long.  the gilmour name has been associated with quality garden hoses for years and we still have one in our yard.  but, we needed to try one of those curly hoses for convenience.  it took three punctures from cracks in the thin wall curly hose to get us to go back to a light weight 1/2 inch hose for our yard watering needs.  the gilmour has super quality metal ends and if there happens to be a leak sometime down the line, everyone sells hose repair kits.  have you ever tried to find a hose repair kit for a curly hose? (shoe goo and sealing tape did the job until the next leak popped up)  this gilmour hose is lightweight and there is no need for a massive 5/8 or larger hose for our yard watering needs.  now this hose is quality and there was the super fast delivery, too.
B000XTI5Q4 So far... I have used this for a year now, & it holds very durable. I know it's probably too early yet but there is no kinks yet & I have this stored on ground ( not rolled up ). So it has been in bad weather elements... I recommend so far.
B000XTI5Q4 It tends to kink but it is lighter weight and easier to use than some of the other no kink, heavy, black hoses I have bought in the past.
B000XTI5Q4 Just love the Gilmore hoses they always deliver
B000XTMG8W I got suckered into buying a fancy plastic hose nozzle.  It sprayed water heavily out the sides the first time I tried it.  I even almost ruined my hose by trying to use tools and leverage in an effort tighten the plastic nozzle to the extreme.  Finally, I got this beautiful little brass nozzle.This is one of the best purchases I've made on Amazon.  The thing works great.  When it's shut off, you'd never know the water is still \"on.\"  Just beautiful - I love it.
B000XTMG8W I love these solid brass nozzle, very sturdy will last for a life time. I do recommend getting a shut of valve just before the nozzle so you can leave the nozzle on the setting you like and turn it of and on as much as you like.
B000XTMG8W I've tried many plastic nozzles each with a different set of sprays.  The reason I've had to \"try\" so many of them is that they always BREAK.  I was so fed up with spending $15 each time I needed a new one, that I looked into this.  Easily, this is the best garden purchase I've made in while.  From its full force jet spray to a fine mist, this can handle it all.  It hoses down my patio with ease and in an instant, I can put it on a fine spray or mist to water the flowers and pots.Fantastic!
B000XTMG8W This is the best on the market in my opinion. Very large fits your hand perfectly. 5 inches with replaceable o ring seals. does not leak with a very good mist to stream variation. The last you will ever buy or need. Recommend to anyone with a hose!!
B000XTMG8W Regarding the Gilmour brass garden hose nozzle models 528 and 528T528 (rubber jacketed verison of the 528T):I bought this Gilmour nozzle first and...It Broke!!! well, LEAKS is a better choice of words...where the shaft of the inner core mates with the base of the nozzle that screws onto the hose. They are two separate parts that appear to be press-fit togetther! And it leaks alot...not just drip, 2 seconds, drip..it has become a small trickle. Worse, the core and the outer twist part now spin at the faulty juncture effectively preventing the adjustability of the spray. To try and make this clearer, I can no longer grasp the long outer jacket and twist to adjust the spray, because it spins at the faulty juncture. Haven't even had it 4 months.528T:I bought this nozzle based soley on the positive reviews. Upon inspection of this nozzle when it arrived, it became immediately clear that the same 'press-fit' manufacturing technique was used in the assembly of the 528T as in the rubber jacketed 528. The Gilmour products that utilize this 'press fit' manufacturing technique have, in my experience, an unacceptable failure rate, and are not the perfect hose nozzles we thought they might be...but this one might be:Dramm 12380 Heavy-Duty Brass Adjustable Hose NozzleWarrantyGilmour covers this product, (and presumably the 528), with a 'Lifetime Replacement Policy' stating they will replace the product free of charge. They do not provide a telephone number on the packaging but rather an address, and a P.O. box number at that. I have no doubt they will send you another one, 'free of charge'. But who wants it? Especially in light of the fact that there are better products out there that cost no more.
B000XTMG8W Yes, as everyone says, it is solid brass. Unfortunately it does not have a versatile spray pattern of water as other ones of the same price.When you first open the nozzle a lil bit it will spread water like a mist... open it more and it will spread a thicker stream in a farther distance and ofcourse it will shoot a steady stream when opened further.It has below average coverage for watering the lawn...too strong or too misty for watering flowers...its okay for shrubs and that's about it.I regret buying this.
B000XTMG8W A simple very dependable hose nozzle, I own three and love them for their great performance. You can't go wrong with the solid brass.
B000XTMG8W .I had despaired of ever finding a hose nozzle that did what it was supposed to do.  Not much to ask of a simple brass hose nozzle, right?  Buying them at a big-box store was always an adventure.  Would this one work better than the one I just threw away?Well, this one does.  It feels substantial in the hand, adjusts smoothly and easily and doesn't spray in spurious directions.  The water stream is focused and precise.  It's just a joy to use.  Simple things that work well are delight to use.In my opinion, you won't find a better one that does the job it was intended to do at this price.  For six bucks and change, how can you go wrong?
B000XTMG8W Nothing fancy here.  Just a sturdy all brass nozzle for your hose.  It comes with a washer and it is easy to adjust the spray by turning the nozzle.  The spray is adjustable, accurate, and it can be turned completely off.  I leave mine on and turn the the handle of the spigot off to allow the hose to drain.
B000Y1BGN0 not a toy but a functional part of my polaris. I refill once per year and have to put this scubber on the tail of the polaris about every 2-3 weeks. someone had suggested using a noodle but I think the noodle as it would wear down with make a mess in the pool. been using this product for many years. price is right and can't go wrong
B000Y1BGN0 These work as anticipated. I started buying all my pool equipment on Amazon and save quite a bit of money doing so. I think I have to replace these on my polaris 360 every few months or so, operating the unit 4 hours a day.
B000Y1BGN0 A couple of years ago I purchased a house with a pool.  The tail scrubber on the Polaris robotic cleaner was gone.  I purchased these as a replacement.  Without this scrubber, the tail can't effectively do it's job of dislodging the algae as it starts to grow on the pool walls.  They last several months, but it's nice to have several on hand for when they start to wear away and become less effective.  It's worth it not to have to brush the sides of the pool as often if you keep a good scrubber on the tail.
B000Y1BGN0 These scrubber tips really do a good job with our Polaris Sport.  We will rotate them 180 degrees after a couple of months so that they last longer.  Nice to be able to stock up on them at a reasonable price from Amazon.
B000Y1BGN0 Polaris accessories are grotesquely expensive at the pool stores and online.  This company provides a good quality tail scrubber at a far more reasonable price.  A most worthwhile purchase.
B000YFA7HW We only had one critter that was bothering us and visiting out kitchen every night. We bought this trap and in 2 days we had nothing. In fact, we noticed the bait was slowly disappearing white the door was never closing. It seems that mice are too light to trip the door. What's the use then?We bought the metal trap and that worked. This one was mostly useless.
B000YFA7HW I recently ordered several live traps because the reviews on all were mixed.  The Kness Tip Trap has worked for us.  Don't remember which ones I ordered, but it appears I never received this one.
B000YFA7HW It worked! We had a mouse in the trunk of our car. We tried various ways of getting the little critter out: we left the trunk open, we used mothballs. No luck. This trap baited with a cracker and peanut butter caught it! We gave it a ride.No need to go and kill critters is there?I'm quite pleased.JW
B000YFA7HW I've been using the Tip Traps which are good too and got 5 of the little buggers.  But then they figured it out and I wasn't getting anymore.  I remember seeing the Smart Mouse trap when I was looking initially and only didn't get them because they were more expensive.  Well I got 2 and nabbed another mouse right off the bat.  It is very nice that you can see the mouse in the trap without out having to open it.  The Tip Trap is like a surprise, the mouse weighs so little you can't tell if you have one or not. The instructions for the Smart Trap tell you to put the peanut butter where the mouse can't get it, I think that is cruel and I put it on the end of the trigger platform instead so the mouse can eat it.
B000YFA7HW As a kid I remember setting wooden snap-traps with cheese, disposing of the unwelcome critters, and thinking little of it.  But as you grow older the long-term memory brings back the stories mom read about Mr. and Mrs. Field Mouse and their family of snug and secure little mouslings.  Moreover, my late, lamented cat taught me a lesson in humaneness.  One night she was lying on my desk, next to my computer, and a mouse literally scampered across the room.  She looked at it with moderate interest, but made no further efforts to disturb its progress from one wall to another.  Now I feel I owe it to her memory not to harm these unwelcome co-habitants.This plastic greenhouse is a bit pricey, but does the job--more or less.  The idea is to trap a single mouse, bring it out into the country, then wait for it to eat its way through a cracker wall and escape to freedom.  Let's see--the cost of gasoline, the waiting around for the little thing to catch on that it's OK to escape and feast while doing so.  Not exactly an efficient way of evicting the tiny tenants from your home.  Moreover, the plastic pull-up panel cracked the first time I used it.  It seemed to be a bit warped, making it difficult to reinstall  after removing it the first time.So maybe we'll keep this little green house for a demonstration for one of the grandchildren.  In the meantime, I don't plan to get homicidal--yet.  Of course, there's plenty of ammunition at the superior being's disposal--poisoned food, snap traps, glue traps, small electrocution chambers, even drowning (!) systems.  Instead, I'm going to try one of those sonic pest chasers and perhaps a more efficient and durable live trap.
B000YFA7HW I have extremely lazy cats.  They are absolutely useless when it comes to catching and killing mice.  Of course I could say the same thing about my sister, but will not go into that here.  This trap works wonderfully.  It is extremely humane and I am able to catch the little beggars and release them out in the woods where they can supply nourishment for the critters that are higher on the food chain.  Pity I cannot do the same with my sister.  Anyway, I do recommend this trap; it actually works and is actually rather fun to use.  Much better than putting out that horrid poison stuff or squishing them in the traditional traps.
B000YKJ6YW After more than 30 years in this house, I finally found something that gives me the spot watering I need.  I swear I have tried everything else out there.  Be careful it you punch the plastic spear thing into the ground--follow the instructions and stab a hole in the ground with a screwdriver first.  I have been able to avoid that just by moving it around just a tad to find a soft spot, but I could see if you have hard soil you could easily break that thing.  So that I don't have to constantly adjust the tips, and since this is inexpensive enough, I'll get a few more and leave them in or near certain parts of my yard set up just as I need them to be.  I love this gadget!
B000YKJ6YW Back when I used sprinklers, this was the most one I used. You can direct where the water goes, but it's sort of a general aim, the tubes won't stay exactly where you leave them.Nowadays I just water my garden by dropping the hose in the middle of a few plants, and leaving it on real low (like 1 drop every 2-3 seconds) for a few hours, then move it to another location.
B000YKJ6YW I&#8217;m the type of person who believes every product deserves a fair chance, boy was I wrong with this one! Yes I admit the idea was great but it does not work.I properly hooked this up and used the supplied spike to give this the leverage I felt it needed; I even tightened the hose securely and used the washers that were suggested with this purchase. It leaked all over the ground and left a puddle in my grass, and this wasn't even the beginning of my issues.I adjusted the noodles with the water off and they still wouldn&#8217;t stay bent once the water was on. I tried to adjust them with the water on and still no luck.This leaves puddles, it does not cover the areas well it just sprays in the air and hits the grass leaving a big mess. It almost seems like it&#8217;s missing something maybe a mist feature?Overall save your money with this one a buy a sprinkler. The Gilmour 196SPB Pattern Master Impulse Sprinkler on Polymer Sled Base works great for me! I left a review for this item as well.
B000YKJ6YW I have a curved drive way and would waste water trying to water a small section of grass.  This item has been a life saver.  I haven't had any of the issues that I have read in the reviews.  This is one of the only item out there on the market that gives you flexabilty.
B000YKJ6YW takes a lot of work to aim all those little noodle nostrils where you want them and you have to start all over if you move the sprinkler
B000YKJ6YW My kids wanted a sprinkler to play in on hot days with their friends. I was hoping to find something different than the typical design and I sure found it with this Noodlehead!I had shopped the different kids toys sprinklers first. Not only were they all 2 to 3 times as more in price as this Noodlehead, they also had terrible reviews. Everything from them hardly working to no water pressure and big let-downs. Then I found this.While obviously not marketed as a child's outdoors water sprinkler, it is absolutely awesome for this purpose. It shoots water out in a beautiful geyser in all directions. It also shoots with very strong water pressure and a large abundance of water. At one point we had 8 ten year olds playing in the water falling from it at the same time!So if your in the market for something fun for the kids to play in, I highly recommend one of these Noodleheads. It works far better than anything created for kids and costs half the price!
B000YKJ6YW This is not only great for the lawn but its so much fun to play in!!  :)
B000YKJ6YW The idea is great, and may well serve areas that have plants/shrubs ok, but it doesn't work too well for lawns because it only shoots about 8 feet, which doesn't create much coverage.  So if you have an area that needs water more than 8 feet away, this won't work for you.
B000ZOM7QG As trucks go, this is a pretty good one. The assembly is relatively easy to put together as long as you have some adjustable wrenches and other hand tools around the house. One important feature for hose trucks is to have a hose connection on the drum that is aligned with the direction of the hose being wound up. Without that feature, many hoses will simply crush over time as they start to kink, collapse, and so on, reducing water flow. The handle also makes it relatively easy to wind up all the hose.There are a couple of things I am not crazy about, however. I've banned pneumatic tires from my yard. Maybe other folk have better luck with them but I wish someone sold a hose cart with never-flat tires. I had two sets left over from my previous hose carts and while my previous hose carts are falling to pieces, theMarathon Industries Flat Free Tiresfit great and after two years of use have yet to produce a hint of rust.Secondly, the pipe carrying water from the outer to the inner hose connection is quite skinny, slightly crushed where it was bent, and makes up part of the female hose connection. A thin diameter tube is bad for flow, narrowing due to the tube being bent doesn't help either. Plus, when the pipe starts to rust (and from the looks of it, we're dealing with the same steel as the frame) then the whole hose cart could become unusable because the pipe may no longer seal sufficiently. Thus, it would be great if all parts that come into contact with water were either stainless steel or brass.The manufacturer helpfully provides a short hose to connect the hose cart to the home. It uses nice brass fittings but the hose ID is &#8541;\", so if you were after high-flow applications with larger hose diameters, this short hose is undersized. Similarly,a right angle connector / strain relief for the feeder hose would also help. Neither of these issues takes much time or effort to address; simply buy a larger-OD feeder hose and a strain relief / right angle connector, if you need them, and you're done.All in all, I am currently quite happy with this unit. Let's see how long the paint job will last...
B000ZOM7QG I obtained this to replace a plastic reel which is headed for recycle.  This hose reel cart is literally as easy to assemble as 1,2,3. Step 1 you bolt on the four pneumatic wheels. Step 2 you attach the wheel crank with two Phillips screws. Step 3 you fasten the Snap-on frame handle with two Phillips screws the same size as the ones used for the crank. If you work slowly the entire assembly process may take up to 5 minutes.The pneumatic tires provide a smooth and easy way to move the cart around. The reel can hold a mile or so of hose. OK, that may be an exaggeration because it seems like a mile but it will hold 350 feet of 5/8&#34; hose.I have owned more than a dozen hose reels and this is far and away the best ever.
B000ZOM7QG I have a front yard and a back yard and then a garden to the side of my home across the road, so lugging the hose all over to water flowers and plants is a big head and back ache.  I am so thrilled with this hose truck.My husband was able to put it together in less than 30 minutes.I already had a 150 foot hose, so we were able to use it right away.  No more back aches from carrying the hose., and it save a lot of time. Watering took 45 minutes less.
B000ZOM7QG This is probably one of the most sturdy hose cart/trucks made for the average homeowner. If you are like us, hauling around an extra long hose is a constant battle. We've tried all types of smaller versions which fail to do the job. This is the exception.Out of the box you will instantly notice that this is easy to assemble; parts are clearly marked and of a substantial quality. Wheels and related assembly were especially durable materials.Once assembled, this roles easily thanks to the wheels and parts. The turning is a bit less easy but that is largely related to the size and weight of the hose. I will say this is probably the first truck able to handle our extra long, extra heavy duty hose. The handle is well sized and of a useful height.This is not the most attractive product but it scores very high on functionality.
B000ZOM7QG 
B000ZOM7QG Overall I like the design of this Yard Butler hose reel.  It holds plenty of hose &#8211; I have 100 feet on it and there is room to spare.  It reels easily.  No leaking after assembly and use.  Looks attractive.  Feels sturdy.  The handle is high enough to wheel it around without stooping and can be used to push the cart &#8211; like a shopping cart &#8211; rather than dragging it around.Why 4 stars?  The wheels.  My tires came inflated and bulged out of round at the inflated pressure.  They also did not turn freely after being snugged down onto the frame.  In fact, the only way they turned freely was when they were loose enough they could be jiggled a bit on the frame.  I found that a bit odd since the wheels are on hubs that &#8211; I assume &#8211; have bearings.  And only the hubs contact the assembly bolt and cart frame.  Go figure.
B000ZOM7QG This hose truck is simply splendid! It comes with everything you need to get started ( actually water hose not included,  just the attachment hose).Putting it together was simple thankfully,  and wheeling it around is easy as well.  A few things to keep in mind when looking at one of these though.  One being do you actually need it,  we live in town with a decent sized front and back yard.We also have UGS and only really use the hose for water play,  washing a vehicle ect. So we don't really need this item since I can easily get the hose where I need it.You also are going to probably going to want a good, sturdy, quality hose. To utilize this product you also want a rather lengthy hose too.My in laws, and grandparents however are Gaga for this bad boy and keep trying to get us to load it up for them. We plan to buy a home with acreage in the near future and I forsee a need for this hose cart.If this is a product you know you will use and want then I say go for it!
B000ZOM7QG The Yard Butler Hose Truck is easy to assembly, easy to use and a great product to have around. There is nothing I hate worse about yard work is rolling up a muddy hose after a rain storm, or trying to roll &#34;hose rollers&#34; around the yard with their tiny wheels. The Yard Butler relieves that burden. The Yard Butler was easy to assemble and the extra large wheels are great for moving your hose around the yard. The long handle make it easy to roll around and the crank is easy to turn and roll the hose. It is a must have for any yard.
B000ZOM7QG This is a very solidly made hose reel. It's fairly heavy when assembled, probably 30+ pounds so it shouldn't be tippy when reeling hose. It is finished with a heavy paint, probably electrostatically applied, which should make it very rust resistant. The handle is not snap on like it is described but it is easy to attach. What I like about the handle and hose reel handle attachment is that instead of using a bolt that goes all the way through, thus providing a snag and scratch point, they opted to use nice pressed in threaded nuts and machine screws to attach the handles. Much better and more solid in my opinion. The wheels have bearing instead of bushings and the tires are good sized pneumatic so moving it around should be pretty easy. I would recommend that you use an impact wrench to secure the wheel axles which are nice plated 5/8\" (or equivalent metric) bolts and nylock nuts. The nylock nuts won't come off by themselves (a very good thing) but they do take some effort to tighten. Not that you can't do it by hand it is just so much faster with an impact wrench. All in all assembly was simple and there were NO missing parts as is often reported with a competitors similarly styled unit. Check to make sure you don't overtighten the wheel nuts. The wheel should spin pretty easily with no weight on it but still shouldn't have a lot of side to side wobble. I recommend this reel. ;)
B000ZOPXPS I own the Yard Butler HT-4EZ model and love the quality....liked it so much I bought this for a gift for someone who bought a plastic one at HD...that one fell apart while assembling...told them to take it back to the store and I will get you an ALL STEEL one with air tires......like day and night...you can buy a new plastic one every season or buy one of these that will last forever.....2 plastic ones cover the cost of this ONE purchase item....save the money and buy this quality hose reel one time....
B000ZOPXPS This is the first hose reel I've ever purchased.  It just made so much more sense to pay a bit more up front for a quality product than to keep wasting money on plastic reels which I understand do not typically last or perform that well.This particular hose reel is very well made.  It's also easy to use and move around the yard, although I always store it away in the garage.  The crank handle that rolls up the hose works easily, and I figure it gives me some good exercise!I priced this very model at a few local garden centers and, of course, paid much less at Amazon.
B000ZOPXPS Everything they claim is true...sturdy construction, easily moved, balanced weight...Those cheap plastic reels, boxes etc...are now a thing of the past.This unit will work!
B000ZOPXPS Luckily my husband is a carpenter by trade and can put things together.  Otherwise I'd be struggling with the flimsy instructions.  It took him around 15 minutes to get everything put together, and it's a solid piece.  The hardest part for me was getting the hose connected to the reelWe have thick rubber hoses and there's no way this reel can fit 200 feet of hose.  Still, this reel provides for enough capacity to carry a 100-foot hose.The enclosed tires came partially deflated, but that, too, was an easy fix. Hopefully this will last me a while.
B000ZOPXPS This is one of those things you debate needing then, once you have it, you know if anything happened to it you'd order another one just like it within the hour.I am into ponds, streams, gardening, a wildlife sanctuary, chicken rescue, nature, anything with the outdoorsAnd many of the above require water, do they not?Enter the world's longest hose at this house.Exit me trying to yank tangles free, free a section of the hose hooked on a rock or a tree, etc.Now I can just wheel it around like some wheeled toy as I go about my chores with ease and, better yet, just use that handle and wheel it all back up when my day's work is done so it no longer looks like a very skinny python has invaded the backyard and grown to reach the entire fenceline all laid out.And for that I imagine the neighbors are mighty happy as well in the event they can see the yard now sans hose-all-over-the-lace.Win/Wins everywhere.
B000ZOPXPS I have 75 feet of 5/8\" hose on this reel now and probably could get another 25 feet on there if it were carefully rolled but I would say that 100 feet is the maximum capacity for standard 5/8\" hose.Assembly was easy enough with the exception of the wheels. They provide nylon lined lock nuts and they are very difficult to turn. You will need a 15/16\" wrench, make that two wrenches because you need to use so much force to thread the nylon lining you have to hold on to the bolt as you twist the nut. Other than that it went smoothly and the tires came inflated.The water supply hose provided is low quality 5/8\" hose and a washer was not included for the end that connects to the hose reel. Fortunately I keep some on hand and did use a washer for that connection.The fitting on the reel the supply hose attaches to was screwed on so tight I had to use a wrench to back it off enough to attach the hose.The hose unwinds and winds easily and the unit is easy to move around. So far no leaks at the connectors.At 30 days I already have a couple spots of rust forming. The paint does not seem like a high quality baked on enamel and the U shaped piece in front of the wheels does not have any type of feet so the metal makes direct contact with the ground. It will likely get scratched up and be another source of rusting.The real test of a hose reel is how it is holding up after a season or two.  I am required to post a review within 30 days so I can only give first impressions and will follow up the review when I have had more time with it. My initial impression is this reel will last about as long as a good quality plastic hose reel (3 years) but it is twice the cost.In comparison; June 2004 I purchased a Rapid Reel two-wheeled all metal hose cart and it is still in service today. No rust, no parts have needed replacing and it came with a high quality 3/4\" water supply hose. It has survived 9 Minnesota winters outside; I just disconnect the hoses and drain the water out. The Rapid Reels are very expensive but you don't have to replace them every three years.
B000ZOPXPS I've been manually coiling my 100' Craftsman All Rubber hose for many years now, and I'll tell you, it's a tedious job.  I'd have to stretch the hose out fully, then manually coil, as not to kink.  It was tough.  Upon receipt, dh was kind enough to put it together, rather easily for him.  I went out to do my watering.  Habit made me stretch the hose out straight into the back yard.  It was extremely difficult to reel it in, since my hose is so heavy.  So I laid the hose out in an area of the truck and started reeling it in, and oh my, what a breeze.  No kinking, and in a minute, the hose was coiled.  I do have to guide the hose while I'm spinning the reel.  I water my beds daily, so this hose truck is truly a sanity saver. As for the capacity, I don't see how this model could hold 175' of hose; my 100' fits perfectly.
B000ZOPXPS Before I opened this product I was prepared to have several dozen parts-large and small-to assemble with this product and was pleasantly suprised. There was only about ten parts and it took a total of a whole 15 minutes!  That is a good start. The metal is very strong and nice looking-not cheap like so many of these are. The wheels did not need air which I was prepared for that too but no need for worry. It is very curb appealing-when I pull up it is the first thing I see and makes my house look better. Did not have any problem with the hose hook up either.So from start to finish it was about 25 to 30 minutes for assembly and then the water flowed. Can't wait to start using this summer!Thumbs up!
B000ZOPXPS I got this 2-Wheeled Garden Hose Truck to replace my leaking plastic hose reel.The included instructions need some improvements. I am handy for chores around the house, yet it still takes me a while, looking at the drawing on the instructions to figure out the right direction to assemble this hose truck.This thing is really solid and it's all steel. The water connector has brass fittings. It comes with two real tires...seriously, I have to inflate the tires to the right pressure. It works well without any leak and it's very easy and quite when rolling the cart or turning the wheel...unlike my previous plastic one, making so many noises.My 100-foot household hose almost fills up the carriage. Not quite sure about the claimed 200-ft capacity though.Overall, this hose truck seems to be able to last for long time.
B000ZOPXPS I'm the gardener in the family and I can almost always handle assembling benches, flower boxes, garden tools and even a small pond. But the Yard Butler hose cart was a challenge. It does not have a lot of parts but there are NO instructions, just drawings, which are no help and are even numbered incorrectly should you decide to follow them.The first step is to attach the tires using a very large bolt and lock nuts. Simple, except that I could not tighten the lock nuts and wasn't sure how far in to tighten them even if I could. Leaving them at the point where they reached the plastic resulted in too much wobble. So I had to wait for my husband who is much stronger than me, had the correct, large wrench in his mechanic's toolbox, and knew just how much to tighten the bolts. And it required quite a bit of force to do so.Once we got the wheels installed it was easy going to attach the reel and the handle using a screwdriver. Next problem, the cart didn't roll very well. This is because the pneumatic tires had to be inflated. I think plastic tires would be just as good and not need to have air added periodically, especially after the winter. At the very least they could have shipped them with air. We have an air compressor, but not everyone has a tire pump or compressor.I connected the hose, turned on the water, and no leaks. My 100 foot hose fits on the reel, but there isn't enough room for a second hose. Now that it's assembled and operational, it looks nice and is much sturdier than the old plastic cart it replaced. So far, it's working as expected. Time will tell if it will hold up long term.
B000ZOPXPS This is the first garden hose truck that I've had. The assembly didn't take long for my husband to do. He had it put together in no time. It was also easy to crank. So far, I haven't had any problems with it!
B000ZOPXPS This hose cart is light years beyond those poly hose carts that cost 30 to fifty dollars and last a year or two. I just replaced one that is less that a year old with thes Lewis Steel Hose Cart.The cart is ruggedly built and comes with a high quality leader hose. The metal connections all look and feel substantial.Putting the cart together was a little problematic even though there are few pieces.It took more effort and time to screw on the crank handle than I would have imagined. For some reason the threads just wouldn't mesh or connect. After finally getting the handle on I noticed that the crank was bent inward didn't make a full revolution because it hit the framework after each half turn.A manufacturer's rep, reached using the 800 number provided, was very courteous and suggested I try to bend the handle out manually. She thought it must have been bent inward during transport. Fortunately the handle bending strategy worked and the cart works well.This cart may hold two hundred feet of hose, but it barely contains my two hundred feet of hose. My hoses are 5/8\" and heavy. Two hundred feet of cheaper hose will fit on the reel easily.The hose connections are leak free and the crank turns with minimal effort. Despite the assembly problems, I like this cart and would buy it again.Be aware that the pneumatic tires must be inflated.
B000ZOPXPS The hose truck is well built and holds 150 feet of quality (non-kink) hose.  While the 4 assembly steps are simple, there are no written instructions and the drawings can be misleading.  I was reluctant before I purchased the product because of the reviews above seemed to have real problems with the handle.  Perhaps the handle problem is related to the orientation of the center spool, which is incorrectly pictured on the instruction sheet, but correctly pictured on the box.  So here are some tips.1.  Look at the picture on the box (the back panel for English) and make sure you assemble the spool and crank exactly as pictured.  Standing behind the truck the handle should be on your left.  The left handle strut is contstructed so that there is about an inch clearance for the crank.2.  The 1 inch bolt with a 1 inch locknut that forms the axle for the wheels should not be overtightened.  You will need 2 one inch wrenches to install.  If you use channel locks or a similar tool to turn the nut or stabilize the bolt head, remember a piece of cloth between the tool and the nut/bolt head to prevent chewing the metal up.  The nut turns very hard initially.  The wheel should turn without the threaded axle turning.  It's ok to leave the wheel a little loose, since the wobble is not noted once the hose is loaded on.3.  The white plastic bushing around the crank receptacle comes off.  Take the screws on the crank completely out (the nuts are fastened inside the crankshaft)for installation of the crank.4.  All 4 screws have Phillips heads.5.  The tires are tubed and inflatable up to 50 psi.Well, that's about it for the do's and don'ts.  It will take you about 30 minutes to get everything together and tested, and I think you will be happy with the result.
B000ZOPXPS I'm a female who normally doesn't have any trouble putting things together without any help. But the industrial-sized bolts and cheap plastic-insert lock-nuts on this hose reel made it impossible to install the tires without finding someone to help me (I couldn't tighten the lock nuts). We ended up discarding the lock-nuts that came with this and buying a set of washers & lock-nuts made for a 5/8\" bolt at the hardware store in order to complete the assembly. I was happy that the hose connection doesn't leak, unlike the cheaper plastic hose reels I've owned in the past. Don't count on this holding 175 feet of hose like the description says....unless the hose is skinny, I'd guess the limit is closer to 150 feet of hose, if that.
B000ZZU960 i love this feeder station. it accommodates all of the feeders i had and the meal worms go great in the tray. its tall enough too. which can be hard to find tall ones. you do have to assemble, but the directions are easy, just pay attention to which parts go where. it did not seem flimsy or unstable. It says to push it into the ground at about 16 inches, i couldnt get it that far down, but its still was very stable.
B000ZZU960 I'm new at birding and this is my first stand. It comes with a pointed end to drive in the ground but I have in on my deck 'duct tapped' (temporary) to a wooden post.It has a nice smooth black finish and you only need a Phillips screwdriver for two screws that join the 3 sections together.I've been introduced to squirrel and raccoon problems climbing the feeder. This prompted me to put grease on the pole but one feeder had a 'BIG raccoon' hanging on the bottom swinging back and forth so it's strong. I see new adventures in urban critters awaiting me.Happy with the product and easy to put together. Comes with metal screen tray and semi-clear water tray and places to hang 3 seed feeders.I can't drive it in the ground (apartment) so I may drill two holes in the lower pipe and screw it to the wooden post once I know where and how I want it orientated.There is a gazillion birds using the thing and they are constantly singing or squawking when the squirrel is around. When the feeder is full of birds the others are waiting their turn in the trees in the nearby greenbelt.
B000ZZU960 very nice and it should work good to hang my feeders that I got to put on it just waiting until the ground unthaws so I can put it in the ground. Wanted one of theses for sometime now
B000ZZU960 So far, so good.  It was easy to put together (except I dropped a screw and it disappeared into the gravel, but found one I could use in my spares).  I used a level as I was hammering the base piece into the ground (it goes in about 18&#34;).  The birds LOVE it.  I hung 2 Perky Pet 312C feeders on the top pieces, and Regal Art and Gift Solar Hummingbird feeder (it's a seed feeder with pix of hummer) on it.  Cardinal flock to it.  I've even seen them using the water dish that comes with it.  Highly recommend this
B000ZZU960 I use this hanger to hang birdfeeders, plants, and windchimes. The only thing about this hanger I think should be changed is that a double pronged bottom should be added instead of the single pole end as it is now.
B000ZZU960 Still working like a champ even in the flat land winds and storms. We get some crazy winds in my area it really never stops blowing at a normal 15 MPH and up to some times 75 MPH during a good storm this is still holding strong. minus one piece the bird bath which deteriorated the first summer.Over all it holds my many bird feeders, holds up well in the winds and still going strong on a second year. It was worth the cost and I am happy with it.
B000ZZU960 I was pleased to receive the bird feeder and see that it was exactly as advertised.  I will be using it this winter to feed all the birds that have become used to grabbing a snack at my home.
B00104WRCY Had never smoked meat before buying this smoker. Have to say smoking your own meat is fun and this smoker works flawlessly. You will amaze your family and friends when you start smoking meat in this smoker.
B00104WRCY I just set up and ran my Masterbuilt 30 inch electric smoker, and after doing the same bit of fun with a Brinkmann charcoal unit as well as a Masterbuilt GS30 propane unit, I give this unit a heartfelt top of the heap rating.  I'll simply summarize what others have said relative to construction:  it is truly thoughtful, using double wall insulated construction all the way around; whereas many users place oven rope around their propane units, this smoker has a rim of rubberized sealing from the factory; the drip pan is full sized and smartly cantered to drain efficiently; the digital programming is a snap, although I would suggest placing the starting temp adjustment at 200 degrees rather than 100, thus leaving only a modest + or - for a setting; but above all the very useful, very clever loading tray permits really easy addition of chips whilst in use.  I've also mentioned my truly responsive experience with Masterbuilt's customer service, and this is 2012, hence current, so criticism relative to their bottom line is not something I've encountered.  Again, this has been a fun experience.
B00104WRCY We love this smoker!  We were a little hesitant to &#34;go electric&#34;, but I'm sorry we waited so long!  Set the temperature, fill the basin, put in a few chips and it's time to add your meat.  So easy.Experiment a little to find the hotspots.  Bottom tray over the smoker element is a no-no, and near the rear of the trays seem to be hotter - just plan accordingly.
B00104WRCY Yummy. I'm not really into writing the product reviews so adding this filler to satisfy the required number of works.
B00104WRCY Nothing but flimsy cardboard shoved inside cheap plastic. If you have slippers or sandles, you'll be OK..... butanything more, forget it. I'm looking to replace this piece of garbage. Save your money and put it toward something more substantial.......not this.
B00104WRCY I bought this smoker and great hopes for it, but quickly ran into problems. The smoker/wood chip area comes in two parts - a holder box and a tray. The holder box was not attached correctly and where you put in the chips was not even attached to the side of the box correctly. It was at an angle. The smoker tray I received seemed to have been manufactured in an incorrect size and wouldn't fit in the holder. The tray also seems to have been made from very thin and cheap metal. I can't imagine that it would last very long. Screws were missing for the electronic controls. As a result I couldn't even put it together and ended up taking it back.I guess the 90 day warranty should have been a clue, but Amazon doesn't mention that fact.Admittedly this is an inexpensive Chinese made smoker, but the quality I got is the worst I've ever had in a consumer product. I am still looking for an electric smoker, but will go for a more expensive stainless steel model. Most of these come with two year parts warranties.Buyer Beware.Addon - Masterbuilt finally admitted that I had a faulty unit and sent me a replacement. The new replacement was of much better construction and went together easily.
B00104WRCY What make it different than a conventional kitchen oven if electrical/LPG power is used?I've been using a real smoker, looks identical to this one, built by same company but designed to use woods and/or charcoal) for nearly 10 years.  Mine will probably last forever as there's nothing to go wrong, but chunk of heavy metal with wheels.  Cooking by smoke means extreme slow and low temperature cooking, by natural smoke alone, not by adding yucky tasting man-made liquid smoke which taste like a cigarette.  Get a real smoker, burn some fruit trees, completely eliminating need for salt or any other artificially flavored seasoning.  Eat good food, learn to enjoy life, that is our portion.
B00104WRCY I used to be a hardcore dyed-in-the-wool charcoal pit smoker. I decided to take the leap with an electric smoker after checking out the reviews on this machine and thinking to myself, \"man it sure would be nice not to have to worry about tending the fire\".This baby does the job and it has tons of room. My first smoke (after curing per instructions) was huge. I did 2 briskets, 2 full racks of ribs and 8 chicken quarters (see product shots) over apple wood. Smoke permeation level was exceptional. The manual recommends adding a new wood chip dose (via the convenient external access wood chip tray) every two hours. I did exactly that for a total of 3 doses of chips over 7 hours @ 200 degrees. The results were phenomenal.The window, remote control, internal light are all exceptional features. Other than refilling the chip tray, I never had to go outside to tend the smoke once. I could easily monitor the smoke level inside via the window and the light with the remote control.Excellent machine. Very happy with the purchase and seems to be well made. I'm a little worried about the heating element going out based on other reviews, but as mine is brand new everything seems to be in order now. I'll check back in after a few months to a year and update.It held temperature within 2 degrees for the entire cook.One sort of odd caveat I had to figure out was that you have to set BOTH temperature AND time for your cook. If you only set temp the unit won't start and it will shut off when the timer expires.My dog LOVED the easy access to the drip pan in the back. Thanks to him I never had to empty it :)You can't go wrong with this unit. Would easily buy again.
B00104WRCY F.Y.I  A LOT OF THE BAD REVIEWS ARE ON THE OLDER MODEL SMOKER. THIS IS THE NEWER MODEL AND YOU CAN BUY AND REPLACE THE HEATING ELEMENT IF IT EVER BURNT OUT.this masterbuilt smoker works great for me even when using a extension cord. but if using one it be must be able to handle the power the smoker requires. I used a regular outdoor cord and it took my smoker forever to heat up. I ended up buying a (Yellow Jacket 2883 12/3 Heavy-Duty 15-Amp SJTW Contractor Extension Cord with Lighted Ends,25-Feet) bought on amazon and smoker heated up quick & worked it the way it was meant to work. this smoker is very easy to use and puts out good smoke although it does not put out smoke with temps under 200F not sure if that's because I use wet chips I haven't tried using dry chips yet. I'm very happy with this smoker so far I've only smoked ribs & chicken and turned out very good. there has been a lot of reviews about getting parts for this smoker & dealing with Masterbuilt customer service. I haven't dealt with C/S so I don't know about that as far as finding parts I found a place on the internet called APPLIANCE FACTORY PARTS that sells parts for model# 20070106 & model# 200709010 also I did not buy this smoker from Amazon got mine at WM but thought I would write a review anyway and I payed the same price that amazon sells it for but it took 2 weeks to get it from them.6 MONTH UPDATE 11/23/12well after 6 months and 200+ hours of smoking time, this smoker still works great. I've smoked snacking sticks, summer sausage, pulled pork, chicken, ribs, Canadian bacon,turkey, and venison and all turned out great. I never had any problems with the heating element, digital timer, or any other part of this smoker. as far as smoking/cooking I've never set the temp higher then 225 F when smoking, after a few hours of smoke I'll drop the temp down to 200 to 210 F to finish cooking, and use a wireless digital meat thermometer. I've kept mine outside all summer/fall and haven't noticed any signs of rust or any other signs of damage but I have a good cover for it. but I'll keep in the garage/shed over the winter. the cover I bought for this smoker is the Veranda Square 30\" Smoker Cover for Price: $29.00 bought on amazon its a great cover. love this smoker. just remember keep it clean buy a water proof cover, if kept outside. if going to use a extension cord I recommend this one. Yellow Jacket 2883 12/3 Heavy-Duty 15-Amp SJTW Contractor Extension Cord with Lighted Ends, 25-Feet. I will UPDATE in another 6 months.1 1/2 YEAR UPDATEwell after 1 1/2 years of use about 450+ hours this smoker still works great never had any problems at all with it. I did buy the cold smoker adapter for it and that works GREAT, I don't put chips in the main smoker anymore. the cold smoker adapter holds a lot more chips about three good handfuls and produces longer and better smoke then just using chips in the main smoker. you can run the main smoker and the cold smoker at the same time even when using a extension cord in fact I can run the main smoker, cold smoker and my Weber rotisserie at the same time without any problems. the extension I use is a (Yellow Jacket 2883 12/3 Heavy-Duty 15-Amp SJTW Contractor Extension Cord with Lighted Ends 25-Feet) and a ( yellow jacket 2' three plug adapter. again if you plan on keeping it outside make sure you buy a good waterproof cover the black masterbuilt cover is worthless. also I would not keep it outside in freezing weather the cold could damage the digital timer / temp gauge. I keep mine in the basement in the winter months when not in use and never had any smoke smells coming from it.
B00104WRCY ---UPDATED NOV 8th, 2009----Like others, my beloved smoker has died! The digital temp gauge is stuck on 300 degrees and no amount of troubleshooting has resolved this. I couldn't get any help from Masterbuilt so I searched forums and some said the wiring in the back of the unit could be burnt so I grabbed a hammer and crow bar and broke all the rivets around the back of the unit to get access to the wiring and yes indeed I had some burnt wires, but I don't think that was 100% the issue has they weren't that bad. It looked like the heating element was also failing....I really loved this smoker, smoked numerous boston pork butts, a turkey, etc in it and it worked great. But I like others have suffered the same fate of a dead smoker at the 1 year mark. In fact I'm 14 days shy of having it for a year....Would I buy this unit again? I don't think so... Instead I opted to switch from electric to charcoal and got a Weber Smokey Mountain Cooker and after smoking my first pork butt and turkey on the charcoal smoker I can't believe the difference in taste. Plus the charcoal held temperature for a full 12 hours without any maintenance, in other words my one worry of temp control which is why I got the electric to start with was invalidated as the charcoal Weber Smokey Mountain held at a constant 225 degrees and could go up or down based upon how far you open the 3 bottom and 1 top vent. Masterbuilt has a 90 day warranty, Weber has a 10 year limited warranty.... I should have gotten the weber from the start.----------------------------I have never used a smoker before however have worked with a guy who is a pro at smoking meat. I was envious so I bought a smoker so I could make my own great food! I looked around and got some advice and was told this was a great looking model. I went ahead and ordered it and had it delivered in time for Thanksgiving. Unboxing it was easy, they have everything secured and wrapped well and it's just a matter of removing the foam wrapping, cardboard shims and screwing the timer/heat control panel to the top.As for using it, this thing is a piece of cake. This was my first attempt at smoking and a Turkey was a bit daunting. I had my mother-in-law prep the bird while I turned the smoker on (pushed the button) and set the temp (pushed the other button). I then filled the water tray, put some wood chips in that I had soaking for about 30 minutes and then popped the bird in.I cooked it at 230 degrees for approx 9 hours basting it with butter about every 2 hours and adding wood chips as needed.The turkey was really good, wasn't dry and it cooked perfectly and tasted really good. I look forward to smoking pork butt, ribs, chicken and anything else I can stick in it!If you want a smoker this is a great one to get. It really is a set it and forget it thing. No messing with the temperature and adding wood or coals to maintain the heat. All you need to do is baste (if you want to) and add more wood chips (if you want a really smoky taste after the initial chips are gone.)As for the flimsy latch that was mentioned on another review. It definitly isn't the strongest. But it does do the job, just need to be a little careful with it and I don't think there will be any issues. That's the only reason I give it 4 stars.What I loved was I had this shipped overnight using Amazon prime for only $3.99! Another site that I was going to order this from wanted to charge $70 for it to be shipped overnight! Love that Amazon prime!
B00104WRCY This is pretty dadgum kwel.  There is a drawback for learning the process.  It doesn't come with any good instructions.  So, for me it's been trial and error, googling, and you tubing.  Still, I like it and am slowing figuring it out.  I like the glass door a  lot because it permits me to keep an eye on the food.  One thing I have learned to do is line everything, including the racks, with heavy aluminum foil.  It makes the clean up a snap.  (The first clean up was AWFUL because I had not lined with foil. That smartened me up fast.)  The salmon and pork have been my best products so far.  The pork ribs were okay but I haven't found the perfect sauce.  My first brisket had a great flavor but was too dry.  The next time I smoked brisket, I left the meat uncovered for a couple of hours then wrapped it in foil.  That kept  it from drying out.  Same with the pork.  I left the salmon uncovered the whole time and it was still moist.  So, like I said:  trial and error.
B00104WRCY I bought this to supplement my wood smokers when I couldn't dedicate as much time to maintaining the fire during a long cook.  I am pleased as this smoker is super easy.  Set the temp, let it pre-heat and then throw the meat on.  I find a load of wood chips which is about 1/2 a coffee cups worth will smoke for about 30 minutes.  Usually 4 loads give me the perfect amount of smoke flavor on a Boston Butt.For capacity, I have easily cooked 4 6lb butts at a time on it and you could probably squeeze 8 of that size if you wanted.  If you go much heavier you will be limited to using only 2 of the racks because it wont fit between them.  It will also hold 4 spatchcock chickens or a large amount of chicken cuts if you utilize all 4 racks.  I also like the manufacturer redesigned it so the heating coil is replaceable if it goes out in the future.  This thing is so simple it feels like cheating.
B00104WRCY I love this thing.  I have been smoking meat all my life and this thing is amazing.  I set my alarm for 6:00, turn it on to pre-warm, get a previously rubbed shoulder out of the frig and let it warm.  I am back in bed by 7 and other than occasionally adding chips, I do nothing until 6:00 that night when a perfect shoulder comes out.I have done, shoulders, ribs, a turkey, lots of chickens, a wide variety of fish.  I love this thing.
B00107039U The kit contains the chemicals you need to test a pool or a hot tub. The instructions are clear, and it is easy to use.  the results I obtain match what the local pool store told me, so it appears to be accurate as well.  There are sufficient supplies to last most of a season, but there are also supplies you won't need if you don't have a hot tub.
B00107039U This is your basic kit. Nothing special. Tells you what you need to know. Other more expensive kits like the 06 are way better. FYI Amazon does not allow this particular kit to be returned for any reason. The ad does not mention that. Mine had some case issues so I'm on my own. Oddly enough accuracy same as Aquachek test strips. All the pool experts seem to love this kit and the Taylor 2006 the most. They are always downing accuracy of test strips, but my results with strips keep matching my various kits along with being close to pool store testing. I'm just about ready to ditch all the chemical tests for strips if the results stay this good. These test strips cover more than this kit tests for. http://www.amazon.com/AquaChek-551236-7-Way-Count-Strips/dp/B0083SMU7C/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1404961614&sr=8-1&keywords=Seven+way+pool+strips
B00107039U We use this test kit for our hot tub, for which it works very well. Our water has a high percentage of calcium compounds so I appreciate its ability to measure a wide range of PH (especially basic) when adjusting the water properties. It's more comprehensive than our previous kit.The shipping container was not well done. Bottles and caps were all over the place. However, we managed to find everything and nothing was broken, This does not affect the good quality of the kit and we did not downgrade it because of the packaging.
B00107039U Its kind of complicated to use. I still havnt figured it out. I use the test strips and they work fine for my small pool.
B00107039U Being a new pool owner I was really nervous about taking care of our pool without the help of a professional.  This test kit is easy to use and pretty accurate.  I know because I took a sample of my water to be tested at Leslie Pools and they came back with the same readings this test gave me.
B0010QD5QO This comes in a very BIG box with lots of packing paper.  There is a clamp with two screws that you first attach to the pole, the black skirt goes over and simply sits on clamp (the clamp does NOT attach to the skirt), and you push the edges together until they interlock. I was surprised that it moves or can rock a bit, so if a squirrel somehow tries to climb up on the thing from another structure it tilts even more making it tougher. The idea is, they are stopped from climbing up the 'pole' and it does that easily.  If they figure another way to jump on your feeder you can't blame this.  It's not magic, it's a pole block to the critters.There is a big paper label but I carefully pulled it off without tearing it. A little heat (hair dryer?) might make it easier.I did spray the top of the skirt with silicone spray, it may not be needed and a car wax might be worth trying later.One thing I noticed since installing it, I have more birds at the feeder!  I think perhaps it blocks the view to the ground and makes them feel safer (just guessing).  So far no bird has even tried to land on it.I'm a new 'birder' and I'm starting to wonder if there is no end.  I started by tossing seeds on the patio... LOL
B0010QD5QO Well first off I had a heck of a time keeping this up on the pole.  I'd tighten screws one day, come out the next morning and the baffle would be down about 3 feet.  I finally figured out (I think anyway) that the local deer were pushing it down to get to the food, or else it was a raccoon or something fairly large.  I kept tightening those screws but no matter what it wouldn't stay up.  Second issue was that our squirrels learned to shinny up to the baffle - tilt it and then climb the rest of the way to the feeder.  It was sort of fun to watch the antics BUT didn't deter the squirrels so I sent it back.  Overall it was quite frustrating that once again something didn't help.
B0010QD5QO From the very first day of use we knew we had finally defeated the squirrel raiders who would empty our feed in a matter of hours. Actually, the squirrels still get some seeds (the ones the birds toss off the feeder) but that's fine. What we didn't expect was deer that started coming to the feeder that would actually stand up on their hind legs and lick seed out of the feeder completely by-passing the baffle. Do they make a deer baffle?
B0010QD5QO The baffle is very wide and the pole attachment is secure and easy to install. The finish is black and it should keep the critters from climbing the pole to feeder.
B0010QD5QO Don't get me wrong, I love squirrels.  I set out peanuts every day for them and the Blue Jays.  Our squirrels just don't eat the bird seed; they disconnect the bird feeder and steal the entire feeder.  Sometimes we find it and sometimes we have to buy a new feeder.This squirrel baffle worked perfectly.  Our shepherd's hooks are tall so we were able to set the baffle about 4 feet off the ground and away from trees or other objects so they can't jump above it.  Mount the ball onto your shepherd's hook pole and then snap the baffle above the ball and lower it into place.  If the squirrels climb up to the baffle they cannot get above it as it tilts on the ball and they lose their balance and fall off the pole.They are persistent and sometimes they sit there and stare at the thing for an hour.  I can see the little mental wheels turning but so far they haven't figured out a way to get around it.  I think when they are sitting there with their little paws to their face that they are praying for a strong wind to blow down the shepherd's hook.  That has worked a couple of times!
B0010QD5QO Yep!  Anything that manages to prevent those pesky and annoying tree rats from disturbing the bird feeders, gets my vote of approval....and this gadget gets that job done quite well.
B0010QD5QO This squirrel guard performs very well. I have 3 and no squirrel has got past. The only reason that I didn't give it 5 stars is that the screw-on device used to hold it up tends to slip on the smaller poles. This was rectified by use of a small hose clamp below the device.
B0010QD5QO This is a quality made, substantial, heavyweight baffle that will stand up to years of use.  I was hoping it would fit my standard shepherds hook, but the 2 part bracket with screws ( which is  included ) used to fit around my particular pole and which allows the baffle to rest on, is just slightly too big.  I'll be able to wrap some duct tape around the pole to increase the diameter and  then adapt the bracket so it will fit .....with No worries.  Hope it works as advertised. From what I can tell, no way a squirrel is going to get over this.
B0010QD5QO Squirrels could not get up to the birdfeeder by climbing the pole!  I'm impressed, amazed and amused.  Just make sure you have it more than 8 feet away from a tree or other device. Squirrels can jump onto a feeder from the top or sides, just not from the pole it's on, climbing upward.  It seems to baffle them!
B0010QD5QO I bought two of these to fend off the multitude of squirrels that attack our feeders and empty the seed overnight. They seem to be doing the job so far. I hope they continue to work. I will update should it changes. Great product so far.
B0011WP4Q6 Despite what one negative review said, the bag says \"Briggs and Stratton Parts\" and says \"Made in the USA\". It perfectly fits my self-propelled Sears 700 Series B&S engine. For this particular lawn mower - it's perfect.
B0011WP4Q6 The lawn mower repair shops (I checked with 4) wanted more than 3 times the price, then on top of that they would add state tax and then charge me to order it.  It's exactly the same air filter that was shipped with the lawn mower from the factory.  All it takes to change the air filter is a flat tip screwdriver.
B0011WP4Q6 This is a direct OEM replacement air filter for most Briggs and Stratton lawnmower engines. To be used with a pre-filter and the combination works well.
B0011WP4Q6 One thing many homeowners neglect is their poor lawnmower.  Ever since I was a boy my father taught me to change the oil every year, sharpen the blade, and replace the air filter.  I have refined his frugal spirit by cleaning my air filter on odd years and replacing it on even years.That is a small amount of work and expense and it ensures your lawnmower will easily cut through your grass, and reliably, basically forever.  I've never seen a lawnmower fail unless it had been neglected.This was a perfect fit and I received the OEM part in easy to open packaging.  The value was much better than at local retailers.
B0011WP4Q6 This filter is the perfect fit for my Toro mower.  I change it every season.  Keeps the oil clean.  Easy to replace.
B0011WP4Q6 This is a quality air filter the I used in my push lawn mower 6.75 horse. Fit and function was perfect.
B0011WP4Q6 Fits my john Deere js63 lawnmower perfectly.  This is 1/3 of the price home depot wanted for the same. Filter. This saved me money and that's something I. Can be happy about.  Construction  
B0011WP4Q6 This air filter came in a  Briggs and Stratton OEM package and in the exact replacement part. I would order again
B0011WP4Q6 This air filter fits very well my Sears lawnmower. Price is good about half of what other online stores want.
B0011WP4Q6 High quality original equipment Briggs and Stratton Air  Filter. I compared this air filter to the alternative cheaper filters and the difference was really noticeable in terms of construction and quality. Why take a chance on an expensive piece of lawn equipment with a cheaply made air filter.
B0011WP4Q6 I found this filter on Amazon after purchasing one with the same model number at Ace for ten dollars. After ordering this filter I returned the ten dollar filter to Ace.This filter cartridge fits my old lawnmower perfectly. I also like that it came in a plastic baggy so I didn't need the jaws of death to open the package. Very satisfied with the product and the price.
B0012CBRRK I bought these tables for the Q100.  When I ordered them I thought the price seemed steep for two little pieces of plastic, when I received them however I was pleasantly surprised.  They are quite heavy and well built.  They attached in a minute or two using a star head screwdriver (probably a large philips would fit too), by loosening one screw for each table.  They easily held a plate that weighed 4 pounds or so.  They fold up inside the grill when not being used, so you can still use the storage cover with these installed.
B0012CBRRK This is a must have if you have a Q.  My only complaint is that the are little flimsy with a full plate of food on them
B0012CBRRK These attachable tables for the Weber Q provide ideal space right at the BBQ. The are easy to attach and fold up to fit under the Weber cover. A bit pricy though.
B0012CBRRK Perfect compliment to our Weber 386002 Q 100 Portable Propane Gas Grill. Very easy to install. Just wish it was a little less expensive...
B0012CBRRK really adds to the grill. I'm not really into writing the product reviews so adding this filler to satisfy the required number of works.
B0012CH350 This cover fits well, is well made, and does a great job protecting my grill from the weather.Weber sells two types of covers, the black one which is heavy duty and meant for direct weather and the elements.  especially here in the Northeast where the winters can get pretty rough.  Sometimes.The second cover is more of a lighter weight cover and is gray in color.  It is good for a place that has milder winters, or for a grill that you want to cover that is already on a covered deck or carport.  I have used the gray covers during some hard winters, and they start to look their age after some time while the black covers hold up much better in tougher conditions.Both covers end about 6-8 inches from the ground.  This gives good air circulation for the covered grill so any condensation will dry off during the day.
B0012CH350 I purchased the cheap grey cover to just get by and I did just get by and not for very long.  I knew I needed this premium cover if I wanted something that would last.It is made well, can take some abuse and keeps my kettle from getting scratched up when move it from place to place traveling in our RV.Note:  I recently put the grill in the back of my truck while taking a long trip.  It was a windy day and the cover flapped quite a bit.  The wind and flapping destroyed the cover.  The vinyl cracked, peeled and came off allowing the cloth underneath to be shredded by the wind.  So if your transporting it any distance in a pickup be sure to cover it with a plastic trash bag and secure it.
B0012CH350 The Weber cover was free of defects: no holes, rips or tears. The first few time putting the cover on were sort of difficult due to the newness of the item. The elastic band at the bottom needs break in time to easily get the cover on and off the grill. Keep in mind it ought to be tight to prevent the wind from getting up under it and blowing it off the grill.
B0012CH350 LEAVE THE GRILL OUTDOORS AND THIS FITS IT GREATLL  YES HAVE A WEBER AND LOVE COOKING OUT DOORS SO AM HAPPY WITH THE PURCHASE, HAS STRETCH BO0TTOM WHICH HELPS KEEP IT ON IN WINDY CONDITIONS
B0012CH350 Well made, excellent cover
B0012GTU3O I bought this gauge because of accuracy.  Never realizing how inconvenient for a grill that holds the take underneath the grill.  It performs quite well just not very convenient, so not used often as I would like.  However, we just bought a gas smoker and it is fantastic for the tank on that since it sits out.  I bought another more convenient gauge for the grill but this is everything we needed for the smoker.
B0012GTU3O This is a straight-forward hook and lift gauge - and it worked great.  I have used the magnetic junk, even poured the water on the tank and seen the frost line, I prefer this!  I have two tanks, so I go for refilling rather than exchange.  In either case this gauge is handy - slap it on and lift it - that Blue Rhino or refill tank is apt to be only half full, or in the refill - the guy only puts in 10 pounds!  Recommend this item for grillers and RV'ers.
B0012GTU3O As far as gadgets go, they don't get much simpler to use than this. But sometimes, simpler is better.  I've used other gas gauges that you attach to your tank and they never work correctly for very long. This gauge works perfectly every time. Just hook the gauge to the tank and lift. It's that easy!
B0012GTU3O I grill year round.  I'm rather analytical by nature and not having a way to way to determine how much propane was left in my gas grill tank drove me batty.  The place where I get my propane fills has a minimum charge, as many do.  After paying the minimum several times because I had propane left in my tank I decided there has to be a better way.  THIS IS IT!Peace of mind is what it provides, especially on long grills like whole chickens, turkeys, or roasts.  You quickly develop an eye for estimating how much time is left on your propane tank based upon the weight shown on the dial and what you intend to cook, how many burners you'll use, at what level of heat output, etc.  Is it absolutely accurate?  No, but it is darn close.  I haven't paid the minimum fill rate since I got the gauge.A friend says \"just buy another tank.\"  I did that, but you still end up with the same issue as you near the end of either tank.Another friend says \"just use a bathroom scale.\"  Granted, that works too, but this is WAY more convenient than hauling a bathroom scale out to the yard.My Grill Gauge is an essential accessory to my gas grill.  It has easily paid for itself in the dozen or so fills I've had since getting the gauge.
B0012GTU3O Love this little gauge.  Keep it in my camper, weigh my bottle when I wonder, and no need to wonder if I am going to run out.  Worth every penny.
B0012GTU3O Other products that say they can read the fill of a propane tank are wrong. This is the only fool proof way to know how much propane is left in your tank. I had read other reviews about the other products (magnetic strips or gauges) and they all have bad reviews. Such a simple invention that works, well done. Even if you have a propane tank that is installed inside a compartment in your BBQ, it takes 30 seconds to remove it and see what you have left, so no big deal. A lot better than not knowing what you have in your tank and running out mid BBQ only to have to put a new one in.
B0012NTQ68 Tough not being perfect this was an excellent deal.Let me address some points:-the umbrella came packed very well and arrived without any damage-assembly...there is pretty much no assembly the 2 stand pieces need to be laid over each other (each less then a pound in weight) a base piece (maybe 2 pounds) needs to be screwed on with 4 bolts and 4 washers. No rocket science. The cantilever arm with the umbrella comes pre assembled, all you need to do is slide it in the base. Ok this part weights maybe 30 but still, I handled it by myself. BE AWARE: weighting down the stand before you add the umbrella part is a good idea. I bought four pavers for about 4 bucks each at the HD. Looks good and adds the needed stability. Not a good idea to use this without added weight. Think about the shear size of the umbrella and what powers wind can produce. Be safe, don't screw it down with the drill holes in the base, the stands material isn't strong enough to keep the thing up in stronger winds.usage- crank the handle....easy.Concerns: the legs are a little bit flimsy by itself. With the stones added it seems to be stable, but if you have a chance of doing a concrete base that may just be the better way to go.I see needle holes were there umbrella fabric is sewn. If that will result in braking fabric later I can not say yet. If It happens I will state it here in an update.All in all I am a very happy buyer, this thing looks great, was very cheap and as always quickly delivered by Amazon.It is in the same league then umbrellas at the big box stores with 3 times the price. In fact I have seen the exact same umbrella under a different name (OEM) at a big box store and other sellers online for up to 399$.A helpful vote if you feel like my review did in fact help you would be greatly appreciated! If you feel like I wrote BS, make that clear too. If you have questions pls let me know and I will answer if I can
B0012NTQ68 Here in southern Alabama it get very hot in the Summer.  I purchased this umbrella to provide shade while working at the grill.  It works great and, with its offset, is completely out of the way while coking.  I love it, and my grand kids think it is pretty cool.  Highly recommend to anyone looking for a grill shade.
B0012NTQ68 Easy to assemble, but not sure I'd want to leave this outside all summer without a cover on it for some protection during storms.  The fabric seems to be pretty thin, although it is definitely cooler sitting under it.  It's a market umbrella, meaning at the very top there is a separate layer of material that sits over the other, allowing for some ventilation and should handle better in the wind.  This model does not come with a tilt adjustment.At just under 5 feet 4 inches, I'm not tall enough to raise or lower the umbrella even when standing on the patio blocks; an inch or two too short.  I need a step stool.It was a little breezy out today.  Just enough to make the open umbrella move around a lot.  It dips, spins and will even cause the arm to twist.  Not bad, just a little weird at first, although I definitely wouldn't want it open if the wind was any higher.  I went in for a while with the umbrella still up.  When I came out again later with a step stool to lower it, the umbrella was still expanded, but the arm was no longer locked in the upright position and had slid all the way down.  I'm assuming all of the bouncing around from the wind caused it to unlock.  Hope this doesn't become an issue.
B0012NTQ68 Easy to setup. Had to purchase 4 triangle umbrella weights from HomeDepot (25 lbs, $15 each).2 weights didn't hold the umbrella from falling. 4 weights are just right.Provides good shade on the deck and doesn't take lot of space.One small con though: during summer and fall this umbrella (when collapsed) served as a shelter for stink bugs that invaded Maryland in 2010.
B0012NTQ68 I bought this last summer based on the positive reviews that it had.  I was hoping for the best and this was a great umbrella while it lasted (about 2 months), but the top bar snapped during a light wind gust one day.  BAM! The umbrella was open and it just suddenly landed on the table underneath it. The pole was still standing, just the fabric part of the umbrella (where it was attached at the top center) is what broke off.  From the beginning I knew it never could be open on a slightly windy day because of blowing over.  You can only have this open on a day when the air is very still.  You must also buy patio blocks or some sort of weighted devices to keep it in place.  I couldn't believe how quickly it tipped over every day I had it opened when there was any bit of a breeze.  It was not repairable and I had to throw it out before mid-summer. It did give nice shade while it lasted so I gave it one star.
B0012NTQ68 This is a great umbrella. Easy to assemble(less than 5 minutes) and constructed to last. The mobility of this unit is a nice feature. Remember though, I suggest some concrete pavers to weigh this down if you dont intend to anchor it. It is unstable if you dont use the pavers. Besides that Im extremely pleased with this purchase. It comes in handy and easy to move around if needed. BUY THIS FOR THE SHADE.....This thing is just awesome. It looks huge at 10 ft. We have put it up on the edge of our pool which gives a nice little shaded area to swim in. So it has worked out great. As far as needing 400lbs of whatever to keep it weighed down and stable is nuts. 4 concrete pavers as I said before. But if you get a freaking thunderstorm or something with some serious wind then of course its going to tip over. Heck, I tip over in a serious thunderstorm with wind. So go out and buy one. All I need now is a nice patio set to go with it at a descent price.Update... I just wanted to mention something that I came across during the use of this umbrella. The plastic clip that helps hold the pole and umbrella in place is , as other reviews have stated, very fragile and cheap. I have removed the plastic clip and replaced it with a pole clamp that is similar to what they use in subs to repair holes in pipes. I cant remember the name of this clamp but you can get it a Home Depot for 6 bucks and it fits perfect. It is silver in color though and if you dont mind that your fears of the clamp breaking will be relieved. Youll find it in the plumbing section.
B0012NVHVU Patio umbrellas come in a wide variety of styles, quality and price.  I thought that for what I paid, I was just going to get one of those \"good enough\" products.  It's only been a few days, so I can't comment on longevity, but I will comment on out-of-the-box impressions.First, the umbrella fabric is gorgeous.  Thick and glossy, it looks like a high-quality product.  Second, the metal is aluminum -- perfect for rust-free outdoor use.  Third, the vent.  I live in a windy area, so I've seen these umbrellas snap.  Aluminum is a great lightweight rust-free metal, but it's not as strong as heavier materials.  The vent helps alleviate the stress. Last -- and my favorite -- the hand crank: far superior to those pulley systems, or worse, the climb-up-on-the-tabletop-and-insert-the-metal-pin types.  LOVE this umbrella and I'm hoping to update this review with a favorable review on longevity too.
B0012NVHVU I had got a table & chair set from a nationwide home improvement chain store, the matching umbrella was close to $200, I thought it was overpriced, so I started to do some online shopping, i.e. amazon.com, search for an umbrella, came across this one, and thought the price was good and it had a 4-star review, and it did mention that this umbrella would tilt in one of the reviews, turned out to be false. Other than that, this has exceeded my expectation, good built-quality, should last quite a while. Plus it doesn't require any assembly. What more can you ask for for a little over $40. The one I bought was in beige.
B0012NVHVU This is one huge umbrella. It is sturdily made and affords ample shade on hot days.In case you are wondering how strong this product is, consider this: a few days ago, on a clear afternoon with no sustained winds, a dust devil tore into my yard.  The updraft it created lifted the umbrella, with its attached 30 pound base, and dragged everything nearly ten feet across the patio, destroying the screen to my dining room window in the process. I wish I could say that the Umbrella was undamaged, but I'd be lying.  However, watching the umbrella lift and carry that heavy base and table is proof that it is a sturdy and solid product!
B0012NVHVU This is the fifth inexpensive umbrella I have purchased on Amazon since 2007 so that's about one per year.  Usually the wind takes them out though the last one was just terrible - the canopy itself was attached poorly to the frame and the cord that lifted the umbrella broke after about 30 days (that item is no longer sold on Amazon).This one out of the box and in the table is great so far but I COMMIT to coming back to add to this review in a few months to comment on the durability.  It seems like anyone can put together a seemingly decent umbrella but how they perform longer-term is what I'm interested in when I purchase one.Here the pro's and con's so far:Pro's:- Nice crank, works with a satisfying \"click\" and is easy to turn- Good canopy, blocks the light, stitching is well-sewn, only one loose thread (cosmetic)- Center pole is standard sized... my last umbrella required a larger than normal hole (2.5\")Con's:- The supports for the umbrella are aluminum.  Some higher-end umbrellas (which admittedly at this price this is not!) use PVC/plastic which gives more in the wind.  I suspect these \"arms\" will be the weak link of this umbrellaOverall this is a screaming deal at $42 even if the thing only lasts one summer.  So far, so good, highly recommended!Update 7/8:  This umbrella survived 4th of July picnics and some pretty gusty winds... operation is still excellent and it's holding up well so far!UPDATE June 2014:  This umbrella is still going strong, works and looks GREAT!  I am very pleased with this umbrella.
B0012NVHVU Amazon recently ran this for $36.70, including super saver shipping.  I had looked extensively in brick and mortar stores, and this umbrella for that price cannot be purchased in those places.  The cost will be more like double at best.  The umbrella opens and closes easily, which I appreciate.  The metal construction is definitely welcome; my last one was wood and warped in one season.  The thing I like best is that it looks so much more expensive, and it is very sturdy as well.  I will update this review later as to how the umbrella frame and fabric withstand the extremely hot weather we get from July through October.  I bought the green one, and the color is dark, and just what I wanted.
B0012NVHVU This umbrella does the job, but it's hard to get it to stand up straight (I have a new umbrella base, so I don't think it's that), the umbrella seems to always lean to the side slightly, which is a bit annoying. The crank handle to raise/lower the umbrella is great though, much better than the pulley string ones.
B0012NVHVU Originally I would give this 4-5 stars but after only a few months the stitching and material at the ends where the poles secure into already started to tear.  I had to manually restitch in order to keep the poles from piercing through the material.  Aside from the material the umbrella open and retracts smoothly.  We've had no issues mechanically with it.  From time to time it will tip over in winds 15+mph despite the air vents.
B0012NVHVU I don't believe in paying more than $50 for these anymore. I live in Northern California, so these are left out year-round and tend to break down after a year. This umbrella is holding up as well as it's $200 predecessor. I have no complaints.
B0012QLVRM I've had several electric leaf blowers. Most of them were fine for the yard and leaves, but if I wanted to quick sweep my garage/basement, they were so powerful that took all the dirty on the floor and just put into the air as dust, only to settle over everything.This is a small blower, 5 pounds, sounds like a hair dryer. But, on low speed it blows all of the leaves, dirt, dust, etc., out of my garage without raising a cloud of dust. On high, it makes easy work of the patio, porch, steps, drive and sidewalk. It also is good for scattered leaves and small branches from shrubbery.I would not tackle a yard full of hardwoods in the Autumn with this, I don't think the power is adequate. But to just grab this lightweight, efficient tool for weekly clean up after hedge trimming, cutting the yard, etc, it works fantastically. I recommend it.
B0012QLVRM - Powerful enough to move a good amount of leaves- not overly loud- two speeds is perfect when you want to tone it down- price is unbeatable....you could spend that much on a rake.- wet leaves move pretty well, but this isnt a huge push blower either. It has its limitations.- I keep a cheap tarp and a rake handy for when the piles are too great...Itake a tarp out to the street then blow the rest off.- Overall its a great help- it wont DO all the work for you, but for the price, I really like it.
B0012QLVRM I just wanted to blow dry my car after I wash it just like the car wash.  I looked around and decided on this.  It works as a car dryer.I start with the roof first.  That takes only a minute per side to get all the water from the little nooks of the rack.  Then I proceed to the windows and windshield.  Then last is the body.I can get the mini-van reasonably dry in about 10 minutes.  The nice part is that it can real get into the little spaces that rags cannot reach.  I do not have to wash rags ever again!!!
B0012QLVRM I'm really happy with this, especially for the price. It's light, quiet and powerful. In fact, for leaf blowing and similar, I find the low setting is all I need, because the air flow is so well directed. Plus, the low speed is very quiet for a leaf blower, not much louder than a blow dryer. It also seem quite well made and solid. Of course, it is corded, so if you have a really big yard, you might do well with a battery-powered or gas model. But if a corded model will work for you, I would buy this and the save money. I definitely recommend this.
B0012QLVRM I bought this to blow the sand and debris off of my porch that my animals drag up. I have a lot of plants furniture etc, and it is a pain to move everything to sweep. So I just use this every other day for a couple of minutes and all done. Makes my life a breeze! I am very impressed at how powerful it is, it gets all the muck out from between the wood too. Highly recommend.
B0012QLVRM This blower is an an inexpensive blower that works well on most jobs and you don't have to spend a lot on a gas blower but you do have to contend with the electric cord.
B0012QLVRM This blower is exactly what I wanted and more!  It is lightweight and easy to manuever.  Actually, it is so light that I was surprised by the powerful force it has!I have been able to blow cobwebs out of the eaves of my house with it, which is not usually easy since those are sticky, yuck!  When I edge my sidewalk, I follow it up with the blower, and it gets stuff that I didn't realize was down there in the skinny edging ditch I just created.Sometimes we end up with an accumulation of yard waste along the curb in front to the house, which flowed down from other houses in their sprinkler water.  The resulting mess of green material and water is nasty.  This blower moves it all, helping to clear the front of my curbs and allow water to flow freely again.I rarely sweep my back patio anymore.  I can usually clear it in 60 seconds with this blower, rather than 10 minutes of sweeping.  Plus it looks better than when I sweep, as it is far more thorough.This may not seem like an essential yard tool to some, but once I had it, I wondered why I waited so long to get it!
B0012QLVRM We use our little Toro blower all the time to quickly blow leaves from our porch and walk.  I keep it in the closet next to the back door, it's much faster than sweeping.
B0012QLVRM This little leaf blower is effective in blower debris, but only in the high speed mode. Forget the low speed; it is simply not strong enough. The cord attachment \"lock down\" design is bad; the cord got pulled off several times on my first use. Not as powerful as the reviews here had me believe, but effective in small jobs that I will be using it for. It is not strong enough to remove cob-webs.
B0012QLVRM We have a rental house, wanted something small and easy to use for just cleaning off the driveway, patios, and even the garage.  This little guys is light, convenient, not too loud, and has just enough power to clean up what we have to clean.  Not sure I would try to use it to blow the entire yard for all the fall leaves, but that wasn't what I needed it for.  Perfect addition to my garage.
B0012QLVRM I got this for my sister as a new house warming gift and she loves it. Its light weight and powerful and does a good job. Its electric so you have to have the extension cord but its better then a gas powered one where you have to prime and pull start it and then smell like gasoline from the exhaust blowing on you.
B0012QLVRM The battery powered Black and Decker was convenient for cleaning the deck but annoyingly lost power at inopportune times. Rather than buy a more powerful and more expensive cordless sweeper, I opted for a corded model and narrowed the choices to this one and several Weedeater models. The Toro is slightly more expensive, but I like the two speed feature.So how is it? The power is superior to that of my cordless B&D; blower and not even close to that of my gas-powered Stihl. Yet I have no complaints, since each sweeper has its niche for Spud Acre chores. I've used this Toro to sweep our large deck, clear sidewalks and \"rake\" leaves and give it an A- for all. For moving the thousands of acorns lying on the ground at this moment, I'd award it a C+ or a B-, though the acorn mass presents a formidable opponent.I like that the Toro is just powerful enough to blow leaves off of the gravel driveway, but not powerful enough to blow away the gravel along with the leaves.  The lower of the two speeds is much quieter and is good for blowing leaves off of our non-garaged cars and for clearing the foundation beds in front of the house.I wish that the blower attachment were a couple inches longer, but that shouldn't be a deal breaker.With modest expectations, most buyers should be satisfied with this sweeper. With Amazon prime the tool was delivered to my house in two days. Nice!
B0012QLVRM This thing blows.  I like to use it to blow leaves and grass clippings into the street.  I am batman.
B0012RS2I2 I bought this for my Q240 and it fits perfectly. In fact, it fits a bit too perfectly. It's form fitting and hard to slide over the top, especially if you're a bit tipsy.
B0012RS2I2 I own the Weber Q and it sits on the rolling cart.  I have owned this grill for about 6 years and love it.  Before discovering this cover, I was using theWeber Q Vinyl Coverwhich left the cart and tank exposed to harsh weather.  This cover is made from strong durable materials and covers everything.  No more replacing tank hoses that they been dried out from the sun or having theWeber Aluminum Drip Pansblowing out in high winds or exposed to bugs.  Since it is from Weber you know you are getting a high quality product.  Highly recommended for any Weber Q owner, you won't be disappointed.
B0012RS2I2 I could not remember which Q grill we had bought a few months back so when i ordered this it was kind of like a gamble which turned out to be a good gamble that paid off at the end.Quality wise its great, the price was ideal and of course it sits on the grill great too my only -1 star is that although it is clearly shown in the picture that the tire/wheel is supposed to be out i don't like that because the weather still gets to that part so its kind of like what was the point really to just stop there? A few more inches and i would say this was absolutely perfect.Definitely recommend and would buy this again.
B0012RS2I2 covers grill seems heavy duty has held up for some time during winter.  it does what a cover would do it covers.
B0012RS2I2 Well made, keeps grill out of the elements and it even fits the Q-100 and the folding picnic cart combo!
B0012RS2I2 A great cover.  Easy to put on and take off.  Fits just right.  I like the quality of the material.  I think that anything that has the Weber name is quality.
B0012RS2I2 I was apprehensive about ordering this cover from Weber.  While it is sized to accommodate the two Weber products I own (the Weber 386002 Q 100 Portable Propane Gas Grill and Weber 6549 Weber Q Rolling Cart), I wasn't sure of the cover's quality.  It would seem my apprehension was unfounded.  The cover is durable and a perfect fit.
B0012RS2I2 The cover is made of a nice heavy material. No junk here! It fits the Weber Q200 grill perfectly. The cover goes all the way down to the bottom of the cart. It is a snug fit that requires no ties or straps to hold it on. I hope it lasts for years.
B0012RS2I2 I own the Weber Q 200 and the Weber 6508 Stationary Cart. I wanted to keep the grill clean and dry since I store it outside. It was also important for me that the tank was kept out of sight and this cover accomplishes both of those things.This cover completely encloses the entire grill and the cart. It is a nice fit and I think that it is reasonably priced. I am hoping that is keeps my Weber from being noticed too much so it doesn't get stolen like my last one did.Weber 54601 Stationary Cart for Weber Q Grills 200 and 220Weber 396002 Q 200 Gas Grill
B0012XXD4Y Well made and it allows me to use a 20+ pound propane tank instead of small tanks that are expensive and wasteful. If I were to go camping I would use the small tanks but since the grill is used on my deck and permanently mounted there is no reason to use throwaway products.The hose fit perfectly and is well made so I couldn't be more pleased.
B0012XXD4Y Not much to say on this one.  It works, I have 2 full size tanks so this makes using the Weber Q at home hassle free without wasting portable bottles.
B0012XXD4Y Hooked it up to my Q 100 and a 20lb tank. Works great.... I wish it came with the Q100 rather than a separate purchase.... if you have a Weber Q grill its really nice to be able to use either propane setups.
B0012XXD4Y This was a gift for a friend, along with a Weber Q,  and it's rolling stand.  I have not personally used it, but my friend is raving about the BBQ.  He set the unit up right out of the boxes,  and began cooking.  He is an ex-professional chef, and loves the set.
B0012XXD4Y this is a massive 6 foot hose i was expecting something completely different but, when in  rome.  start the music.
B0012XXD4Y This product is straightforward. It works well if you don't want to use the small cylinders. By using a larger propane tank (10lb) I save time, money and the environment.Update: failed after 3 months use. Small round platic piece fell out of the pin hole bbq connector causing gas to leak, a serious hazard.
B0012XXD4Y I have the weber with the gas starter on charcoal, and the small bottle work well enough and last a while but this lets you hook it up to a full size gas bottle and start your grill all year on one bottle.  Its especially handy if you have plenty of the larger propane tanks kicking around for other purposes.I havent left it outside long enough to see if critters eat it like other people suggest.  I'm guessing that those hoses had some grease run down the line from the grill and thats why it was nibbled on.  I cant really say it has an appetizing smell.
B00138MO16 These things work pretty well.  I used to use the weber starter cubes.  The only issue i had with the weber cubes was that when you take it out of the package, you get little pieces that break off all over the place.  The main thing i like about these starter squares is that you can break them into smaller pieces and shove them into the charcoal to light it.I always ran into the problem with the weber cubes having to sit them on the ground and burn my grass whereas the starter squares being placed right in the chimney i no longer have that issue.The only thing i dont like about these squares is that they seem to smoke up a lot.  Not an issue tho
B00138MO16 It makes it very easy to safely start the fireplace logs.I enjoyed the warmth and light almost every day.
B00138MO16 This stuff really works. Just using four of these bricks, as directed, and this worked quickly and every time. Will buy again.
B00138MO16 Excellent product and works like a charm.  I utilize these when lighting my charcoal grills and campfires.  Easy to light and they burn long enough to light the coals!  Wonderful.
B00138MO16 These squares are great for starting any type of fire. They have wax in them so getting them wet won't matter. They can be used with a fire starter as well.
B00138MO16 These are great fire starters. A must have for camping. I discovered something similar to this product a year ago and loved it, only it was sold in smaller packs for a high price. I was glad to find this, this will last me a long time and it's a great deal.
B00138MO16 I've been using these squares for two seasons now with good success. The squares are easy to break apart and are easy to light. It's great that the squares keep burning long enough for the kindling set above them to catch and get a good fire going quickly.Using these squares and a piece or two of Fatwood for insurance, I almost always get a good fire going quickly.Unlike other other larger firestarters, these are not messy on the hands and don't take up much room. About the only problem I have now with my fires is when I forget to open the damper like I did the other day. That really puts a damper on things.
B00138MO16 So far, the best price in on Amazon.  If someone knows of a better one - let me know please.We heat our house strictly with a wood stove so this is a great product to have.  It won't replace kindling (unless your wood is super dry) but it does replace paper.  Keep in mind that paper burns for less than 20 seconds while this products burns for a couple minutes and gets a good flame going long enough to really ignite the fire.This is important for those hurried mornings when the fire is out and I don't have time to light 5-6 piles of paper to get a dead fire going.  I can simply light a brick under kindling - walk away and come back to a roaring fire.  Occasionally it doesn't work (will not work on wet wood), but I would say for us - it works 24 times out of 25.  Enough for me.
B00138MO16 I've been a diehard user of the Lightning Nuggets Firestarters 100 count that sells for about twenty five a box. I'm cheap and always looking for an alternative because the Lightning Nuggets are really too large for me and I didn't really want to cut a bunch in half on the scroll saw. These are small and the burn rate is pretty accurate in the 15 minute range. With these selling at around fifteen for a box of 144 that reduced my cost-per-start from a quarter to about a dime and that's better than if I cut what I have in half.If you don't care about some dirty hands and smoke then use some crumpled newspaper and a cheap lighter. I have an old Blaze King wood stove and when it's cold it's hard to get a good draft to draw the smoke up and out so these little smokeless lighters really work for me... and there's no newspaper delivery here.I wouldn't recommend these if you don't have some really dry kindling and logs. I use the Lightning Nuggets if I have some damp wood to get the extra burn time on the start. These come in 12 thin bricks that are scored with 12 starters that you must break off to use. They light easily, don't burn out and I'd recommend them in a heartbeat.
B0013CCO08 I purchased one of these (not from Amazon) a few months ago and I am reasonably happy with it so far. However, there are some issues.After 3-4 months of use I can testify that the Cascata is a great way to deliver water to a small garden patch in my backyard without breaking a sweat - when it gets hot and dry, I simply attach a hose that branches into a network of drip soaker tubes and I don't need to worry about it much. The top, which is supposed to be a planter, I keep it as a small bird bath.I can't say anything about customer support because I did not need any help yet.This is what I like about this product:- Large capacity. 65 gallons is a lot of water but this is okay because one big downpour may be enough to fill it up where I live.- Good looks.- Setup seems to be easy but, I must admit, I chose to hire a professional to set up the base, connect the down spout and make sure that the connection to the soaker tubes fit.Issues:- The accessories do not seem to match the quality and design of the barrel itself.- The overflow hose is not sufficient to keep up with the inflow during a heavy rain so, if you have a finished basement, be very careful.- The 20 year warranty covers the barrel only and none of the accessories so, unless the barrel cracks or explodes on its own and you capture that on a video and you can provide 'proof of purchase', don't expect much from the warranty.Rating:I hesitate between 3 and 4 stars. The serious overflow issues and the warranty tell me that I should grant this 3 stars but the fact that it worked well ever since installation bumps up the score to 4. It is possible that, had I interacted with the customer service my ratings were lower - from the others' reviews - but, since I didn't, I can't factor in 'support' so the 4 stars should be viewed within that context.
B0013CCO08 I use the Algreen Cascata Rain Water Collection and Storage System, 65 Gallons, for the Collection of Rain Water for later drinking or watering of my beet garden.For the first few months I got this, it never was filled up even though it rained all day, turns out I forgot to hook it up to a spout. What I used was an old sewer pipe line that swings from my roof down into it.At times I noticed an odd odor and there were dead mice or cockroaches floating in it so be sure to clean it out regularly with a toothbrush or a used toilet bowl scrub cleaner.Sometimes I just take this to a gas station and fill it up with free water. You can also use it to store dead tadpoles or as a holding tank for rabid skunks. I have two so I fill another one up with vinegar to take baths with.

B0013CCO08 I bought this a few months ago from warehouse deals for about $10 less as the box was crushed.  The rain barrel was in perfect shape.  We set this up at the corner of our house and I did put it on some landscape bricks so I could get a sprinkling can under the faucet easily.  My husband made a few holes in the top so I could plant flowers.  The weather here in Michigan has not been warm enough to plant anything in there yet, but I have flowers ready to put in there hopefully soon.  The barrel looks great just the way it is.  I have gotten many compliments from people walking down the street on how nice it looks at the corner of the house.  Getting water from just the faucet is obviously not as fast coming out as a home faucet, but I found if I put the sprinkling can under the faucet and put the hose in there also the can filled up pretty fast.  The hose that came with this had a bad kink in it and I called Algreen and they fed-ex'd to me the replacement hose and I got it within a day or two.  Great customer service there.I would like to do something with the two overflow tubes.  We have had alot of rain recently and the water shoots out of the back very fast.  I put a splash block on the ground under these tubes and it does help to carry the water away from the house and drain onto my lawn.  I am considering a second barrel or buying some hose if I could find the correct size to put on the back tubes to drain this water still farther away from the house.I did buy from Amazon the pump that goes with this to get the water out quicker when using a hose.  I have not used this yet; will comment on that later if it ever dries out here.
B0013CCO08 Well, we must have gotten lucky because we haven't had any of the issues I have read here. I got the barrel on a Tuesday evening and had it in place on Weds. The Brass fittings and hose fit snugly and with no leaks or crimps. I needed to modify the downspout a bit but with Home Depot close by it was a breeze. I'm interested in the postings where people in the northeast have left their rain barrels in place during the winter. I may/may not do that depending upon further investigation. These rain barrels are well made and indeed they look like terra cotta. They are handy near gardens or plants that need to be watered. Yes they do take a bit of time to fill watering cans but whats the rush? I am pleased with my purchase but wish they weren't so damned expensive. I'll probably pick up another next Spring.
B0013E3TXC About a week ago, our snow finally melted and I was greeted by early spring vole tracks. Hoping that winter was finally done, I installed this mole spike after making a pilot hole and burying it up to its panel. The spike then began to send out its sonic pulses, as expected. Unfortunately, we recently got another covering of snow, but the last time I checked, this spike was still busy pulsing away. I'm hoping that it survives our sudden cold blast. Of course, the true test will be in about a month when pest activity increases, but for now it seems to be working as described.
B0013E3TXC This review is for Sweeney's Mole and Gopher Solar Spike.  The spike works.  I have a groundhog problem. I don't have any moles, so I can't tell if it works for them.  But ever since I put this in the ground, the groundhogs have stopped making appearance. I also have a humane trap out in case they do come into my garden, but they have not come by in a whole week.  They usually come around every day.  So if I do see them, I will update the review.Details: The spike is slightly more than 11\" tall and 1\" wide, while the top part is 2.5\" x 2.5\" (square). The solar cell is 1.5\" x 1.5\".  Make a pilot hole in the ground first, then insert the spike. There's an ON/OFF switch to turn on the spike. The audible sound and vibration is noticeable. If your ground is dense, the vibration will travel further. If not, the range won't be too far.  The spike should be removed if in a flooding area, and also before the ground freezes.
B0013E3TXC We have only had this in a few weeks and the weather is still cold here in the mountains, so it hasn't gotten a true test yet. However, so far so good. I haven't seen any new activity. Because of our dogs I absolutely do not put any poisons out for rodents, etc. (including decon, which can poison a lot of different animals including my lovely birds). I am always searching for non poisonous methods that are not dangerous to our pet and small children. I also love the fact that this doesn't use batteries or make a loud noise. I had one that made an audible beep and found it was annoying when sitting in the garden. I will have to visit again in a few months when summer is here and all the plants are in the garden to see how it holds up through the growing season.
B0013E3TXC I like the idea of this product, I have used similar, non-solar spikes in the past with great success.  They seem to work but installing and caring for them is made very difficult by the solar panel on the top of the spike.  It is hard to install these without being able to hammer them into the ground at some point, and the tops are way too fragile for that.  We managed to get them into the ground by making a sizable hole and then burying them but that seems like it would impact their effectiveness.  One of the four has already broken -- my dog hit it while chasing a tennis ball.  Probably best to just go for the battery powered version.
B0013E3TXC This puts out a strong vibration (about 200 Hz) every few seconds.  It has an on/off switch, that must relate to the battery only, because the bursts of vibration occur even in the off position if there's sufficient sun light on the collector.  The spike is about 1\" in diameter and is made out of plastic.  They warn that you should use something else to make a hole in the ground and then install the spike.  That's really my only gripe about the unit.  They could have provided some cheap hole maker.  I couldn't find anything in my stuff to make the hole, so I just used a shovel and then back filled  around the unit.  I think the vibrations would travel farther if there was a hard pack around the unit and my fill will take a while to pack sufficiently.  I suspect that it will be sufficiently irritating to most gophers so they will move on, but this is the kind of device that is hard to state that it works.  With few data points, you have a hard time ruling out the possibly that the gophers just didn't come around this year, but I think it should work.
B0013E3TXC I started using this \"device\"  after finding evidence of a mole in my yard, but I believe the mole left before I inserted this \"solar spike\", so I can't at this point be particularly positive or negative about the product. I do plan on using it again if more moles or gophers appear this spring, so I will follow up on this review then.Review Update as of September 1, 2013:  Having used this device for a reasonable period of time, I can attest to the fact that it apparently does not work!  Another reviewer has said that it seems to work, but only in harder soils. The reason it \"seems\" to work in hard soils is that moles don't LIKE hard soil, so they move to where you are watering or elsewhere to soft soil.  I recently noticed a HUGE mole hole just a couple feet from this Sweeney spike, where the soil is softer. Moles really don't seem to mind these sonic devices, because as long as they find soft soil, they quickly adapt to the sonar output.
B0013E3TXC Moles or gophers had wreaked havoc in my backyard lawn by digging up holes and leaving sizable mounds of dirt here and there.  I triedHavahart Critter Ridder 3146 Animal Repellent, 5-Pounds Granular Shakernear the damaged areas but the critters simply dug holes around other areas without the repellent; can't preemptively place the Havahart deterrent because can't predict where critters will dig.  This Sweeney's Mole and Gopher Solar Sonic Spike deterrent seems like a viable alternative solution!Likes:>I followed the instructions on the box by making a pilot hole first with an old metal rod so it was easy to insert into semi-moist soil.>Emits a low, intermittent beep when activated by sunlight (even with the power switch off and only audible when close to the solar spike).>I made sure not to insert all the way down to the mini solar panel to facilitate easy removal.>Even placed a my own clear screen protector (surplus) to prevent scratches to the solar panel.>So far, after a week, no new holes dug up by critters!Dislike:>Entire solar spike is not very visible once inserted down to grass level.  The mini solar panel top may be damaged if not removed prior to mowing, children playing, or just walking across on the lawn.Overall:An install and forget garden tool that's currently helping deter gophers/moles from digging up my backyard lawn.  Long term effectiveness and durability is unknown.***Updated June 24, 2014.  Within the last two months we've had another gopher outbreak in the backyard.  This solar spike no longer works as a gopher deterrent, but became an attractant.  The wily gophers dug holes right next to the solar spike.  Could be used to attract gophers to bait or traps.
B0013E3TXC I'll come back in a update on this if anything changes over time, but it seems like these spikes actually work.  I've had this one operating in my yard now for about 2 1/2 weeks.  I don't think it works as well over a big area, but I intend to buy several more.  I was afraid that the noise the spike makes would bother my dogs, but they don't even notice when it emits it's little sound every 30 seconds.  I notice it, but it doesn't bother me.  Apparently the gophers don't like it though, because activity has ceased in my back yard.  Soil type and what kinds of things you have that actually go down into the ground can influence how well it works, too, and you have to make sure that the soil comes up around it closely.  A lot of the possibility for success with this has to do with what kind of soil you have and what else is below ground in your yard.  But when it does work, so far it works very well.  Summer is coming, so we'll see how it does then.  I plan to buy several more so that it will cover all over my yard and maybe my plants will have time to grow thick roots before the gophers find them.
B0013E3TXC Hang on there... UPDATE ...  May 27, 2012They work, yes, but they only work for about three months.At this rate I need to replace 6 of them every 3 months at $20 - $25 each, that's $120 - $150 and annually $480 - $600.  I'm going to try propane gas next.  Someone mentioned using lit flares shoved down into the holes but the chances of lighting my whole garden and home on fire is a bit worrisome.I'm going to check other manufactures, too.---------O----------Earlier ReviewI've tried nearly everything from cyanide graduals to chocolate flavored ex-lax, yes, Ex-Lax.  I was ready to put carbide graduals down into the tunnels in order to 'gas' them to death.  While at the hardware store one of the employees vouched for this Sweeney's Solar Mole/Gopher Stake (spike).I-T - W-O-R-K-S !!!I paid $25 for ONE stake/spike.  I just ordered two for $25 right here on Amazon!NOTE:  The moles/gophers eventually get used to the vibration/sound, so you have to relocate them about once a month.  They work best in hard clay soil because that allows the vibration/sound to carry further.I wish I could meet Sweeney... I'd give her/him a big hug!  My garden is doing so nicely without the moles.
B0013E3TXC Solar mole repeller works fine. It's been run over by the mower, so the plastic cover and part of the base got cracked, bigtime. It kept working and I didn't realize the damage until I pulled it up. I've had it 2 years. When I pulled it up for the winter this year, water poured out the cracks, so I'm ordering a replacement just in case. I have mostly DENSE CLAY SOIL with some surface amendments, and I'd imagine that soil quality has a lot to do with transfer of the sound. Same goes for a solar-powered fence charger...it also works well here because of the clay soil. But the fence charger stake goes deeper into the ground, about 6 feet and theoretically could overcome looser surface soil.The mole repeller stake goes into the ground only 10 inches... I pre-punched a slightly narrower hole in the ground for it, so as not to smash it trying to push it in up to the max 10 inches. I also put some soil around and packed it in to make sure of good contact.Buy it because it does work, but be mindful of your soil density. If you've got real loamy great super-duper soil, 10 inches deep, it might not be optimally effective...just my hunch.I love solar stuff. Set it and forget it. Except remember to MARK where it is so it doesn't get damaged, and make sure the area around stays clear so SUN can hit the top. It does make an intermittent buzzy noise, but to me, here in a rural area, it is not bothersome.BTW, I turned it off when I pulled it 2 weeks ago and it still is holding the charge...can turn it on and it buzzes...am about to order a 2nd one for back-up.
B0013E3TXC I just got this and have not had much springtime gophr activity yet to test it on but it seems very well made.  I ordered it because it does not take batteris which is a great improvement over my last product of this type and it goes in the ground so far that you can  mow right over it instead of mowing it off.  I had alot of moles in my garden lt year and am looking forward to see how thi product works on them.  I have tried sevral other solutions and they haven't worked.  I was down to this or traps which are a pain.  Hoping this works well.Will update during the growing season.
B0013E3TXC The Amazon description of this product appears to be incorrect (and contradictory).1. This item is totally solar powered and does not require you to insert batteries. There is a rechargeable battery in there, so that it can continue to work at night.2. It emits an irritating sound, about 1.5 seconds long, every 7 seconds or so. I don't know how irritating it is for gophers and moles, but it is irritating everyone else in the house.The sound, however, does not travel very far. Within 25 ft the sound level in the air drops off significantly. Sound conducts much better in the ground (especially moist clayish soil) so would travel farther underground.There's an on / off switch. I'm not sure if my unit is defective or if this is as designed. In On position, it will emit the sound as long as the battery has power. In Off position, it will emit sound when the sun is shining directly on it.The construction is plastic, so definitely use something else to make a pilot hole first (the instructions mention that as well) or it will definitely break - unless you are blessed with really soft soil that goes down very thick.The solar panel is small and needs good sun exposure to recharge the batteries, so placement on a lawn is rather tricky. You want it low enough so that lawnmowers will go over it, yet high enough so that grass will not cover it too much. Mine was meant to protect my vegetable beds, so it's at the side of a walking path.Gophers have been eating some of my garden plants, and castor oil pellets have not been effective. In the 3 weeks that I've been using this, I've lost 2 additional plants. That appears to be an improvement over losing 1 plant every night before I started using this. I'm cautiously optimistic, but I bought a gopher trap as a backup in case this doesn't work. I'll update this in another couple of months regarding effectiveness.
B0013E3TXC I put this in my front yard shortly before gopher season.  That was a little more than a week ago.  The gophers are digging holes in my back yard, but there are no new holes in my front yard.  Since this Mole and Gopher Spike is the only thing different between the two yards, I can confidently deduce that it's the spike that's keeping the gophers away.  I really like that there are no batteries to replace, and I plan on buying a few for my back yard.The spike treats 7,500 square feet.  That's about 90 feet in every direction from the spike.  I can't say how it will work in every soil density, but this spike works very well in my heavy clay soil.
B0013E3TXC Hard to tell how well it works with moles and gophers, but I installed it in the relatively hole-y yard area that I intend to be a vegetable garden soon. I put it in once the snow was gone and the ground had thawed enough to insert it into the ground. The switch did not appear to work, it's on either way, but for a solar device that seems okay to me. Quite audible periodic 400Hz sound. Will see when the garden goes in if it has worked...
B0013E3TXC I have a ridiculous amount of mole activity in my lawn.  The little buggers push up mounds big enough for a major league pitcher and even when I clean them up, I wind up with rocks in my lawn just lying in wait to destroy my mower blade.  I have tried the gas pellets and bait blocks with little success.  I was eager to try a less toxic approach - especially since my neighbor uses these and swears by them.  I stuck one in my front yard and haven't seen any activity in about month's time.  The noise it makes is not something only moles can hear.  It is a very noticeable, intermittent beep and I think it would be bothersome in an area where I was going to spend any amount of time.  But such is the price of war my friend. And yes this is war- a war I hope this weapon will help me win.Next, I'm going to move the spike in the back yard where they are very active and see if I can drive them away.  That will be the true test.  If that works, I'm gong to buy several more and set up a perimeter!
B0013E3TXC So we were super skeptical about this item... for a few reasons. 1 is that it's hard to prove it's working and 2 we have pets and didn't want them to get annoyed by this.The box says 7-14 days before ground rodents start to move away from the area- but we put it in a raised bed in the garden and got instant results. We had a pest that was eating our yummies. And it literally stopped coming. Maybe it's more powerful if just placed in a small bed because the power is amplified so much since it doesn't reach as far out as open ground (the product claims a radius of 95 feet).In any case we like it. 2 Caveats.1) it pulses every 36 seconds. It is audible close by. Kind of annoying when working in the garden, but easy enough to turn off with the power switch.2) the box reminds you to not try to drive it into the ground with a hammer since this would break the solar panels on top. It says to drive a pilot in with a steel rod, but probably not everyone has one with the right diameter handy. So be prepared to make a \"pilot hole\". The base is about an inch thick.
B0013E3TXC It was a lucky strike to find this available from Amazon. I have a mole problem and it's been ongoing for some time now. I refuse to poison them or inhumanely trap them, so this product was just the thing for my problem.It works. The moles stay away. I don't have to feel bad about killing them or setting them free elsewhere. However, I can hear the noise this thing makes. It's worth it for me because the moles are worse than the sound, but consider that when making your decision to buy.
B0013E3TXC When the snow thaws I'm left with a torn up lawn from the moles.  I figured that I've give this product a try as it's easy to use and doesn't cost a ton of money.  It was easy to install in my soil.  Every 30 seconds or so a sonic pulse penetrates the soil, sending off a penetrating sound which is irritating to moles and gophers.  I don't find the sound annoying at all as some have said, I hardly notice it and I've been sitting about five feet away reading in my yard.  But the moles will find the sound very annoying and want to leave your yard.  It will also discourage other moles and gophers from doing damage to your yard.  No batteries are required, you just use the sun for the solar panel.  After I inserted the device into the earth, I repaired any damage to the yard that the moles had done during the winter.  So far I haven't seen any new damage to my lawn, if I do I'll update my review.
B0013E3TXC I've been using this product in tandem with Poison Peanuts Pellets.  Between them, my chipmunk problem seems to have abated.
B0013E3TXC I ordered this in February, expecting to use it soon, but winter's weather has not lessened her grip. As soon as the snow cover melts, I'll put this out in the yard and I hope the little buggers go scurrying. Will update that soon.Reviewing this product right now seems a bit unfair to the manufacturer of this product, but then so does the new Amazon Vine policy which requires 100% compliance on reviews.Thank you!
B0013E3TXC OMG, this is cool! It really works! Every year at this time we get tons of moles. We live in Northern California near the Redwood Parks, and boy do we get hit with moles. This keeps them off my lawn! Easy to use instructions, and you will see results quickly. good luck!
B0013E3TXC I got this device to test it out for effectiveness in warding off moles. We have a mole problem in our yard and I'm leery of using poison because we have pets that dig and I don't like the idea of adding toxic chemicals to our yard. At the moment we're having construction work done at the house and I'm afraid this product would get destroyed. As soon as that's over I look forward to trying this out and I'll update the review after I've tested it.
B0013E3TXC We had a serious mole problem last year and I am opposed to harming the ugly little critters so I figured to try this and see if it would chase them away. As of this writing, we have been unable to use the product because it's only just now getting warm enough to be outdoors and the moles don't appear to be here yet. So, when it's a bit warmer, I'll try it. Having been notified by Amazon Vine that all products must be reviewed within 30 days, I am going ahead and reviewing this--but I don't think it's rational to require reviews for every single item within 30 days, due to circumstances such as this.
B0013E3TXC If you're wondering if this kind of device will work at all or is entirely hype, this type of  mole and gopher repeller can work. Will this particular device work for you, in large part it depends on your soil. I live in an area with rather solid soil that seems to carry the noise fairly well. We've been using a battery-operated device for the past better part of a decade and you can tell if you let the batteries run out because holes start to form in the yard.When I got a chance to try out this device, it looked rather interesting due to the solar panel. As mentioned, I'm fairly bad about remembering to change the battery so from time to time the gophers will come back and destroy the yard. One thing I really don't like about the spike as it seems very cheaply made. The battery powered unit we've been using is metal, but this one is entirely plastic. You're definitely going to have to make a hole with something else because this will not push through dirt. My other major complaint, the on off switch seems to be decorative only. I played with little bit in the sun and it had no effect at all. This is somewhat troubling because it may mean that the battery is constantly being drained when not in the sun, which could shorten its life span.That aside, the spike seems to work quite well for us. We've been using it as an expander to the range of our existing spike in a portion of the yard where the gophers still sometimes intruded. So far since being put in, about a week ago, there've been no further incursions. So I can say, in soil that previously had another spike working well, that this spike proved effective. However, these spikes aren't for all soil or at least in certain soil you'll need a lot more of them.  I'd suggest if possible checking the return policy when ordering or purchasing one of these devices, so you have some fallback if it doesn't work at all for you.Our previous spikes have lasted anywhere from 2 to 3 years. If this does suffer an untimely death, rest assured I'll update my review with extreme prejudice to indicate how long it lasted. Barring that though, the spike is working quite well and aside from the on/off switch not working, I mostly like it. You may want to put a piece of tape over the decorative power switch so no water can get in through there though.
B0013E3TXC As soon as I completed landscaping my new home, the moles/gophers moved in too. I have been using Exhart spikes, and I think they help, but of course they run on batteries. This Sweeney's is solar powered and is considerably louder than the Exharts. Only time will tell how long the solar system holds up, and how effective it will be in discouraging the varmints.Update Mar 2014.It's quite noisy. Sounds like a distant Vespa horn . To deaden the sound , it has to be buried leaving the solar top flush with the ground. Which is OK until leaves or other debris covers it up. Deprived of sunlight, it stops making the buzzing noise, and you can't find it. I do not have an acceptable solution to this problem.
B0013E3TXC I had intended to use this mole spike this summer to repel moles at a choke point were two concrete walls narrow down to about 15 feet apart.  If the moles are kept from entering between those walls my garden will be safe.  It is a little early for mole activity in my area, just starting to warm up, but the new Vine Program deadline for reviews is 30 days so I can't wait to see if any moles do get past this mole spike.  The device seems adequately made and was easy enough to push into the ground so I have my fingers crossed in hopes that the sound emitted will be offensive to the moles.  I can't give any more than 3 stars at this time because I don't think any moles are active to be repelled yet.July 18, 2013 update - I just finished watering my garden and discovered water running out of a collapsed mole burrow about 10 feet from the edge of the garden.  This MAY BE an old burrow from last year however ???  I haven't seen any fresh dirt from digging and that is a good. the Mole & Gopher Spike is still making noise periodically.
B0013FO2B4 Being an avid bird watcher, I was excited to get this duel Feeder/Waterer. The design is nice and simple and matches the arbor where I hung it almost perfectly (the arbor is copper with scroll designs). The size of both containers is pretty good, will probably feed birds for a couple of days before needing refilled. Not sure about the water portion, they seem to have not noticed it quite yet. I fill my other feeder with a large plastic cup (large size drink from fast food) and one of them fills the seed portion of this new feeder almost exactly.Some small things about this feeder bother me, namely the scroll design on the silo portion of the feeders is not really necessary and will most likely get dirty sooner, especially on the water side. Also not thrilled about plastic usage on those or the cap and base portions.  I had another plastic feeder in this same location and the sun and cold wore it out quite quickly - and it was thicker plastic than this one. Plastic has a tendency to break down under sunlight so I'm dubious of how long this feeder will last, especially since it's in full sun most of the time. I suppose the plastic will be easy to clean, however.For the price, it's a good feeder and will look attractive in it's new home, but I'd be willing to pay a few dollars more for glass silos and plastic-coated metal and/or REAL copper caps and bases. It will be fun to see birds balancing up and down on the feeder, but so far they've been only coming one at a time. This would make a nice gift for someone getting started with feeding birds.ADDED LATER: In the winter, this feeder has some problems, ice and snow tend to gather in the bottom and must be cleared regularly to keep feed unobstructed. As well, trying to use this for water when the temps dip below 32 degrees is totally not recommended. I'm now using this as a warm-weather-only feeder.
B0013FO2B4 This is an attractive, lightweight feeder that despite being made almost entirely of plastic does look nice and give the impression that it is copper.  It's easy to install with the included hanger -- no assembly necessary -- and the hanger's scrolled design complements the feeders nicely.  The trays and perches are very suitable to the smaller birds most folks like to attract, such as chickadees, nuthatches, and finches.I've chosen to use sunflower chips in one silo and water in the other; so far, the birds haven't shown a lot of interest in the water, although the chickadees seem to like the \"one-stop shopping\" arrangement.  My nearby neighbor has a nice birdbath, so it doesn't surprise me that birds might find the water silo's little tray less attractive.  I bet it would be a very welcome feature if you feed birds in an arid climate, however; nothing attracts birds in the desert like water!Your satisfaction with this feeder probably depends on what type of bird feeding you do.  I feed quite a lot of birds year-round with a variety of food ranging from safflower seeds to grape jelly, and this feeder probably won't be in the rotation for very long.  It doesn't hold much seed (although it is convenient that both silos can be converted to hold seed just by switching the top and bottom around).  In order to fill the silos, they must be inverted and the bottom screwed off, which means it can't be filled while it's  hanging and needs both hands to fill it; even with the decorative finial removed from the top, it doesn't sit stably enough to pour in seed without holding onto it.  This also means you'd better be able to pour from your seed container with one hand.  Flipping it over to rehang it after it's filled makes using the water silo a splashy experience, too.I prefer feeders that hold a large quantity of seed for less-frequent filling and enable convenient pouring from a large bag of seed or a large scoop.  I also prefer as few parts that must be removed for filling as possible since I'm sometimes working with mittens on my hands and trying to get out of the cold as quickly as I can.If, however, you want a small, attractive feeder that will look very nice on your deck or in your garden, you may really like this Birdscapes Sip & Seed.  It's lightweight enough to hang from a shepherd's crook or small branch.  The ports are large enough (yet also small enough) to allow you to feed many different kinds of seeds.  Offering water is always a great idea for attracting more birds, or you can easily experiment with two different kinds of seed.  If you have a setup where it's convenient to simply remove the feeder and take it inside to work with it, fiddling around with the caps and seed may not be an issue for you.  In fact, the more I think about it, the more I think I might just move it to my deck!Update:  I've been using this feeder for awhile now and am still less impressed with it.  The water silo was easily contaminated by the seed from the other silo, and between that and the hot weather, the water became foul in less than a day.  I had to switch both sides to seed (again, it's nice that this is an option).Also, we had heavy rain, and because the trays are made to hold water, they did, long enough for water to seep into the seed, causing it to swell and spoil so that none could come out of the openings.  It was easy to clean out, but irritating to have to do it.On a positive note, the feeder still looks nice despite exposure to rain and sun, and the smaller birds really like it.  Even a downy woodpecker perches and pecks at the sunflower chips.  I put a finch mix in the former water side, and it attracts a good variety, too.And, believe it or not, so far this feeder is not attractive to the squirrels in my neighborhood!  They are always checking out the hopper feeder that is right next to this one, and they destroyed a finch sock in no time flat, which had the same mix I've now got in this feeder.  For some reason, it has not occurred to any of them to hop onto this feeder and eat from/chew on it.  If this continues, the feeder will certainly stay in use!
B0013FO2B4 First let me tell you that the Birdscapes 737 Garden Sip & Seed Feeder is beautiful!  That said I have no idea how long it will stay beautiful as I do not know the quality or corrosion resistance used in constructing the rod iron hanger of this unit. [I know the feeders themselves are made of plastic - but that will last and will not rust].  I don't know if the hanger is just steel (that will rust) that is coated with a brass look-a-like coating that will chip or wear off with exposure to sun and rain in one season.  So time will tell me whether this product will last.  Right now it looks like a million bucks!!!  The only negative thing to say is it is a little balancing act in filling and hanging the water and seed feeders.  Did my best but I did get some water on me and spilled some seeds on my first attempt.  But I can't juggle more than two balls in the air at one time, so I will learn how to fill the units and spill less over time.  Again, my fingers are crossed on the durability of the product.  I bought coated potted plant hangers (that had birds welded on to the hanger and looked great) from Walmart a few years ago and today all that is left of them are pieces of rusty twisted metal that cannot be used to hang anything.  We'll see.  So until time passes and weather does its thing on these feeders I will take a leap of faith and give it 5 stars for being so darn beautiful.
B0013FO2B4 What a terrific idea - being able to have water and feed for the birds from a simple to use dual silo bird feeder. No assembly required. The plastic antique copper finish top and bottoms add sophistication. The metal copper finish scroll hanger allows you to hand one or two feeders from it. We have a deck on the second level of our ranch home and I use a deck mount bracket to hang the hanger with the feeders. This way we can view the birds easily and since it hangs outside of the deck, the empty seed shells will drop to the lawn instead of our deck flooring. Birds can be messy eaters!I am disappointed that the silos are made out of plastic and not glass. I can see the plastic getting warped and cracked over time by the sun or by larger birds pecking at it. I expect that the water will also cause a hard water film to form inside the silo over time since we have well water. I have plastic hummingbird feeders that have gotten sun bleached and the plastic has warped because of the hot sun. Since the silos are made of plastic, the one I use for water forms green algae and it is very difficult to clean. I have a feeling it is because of the birds hoping from one to another with the seed and droppings on their feet collecting at the bases of the silos.Overall it is a beautiful feeder that adds a unique look, but I don't expect it's beauty to last for years.
B0013FO2B4 We had this bird-feeder set up in no time and it looks great. We hung it on a tree in the backyard. The birds really love it, they are eating up the seed so fast it is hard to keep it filled!We haven't had any complaints about it so far and everyone that has seen it thinks it is nice.
B0013FO2B4 What a good idea. Having a bird feeder with two silos to have water and seed available right next to each other. Birdscapes excuted the idea well where birds have been flocking to it and it adds a nice elegant touch to our porch.It actually looks better in person. The tops of each feeder have a two-tone design dark brown and a copper color. Plus you have scroll work everyone. In the hanger and it is echoes on the sides of the silo. Food and water are easy to put in. Perhaps my one complaint is that the bird landing could have been bigger. Larger birds or more than 2 at a time find it hard to use this feeder.But I gave it 5 stars because birds have been using it more than our other feeders, I like having 2 silos, and it probably one of the best looking feeders I have ever had. Recommended.
B0013FO2B4 This Birdscapes 737 Garden Sip & Seed Feeder consists of two sets of clear tube between trays - one set for seeds, the other water.  The tube-and-tray sets are about 15 inches high and 6-1/2 inches across and made of plastic.  The hanger is about 12-1/2 inches long and 9 inches high and made of metal with a copper finish.  The 2-tone plastic trays are black and copper-finished.  The trays for the seed feeder have holes in them for drainage.  Look for the seed and water icons in the trays to distinguish them.  The rails around the trays are the right size for those tiny bird feet.  The tubes hold slightly over 3 cups of water or 3 cups of seeds and are closed on one end.  They must be filled from the open ends and then inverted; that can be awkward sometimes.  A finial (plastic knob) under a tray was screwed on off-center and was a manufacturing defect, albeit decorative; it could not be corrected.  I deducted one star for it.  I hung the Sip & Seed feeder in a tree.  Only the small birds can to get to the seeds and water.  The feeder is esthetically pleasing, easy to clean and reasonably easy to fill.  I am happy with this product.Update:  This feeder has a problem staying at one place in high wind.  In windy days, on several occasions, I found the seed and water tubes wedged in the tree or on the ground.
B0013FO2B4 I currently have thePerky-Pet 7103-2 Copper Triple Tube Bird Feederwhich has served us well for many years.  It holds lots of seed and has many feeding stations on it for both 'clinging feeders' like Goldfinches, Woodpeckers and Nuthatches, and 'sitting feeders' like Doves, Cardinals and Grosbeaks.This Birdscapes 737 is smaller by comparison.  The tray on the bottoms and the tubes are plastic - a much thinner plastic than the Triple Tube.  So thin that I'm afraid the tube won't last more than a couple years of outdoor exposure, but we'll see.  The platform where the birds can sit is narrow/small enough that I noticed some Mourning Doves and Cardinals avoided it because they couldn't sit and eat; smaller birds had no problem though.A marketing point for this feeder is the ability to have both water and seed in it.  The way they accomplish this is that the tubes only open on the bottom, so the water will stay in the tube.  This makes it more difficult to refill than my Triple Tube because you have to remove the feeder from the hanger, turn it over and unscrew the bottom to fill it.  The top plastic eyelet for the hanger is not flat, so you cannot set it down to fill unless you also unscrew and remove the top from the tube as well.  Also, most birds should be able to find a water source and really not need the tube filled with water unless you live in an arid area.  You can fill both tubes with seed, which is what I did because I have a backyard pond next to the feeder.
B0013FO2B4 This is a pretty little dual-purpose bird feeder/waterer.  It seems fairly sturdy, and I like the detailing and design of it.  Having the water and seed containers close to one another gives the birds a chance to get their food and water needs pretty easily.  The containers are fairly simple to fill, just make sure you use the one with the smaller slots at the bottom for water and the one with the larger slots for seed!I'm giving the setup 4 stars at this point because I'm not sure how well the plastic containers will hold up to sunlight in the long term.  Hopefully they'll give great, long service.I hung mine up from one of those shepherd's hooks you can drive into the ground - makes it easy to locate anywhere there is dirt enough to push the base in - even a large flower pot will do.  It's pretty in the yard and I'm enjoying looking out the window and watching the birds feed.
B0013FO2B4 
B0013FO2B4 I love the look of this bird feeder and waterer!  It looks great hanging outside my kitchen window.  It would absolutely be a 5 star review, except that the waterer is so close to the feeder, that birds scatter the birdseed into the water tray, and then the seeds start sprouting up inside the water holder, making weekly cleaning necessary.  I might try to modify this thing so that it has 2 seed containers instead of one of each, which appears to be possible.
B0013FO2B4 We have a lot of small birds around our home, but up until receiving theBirdscapes 737 Garden Sip & Seed Feederthe only ones I was feeding were the hummingbirds.  Before I received the feeder I was already scouting our yard for a good place to hang it.  Originally I had hoped to put it outside of a window that our cat likes to sit in, but I was vetoed on that idea. So eventually I decided to use a tree in our front yard, so that there would be no additional hardware to buy and install.Filling and attaching the feeders was relatively easy. Just make sure when you screw back on the bases which will act as the perch, that you put them on the right feeders. The seed feeder has much larger openings than the water feeder and if you mix them up, the water will flow out within seconds. Yes I did this in the rush to put them outside and I figure it's good info for others.Once I found a branch secure enough to hold the feeders it was simple to hang the hook and attach the feeders one at a time. Currently the water feeder hangs down a bit further on mine, but that can change depending on how quickly they each empty out. It took a couple days to see any activity, but I have been seeing some small finch-like birds hanging out at the seed feeder.Now if the my review were only on the ability to attract birds and for the way it looks, it would get 5 stars. Unfortunately the quality and price play a factor, so I had to remove 2 stars. I really question the durability and how well this feeder will hold up over the next year. Beyond the decorative hook, it's made entirely out of plastic which was a surprise when you look at it's cost of over $30 at this time. It's really my hope that next year I'll be eating crow and can come back and upgrade this review to 4 stars, but we'll have to wait and see.I added some customer images of the feeder as I have it hanging now in my yard.
B0013FO2B4 I really like that this feeder has the look of metal but is made of impact-resistant plastic. I say impact resistant because I dropped it three times getting it out of the box (yes, I'm clumsy). I was worried the plastic of the feeder trays might crack or shatter, but they were fine. If they had been metal, I probably would have dented them. The container portions are clearly a flexible material, and lightweight, so I wasn't worried about those. Knowing myself, I anticipate many drops in their future, so I was pleased with the durability. I hope the shatter resistance lasts after they've had UV and freezing temperature exposure, but I'll need a year or so to test that.This feeder has a clever, attractive design. But inverting the containers you can use either or both for dry feed or water. They're easy to remove and refill, and the hanger is both attractive and clever. I was also surprised at how secure it is! The containers stayed put--and didn't even lose any contents--in the aggressive Kansas wind.It was very popular almost immediately--the downside being that the birds also discovered my tomatoes, and I had an absolute plague of them bothering my tomatoes all summer, even after I removed the feeder. I'll definitely hang it back up in the winter, though I'll probably replace the water with extra feed once it gets cold.The only con I see is that the containers are a bit small for my taste, though not at all too small on average, compared to other feeders I see on offer. But as someone who's rather lazy and not accustomed to maintaining feeders, I could see refilling becoming an issue.
B0013FO2B4 I received my Garden Sip & Seed Feeder today, which came only needing the end caps screwed onto the ends of the clear reservoirs prior to hanging. Pretty fail-safe, I thought. Both ends of the reservoirs have screw threads for screwing onto the end caps, and they are both made exactly the same so you can't screw it up. The Sip & Seed looked beautiful, so I washed away the gross \"new plastic\" smell with soapy water and rushed right away to set it up in my garden. As my very first \"garden art\" where I'm living now, I'm inspired by the look of it.We live at the edge of a large meadow with plenty of food for birds, so I decided to put water in both reservoirs for them. The first reservoir worked just fine after I figured out that you have to flip it over quickly after filling and keep it straight up while positioning it on the hanger to keep too much water from leaking out through the seep holes near the threads. But I groaned and was VERY disappointed when I put the second reservoir up; all the water came pouring out! I just could not believe it! I was about to come here and negatively review the product but decided to see if I could figure out what was right with the one that worked and wrong with the one that didn't. I'm so glad I did.The only difference in the end pieces of the one that worked, other than one end having a hanging hook and the other a finial-type piece, is that the one for the hook end has a circle of small air holes and the bottom \"perch\" part does not. I determined that what was wrong with my second reservoir is that it had been assembled with the wrong end pieces, so that the hook was on the perch side and vice versa. The water was draining through the circle of air holes. I was able to easily unscrew and swap the hook and finial pieces for that feeder/waterer, then reverse the direction of the reservoir, and that instantly fixed the problem! Yay! But I'm knocking off a star for the frustration and wet t-shirt.(UPDATE ON THE \"HOLES\" THING: Another reviewer commented that the small holes in the bottom of the feeder were great to help drain water away from the seed. What this suggests to me is that the documentation on this feeder needs to be better. It needs to state how to assemble the feeder so that it works properly for either seed or water. If it's true that the circle of drainage holes should be on the \"perch\" end when used for seed, they need to state that.)Another reviewer had mentioned that they wished you could fill these from both ends. The way the reservoirs are made, both ends have the screw threads but one end is enclosed with thin plastic so you can sit the reservoir flat on a countertop while filling. Cutting out the end piece and leaving just the screw threads would result in a reservoir open on both sides, but I don't think I'll do that. It's not that difficult to fill it up as it's made.The staggered off-center swirl between the two reservoirs could be used to hang a small fruit feeder such as thisCopper Heart Bird Fruit Feeder, a crystal or small windchime (if it wouldn't scare off the birds), a small solar bauble, or something that would attract bugs away from the garden that the birds could then eat.I probably would have preferred glass reservoirs to the plastic, and I think they used to make these with glass, but I really do love it.
B0013FO2B4 This product is nicer than I expected it to be.Although the individual feeders are made of plastic, they seem to be well constructed.The hanger allows you to suspend from a building, a tree or just about any structure or support.It's great that you can use it as a double feeder, double waterer or fill on container with seed and one with water.It's both attractive and versatile.
B0013FO2B4 This is a nice idea to have both food and water available in the same vicinity. It also makes a nice appearance hanging in the yard. Yes, as some have pointed out, it is made of cheap material and will probably not weather well. But it is not likely that the birds will complain when the hanger tarnishes and the plastic gets scratched. For a relatively low price this brings a lot of pleasure to the feathered ones and to those of us who watch them.
B0013FO2B4 The bird feeder (we are using both containers for seeds because we have a birdbath)was easy to assemble, fill and hang.  It is decorative and coppery. I bought special seeds to attract specific birds and I don't really understand why the birds have not come to this feeder.  That's why I didn't give it a 5-star rating -- the birds in my backyard who have decided not to visit this feeder are, after all, the true reviewers.
B0013FO2B4 I love this feeder. Since I had it and hung it on a branch in my backyard, I've really enjoyed watching the birds and occasionally, squirrels. Easy to assemble and fill. Just need to do it upside down and remember to get the small grain birdseeds. Work as expected and good looking too.
B0013FO2B4 I selected the Sip & Seed feeder from Vine because I do love to watch birds, and especially want to provide water.  It's so much fun to watch birds play in water on a hot day!I used shelled safflower for the feed side.  We moved last year, and at our old place we had no squirrels at all.  But there are a few here, and after doing some research decided on safflower meats.  Yes, it is more expensive, but I don't have to clean up hulls.  I've had lots of wrens, and a cardinal (maybe two, I'm not sure), and some sparrows.  No blue jays yet, but they don't usually come to feeders in these parts till later in the year.I hung the feeder from a shepherd's hook.  It looks fabulous right now, but I don't think the plastic reservoirs are going to hold up, and the way they're made, they're kind of difficult to clean.  To be honest, I haven't had any takers for water yet, but we've had rain every day for weeks.  It only stopped raining yesterday.  Come summer, bacteria and mold can build up in that plastic, and if you've ever owned a plastic feeder, you know how difficult it is to remove oil from the seeds and mildew from wet, hot plastic.  Eventually the wind and birds will scratch it too.  Well, really, the most important thing is safe feeding and watering for the birds, right?  Glass would be pretty heavy, but much easier to clean.Yes, this is a nice-looking dual feeder/waterer.  But you can get a much cheaper, uglier but functional feeder with a tray and perch for about ten dollars; just get one made with easy-access openings for cleaning and enjoy birding!4/4/12 - I came back to update my review.  This thing is absolutely horrible.  The wind rocks both units, causing the water to spill out.  When it gets close to empty, the wind blows that one clean off!  So I started using just the seed container, with the safflower.  Well, the safflower gets jammed in the feeder.  I was very excited at first, but the birds stopped coming because the seed was all stuck up in the jar.  And the first time the seed gets wet?  Fuhgeddaboutit.  You have to empty it and refill.  I finally gave up on it.
B0013FO2B4 This is a very attractive set that provides the ability to offer birds both seeds and water. It's simple to put together ( it takes less than 2 minutes) and can either be hung from a hook or garden stake with ease. Very versatile. I especially appreciate the ability to offer water with the seeds in order to attract birds to areas without (yet another) bird bath. Out of the box, this set appears VERY attractive however, it is plastic which appears fairly durable but has a tendency to scratch and dull over time. Additionally, I'm a bit torn about offering wild birds a plastic based feed/drinking source given the associated health hazards. The metal bracket - also attractive - is not heavily coated so I have doubts as to the long term viabilty of the feeder as well as the environmental impact.Yes, I realize this might sound a bit over the top but if history has taught us anything, it is the long term impact on nature (especially birds) can be much more detrimental than we imagine even from seemingly minor aspects of interaction. I would feel much better about the product if it were made from eco-friendly materials with a longer durability factor.Final note - the birds seem to enjoy it immensely! It took less than an hour for a friendly cardinal to eat and drink from it!
B0013FO2B4 I received this bird feeder and at first it seemed like it was a great feeder. But as the days turned to weeks I got tired of it.The feeders are built out of plastic, a complaint some people have, however for me it's a positive because squirrels and other critters keep jumping on the bird feeders and knocking all the seed out of them and also knocking them off the hook onto the ground. I've tried putting these feeders in various locations around the yard and no matter where they go squirrels knock them over.Filling the feeders also proves to be a tad difficult. Once can be used for water and the other food, in my case I'm using them both for food as I have a bird bath already in the yard.I use a number of other feeders in my yard and never have squirrel issues with them. Occasionally a squirrel will get on the feeder and eat the seed but never knocks them off the hooks. Other feeders I have also have a wire cage around them as part of the design to keep squirrels off. This is the only feeder in my yard that I can't keep filled or hanging.I think if the company that made these put some sort of a closed hook fastener to keep it secured that may solve one issue of them falling over. But because the hook is open on one end it easily pops right off. A poor design flaw if you ask me.I'm pretty much done using these feeders, it's far to much hassle and an inconvenient for me. I've seen other feeders work far superior in my yard and this one just has to many faults to work in my environment.If you live in a part of the world where there are no squirrels and there is no wind that could knock these off the hooks then they may be for you.
B0013FO2B4 This 3 piece feeder featuring two feeders/waterer's with a fancy styled copper hanger certainly has its place somewhere.  Its a nice compact choice for right outside a window, on a deck close by, or somewhere in the city where one wouldn't be bothered by squirrels.  However as a choice for your backyard where squirrels tend to find your feeders fascinating, its a big fat no no.  This feeder is 100% NOT squirrel proof.  Anywhere you hang it without some squirrel baffle on a pole set up will be all she wrote squirrel wise unfortunately.  The feeders are of a straight open tray design with no ports where the seed just flows out into it very freely.  That means that any tipping or jostling of it and the tray just leans and spills its contents onto the ground.  Once a squirrel figures out that rational, (and trust me they will in no time) they now know they don't have to bother with finding a foothold on the feeder itself. Just jump on it and shake it up a bit.  In short, its pretty much useless as a feeder/waterer in that sense.  On the other hand, if you set this up on a pole with a baffle, or in some locale where squirrels won't be ringing the dinner bell, its a fair little system. Both feeders can be either a waterer or feeder by just unscrewing the caps and making sure the smaller slots are on the bottom for water, and the larger ones for seed. The copper hanger is nicely designed to be perfectly counterbalanced whether its seed in both, or one with seed and the other water.  And it is not disturbed by having birds on one feeder perch, and the other being vacant.  It seems to stay nicely level with any combination.  It looks really nice hanging on the copper hanger included, and the top and bottom of the feeders have a nice copper cap as well. Nice looking though it may be, this is still a cheap pair of feeders.  The body of the feeders are plastic, and will wear and crack in just a couple of seasons or so.  Also, if you decide to just ignore the squirrels and let them have their way, they will eventually chew through it.  I would be much more impressed if they were made with a heavier plastic, or tempered glass.  Oh and one last detail, the hanger set up on this model doesn't make using a baffle over it for protection from the weather really possible, as many people employ.  Thus when it rains, the cap on top does little to protect the seed in the trays, and you end up with a wet mess if the rain is heavy enough.In conclusion, as feeders go, this set is not really that overpriced, but you are mostly paying for the hanger and caps, for the feeder bodies are cheap.  Still though it would look nice in the right place, and with the right set up to deter squirrels.  If you do decide to purchase this set, I do recommend using one for feed, and one for water.  IF you do not have any other water available for the birds already that is, ( I do, so I use both these for seed).  Water is a much overlooked necessity for many back yard bird enthusiasts, and I highly recommended you provide water either with this model, or some other way if your an avid fan of our feathered friends.  Good luck, and happy feeding...
B0013FO2B4 Item arrived perfectly from amazon. Unpacked with ease, filled it with seed, and found a tree to hang it from. The next day the squirrels and birds were having a war of the seeds! Its a very nice looking feeder, and seems like it will last a season or three. Ill report back soon on the outcome of the war and who won.
B0013FO2B4 Even when I received the box and looked at this feeder in person, I still thought the caps and bases were going to be actual brass...  but they were plastic.  It definitely does look nice though.  I've had lots of birds coming to visit it.  I am having an issue with the water side though because sometimes the wind blows hard enough to tip the feeder enough to make all the water come out.  I would have loved it if the water side had a deeper base so the water wouldn't spill out so easily.  Once I discovered this issue, I moved the feeder to an area that was less prone to the wind and I haven't had as much of an issue.  I actually had a neighbor comment on the feeder and how nice it was.This is a great looking feeder, but I don't expect it to hold up for more than 4 years or so (especially with the amount of use it is getting).
B0013FO2B4 This is a pretty good bird feeder.  All parts except the scrolled hangar are plastic.  Actually, I think some of the top hardware might be metal too.  The clear tubes are definitely plastic.It is easy to fill and hang - we threw a thin line over a high branch and hung it from the bottom of the line.I initially filled one side with seed and the other with water.  It was a vaguely windy day (maybe 8-10 knots) and all of the water spilled out within a few hours.  The seed stayed well - and the weight of the seed balanced it out better too.So, we now have both sides filled with seed (the cheep stuff from the supermarket).  My daughter can see it from her bedroom window and enjoys checking to see if there are any birds.One star deduction for the water.  I think if the holes were much smaller on the water tube it would work much better.
B0013FO2B4 My use for this attractive feeder is somewhat unconventional.  The idea of using one side for seeds and one side for water is a good one.  However, there are also two other possibilities:  to put seed in both sides or to put water in both sides.  Because of where I choose to hang this feeder, my option is to put water in both sides; but because of the weight, I fill each side only one-third to no more than one-half full, keeping the sides somewhat balanced.  This will allow the birds to get water.  This feeder has held up well in my garden (several months), but again, I take care not to put too much water in it for fear of breaking it.What I discovered the hard way is that if you put seeds in these containers and hang them over soil, the birds do love it and throw the seed everyone on the ground.  Then what happens is that the uneaten seeds sprout in the soil and you now have grass where you may not want it.  If you hang these feeders over concrete, you are constantly sweeping everything up, plus, again, if the seed falls anywhere soil is, it sprouts.  As for the current price at over $27, well, to me it is worth about $20; the plastic is fairly sturdy, but it still is overpriced in my opinion.
B0013FO2B4 My Sip & Seed feeder came assembled. The sides of the silos have a pretty  design on them and the copper-look hanger is  very pretty.  The nifitiness (is that a word) of this feeder came into play when I decided to put water in one silo & seed in the other. The top & bottom pieces can be reversed. One piece has small holes in it; of course this piece is for the seed. The other piece is solid, no holes, for water. There's also a tiny, hard-to-see, embossed emblem on each piece; one emblem depicts water, the other a seedling.  Because mine was assembled, I had to take it apart to get the top & bottom pieces in the right place.After we fill the silo with water, we carry it upside down. Otherwise all the water would spill out. Then we flip it to hang it on our shepherd's hook. We always lose water when we flip it over, but it doesn't bother us.  The silo's seed holes are fairly large, but some fruit pieces got stuck anyway. The next time we filled it, we used a smaller seed mixture. I think a mischievous squirrel has been busy getting to the seed. I haven't seen him yet, but the water container has been emptied twice in 24 hours. I think he's tipping it when he tries for the seed.My husband doesn't have any complaints with the sip & feeder. I'd prefer being able to sit the silos down while filling or even after they're filled. Because of the design they won't sit flat, making them a little more inconvenient to use. That's about the only problem we have with this bird feeder right now. We had a bad storm the first night we hung it. I'm happy to report that the water drained out of the seed tray.Birdscapes 737 Garden Sip & Seed Feeder is so attractive, we put it in our front yard.By the way, you might want to check out theHeath Outdoor Products FS-1 Feed Scoop-Funnel.

B0013FO2B4 This was easy to set up.  It attracted birds almost immediately after we placed it on a tree limb.  It also attracts squirrels.  It is fascinating to watch the squirrels hang from their tails and do other contortions to get to the seed.  If it weren't for them eating or knocking out the seed onto the ground it would be a fun show.We have watched birds wait patiently on higher branches as others eat and fly off.  And there are so many colorful ones.The only issue we have with this and it is really a minor issue .. is that the water portion seems a waste.  We have not seen any bird or squirrel taking a drink.  Perhaps if the weather were hot for days with no rain that would be different.  We are toying with adding seed to both containers.This is a first-rate product and has brought us new found visitors to our back yard.  Easy to set up, easy to refill and definitely attractive to winged friends and bushy tailed ones too.Enjoy the chirps as they share the wealth with their flying friends.
B0013FO2B4 This has to be the most difficult bird feeder to manage. It is very time consuming to fill and the second one for water is useless as well.
B0013FO2B4 Got this through the Vine program. Positives: Extremely attractive. I live in a townhouse with a relative small backyard. I don't have trees in my yard, so I use a decorative pole which I attached the Birdscapes feeder to. It looks absolutely gorgeous out there and the birds are out there daily. Having water and seed together is a new and unique concept to me as I have always just used a seeder (and let the birds get their water elsewhere, lol). I love watching the birds my window flock back and forth to both. It was easy to set up and has provided hours of enjoyment for my family, and my cat. I definitely see more birds in my yard having the combination of water and seed than I did with just my regular birdfeeders. Here are the negatives: There is nothing in this set up that will deter small wildlife (i.e. squirrels) from hanging and making a huge mess (with both the seed and the water. I try to offset this by keeping a small bowl on the ground filled with peanuts and other items that are attractive for the squirrels. I am thinking if this was hanging from a tree, and higher up off the ground, maybe it wouldn't be quite as accessible. However, there are other (and I have used them often) feeders that discourage the critters and make it difficult for them to access the seed. This is definitely not one of them. Overall, I recommend this set up simply because of its beauty and for the way I am seeing far more birds than ever in my yard.
B0013FO2B4 I'd been using a cheap bird feeder from a super store and the poor starlings couldn't ever get any food. Then I got this dual feeder. I decided to do seed in both sides (you can flip the container to whichever opening you prefer, food or water) and I hang a metal basket of suet in the middle. From the basket of suet I have a hanging basket of flowers. This entire setup is supporting that huge, heavy basket of flowers. The starlings show up and have absolutely no problem perching themselves to gorge. The only time I had a problem was when a fat starling sat on the feeder and it broke with him on it. I ran out pretty disappointed in the product until I discovered that it had only just become unscrewed, so I screwed it back in and we were back in business!There are notches in both the top and the bottom perches, but the plastic bottle actually has only one opening, which makes it easy to use with water. Nebraska is just too windy to fill these things with water, though.It's been holding up to thunderstorms and wind quite well. It's very elegant and the design of the hanger makes it easy for short people like me to place it in higher areas.Should something happen to this one, I would be sure to replace it with the same make and model.
B0013FO2B4 I couldn't be more happy with this product.  It is very attractive and well built.  The design allows each receptacle to contain either seed (or by flipping it upside down) water.  My birds don't seem to be drinking the water though perhaps they will as we get deeper into summer and natural water sources get harder to find.  If they don't take an interest in it by then, I'll have the option to put seed on both sides.  I can even experiment with two different kinds of seeds to see what attracts which type of bird.  The curlicue fixture from which these hang gives the entire thing a little bit of movement, like the balance of a scale, which may help to dissuade squirrels or other undesirables from getting into your birdseed.  I used an angle bracket to mount mine to the side of an arbor rather than hang it from above.  My cats and I are thoroughly enjoying the all day bird show.  Now to find a source for the 50lb bags of birdseed I'm going to need....
B0013FO2B4 I love my new Birdscape bird feeders.  The bird feeders are beautiful. They look like they're made of metal and glass, but they are mostly made of plastic. The metal parts are the hanger, the hooks and finials, and the decorative plates on the ends. Despite all the plastic, they don't look cheap.The feeders are heavy when full. They actually bend my shepherd's hook. It's a double hook, so I balance it out with a hummingbird feeder on the other side. I also have a single hook shepherd's hook, but they would make that bow.The bird feeders are versatile. They change from water feeder to seed feeder by flipping the clear plastic tube. One could have two seed feeders, two water feeders, or a seed and a water feeder.I am very happy with this feeder. Now, my backyard is complete.
B0013FO2B4 I am happy with this feeder.  It is plastic, but then that makes it lighter than glass and it doesn't break when it gets knocked to the ground by wind/squirrels/raccoons/bears (I have them all).  There are no squirrel proof features, but grey squirrels find the base too small to be comfortable and red ones can get the seed out without having to chew and thus ruin the feeder.For me the water side is more decoration than necessary.  I live in a cold area and on water.  When it is warm enough for the feeder to hold water rather than ice, the birds can get water from our lake.  I was happy to see that the feeders can easily be reversed to hold either water or seed.  I have one of each now as it looks great this way, but in the winter I can switch both to seed.The seed section is not appropriate for fine seed like thistle, but works well for sunflower or mixes.  They are very easy to fill.I am very happy with this feeder and will keep it in mind when shopping for gifts.
B0013FO2B4 This is a sturdy and attractive feeder/water combo. The food/water cylinders are made from a plastic that feels pretty heavy duty. The metal parts are a burnished copperish color. You can either fill the cylinders with a seed and a water or 2 seeds/2 waters. I have multiple bird baths in my yard so I decided to put feed in both cylinders as opposed to a water cylinder. I hung it out in our courtyard this afternoon and already had evening grossbeaks and Bullock's oriels mobbing the feeder.I love the hanging mechanism which allows for hanging the feeder on a nail, hook, or small diameter branch. There is plenty of space on both feeders for the birds to comfortably sit and eat. It is fun to watch the birds sitting on two feeders so close together. There were eight or nine birds eating at any one time. The unit was very easy to open and fill. This is a lovely unit and a great addition to the 14 other feeders I already use in my yard!
B0013FO2B4 Its all plastic except the hanging device. It is easy to setup - the bottoms screw off and you pour the water or seed into each holder and flip them over. It is a little tricky if you try to fill them both then take the whole thing outside and hang it. Best to fill the seed, hang it then come back with the water. Looks ok nothing spectacular. We'll have to see how it holds up year around.
B0013FO2B4 Do you eat your meals in one room and then walk to the next room to get something to drink? Or do you prefer to have both food and drink at arm's length so as not to interrupt your meal? Gabby and Piper have fresh water close by when they eat, and so do our parakeets Spud and Jazz. But the wild birds using the feeders in our backyard don't have such convenience. They must flit back and forth from feeder to birdbath to satisfy urges for food and water. What if both of these necessities could be combined in one unit for our feathered visitors? Yes, it seems like a good idea to me alsoThe two feeders are identical, but for water one is directed to fill from the top and then turn the feeder over. There's a little spilled water in the process, but it's not too bad. One has the option of filling both with seed, both with water, or one seed and one water. We chose the seed/water option because the other configurations defeat the purpose of the Sip & Seed.First I hung the unit on a shepherd's hook away from all the other feeders in the back yard. After a few days of monitoring I saw no birds at the unit and no signs of any visits. It looked good hanging on that hook though. Then I moved it to a hook attacked to an upright 4&#34; by 4&#34;. Still no visits, but still looking good.After a few days I replaced a popular feeder just outside the kitchen window and over the deck with this new Sip & Seed and left it there for close to two weeks. The birds disappeared, and oddly even the worrisome squirrels totally ignored this new feeder. I got fleeting glimpses of birds at the water container, but that was it. While in this placement, the feeder moved quite a bit with the wind and seldom was stationary, turning slowly side to side. Upon examination it does seem stable in that a bird landing on one of the stations doesn't shake the twin feeder or tilt it like a seesaw.I finally gave up and moved the Sip & Seed to another shepherd's hook in a different yard location visible from the kitchen window. While positioned here the food in the one tube disappeared within a week, food for ravenous black birds, we suspect. Only occasionally did either of us actually witness a bird using the Sip & Seed. Once I did see a finch flitting back and forth between seed and water. In the meantime birds returned to their old, temporarily displaced feeder though in diminished numbers.Finally: This unit is attractive, easy to fill, and easy to clean. Unfortunately our resident birds don't share our enchantment with this new feeder. My next experiment will be to move this unit to the front yard away from the competing feeders and birdbaths in the backyard. I may even try it with the more expensive safflower. If I notice any significant feeding activity on the Sip & Feed, I'll update this review. For us the Sip & Seed has been a surprising disappointment perhaps due to factors of which we're as yet unaware. But as they say, past experience doesn't guaranteed future interest. Because of its aesthetics and concept, it's worth a try for other bird enthusiasts.
B0013FO2B4 The Birdscapes feeder is extremely easy to install and use, and it looks great.  The water and seed stay in the containers, without leaks or spills.  You will need to buy a hook to hang it on.With the exception of the attachment hardware, the product is plastic.  The plastic isn't a problem, though I am not sure how many years a thin plastic perch will last when in direct sun most of the day.So far, I am very happy with it.  When comparing this bird feeder with others, I would just consider potential longevity of the plastic.
B0013FO2B4 I love the feeder but I'm not sure if i purchased the right food so i can enjoy seeing more birds.  so far i have only seen 3 birds in a week's time but I'm sure it's the food and not the feeder.  This feeder is not squirrel resistant so I advise against it if you have a problem with squirrels eating from your feeder.  They are able to climb or jump to the filigree design and hang with one foot upside down to reach the food, then when you yell at them, the squirrel panics and sends the bird food EVERYWHERE!
B0013FO2B4 This bird feeder/waterer is very pretty and with the lovely hanger, it's as unique as it is functional.The feeder is made of plastic, although the top and bottom of each \"silo\" are covered in an antique copper colored metallic paint. The hanger is a copper colored metal. Because of this, it is very lightweight. That might be a plus for someone who could not easily refill a heavier feeder.You replenish each silo by removing it from the hanger, unscrewing the silo from the base, refilling with seed or water, and then screwing the base back on and rehanging. They don't hold a lot of seed or water so I think I will have to refill them frequently. I hung it in a spot where I had a different feeder and within minutes, there were birds at the feeder and the waterer.I was pleased to see that there are drainage holes on the base of the seed silo so that in the event of rain, the seed will not get soggy/wet/moldy.My concern is that the plastic will become brittle and break quickly in the brutal Texas sun, but I hope I am wrong. It is certainly a lovely addition to my yard.
B0013FO2B4 Very pretty dual purposes bird feeder. I decided to put food in both containers as we have a pond so I can't comment on the functionality of filling one side with water. The feeder's look belies the inexpensive (I'm hesitant to say 'cheap') materials used and its low price. For me the fact that the feed tubes are plastic is a massive plus as we get the worst wind around here even on days where none is forecast. I know at some point this feeder will go flying into next door's yard and the rugged thick plastic should survive such an uprooting with ease where glass would instantly shatter.The design of the scroll work can result in the feeder 'see-sawing' somewhat when a couple of birds of the more chubby variety land on one side - but they don't seem to mind! All in all very nice unique item worth the price of admission.
B0013FQ0XC Feeder is sturdy as well as attractive- I was impressed with how solid it felt out of the box. Easy to fill and set up- each tube has an adjustable setting for either food or water so you do not have to worry about which is which. The tubes balance themselves well on the copper hanger- though I do worry a little about wind if it is hung anywhere overly exposed as the tubes are able to move along the hanger a bit. The water tube allows enough water in the bottom bowl that smaller birds can enjoy a splash or two.The only downside I can see is a lack on the user side, not design. Make sure you are regularly and thoroughly cleaning out the water side between fillings. Otherwise it is the perfect environment for interesting and unsavory things to grow. Squirrels would also make short work of this one.
B0013FQ0XC As others have pointed out, this item has several flaws - including labeling it \"copper\", since it's simply a copper-colored paint over plastic.The second flaw is a lack of drainage, and if you live in a rainy climate, you'll want to be careful to drill some drainage holes, otherwise you'll get some messy birdseed. I used a 1/16\" drill bit and put three holes in the bottom of each tray - now it drains fine.The third flaw, which I haven't found a good solution for, is this. Depending on how you mount it, the feeder can be easily unbalanced, causing seed or water spills. I can't take credit for figuring this one out - the squirrels that live in my yard found out that by sitting near one edge of the feeder, it tips onto its side and most of the contents spill out.It's an attractive product I suppose, but seems to require some TLC to get the best out of it.
B0013FQ0XC We do some great bird watching from our large picture window. I wanted to see if different types of birds would be attracted to the yard with this feeder. I did see one new type of bird once we added this feeder. The feeder was easily mounted on a tree. We filled it with water. It has been so hot so far this spring/summer we thought the birds would really crave water and I think we were right. You do have to refill it quite a bit.I really like that it is functional, but also nice to look at. Some bird feeders are just plain ugly in the yard, but this one keeps with a nice and elegant look.I can't say how it would stand up to weather as we haven't had it for too long. I will definitely take it down if there is a storm coming and it will need to be cleaned seasonally since it is copper.I think this product is good for an avid and novice bird watcher, especially if you are looking to attract new birds. Would definitely add another one to the yard!Oh yea, we have lots of squirrels in our yard and the feeder as not been attacked by squirrels trying to steal water! Another sign of a well made feeder!Update - after almost a year, this bird feeder is still going strong! We have had some of the most unique birds come to visit our yard. The bird feeder did well through the winter. Although it was a mild winter - we did have some days where the temperatures got below freezing. The water froze, then quickly melted when over freezing and the birds came right back to drinking. Our kids have become quite the bird watchers and we are just really, really happy with this feeder and the experience it has given us thus far.Update number two - we are still loving the bird feeder! It has been through everything - including a tornado and still hanging in there. Still attracting the most beautiful birds I have ever seen, and still keeping the squirrels creative trying their best to steal the birds food and water. Continue to be impressed by this bird feeder!
B0013FQ0XC This is a nice looking and nicely manufactured unit. I've been a backyard birder for years, and have gone through many styles of feeders that \"look\" great but start falling apart after only one season.  This one not only looks great, it's well-made and seems to function well, too --- but as a watering device, not for dispensing seed.What I mean is that this thing looks great. Very classy.  But after hanging it with the other feeders two things became apparent: No drainage holes and no \"roof\" meant that seed would be sopping wet after a rain if it's used in an uncovered location. This led me to rethink its use -- after all, it's designed for both seed AND/OR water.  So I decided that since I already have feeders, using it as a watering device would be better. And for that it works fine.UPSIDES: I especially like the thick glass and the metal hangar hook.  The other \"brass-looking\" portions of the feeder are plastic, but even they seem stronger / more durable than what one typically finds on a regular plastic bird feeder.I also like the way the unit comes apart. You can disassemble the entire unit and put the parts in the dishwasher!  As a cautionary measure, I put the plastic parts in the upper rack, and everything did fine.DOWNSIDES: No drainage holes or roof means soggy, unappetizing (wasted) seed if used in an uncovered locale. Also, this feeder's classy design of how the two units hang means that when you take one unit off, you must be careful not to let the remaining unit swing down, hit you, and in so doing get knocked off the hangar. Just go slow when putting on / taking off tubes and this will not be an issue.This is a solid, functional unit that will add a touch of class to your yard.  But unless you make your own modifications or hang it where it will be out of the weather, it's probably best if it's just used for water.  Still, I like it. And for that, four stars.
B0013FQ0XC The aesthetics of this bird feeder are awesome.  It really is beautiful to look at.  Some parts of it are plastic rather than metal but I didn't see that as a huge issue.As others have pointed out there are not drainage holes in either silo and I think the rationale was being able to fill both with water (the box advertises being able to fill both with water, both with seed, or one of each).  Ours is on our porch, but I could definitely see the rain ruining seed and causing problems out in the open.The other problem I had was filling it.  Even with the closed setting there is substantial spillage of both water and seed.  I think the manufacturers knew that because in the instructions it says to fill the feeder near where you're hanging it.  It would have been great if they'd made it a little more airtight.
B0013FQ0XC For the money, I think this is a great bird feeder.Construction Quality: The base is plastic, but it looks much like copper and survived a fall (my fault) from 6 feet without any damage.  The wire hanger is sturdy, the jars are solid.  It's all well made.Ease of use: I deducted a star because you have to unscrew the jar from the base to fill, which seems like an unnecessary hassle.  Otherwise it's easy to adjust between water and birdseed by twisting a door open at the base.  Other than taking a little more time to fill, they couldn't be easier to use.Value: They look like nice antique bird feeders.  I would pay substantially more than the listed price, and I intend buy a set of these for my mother.  It's much less expensive that I was expecting based on the quality.BTW, I'm not using the wire hanger.  I have two posts on my pergola, and have hung the feeders from a hook on each.  It looks very sharp this way.  Be creative!
B0013FQ0XC My husband and I are in love with this bird feeder/waterer and so seems the local birds.  The design is beautiful and balances well.  The feeder and the waterer are easy to fill and hang and release at quite a proper rate.  We have had no problems with balance.
B0013FQ0XC There are two of these bird feeders with a similar appearance. After having reviewed the other (which I was very pleased with other than the use of plastic throughout), I thought this would be a better choice due to the glass. While it is a VERY attractive feeder/water set, the other version is actually a much better choice due to the function.While both provide basic water/seed options, the other set is designed much better including the little top hat which helps prevent water and moisture from clogging the bottom. As others have noted, this isn't real copper - the glass is much nicer than the plastic tubes on the other but 
B0013FQ0XC This is a very decorative bird feed tube set.It has two heavy-gauge glass tubes capped by copper feed trays. You can use each with seed (for example, you could do black oilseed for your cardinals and maybe a thistle mix for the finches) or you can do seed and water in the summer months.Some random comments:1. The decorative scroll bracket is very pretty, but if you live in a breezy area (we do) then you will want to tie the feeders onto the hooks with cable ties. I can see them swinging off in a stiff breeze, especially the top hook, which is meant to hang on a wall bracket or a yard stand. I would NOT trust this unit in a breezy area without some \"redesign\" using cable ties.2. In winter, fill both tubes with feed--water will freeze and break the glass.3. Birds are really more attracted to running water. While they will appreciate a sip from the tube, if you want more birds in the yard, find a fountain bird bath. At one point, we converted a terra cotta cascading fountain to a bird bath by putting it on a stand. The birds stood under the cascade and took showers. They LOVED it. A cascading fountain is nice in the garden and will attract more birds to your yard. I would probably not bother using the water side as water; I would use two kinds of seed: oil seed and thistle mix for example.The unit is packed extremely well--it was wrapped in bubble wrap and taped to keep the glass tube from breaking. It is attractive, fits my color scheme but beware the issues of durability where you hang it.
B0013FQ0XC We've had a lot of bird feeders, but my wife remarked after I hung the Birdscapes 389 Copper Sip & Seed Feeder that this is easily the most elegant bird feeder she's ever seen.I have to agree. The simplicity of the twin silos is most attractive.The birds seem to think so too. I filled one with sunflower seeds and the other with water and the first bird showed up after only 45 minutes.Its only shortcoming may be its relatively small capacity for food and water. Once the word gets out in the local bird community, I expect to refill it frequently.The product makes no claims about being squirrel-proof, which is no big deal because I've come to the conclusion that NOTHING is squirrel proof.This feeder will be an attractive addition to any back yard or porch and the copper finish goes nicely with almost everything.
B0013FQ0XC I loved the look of this bird feeder at first. Until I realized what everyone else is gripping about. It's not really copper. Which is really misleading. Also I don't like how much feed it holds. You will have to refil it ofter and if you work a job and take care of a house it's a hassel to have to refil a bird feeder everyday. Standing back, it's very pretty, just not what it seems. Beware before purchase.
B0013FQ0XC The Birdscapes 389 Copper Sip & Seed Feeder looks GREAT! Too bad it's not copper. It's painted. You notice it right away. Perhaps it won't rust, but upclose it looks a little cheesey. From far it looks fine, but forget about getting a nice patina over time. I put it up right away, very excited to see how it works....well I found out. Apparently, this is made for dry/desert regions where rain is not an issue, becuase it really has no way to drain water away or out of the seed dispenser. It has been raining like crazy here, and all I have a very swollen seeds....with any luck they will germinate (sarcasm). Two stars because it looks great, but that's about it.....oh, I didn't get a lot of bird action before the rain came, but the squirrels were all over it (nothing new)....at least something got fed. So, if rain is a normal weather condition for you, I would pass. If you live in the desert or very low rain area, this probably would do well, and it really does look good....too bad it's not really copper.....It did say Copper Sip & Seed Feeder. I wonder if I can use it just to feed/attract hummingbirds? I will try it and let you know if I get any....if not, it seems like a waste.
B0013FQ0XC This feeder is quite pretty right out of the box. It also looks lovely hanging in the yard. As others have noted, it is not copper but painted metal and plastic. The feeder tubes are glass. We have quite a few feeders in our yard. We live in a frequently windy and rainy part of the country; we opted to put seed in both tubes since water is everywhere here.Day One: We decided to put this feeder on one of our \"squirrel-slowing\" poles as is to see how it would fare without modification. After a rain, the seed was ruined in both tubes within hours. Squirrels had already chewed on the plastic bits.We took the feeder down and my husband drilled 4 holes in each seed tray to prevent pooling.Day Two: Cleaned out,new seed, we hung the feeder from a tree on a cable with a pulley. We needed to make some changes to the hooks since their open nature was going to make wind knock down really possible and we didn't want shattered glass all over. So far, so good, well accepted by birds in our region. Getting lots of use.We live in Wisconsin and really doubt this feeder will survive a year here. I'd be happy to come back and edit this if I am wrong. I believe the drill holes will resolve the water pooling problem and the cable will deter squirrel chewing. Refilling the feeder will require a ladder and it is awkward to refill this feeder as there is no way to set it down...the tubes have no flat surface. It helps to have an assistant. Also, the glass tubes are quite narrow; I had to fill them with a funnel.My gut reaction to this feeder is that it is really not designed for my region but would be perfect for a desert environment. Wind & rain are not compatable with this feeder as it was manufactured. Right now, it does look lovely in the yard and the birds are using it heavily. I think this feeder is \"bird-friendly\". I wish it did not have the plastic pieces as they would be completely destroyed by squirrels if hung lower/closer to our deck. The plastic parts in question are also critical to how the feeder works and would not be replaceable.Bottom line: Very attractive feeder. High maintenance. Will require modification or shelter for use in any area with rain.6/26/2011 edit and update: This feeder did not survive the first rain here. Even after drilling holes and placing the feeder in a sheltered area, the feed tubes clogged after our first hard rain and no longer delivered seed. We unclogged it, cleaned it out, hung it again and the same thing happened with the next rain. If we made the drill holes any larger, the seed would just pour out. We've taken this feeder down and used the bracket/hanger for other feeders that work in our region.
B0013FQ0XC I purchased this Sip & Seed set sight unseen because of its style and versatility.  The metal hanger is robust and appears to be painted a copper color, so I saw no rusting during the time I used it.  The glass containers are heavy and thick.  The cap on the top and bottom are copper colored metal as well, but be advised that the tray itself and the ports where the water/seed exits is just copper colored plastic.  The tray can be rotated to open or close the ports.  The top cap is removable and the bottom finial can be unscrewed to remove the bottom metal portion.I stopped using this set to present seed because of one serious design flaw:  There is no feature for rainwater drainage.  That may seem a little obvious...if they both can HOLD water, then they are not designed to let water (such as rainwater) drain out.  What that means, unfortunately, is that everytime it rains, the seed tray will fill with rainwater.  That rainwater will also fill the inside of the glass to the same level.  In one day, the seed becomes contaminated and clogs inside the glass and the seed ports.  Mine would never dry out to allow seed to flow again.I attempted to drill drainage holes in one tray to allow drainage, but it's just too far down through the plastic tray and the bottom metal cover for it to drain efficiently without quickly clogging.Unless you're willing to clean out the seed every time it rains a little bit, I recommend you stick to presenting water only in this feeder or mount it under cover.
B0013FQ0XC This set is heavy duty. Be sure to place it in a place that won't get wet or the seed feeder base will fill with water. This set seems bombproof.
B0013FQ0XC First - the feeder is quite lovely. Although not of copper but of some other metal (which I find misleading), the counter balanced scroll system is attractive and I was happy to hang this on the porch. The glass tubes are thick and looks to be quite sturdy - I'm not worried about breaking them when handling them.  The tubes screw in at the top and then hang from a hook you attach through the scrollwork.  The copper looking metal also looks sturdy and like it would last quite awhile.To fill the tubes, you can unhook them from the main scroll hook easily.  Then, you screw off the bottom, fill with seed, and re-screw on the bottom.  You then have to be very careful when turning it upright again or you'll get seed all over.  Just make sure you either block the openings or you turn it over a trash can or the bag of seed to catch any that falls out of the little hole in the bottom.  You just then reattach the top hooks to the main scroll hook.  Note that the seed spills into the little saucers for birds to land and feed.We had a problem right on the second day - Spring rains got the seeds in the saucer wet, which carried up into the main unit getting the seed damp.  This could be very dangerous and even deadly for birds.  You should definitely place this somewhere protected so that the seed doesn't get soaked.  Also place it somewhere that will make it easy to clean up all the discarded shells, because the birds love it!In all, due to the design flaw (no drainage in the saucers), I don't recommend this feeder unless you can keep it nice and dry.Update: it had been up for two weeks, when we came home to find the feeders on the ground and just the hooks still on the scroll bar.  The metal tops screw into a smaller piece that has the hooks, and either the birds or squirrels had managed to unscrew both! Thankfully they didn't break, but it was further cause for concern about the design of the feeder.
B0013FQ0XC This feeder/waterer combo is by far the prettiest I have seen in a long time. The metal cap, base and hanger are a pretty copper color and the thick glass \"silos\" are stunning. Because of the thickness of the glass, the entire thing is quite weighty and substantial.You fill each silo with seed and water by removing it from the hanger, turning it upside down and unscrewing the silo from the base and then filling. It doesn't hold a lot of seed or water, so I suspect I will have to refill often. Still, that isn't a huge drawback for me considering how beautiful it is.The major design flaw is that the seed silo has no drainage holes in the bottom! This will definitely lead to soggy/moldy seed in the event of rain. Because of this, the only practical choices are to place it in a covered area, such as a porch or covered patio, or to drill drainage holes in the bottom of the seed silo. Since I wasn't anxious to have bird poop all over my patio, I chose to drill some holes with a small drill bit. It worked OK, although it was tedious trying to do it neatly so that it would be attractive on the outside. After I was done, I put some water in the bottom of the seed silo to make sure it drained quickly and freely and it seems to work fine. Since I live in Texas where we are in the middle of a drought, I haven't had the opportunity to see how it works in a rainstorm. I will update this review if it ever rains!It's too bad Birdscapes neglected to allow for proper drainage because other than that, I would enthusiastically recommend this Sip and Seed Feeder.
B0013FQ0XC Not only is this really attractive but I love the way it's constructed.  Right now I have water in both cylinders because of the hot Summer weather coming in and the fact that the birds have enough of natural food that they really don't need to have seed at this time of year.The bottom holds a nice amount of water and food and it has a wonderful slide closure so you can knock down the amount of water or food that is despensed.  Really cleaver let me tell you and this is the first time I have encountered this type of closure.Made from glass, metal and plastic this is a weighty piece and does hold quite a bit.  You won't have to worry about squirrels eating the dickens out of it with the cleaver way the entire thing is set up and it's construction.  They say you get what you pay for and I think here you are getting much more than what you're paying for.  I have seen far more expensive feeders that a pure junk.  This rates as queen of the line.  It's also great that you can use each of the cylinders for either water or feed as they are both the same.I am truely one happy camper with this product and will be looking into more of this line.
B0013I2MLS I have another timer that is battery operated and digital.  Required setting several different parameters to make it work.  Pain in the butt.  This one is great.  Just turn the dial to set up your watering schedule and you're done.  Hasn't failed me yet.
B0013I2MLS This is a nice, but CHEAP solution to your 'timed' watering situations . . it is a simple, but, excellent
B0013I2MLS My order arrived promptly and in un-damaged condition.After just 3 days of use, the Orbit #62024 Watering Timer started leaking internally -- and it got progressively worse for the next 2 days. Attempts to repair it were useless, as the cheap plastic construction gave signs of more problems in the future.I wasted my money on this poorly-made piece of junk, but Amazon's great Returns Policy made good for the bad unit. I'm hoping for better luck with another Orbit model.UPDATE -- 20 December,2012 --I tried a different model -- Orbit 91213 One-Dial Garden Hose Digital Water Timer -- it was very easy to set up, and has been working very well for several months, with no sign of leaks or malfunction.UPDATE #2 -- 30 August,2013 --Orbit Model #91213 has performed flawlessly for over a year with no leaks, no failures, nor problems of any kind.That said, I would suggest buying the Orbit #91213 -- and forget about the #62024.Good Luck !!
B0013I2MLS I've used a variety of similar timers through the years with a few houses on 20 acres, and this is easily the simplest to set and use. It isn't fancy, but if you want to water up to 90 minutes every 3rd day (60 minutes every [other] day) it is as simple as turning the dial to make it run then, and every target day at that time thereafter. Time will tell on durability, but as simple as the design is, one would expect it to be pretty good.
B0013I2MLS I can operate this valve without glasses or instructions, very simple. The valve fittings are leak proof. Great price for the money.
B0013I2MLS This timer will be used in my garden this year for my soaker hose.  I haven't tried it yet, but the ratings were good about it.  I bought 2, 1 for my vegetable garden and one for my watermelon patch.
B0013I2MLS I recently hired a contractor to sod my lawn after I did some major backyard renovation work. Prior to him sodding, I knew I would have to water the sod very frequently. I didn't have a hose timer, so I immediately looked to Amazon (my #1 choice) for hose timers.  My only criteria (at the time) was that I wanted it to be under $30 (the closer to $20 the better). At the time of purchase (back in July), Of the top 6 hose timers on Amazon, only 4 of them met my criteria.  They are as follows:Ranked #1 Orbit 91213 One-Dial Garden Hose Digital Water Timer - $29.98Ranked #2Orbit Hose Watering Timer 62024- $20.49 (The One I'm Reviewing)Ranked #4Orbit SunMate 62034 Mechanical Watering Timer- $11.17Ranked #5Orbit 62061N Single-Dial Water Timer- $24.99I ended up choosing #2, the one I'm reviewing but really wished I would have chosen #5 (will get to that later).  #4 was not an option due to same-day only watering.Physically, nothing is wrong with my timer. It exactly like I expected it to and has no leaks whatsoever. The gray \"cover\" you see in the picture actually goes over the timer itself (NOT the hose portion as pictured) to protect the \"timer dial\" from the elements.The reason I wish I got a different timer though is because the frequency of the timer activating is limited to \"Daily / Every Other Day / Every 3rd Day\".  I live in Tennessee where the summers get hot (90+ degree temperatures).  Because of my location, I am required to water my sod twice a day.  Unfortunately with this timer, the best frequency I can choose is \"Daily - Once A Day\".  So I've found that I've had to manually turn it on in the morning and then again when I get home from work. But due to the mechanics of how it repeats, the timer repeats at the time of day you last turned the dial.Now you must be thinking, with your schedule, you essentially got the same functionality as the #4 ranked timer,Orbit SunMate 62034 Mechanical Watering Timer. In essence yes (due to me watering daily) but once my sod is established, I will probably use this timer for other purposes to water my yard and/or plants with my sprinkled using the other frequency settings available.Now the reason I wish I chose #5 is because #5 is actually a newer model of #1.  #1 is ranked just because of purchase frequency.  If you Google both timers, you'll find on other reseller pages thatOrbit 62061N Single-Dial Water Timeris the newer version of Orbit 91213 One-Dial Garden Hose Digital Water Timer. I'm not sure what is improved, but obviously they look the same AND the 62061N is $5 cheaper. But the main reason I wish I chose #5 is because you get a wider selection of watering \"frequency, duration, time start, clock function\" all for $5 more than the Orbit 62024.The manual is shared by both of the 91213 & 62061N and according to that, you can set duration anywhere from 1 minute to 4 hours, set the frequency of watering from 6 hrs or 12 hours, or 1 day to up to 7 days. The \"Rain Delay\" function is nice because with a press of a button, you can choose to skip the \"auto watering\" via 24 hour intervals up to 72 hours.So with that said, I really wish I got theOrbit 62061N Single-Dial Water Timerfor $24.99, but I decided it's not worth the trouble sending it back since I'm already on my 3rd week watering my sod and I really need to keep it watered.Hope this review helps.
B0013I2MLS Maybe I got a defective unit, but it leaked when being hooked up to my hose.  Nice and tight, even replaced the interior washer but no luck.
B0013I2MLS Item came well packed and installs super easily.  Just set it up for your needed watering schedule and time and it handles the automatic sprinkle very well.
B0013I2MLS Works on blck drip line but you must leave cap off. Downhill slop is enough to releas 4gals in 90min daily. Using a dual outlet seems to defeat drip action by splitting the 4 gallons
B0013I71SC Got this for a backyard garden as it seemed better than those I could locate locally. Works great so far.
B0013I71SC First let me begin with the fact that I love this sprayer.  The patterns are great and your able to press the trigger lightly and get a slower stream of water.  I also have a cheaper sprayer which makes it difficult to press softly, it seems to have off and full stream unlike the Orbit sprayer.  I use the Center quite often,  to fill my self-watering Misco planters from a distance I use the jet with out pressing the trigger all the way and it does a great job.  The Jet stream is also  straight & uniform unlike my other sprayer's jet setting and it reaches quite a distance.  The other sprayer is a Viking 912600 8-Way Heavy Duty Spray Nozzle.  To be fair the Viking is half the price.  I took one star off because the trigger handle is made of a cheap plastic which broke in my hand while spraying my plants.  I did not know if the sprayer had a warranty. I never did look at the original label on this sprayer when I first received it.  I was unable to get an answer here on Amazon from my fellow shoppers. I the decided to Google Orbit and found their website.  I contacted them via email and they answered fairly quickly plus offered me a new sprayer no cost to me nor did I have to send in my old one, very nice.  I purchased the Viking sprayer in the mean time and as a future back up since Orbit Customer service informed me it would take 7 to 10 days.  I looked carefully at the label of the new Orbit sprayer I just received 02-21-2014 and it does say it has 6 year warranty.  I would upload the picture but it seems Amazon does not have the add a picture feature available at the time of this review.  Some may say it's only 12 to 13 bucks who cares.  I disagree, I don't want to spend 12 to 13 bucks twice in a year for a sprayer.  I never abuse this sprayer I always place it down never slam it or just let it drop to the floor.  It does have a few scratches but no abuse.  Hope this helps and happy gardening!
B0013I71SC I bought this nozzle based on other's good reviews.  Received it today, and it works great, no leaks, lots of settings, EXCEPT there is no FLOOD setting!  I am disappointed since this is the setting I use most for watering my flower pots.  Oh well, at least it doesn't leak, and I guess I'll make due with the settings it does have.  It is lightweight and seems like a quality nozzle.
B0013I71SC I purchased this item last April, but I didn't use it a lot. I only use my hose occasionally to clean up the yard after my dog. At the beginning, the hose nozzle worked fine. After a while, it started leaking in one place and then it leaked in more and more places as I continued using it, getting to the point where even my clothes got wet. I noticed that I am not the only buyer having the leaking problem with this nozzle. This item went in the garbage now and I ordered a different one also from Amazon.com.
B0013I71SC I purchase this a few months ago and use it daily to water by backyard and container garden.  Work so perfectly and easy to change spraying patterns.  I use the shower pattern to bath my 3 labardor retrievers when the weather gets hot and they love it.  Highly recommend this product and buying a 2nd one to use in my garage to wash my cars too. Well made product and not expensive.
B0013I71SC I'm using this at a stable that has fairly low water pressure (about 30 psi). The hose works well even at this lower pressure, and the \"jet\" setting sends a stream about 25 feet.No leaks at all. The ergonomic grip is comfortable to hold.I would buy again
B0013I71SC Works.  Not too high of quality.  Good to have in the hose storage container.  Priced appropriately. Get a a few of them if you need one around.
B0013I71SC These Orbit products are all good quality and reasonable.Although made elsewhere I think they overlook the quality control of most of their products.Any auto irrigation system is very reliable and have lasted for year after year.Company backs their products with good gaurantee.
B0013I71SC This is not the best nozzle i bought 
B0013JJ79M I read thru almost every review to find out how cool the grill had to be before I could put this cover on. The highest temperature I have put this cover on at is 350. I am afraid to try it on anything to hot because I dont want it to melt. The heat hasnt caused any discoloration either, however, the rain that has been able to sit on it has stained it so that was unfortunate. This is a great grill cover and definitely serves its purpose.
B0013JJ79M Weber covers are a stronger material than most, use a hose to clean, don't fade easily, and fit great. Worth the extra money.
B0013JJ79M I just tried the cover on my grill and it fit very well. Nice and snug on my grill so that it will not blow off. My only objection is that I have noticed that the rain does indeed puddle on the board area.
B0013JJ79M UPDATE 10/06/13: This cover is doing a terrific job of keeping my Weber looking like brand new, and the cover itself isn't far from looking brand new either after 1.25 years of constant direct exposure to sun and weather! Not only does it keep my beloved Weber clean and dry on the outside, but it's doing a great job of helping to keep my cast iron grate rust free and ready for use at a moment's notice, and you know how quickly cast iron rusts in damp air. Yay! No more seasoning and re-seasoning the cast iron! It's been out there since summer of last year and it stays perfectly seasoned and rust free thanks to this great cover. I can now enthusiastically recommend it to all reading. ---END UPDATE---I ordered this cover to put over my new Weber Performer grill model number 1427001. It's very well made, that's apparent right out of the packaging (but see update), and it fits perfectly, loose enough to make getting it on and off a breeze but tight enough to make it just about impossible for it to blow off in even the strongest wind.It came just in time for two days in a row of severe thunderstorms with very heavy rains and very strong winds, and there wasn't one second that I worried about the possibility of it blowing off or leaking. It's heavy duty too, a lucky thing in light of recent hailstorms we've had in my neck of the woods! I won't make any pronouncements about long-term durability since only time can answer that question, but my impression is that it'll last for quite a few years. I did note that one reviewer's developed cracks in it after just a couple years, let's hope that was the exception rather than the rule!Although I'd have preferred one in the same color as my Weber (I bought the green one to match my patio furniture and coordinate with my house colors), the black isn't horrible looking by any means, in fact it looks pretty good considering what it is, and more importantly, it'll help you to keep that Weber looking good!Bottom line: This is definitely a good buy. It does what it's supposed to do very well, is well made, and looks great (even after 1.25 years of constant exposure). I hope my review helps some of you make a more informed buying decision! Peace :-)
B0013JJ79M Weber 7455 Premium Cover, Fits Weber Performer GrillsWe've had several substantial rains and, thanks to this cover, not a drop on the Performer Grill. It is NOT difficult to get on and fits perfectly!
B0013JJ79M Right off the bat, this cover is for 2005 and newer grills. The picture Amazon has provided (as of the time of this writing) does not correctly depict the actual item. I've added a picture with the correct item on a newer Performer grill.I also have aWeber 3780001 Genesis S-320 Gas Grillwith aWeber 7553 Premium Cover, and was expecting this cover to be of similar quality. Unfortunately, that's not the case.While the cover fits well over the Performer, it isn't quite \"to the wheels\", which leaves anything you might have on the bottom rack of the cart exposed to the elements.More disappointing, though, is that there's nothing in the cover to secure it to your grill. There have been some strong winds here lately, and while nothing's blown the cover off entirely, a decent gust of wind will make it hop up a good 5\" or more if you don't put a brick or similarly heavy object on the work space.Frankly, for that this cover costs, you shouldn't have to do that. It's basically the same price as the Genesis cover, which has velcro straps. While the Performer doesn't have a design that makes those type of straps practical, at the very least, they could have stitched in a few weights, or straps to let you secure the cover to the bottom rack of the cart.I've purchased a few grills with covers, and countless Weber and Weber Style accessories, but this is the first Weber product I've bought where I felt kind of ripped off.
B0013JJ79M Fits my son's Weber Performer very well. Note this cover will not fit the first version of the Performer (that I have) with the stainless steel work area.
B0013JJ79M I love the way my Weber grill looks in green.  It has worked out great for our family and I want to make sure it stays protected from the harsh elements of Southwest Florida.  So I used this cover--which fits perfectly--AND I store it in my garage.The cover not only protects it from the weather/dirt/dust/salt but also from anyone dropping any tools on it in the garage.  If it's worth doing it's worth over-doing!
B0013JJ79M Even though the product description says that it fits 2005 and newer grills, I can verify that it fits my 1999-eraWeber 761001 22 1/2-Inch One-Touch Platinum Charcoal Grill, Blackjust fine. After 14 years, the original Weber cover that I bought was stiff and cracked and falling apart from exposure to the sun, rain, and snow of Wisconsin, so it was high time to replace it.After so many years, I had forgotten just how flexible the fabric on the cover was. It's much easier to get the cover on an off when it hasn't shrunk and gotten stiff from age! It does have a tendency to balloon in a wind, so putting a piece of firewood on the top will keep the cover from blowing off and landing somewhere downwind.There are two things I would change about this cover:1) a vent of some kind at the top, so that the wind would flow throw instead of ballooning it, or alternately, some clips or velcro straps to secure it to the grill legs. I might add some grommets and velcro straps to do just that.2) a change in the sewing pattern or something that would keep the part that covers the table from becoming a puddling spot for water. I would guess this ages the vinyl prematurely, plus it collect dirt and debris which makes it get dirty easier, and if left for an extended period of time, the puddle of water could attract mosquitos. I think I can get around this by putting something on the table before covering it so that the cover tents over it and makes the rain runoff instead of puddling.Overall, I think it was worth the extra money to buy a Weber-branded cover. It's made well and it fits the grill perfectly. The guy at Ace Hardware mentioned that the Weber-branded covers are made better, which is why mine lasted as long as it did. If you get several more years of use from a higher-cost cover, the difference in cost is worth it in my opinion.
B0013JJ79M The Weber grill is great and we bought almost every accessory. When you get a high end grill you need to protect it
B0013JJ79M Great fit and nice looking cover.  Wish it had a way to attach it more securely as the wind can sometimes lift it off the grill.
B0013JJ79M It fits like a glove--which is too say, too snug.  I cannot just plop it on... you have finesse it and get the edges on and then gradually pull all the sides down.  Almost like getting on a tight pair of jeans.  Wish this cover had a loose fit and if I could do it over again, I would get a generic one that I could put on faster and easier.
B0013LI4GM This was larger than I thought it would be. I haven't used it yet, but I can tell it will be PERFECT for transplanting plants, and re-potting. I'm very excited to get some dirt in it.
B0013LI4GM the product is very handy and save a lot of mess. works great and fits neatly in the new potting stand i ordered with it for her birthday, thanks amazon for great products, service, and fast delivery.
B0013LI4GM During the winter I generally pot up plants and plant seeds in the house. This produst keeps all the potting mixes confined so it doesnt go all over the place. Great product would recommend.
B0013LI4GM Simple formed piece of green plastic (don't pay a lot!) but it's good for the intended purpose of giving you an easy to clean spot for potting plants. It lives in the basement with the seed-starting setups for early Spring plantings.
B0013LI4GM Ok, Spring is upon us and pretty soon I can start planting flowers.  I found this on a warehouse deal and bought it right away and received it quickly.  This potting tray is huge and will work perfect to set on my patio table to plant flowers yet still keep the work area around me clean.  Plus I like the fact if I am not finished, all I have to do is pick this up, keep it out of the rain or away from the squirrels digging in it, then pull it out the next day and continue.
B0014NJDQ4 Products arrived packaged very well, quickly and with moist soil. I repotted them and they are still growing with no issues. Looking forward to kiwis.
B0014NJDQ4 so far, i can say that the plants arrived healthy and happy.  I planted them outside when it started getting very cold in November and they lost their leaves quickly.  i can't tell if they are alive but if they die it would be my fault for not protecting them better while young.  I was sent small but healthy plants.
B0014NJDQ4 I'm also in Oklahoma and as another reviewer mentioned, our winters can be cold or mild, but our summers are dependably hot and long.  I haven't succeeded at actually growing kiwi yet because my first try several years ago, I planted them in less than great soil in full sun and didn't give them enough attention.  My first plants were larger, older and much more expensive plants purchased from a different nursery.  They predictably succumbed to the poor site and lack of attention.Next try was smaller, less expensive plants that I planted in partial shade, better soil and watered regularly.  They were growing nicely until rabbits or squirrels decided to chew off the vines near the soil.This time I plan to use the partially shaded site and protect my young vines with hardware cloth until they are thick enough and strong enough to no longer appeal to the creatures who rule our yard.This purchase was the least expensive of my three attempts at growing kiwi.  When I received the potted plants, the female had green buds, but the male was not alive.  I contacted the seller about the male plant and he immediately resolved the problem.  I purchased a replacement for the male and it arrived alive with green buds along the vines.Even though the plants are relatively small, they are very vigorous and healthy.  Mine are still inside and are growing fast.  If I do my part and adequately protect and care for them, I expect them to be a terrific bargain.Having purchased from this seller for many years, I trust them.  This was the first time I ever received a dead plant from them and it was quickly and easily resolved.  They had some of the best prices and offer an enormous selection of plants and seeds that are often difficult to obtain.
B0014NJDQ4 In the ground and growing like champs.  I am sure they will produce as advertised.  They will grow up to a trellis and should be happy.
B0014NJDQ4 Like some other reviewers, my female plant died while the male was still thriving. However, I contacted Hirt's and they immediately sent me a replacement Anna. Excellent customer service!After I had the new Anna in the ground, I watched her a little more closely. I noticed that if we hadn't had rain for a bit, the Anna plant started drooping long before her husband. I have to water her about twice as often as Meader. I'm guessing this was the culprit in the other Anna deaths as well; she seems to require more water than Meader. Wasn't Hirt's fault that she died, really, as she was very healthy when she arrived. The first Anna's demise was all on me for neglecting the poor girl.Since I've planted Anna the Second and have been watching her and watering her when necessary, though, she's done beautifully and has grown a good six inches in the last month. Meader the First is also doing beautifully and has grown a good eight to ten inches, but then he had about a month head start:)Edit; Planted these in 2013. This winter in Iowa was...chilly, to put it mildly. Writing this in April 2014, however, I can attest that both Anna the Second and Meader the First survived the polar vortex and all the -30F temps it could throw at them with only a little minor branch tip damage. Both are now happily leafing out again. Very pleased. If these things can survive that, they can survive ANYTHING.
B0015031R8 I've had a problem with carpenter ants in my kitchen as long as I have owned this house, almost 25 years. I suspect they are living in the large maple tree in my backyard. At first I tried other brands of bait but none of them seem to attract ants, much less kill them.Then I tried Terro II. Well, the word went out, \"Free eats in Boilermate's kitchen.\" and the ants came running. They were two deep around the large drops I put on the piece of cardboard. They gobbled it up so fast that I had to put more out to keep them all satisfied. The girls dutifully took it back to the nest and shared it with their Fearless Leader. Within a couple of days the ants were gone, and stayed gone for the rest of the season.Now I put out a new feast each time the first Scouts of Spring are spotted patrolling my kitchen counters. More times than not they suck it up and the new nest is no more.I've tried other brands with supposedly the same ingredients, such as Revenge, but none of them have worked as effectively as Terro.
B0015031R8 It seems that two or three times a year we have a problem with ants in the house. We've tried various sprays and ant traps in the past, but over the past few years we've used Terro. Nothing works like Terro in getting rid of the ants. A couple drops on a small piece of cardboard placed near the source and within an hour or so the ants are surrounding the Terro. In a day or so all the ants are gone. This has been our experience every time we've used Terro. I wouldn't use anything else for ants that have already gotten into the house. (A perimeter ant spray helps in keeping them from getting into the house in the first place.)
B0015031R8 There are a lot of insect killers available but the most effective one for me has always been Terro.  You are not just killing the ants you see.  You are supplying them with party food to take back to the queen and the rest of the nest.  That way the entire colony dies and they don't come back.I like this as I simply follow their little invisible trail and place a small piece of hard cardboard on the trail and put some drops of Terro onto it.  I use a small square  part that I cut off of the cardboard flap of the Terro box.  The ants love this stuff and soon there are a lot of them gathering up food to take home.  I had a big nest under my deck and I let the ants carry the poison to their home instead of me having to crawl under the deck.I have used Terro for many years and it works well and it does what it claims it will do.  I recommend it to you as a great product.  I just resupplied for the Spring and Summer ant invasion!
B0015031R8 This stuff is the best ant killer I've ever used.  You have to be a bit patient, but it's well worth it.  When you see ants don't just kill them and wipe them away, you need to leave them some yummy ant bait and let them alone till the next day (maybe sooner, if not quite as many ants).  If you kill on site they will simply come back to the same place or maybe somewhere else if there is still chemicals near that area.  But with this stuff they swarm to the drops and hardly go anywhere else, they return it to the nest and the next day you don't see them.  I've had several instances over the years where I've used this and I usually don't seem them again for several months or more.  The worst infestation we had was waking up to find them in the cereal cupboard.  I used cleaner in that case to kill and wipe away, threw out anything they got into.  But I tracked the trail to the entry area, which was a few cupboards away, and left a few dime-sized areas of Terro nearby.  They went right to it, only a couple would stray beyond to wander around, otherwise they would go right back into their hole with the poison.  Next day they were gone, just have to throw away the cutouts with the poison on them.  No traces of ants at all except a couple dead ones that probably drowned in the poison.  If you can find the ant trail on the outside you can leave drops there and just kill those that are inside, eventually you will get all those inside because no more are coming in, they are all stopping at the drops and returning to nest.  Good stuff!  :)
B0015031R8 I get those tiny little things I've heard called sugar ants in my kitchen.  My sister told me about this and I ordered it and within 2 days the were gone.  After the first use a few months later after heavy rains for a week I saw them in droves again in the kitchen so I got it out and put out two little stations of it in their path and they gathered around the drops of it overnight and the next morning they'd disappeared again.  I'd say this stuff is a big success.
B0015031R8 I was crazy about my new house -- until the ants came marching in. I couldn't believe it when I  saw hundreds trailing along the woodwork toward my kitchen cabinets. I mean that: hundreds. Someone told me about Terro. I had it in place for only a couple of days when presto! -- the ants disappeared. I've never been bothered again. I put out the Terro every year just in case. I also use the outdoor version of this product on my wood deck.
B0015031R8 I purchased this product about a year ago and just realized I hadn't written a review. Since I'm buying it again, I guess that tells you that it works. In fact, this is the only product that has worked for us to get rid of ants. We tried the little ant bait thing a few times in the past, you know, the things that look like modernistic little ant houses with little doorways around the edges. They seemed not to be to the taste of our picky little red ants (the kind that smell kind of like turpentine if you squish one). They always seem to be attracted to this stuff. With this product you can put out as many drops as you figure you need or follow the instructions and put a couple of drops on a piece of coated cardboard which is in the box. I use a small plastic can lid with low sides. I use about half a teaspoon or more. I place it in an area that isn't accessible to our pets, like in the far corner of the cupboard beneath the sink, with lots of bottles and things in front of it.After an hour or so there are hundreds of ants eating the stuff and carrying it back to the nest. Usually one day is all it takes. Occasionally a second application is needed. The ants just totally disappear. It's usually a couple months before they find their way back in, but we're always prepared with Terro.
B0015031R8 Ants can be a real nuisance.  When I see them swarming in the house, my natural reaction is to spray them with a diluted soap solution, which kills them almost immediately.Using a product like Terro Liquid Ant Killer, requires suppressing my \"kill immediately\" mindset and taking a long term approach.  The very best case scenario is that the foraging worker ants will consume the ant killer, and take it back to the colony, where it is consumed by the Queen ant.  When she dies, the colony will become crippled and die out.It sounds great in theory, and every species of ant I have encountered seems to love drinking the liquid.  It's very cool watching them maniacally feed, but how likely is it really that the poisonous solution will find its way back to her royal highness?  Probably, very, very, low.Many ant colonies are quite intensive, span large areas, can contain millions of ants, and some have several queens.  Believing that the few ants consuming the poison, will fortuitously also feed and kill the Queen, is quite a long shot.  Logically the more ants that drink the poison, the greater the odds of success.  So infecting as many ants as possible makes sense, but that's a little challenging with the product being sold in one or two ounce bottles, and administered by the drop.  It just doesn't seem very efficient, or provide the coverage to poison enough ants.I live in a temperate part of the country, and have four or five different species of ants constantly battling for territory in my yard.  They are basically everywhere there is soil.  Having used this product and similar liquid ant baits, many, many times, I have yet to see it wipe out a colony.The ingredients listed on the label are \"Sodium Tetraborate Decahydrate (Borax) 5.4%\", and \"Other Ingredients: 94.6%\".  Assuming the costs are nominal for these ingredients, the percentage of profit on a product like this must be astronomical.  If liquid ant killer was sold by the pint instead of by the ounce, at a price closer to actual costs, with a more efficient system of distributing the poison (traps or other dispensers), I suspect the product would have a much higher rate of success.  But of course, that would be financial suicide for Terro, who make no promises regarding success.  Consider this, at the retail cost of $6.50 for two ounces, Terro Ant Killer costs about $416 per gallon (128 ounces).  At the price for the one ounce bottle ($4.25), a gallon costs $544.  This stuff is not cheap!I like to gamble, so I still use the product occasionally, with the hope that maybe just once I will get lucky and wipe out a colony.  Seeing the ants literally crawl over each other to guzzle down the stuff, feeds my fantasy that this will be the time the deadly elixir makes its way down through the depths of the colony, to the Queen's lips (sorry, mandibles), and she will meet a tragic end.Ant bait works.  What appears to be missing is some accurate data about how much liquid, and how many ants may need to be poisoned, to stand a good chance of taking out a colony.  If as I suspect, both numbers are quite substantial, that information probably won't be forthcomming from Terro anytime soon.
B0015AOT4W This is a very simple sprinkler.  You control it by increase or decrease of water pressure which is controlled by how wide you open the spigot of water to which the hose is attached.  How much of the area is covered depends on how strong your water pressure is at its max.  The biggest area I can get is about 10 feet circle.  And, of course, anything less is obtained by just by turning down the water flow.This sprinker works well for spot watering.  I have two small areas in the front lawn that I need to water, so I move the sprinkler a few times to get the entire area covered.Since it has no moving parts this sprinkler is going to outlast all my other rotation and oscillating sprinklers that I use in the back yard. It has one advantage over the alternative spot sprinklerGilmour 876R Rectangular Pattern Spot Sprinkler: this sprinkler is much heavier, so it is better \"fighting\" the hose. With the lighter models if the hose does not lay flat, neither does the sprinkler.This is a very good solution for a small area.
B0015AOT4W Chunk of cast iron that sprays out water.  This puts out a fairly consistent spray pattern and the weight helps keep it in place.  It gets a little rusty but oh well.  No parts to break. Maybe replace the seal every once in a while.  I like simple technology that works.  This is easier than my irrigation system as long as I have time to drag it around the back yard.  Five Stars!
B0015AOT4W Having had a number of rotary and oscillating sprinklers that stopped working, I was attracted to this product because it has no moving parts to fail.  And so it works and keeps on working.  The design is tried and true--my grandmother used a similar sprinkler for many years decades ago.A couple of suggestions.  I take it off the hose and let the sprinkler dry when done, because the interior rusts (not sure the rust hurts anything).  Also, cast iron is somewhat brittle, so I don't let it hit any hard surfaces--my grandmother knocked off a chunk of her sprinkler this way, but it kept on working for ages after that regardless.
B0015AOT4W Was looking for a quality, inexpensive little sprinkler that wouldn't break at the end of the summer like the last two I had.  I ordered this because of the good reviews, and, as always, the wisdom of the Amazon crowds did not let me down.  As soon as I received it, I could tell it was of a LOT higher quality than the plastic junk I've bought in the past.  In action, it proved great as well.  It sprays a nice, big circle of water, whose radius depends on how much you open up the valve at the hose junction at the house.  It's nice and heavy, and stays put.  It also doesn't have any moving parts that will just wear out or break.  In all, this is a great sturdy product for very little dough.
B0015AOT4W When I took this sprinkler out of the box I was surprised by how small but heavy it is.  Unlike other adjustable sprinklers where you have to fiddle with them for a good five minutes before you get the spray pattern you want, this little guy is super easy to use, just plug and spray!  I use it on our flower beds and it seems to do the trick.  I gave it four stars because some of the paint at the base was starting to flake off, but I foresee using this for a long time.
B0015AOT4W Cast iron, brightly colored so its easy to spot in the grass, smaller than most sprinklers, throws a very serious amount of water in a wide pattern.  No moving parts, heavy enough to toss it around a little without breaking it...it should last as long as its predecessor which was similar and lasted for >10 years before I broke it.Edit: I'm going to cut back on expected lifetime.  There is no paint or coating on the interior of this sprinkler, and its already started to rust from the inside out, quite aggressively.  In fact, if you've used this and shut it off and then pick up the hose, you'll get a quart of very rusty water out of the sprinkler, which doesn't come out of the pants too easily.So what will happen is that this will rust considerably on the inside over the next couple of years (including as I see the hose threading) and either the hose attach piece will snap off or it'll crack the next time I accidentally whack it on a rock.A little coating on the inside would have considerably extended the lifespan.  Bummer, but its all about saving a few pennies in manufacturing these days.Update: I dropped this from 5 stars to 2, and it probably deserves one star.  As I mentioned in the original review, its made from cast iron, and no attempt was made to coat or seal the inside.  Its already halfway rusted out after less than a years use.I don't know about you, but I'm pretty tired of buying things that are intended to come into contact with water and they rust in under a year.  I have a similar head that lasted a very long time, but thats because the manufacturer galvanized it, inside and out.  I have many other sprinklers that are almost 20 years old.So, fabulous sprinkler if you only plan on using it one summer and then tossing it.
B0015AP1QM I like these timers because they're inexpensive and easy to use. Unfortunately when it comes to watering devices, there's no market for truly durable and long-lasting stuff - it would be too expensive - despite the complexity of controlling water at high pressure in a challenging outdoor environment. Hence the mixed reviews and disappointment for most of the watering devices sold here. (But would the same folks pay two or three times as much for better gear?) These timers are no exception. One in four or five is defective, and after two seasons' use, they leak like crazy. But given the price, they're an OK deal.  You just have to assume they'll need replacing every other year.
B0015AP1QM It works as advertised...a month so far.  Most of these gadgets last a season, we shall see.
B0015AP1QM While performs decently and is relatively inexpensive, it has flaws.* It in not all that accurate in watering time, 15 min. setting can be anywhere in actual time from 10 to 25 min. -- I would NOT trust it enough to go off for 4 or 5 hours and leave it on and rely on it to shut off.* It is not very weather durable.* One of two I owned and have used leaked moderately and the other one slightly.Not Impressed and will try other timers in future even if they cost a couple of dollars more.
B0015AP1QM Easy to install, works great.  I did not remove during winter (got down to 25 degrees) and there was no leakage or problems.
B0015AP1QM Simple technology and easy to use.  Best one on the market just now, I think.  Orbit has added a small reset trigger to its unit which does not work as expected and sometimes starts flowing again when it is supposed to be shut off.  No problem with this Nelson.
B0015ASY3Y This is a very simple sprinkler.  You control it by increase or decrease water pressure by how wide you open the spigot of water to which the hose is attached.  How much of the area is covered depends on how strong your water pressure is at its max.  The biggest area I can get is about 10 feet square.

With the lighter models if the hose does not lay flat, neither does the sprinkler.This is a very good solution for a small area.
B0015ASY3Y Good: Very heavy, actually waters in a nearly perfect square, great for doing corners of the yard and sits still even under high water pressure. The diameter seems to be about 12-18 feet depending on pressure. Any lower and it turns into a fountain.Bad: Rusts inside. Each time I turn it on, a blast of rusty water comes out. I have had it a few months, and I doubt it'll last a long time. However, at this price, you could just buy another one.
B0015ASY3Y I love this little sprinkler. With our community's 60 pound water pressure it covers a decent sized area. It throws pretty large drops so the water falls back onto the lawn instead of blowing or evaporating away. And it doesn't take long to saturate an area.I did notice that since it has such a low profile, longer blades of grass next to it can get caught in the flow and interfere with the spray pattern. I just pluck them out of the way before I turn on the sprinkler. I'm not sure the pattern is all that sharp of a square, but it is square-ish, and that's good enough in our yard.I think it's a great sprinkler for kids to play in. It has no moving parts to break and no sharp edges to step on. And the flow can be adjusted downward until it's a gentle bubbler. It is cast iron and weighs a pound or two, so it could be painful if one of the kids decides to swing it around on the end of the hose like a mace. Other than that it should be great for play on a hot summer afternoon.The sprinkler technology here is vintage and bone simple -- it's a cast iron chamber with a little hole in the top. There's nothing to fail or break. With a little care -- very little -- it will last for years and years. You might want to smear a little grease in the threads to keep them from rusting, and occasionally remove it from the hose end to keep the two from rusting together. Every few years a spritz of spray paint will keep it looking like new.
B0015ASY3Y With 50 feet of hose, a timer, and four snap together couplings, the water dribbled out of the top.  After removing all the couplings but keeping the timer, the sprinkler produced a big enough, fairly rectangular water pattern.
B0015ASY3Y Solid, simple, I can't imagine how this thing could break, short of an asteroid disaster.  A rectangular one would be nice, too.
B0015ASY3Y The Nelson cast iron square sprinkler is a good deal more solid than some of their other products.  I bought one to replace theNelson Multi-Pattern Spray Oscillating Sprinkler with Flow Control and 3,750 Square-Foot Coverage 50936I purchased last summer, which is already rusted.  This one looks a good deal more solid, but the coverage I am getting is considerably less than advertised.  I wanted it to water a small vegetable garden, but needed the reach as it is too far for my hose to reach.  If it had the coverage they describe, it would have been perfect.  As it is, it falls a few feet short.  Even if I buy a longer hose, this may not do it, as I am only getting a 10 foot (each direction) spray.  It looks like it should almost be a fountain in a small pond.  If you have a very small yard this might work for you, but be aware that the 30 foot spray pattern is an optimistic estimate.
B0015ASY3Y Having had a number of rotary and oscillating sprinklers that stopped working, I was attracted to this product because it has no moving parts to fail. So it works and keeps on working. The design is tried and true--my grandmother used a round variant of this sprinkler almost daily for many years decades ago.A couple of tips.  I take it off the hose and let the sprinkler dry when done, because the interior rusts (not sure the rust hurts anything).  Also, cast iron is somewhat brittle, so I don't let it fall on any hard surfaces--my grandmother knocked off a chunk of her sprinkler this way, although it kept on working for ages after that regardless.
B0015ASY3Y this sprinkler is the perfect balance, no moving parts!my last sprinkler got gunked up with the minerals in the water and then some plastic parts failed.this is perfect for putting water where you need it, I can control the size of the pattern with ease and not waste it on the driveway or sidewalk.going to get a second one for the back yard.
B0015ASY3Y This sprinkler earns high marks for being built to last.  I have gone through many sprinklers that ultimately fail due to cheap construction, failure of moving parts, or water deposits.  This sprinkler has no moving parts whatever; I expect it to work as well in fifty years as it does today.  Here are some observations based on my experience:*  Durability - This unit is made from cast iron.  It is therefore heavy and stays where planted.  It tends to want to remain flat on the ground and is more resistant to tilting due to hose twist or stiff grass than lighter plastic sprinklers.  The finish is yellow and has lasted well so far.  Being iron, I reckon rust may be an issue to its innards if left wet for a while, but you would really have to let it soak for that to affect functionality.*  Pattern - The square hole on top of the sprinkler does a reasonably good job of creating a square watering pattern.  I have noticed with mine, however, that it sprinkles significantly more to one side. (to the left, facing the hose inlet side)  Front to back coverage seems about equal.*  Coverage - This has been less than advertised, in my experience.  I'm on city water here, with very good pressure and flow.  It still covers a decent area, but I would count on it covering 20 - 25 feet square, rather than 30.*  Effectiveness - Unlike some sprinklers, this one tends not to create a fine mist that can get carried away by a light breeze - good for keeping water where you want it.  The flow is good for quick watering, and it produces large droplets.  While the unit sits low to the ground - it's about two inches high - the water emits from the center and not the sides, reducing the likelihood of tall grass obstructing the water.*  What it's good for - it is ideal for straight-sided lawns in the 'burbs that do not exceed the reach of the sprinkler, from narrow parking strips to front or back yards.  For my relatively narrow but long front yard, I put the sprinkler at one end and just pull it along to the next section when the first part's been watered enough.  As I mentioned, it is heavy enough to stay flat and not flip over so I don't have to turn the water off to re-position it.*  Where it's made - For those who care about this kind of thing, it is made in China.  From a manufacturing and quality point of view, I don't think this matters a whit in the case of this sprinkler.*  Value - I think this is priced reasonably and represents decent value for a sprinkler that you can count on never failing.  It may be had cheaper at a local big box store, but I have yet to see this model locally.So while I really like this sprinkler, I give it four stars rather than five due to a lower coverage than expected and the fact that the area does not get covered quite equally. (which, admittedly, is the challenge of any sprinkler)  Also, though I think the price is reasonable it still could be a bit less in my view.  Solid product.
B0015ASY3Y This is nothing fancy, though I kind of like it!  It certainly does the job, and it is heavy so it doesn't get pulled off the lawn by my curly hose.  I have a small lawn, and it covers about half at a time.  I suppose my lawn is 25 by 12 or 15 feet.
B0015ASY3Y OK, so the spread isn't exactly square, slightly uneven, or smaller than expected.  This simple, timeless design far outweighs these potential shortcomings.  As far as I'm concerned, water is water...whether the lawn gets 1\" or 1.27\", I could care less.  I just accommodate the flow to get the best coverage I can.  It's really not that hard.  For a larger area, this probably isn't the best sprinkler.  I use this for a 800sf patch of parkway in the front of the house...nothing more, nothing less.  The only concern I have is the fear of dropping it on the sidewalk and having it shatter in a dozen pieces.  Until then, I'll watch the grass grow :)
B0015AUOSC This is by far the best hoze nozzle I've ever owned.  The water flow is incredible.  It is easy to adjust the flow, and the shut-off valce is positive and easy to use.  My wife loves this for shooing birds out of our trees after they attack our cat in the yard.  The spray can be adjusted fine enough to use as a cooling spray, not a small thing in Phoenix.  We bought two after trying one.** Updated ReviewAfter a few months of using this Nozzle, we are even more impressed.  There are no signs of wear after a harsh Arizona summer, and the nozzles (we have two) function as smoothly as the day we got them.
B0015AUOSC Needed something powerful for the boat at the dock, this works great and has a strong pressure and control! Much recommended!
B0015AUOSC Because my water pressure is NOT that great, this product under performs.  It looks so cool, and the ON/OFF handle is so nice... but the lack of high water pressure makes this a joke.  Well, to be honest, the family did not laugh at the nozzle, they laughed at ME for the lack of performance.  No man wants to be made fun of in that area.  Instead, go with the little brass nozzle (Amazon.com) and you WILL be the envy of everyone.  Best of all, now my Grandson feels like a real fireman when he uses that one.
B0015AUOSC I now have three of these fireman style spray nozzles (and all three continue to operate very well - one is probably 5 years old) and am always disappointed whenever I purchase something else that ceases to function in a very short time period.  I don't expect you will be disappointed with the ease of use, no leakage when flipped off, variable spray capability and rugged build of this nozzle.
B0015AUOSC This nozzle is terrific, it turned out to be bigger than I expected, but it performs great!!  You really notice the difference in water flow compared to those gun trigger nozzles and with this shutoff handle it doesn't spray me in the face whenever I drop the nozzle, like those gun nozzles always seem to do!
B0015AUOSC I planned to give this to my son but I gave it a test drive and decided to keep it. So easy to just flip the lever to shut off the water supply versus the one I did use where you have to turn it to shut it off and then you have to try to find the setting you want when you turn it back on. This is HUGE but don't let that stop you - it works great.
B0015AUOSC this monster weighs nearly 2 lbs. is 8 inches long by 3-1/2 inches diameter. it destroyed a perfectly good hose as the weight and unwieldiness of it opened up the hose itself at the nozzle connection. i am going to donate mine to the fire department, maybe they can use it.
B0015AUOSC I bought two of these two years ago.  I use one on my front porch and one on my back deck to water plants and flowers that I can reach with my hose.  I don't bother to plant farther out any more because of water restrictions in my state.  Be careful, there is a part inside in the middle that is plastic and WILL break.  I dropped one of the older ones on the concrete driveway and it's now a door stop at my son's house.  This year I went back and bought four more.  I still have two hidden away for posterity. (Someone will find them when I am dead and gone and say something about \"that crazy lady\") I must say that two years ago I paid about $12 for them and this year only about $10 each at a membership club out of Arkansas.  They do make a fine mist for delicate seedlings and all the way up to a knock out the windows kind of power to reach the far away plants.  I do use them to reach windows to clean and my son is always using one to wash off his car every time he comes over.  It's especially handy in the Spring with all of that yellow pollen.  I wash down the deck and the front porch almost daily.  I love the handle on it.  It is not backwards to me.  The packaging says its 350 psi and 205 bars?  Whatever that it.  I love it.  Take it inside in the winter when you turn the water off outside.Update:  April 2011.  We have now turned the water on for the summer and attached my \"fireman's hose nozzle\" to hoses on front porch and back deck.  Keeps the pollen off daily and any other problems.  My son just left after washing bird droppings off his car.  Don't buy black cars. I think this is our third summer with these nozzles and I still have two hidden away.  I did add new O-rings.3-24-12:  Because we had no winter we turned on the water mid-March and only added new O-rings to the nozzle. I still have two new ones, never used, put away for posterity.  The pollen count was over 9,000 last week and I've been washing pollen off the front porch and the deck daily.  Working great! This is the 4th or 5th year of use.  These nozzles are a great investment.
B0015AUOSC The dimensions of the product were listed. I just don't visualize very well. It almost takes two hands to hold this beast. It is simply a giant-size screw-nozzle and emits an authoritative volume of water if you have good pressure. If your local water pressure is otherwise, don't get it.  It seems sturdy and I like the big on/off handle that lets you save your setting instead of having to twist it all the way shut.Update 2012. Love this thing, the way I can focus the powerful stream of water down to a dime-sized target three feet away. It actually replaces the pressure washer for some tasks. No leakage either.Update 2013. So good, somebody stole it off the hose. I bought another.
B0015AUOSC The nozzle works as described. However it doesn't show any advantage over the old-time twist nozzle. The intensity and distance of the spray is the same.This may be a function of water pressure in our home.
B0015AUOSC I loved this so much, I bought two of these.  This fireman's nozzle is by far the best one I have seen on the market.  They do not leak unless the rubber washer is missing.  While I like the Gilmour pistol design better, (it's comfortable and looks like a Star Trek phaser,) this Nelson 50503 Fireman's hose nozzle's all metal construction performs far superior. It would do even better with higher municipal water pressure than I currently have (50psi), and a pistol design for easy handling, but that is unnecessary.  I find this Nelson nozzle easiest to use by draping the hose over my shoulder.  Highly recommended.  Put out your fires with this nozzle and high pressure, or just use it to reach far away plants, or get back at your friends.
B0015AUOSC This nozzle works really well but maybe not to the psi it claims to.  The easy on/off handle is a great feature.
B0015UCRXM It's like a handyvac for underwater use.  The design is simple and the suction adequate to clean the bottom of a small temporary pool.  Ours is a 12' Intex Easy Set and this pool broom works just fine.  The device is only about 4 feet long, so if you need a longer one you'll have to use the (included) pole adapter with a pole extension (not included).
B0015UCRXM This is a must have for the little Intex pools. Not only does it clean up all the dirt, it sucked up almost of the dead algae that the filter is just not strong enough for. Last year I ended up dumping my pool due to algae..this year the Aqua Broom was a lifesaver! My pool was clear within a day! Used for the Intex 15' by 48\"Metal Frame pool. Thanks
B0015UCRXM If you have an algae problem in a small pool, with a few suggestions and some patience, this will save the day!We have a 13' Intex above ground pool, and after a hot summer start, the algae got ahead of us.  I tried sucking it through the pump filter, but it's a cheap(but much loved and used)pool and I couldn't clean it out.I didn't want to spend big bucks for a vacuum or drain the pool, so after reading all the reviews on this item, especially the positive ones that were successful, I gave it a try, and by golly, it works.  Here's my suggestions:1. Of course, shock the pool really well2.  Let it settle overnight3. Put one of the two sock-like filters provided with the vacuum over the main filter; the instructions are limited to the box cover and couple sheets of simple drawings.  It runs on 5 D batteries which last 2-3 hours; twisting the torso turns it on and off(we had no problems with that, but do it out of the water.)4.  Buy an $8-10 extension rod at Walmart, pool store or Amazon to save your back from all the bending5. Have a hose ready to rinse off the filter- about every 3-5 minutes6. Carefully, very slowly suck the algae off the bottom; move forward an inch at a time, this is crucial; watch the vacuum as it sucks up the algae off the bottom; when it stops drawing it up or greatly slows- it's time to rinse the filter with the hose.  You can see the algae and debris easily in the filter.Do not vacuum back and forth like a house vacuum or move too fast, or you'll stir up the algae and disperse it.Yes, it's a slow process, but what do you want for $30? And it eliminates leaves and bigger debris much easier. Happy swimming!Addendum- now that it's the end of summer, and I've used this for awhile, I would add that some of the finer algae escapes through the Water Tech filter while I'm vacuuming.  I run the pool's filter as well and eventually between the two, I get the pool clean or at least not green.  But, and it's a big But, it's still a slow process.  For my 13' foot pool, it takes me all week after heavy algae infiltration.  Best is preventative care.
B0015UCRXM I use this little guy every day to clean my small pool. It comes with a micro filter, but any knee high nylon will work. The batteries lasted me about 3 weeks before I had to change them.
B0015UCRXM This is a good product. However, it would even be better if it was wider than just 6 inches. I know its a spot cleaner but it has enough power to do an entire large above ground pool.  I would definately pay more if it was bigger with rechargables. But for 30 bucks you get the size you pay for. Nice little unit for spot cleaning spas and such. I hope to find something a bit larger instead of having to use the large vacuums to clean my pool. Those large things are a hassle to put in and take out. But this aqua broom does the job and is nice and easy to use.UPDATE...7/5/12...The one thing I have come to notice is this vacuum will, for the lack of a better word, recycle the fine dirt on the bottom of the pool. So after vacuuming and thinking the pool is clean, an hour later I see the dirt has settled on the bottom again. So in order to prevent this, Ive wrapped a pantyhose around the existing filter. This helps catch the finer particles. They also sell an additional filter for this very problem. So either wrap it or buy a filter for the \"finer things in life.\" lol
B0015WUQ24 I tilled the hill on my backyard and I have some ground cover plants on it now.  I was really worried that it would rain hard before the ground cover could prevent soil erosion.  I decided to spray this on to my plants to speed up the growing process.  It worked.  Not only did it work on the ground cover but the flowers in the flower bed also started to bloom and it looks great.  I use it once a week to keep it growing faster.  Excellent product.
B0015WUQ24 Miracle-Gro is our fertilizer of choice for our flowers and veggies.  The LiquaFeed refills are much more expensive compared to buying the powder and mixing with water, but we use this for small areas that don't require gallons of mix.  It is truly convenient, but truly too expensive for broad gardening needs.Recommended if you don't mind paying more than double the cost of regular Miracle-Gro.
B0015WUQ24 With this you can't go wrong.  It saves time and money, and both are very important to me!  My fruit trees, strawberries, hanging pots all love a good spray of this fertilizer.  It also keeps their leaves nice and clean, as I probably would not spray my trees with water if I wasn't fertilizing.  Clean leaves make happier trees and Miracle Grow in the spray makes them happy.This is a winner!
B0015WUQ24 I use this as an all purpose fertilizer for my annuals, shrubs and groundcover. Seems to get the job done. I've used these for years and have been happy with my plants...
B0015WUQ24 I used these on a few different types of plants and it helps them grow.  I should probably use it more often instead of regular water and just kind of go back and forth between water and miracle grow.
B00173ELYK Received our watering can and is exactly what I was looking for. We live out on the lake in the country and it is a cute addition to our deck. Holds a lot of water and love the spout. Galvanized metal is nice and shiny. Love it!
B00173ELYK After reading other negative reviews on:1.  receiving item damaged due to poor packaging2.  Poor galvanization / spurs / rough spots on finish3.  Poor construction / qualityI was hesitant to order...................HOWEVERReceived item today.  Yes box was too large and a large corner portion of shipping box was damaged.  Watering can was only wrapped in brown shipping paper.  The watering can WAS NOT damaged and was in perfect condition.Next I examined fit / finish.  I ran my hand across all seams / handles / areas hands contact - NO FINISH ISSUES.Quality of this all metal can is superb.  Three gallon capacity provides ample watering capacity yet watering can is not akward or impossible to manage for those who may not have superhuman strength.  (SIDENOTE - We have lots of annuals in planters, urns, flowerboxes all around the hose.  Hose watering isn't always most efficient or practical.  I was able to give half of the flowers a good drink with one fill up.)The floret is soldered on, it can not be removed.The quality of this item is outstanding and I expect years of trouble free service.  If you are in the market for a quality watering can, look no further.  You will not find anything of the like at the big box stores.My motto is and always has been spend more the first time and buy right.  This watering can fits the bill.  You won't regret the purchase.Purchase again?  YES
B00173ELYK Just wanted to take a minute and write a short review on this 3 gallon watering can.  For years I purchased the plastic 1 and 2 gallons watering cans.  As you know, these break down and fall apart in a year or so.  That being said, I decided to try an old school metal can.  I am happy with the purchase and it works great.  Holds a lot of water which reduces your trips to the tap.  Well made and I would purchase again if necessary.
B00173ELYK Glad I ignored the negative reviews. High functional galvanized steel, with good ergonomics and good solder flow. No leaks. Made in Mexico and a nice finish. I was very , very pleased with this purchase. Nozzles does not detach, so it is a sprinkle only can which is what I wanted. Best value for the money given I could not find a steel version made in the USA or Canada.
B00173ELYK This watering can is a little rough around the edges, no big deal.  The head leaked a little, but stopped with wraps of teflon tape.  I got the 2.5 gallon size and use it to mix fland food.  It's nice because it's galvanised and can stay outside.  I would recomend this can to men and women, but don't expect it to be smooth and girly.
B00173ELYK I have an old galvanize can (antique) that looks very similar to this one.  I was hopeful......(sigh)The can arrived and the first thing I noticed is how flimsy it is.  The galvanized metal is so much thinner than the old-timey ones...typical for all modern products, I suppose.  The second thing I noticed is where it's made.  No, not China...Mexico.  Figures.The screw off nozzle did screw off, but then wouldn't screw back on.  Why?  Because the thread is almost non-existent.  But I'm fairly handy and was able to jury-rig it back on.  Water pours from the nozzle much better than any plastic model off the shelf, I will give it that.The wire carrying handle, with the cheap little plastic hand guard is just that....cheap, cheap and flimsy.  After one season in the sun the plastic will get brittle and crack for sure....I've already duct taped mine to make a more useful hand guard with a bit of cushioning.Why didn't I return it?  I should have....it most certainly is NOT worth the money, but I'm stubborn and too lazy to shop for another watering can.  (How odd that I will gladly haul water back and forth on 2 acres all day, but the effort to shop for a better can just seems too daunting.)
B0017K651A Since I use sticks that fall from my trees for kindling, I do a lot of pickup and transport. This unit offers some good features but is not perfect.  I usually load the sticks and branches into a big wagon or cart when I originally pick them up around the property, but then dump them in a convenient location nearer the house. I use the caddy to transport a load from that pile to my porch stairs where I transfer them to a canvas tote to carry up to the porch storage area.  Lots of work, but worth it to me because it not only saves buying kindling, it keeps my large yard stick free.Some kindling pieces are really small logs and some are spindly sticks--and everything in between.  This caddy is easy to load and unload and carries a good sized load as long as the sticks on the bottom of the front section are set so they don't drag on the ground.  I do some break up before loading this thing and more before transferring what I want to the canvas carrier. Since I'm moving the caddy to different places where the ground can be damp and yielding, it helps a lot that the front part of the caddy rests directly on the ground as that offers a sturdier base than feet that might sink in causing the caddy to tip.I didn't notice any odor as others have mentioned, but then the box sat outside for a couple of days and I assembled the caddy outside.  Assembly was both easy and more awkward than I would have liked.  There is a list of all the tools you'll need.  I did have to get a wrench for the nuts, but my multi-tool provided the other things needed.  The awkward part of assembly was trying to hold the pieces together while starting and tightening the nuts because of how they fit together.  One of the screws used to hold the U-shaped front and back pieces stripped, but I improved the fit by tapping on the top piece to realign the holes slightly giving a smaller opening.  Assembly didn't take long and the unit is relatively sturdy afterward--but not completely tight.The fitted cover seems sturdy and useful for loads of an orderly size such as that shown, but it doesn't work for my odd sized loads.  All in all, though, this seems a good value for the price.  Although I hadn't used it for heavier loads, and hadn't intended too, my son loaded it right up from the wood pile to restock my porch rack and liked especially that the big wheels provided easy transport over rough ground.  He would have liked it to carry more logs in one load, but found it transported the load it does accommodate well.
B0017K651A Easy assembly and easy to roll even full.  Wife pulls a full load up our handicap ramp with ease. No problems assembling either.
B0017K651A I strongly advise that a purchaser open this package outside. There is a horrible odor that makes your eyes water.The cart isn't all that bad, it is a bit narrow which requires that you be careful not to tip it over. The odor comes from the plastic packaging material.
B0017K651A I use alot of wood all winter to heat my house. I also have alot of steps up onto my porch to carry logs up. This caddy makes the job so much easier to bring in the wood. No more back strain, I am pleased with this purchase it is very sturdy and easy to assemble. It also comes with a cover to keep the wood dry. Highly recommended.
B0017K651A About the most useful product I've purchased in a long time! I'm an almost 60 yr. old woman, live by myself, and my wood stove is my only heat source in my mountain home. I still use my fabric carrier for bringing in kindling, but this is so so much easier and faster to bring in firewood, especially up the 4 stairs to my door. I've had no problem using it in the snow or over my rocky ground. What a labor saver.I've been using this for over 2 years now. The only problem is that some of the screws have fallen out, but I replaced them with what ever would fit in my screw drawer. This has been a life saver for me, especially when I hurt my back after falling on ice. I could never have carried the wood up my stairs without it. Except for the screws, it's held up very well.
B0017M5V9A I have several items in my clothes that can attract moths (a fur coat and cashemere sweaters that I would never wear but that belonged to my grandmother and therefore get the status of family heirlooms), so moth protectin in necessary.I put this in my closet, but I haven't seen any moths yet. Perhaps, this is a good thing and indicates that there aren't any to catch. Here's hoping!
B0017M5V9A This trap can serve as part of a moth ridding system. Designed as an alert, it includes a pheromone lure which must be inserted before hanging the trap. It is designed to attract and catch male moths. It does nothing about the females or the destructive larvae other than to make you aware of the problem. Each trap is good for 12 weeks,I placed this in a small room in a basement apartment where some old clothes and linens are stored. I saw a few moths flitting around and thought this might address the help. Nothing has been trapped yet. However, I have taken some other steps. First, I laundered in hot water those items that could withstand it and froze smaller items for 72 hours. (The package recommends freezing for a week but I have always found three days to be adequate.) I also placed a dehumidifier in the room since moisture attracts the insects. Since I try to avoid chemicals, I hung sachets and homemade mothballs (cotton balls soaked with essential oils, primarily lavender, tea tree and lemongrass, although cedar, clove, rosemary and eucalyptus oils also work well, let dry and scatter about like moth balls). Cedar blocks and chips are also helpful although they tend to leave a rather distinctive scent on your clothes.This trap has some nice features. It is easy to set up and use and contains no toxic chemicals. I don't think it is essential or especially effective although it did spur me to address the issue before it got worse.  And that is what it is supposed to do.
B0017M5V9A This does NOT control or get rid of moths.  According to the package, this only attracts male moths and does nothing to control the females nor the larvae that actually destroy clothing.  If you catch males, you know you got a problem...do something else about it.  If you already KNOW you have a problem, this is a wasted step.Easy to set up.  Assembly involves opening a packet and dropping a little square piece of pheromone  impregnated plastic onto the sticky surface inside of the cardboard trap.  Voila.I have these in my closets and so far, no moths caught. But I don't believe that I had a problem to begin with and now feel better knowing.  I will keep an eye on these and update.
B0017M5V9A I placed a Safer moth trap in 2 separate enclosed closets. After 30 days, neither trap had lured a single moth.The traps themselves are paperboard with a sticky side. A small square of pheromones is in a separate packet. You have to open the packet and put the square on the sticky paperboard. Easy enough.The Safer product just didn't work for me. Easy product to assemble, but zero results.
B0017M5V9A My husband's tuxedo was ruined just hanging in his closet as it now has holes in it thanks to clothes moths. When I saw this product I wanted it right away because I use the Safer Pantry Moth traps with work like a charm.Well, I am not surprised to say that the clothes moth traps worked just as well. I saw some stuck inside the trap within the first week. I cannot tell you how much I wish I would have had one of these traps in my husband's closet when we first bought his tuxedo. This little investment of pennies would have saved us hundreds of dollars!
B0017M5V9A Note: This product is designed to alert you to a potential problem, and is designed to trap adult moths, NOT the larvae with do the actual damage.Well, there you have it. This is basically an open sided cardboard pyramid with sticky tape on the inside and a \"lure\" of some kind to attract moths. If you end up with moths stuck to the sticky tape, then you have a moth problem. It basically works like a spider web.
B0017M5V9A I'm not sure what the issue is with many reviewers saying this trap doesn't work.  It works much like the other Safer Brand traps out there where dropping a scented tab on a sticky surface is required and then place it next to the clothes.Set up is so easy! I placed my two traps in an open sweater shelf and within a week the traps filled with small moths that were not much bigger than regular house flies.  I was more shocked to see so many, as that means there are plenty more of these little terrorists flying about my home. I actually need more of these.
B0017M5V9A I have used the pantry moth traps made by this company for several years and they have always worked well for me. This trap is just as easy to set up. You just open the packet with the attractant in it and drop it onto the sticky, inside surface of the trap. The attractant (female moth pheromone) lures the male moths and they get stuck onto the adhesive.Keep in mind that if you have a moth problem, you still have to take the proper steps to clean your closets, clothing, etc, to get rid of the larvae/eggs which are not affected by these traps.Treating a moth infestation is an ongoing battle but these traps really help in that fight.
B0017M5V9A This product is a simple moth trap with an added gimmicky but useful clear window where you can see the moths caught inside the trap.  It is simply flypaper with moth attractant.Pros:+ Clear window so the number of moths caught can be seen.Con:- Works best in an enclosed environment such as a small to medium sized closet with door as opposed to a large walk-in closet.  An attractant-based trap is best used to attract and catch the moths within a given area to rid that area of moths.  In an open closet it just attracts moths from around your house to the area where you put your clothing and the bugs may cause damage before getting caught.  In short, the large open closet would have too much air circulation to pull them into the trap, but enough of the attractant would waft into the rest of your house.Recommended if you need/like to see the number of moths caught.
B0017M5V9A These pheromone cardboard traps perform best at warning that there are clothes moths.  They also help to put an end to the breeding cycle but even then have to be changed out every 12 weeks until the moths are no more.I've found the best way is to alternately expose woolens to sun and freezing.  I never ever see these small moths, just their nefarious work.This product is easy to use and provides a good secondary defense and warning system.
B0017M5V9A This is a decent tool to determine if there is a moth problem in your clothes closets. It traps the male adult moths but, as clearly noted in the product description and on the box, the male adult moths are not the ones that chew through your clothes - that's done by the larvae. So this won't solve a moth infestation problem, but rather will let you know if you have one.If you can see moths flitting about in your closet, or have noticed chewed wool items, this is not worth getting - you already know you have moths! This is for alerting you to a problem before it becomes severe, so you can take action to get rid of the larvae before they do too much damage. Methods to get rid of the larvae include washing, freezing the clothes for a week, steam cleaning, and/or chemicals.If you're looking for an alert to a potential problem, this is a decent product to have. If you already have the problem, this won't solve it.
B0017M5V9A I understand that this product is to be used to alert you to moths in your home.  It is obviously not a trap used to eliminate them or rid you of the pesky guys.  We have an existing moth issue, so I knew ahead of time that it was already a problem.  I figured testing theSafer Brand Clothes Moth Alert Trapwas going to be quick and easy and an excellent way to show that it works.  So we placed the trap alerts in two closets that we currently see moths in and then watched and waited; a couple days, a week, two weeks and a month. Unfortunately it didn't trap one moth in either closet during that entire time, yet we still see them fluttering around.  Overall I can't recommend a product that was a complete failure.
B0017M5V9A Updating my review to add a star because, although the trap isn't very fast, it will alert you of an infestation in seldom used storage. Kept inside a confined area near a door you can check periodically, you'll know you have a problem that you can seek out and address before it gets too out of hand. The only caveat is that you'll need to replace according to the label or you'll have a false sense of security. This is not the best solution by a long shot (if you deal with lots of wool, scrupulously freezing, baking, or tightly sealing any incoming fiber is far more effective).Original review:I used this trap in a confined, sealed closet with a known moth population. Tested it inside the closet for a several days before I bombed it, and used others outside the closet to monitor jailbreaks.Because the traps only catch males, they don't work as a treatment, but theoretically, they should attract any male moths and alert you to a potential problem before it gets out of hand. If the traps had a highly effective catch rate, any males would get trapped before mating and that would be the end of that.Unfortunately, however, judging by the low volume attracted to the trap inside the closet--and the amount of time it took to attract *any* moths, I don't feel confident that this trap will be a good advance warning for a moth problem or mating preventative. It seems so weak that you might need a significant infestation to even alert you--and of course, by the time you have moths, the damage to your fiber has already occurred (adult moths don't feed; the caterpillars are responsible for the damage).I typically keep all wool sealed and segregated, and freeze or bake any incoming wool from unknown sources, but some outside yarn got tossed in a closet, and I ended up with moths. I tossed all the yarn and fiber in the closet to be safe (my real supply and personal stash are both stored in completely different parts of the building), but it gave me the opportunity to test out these traps.I'm still giving them 2 stars because they will catch moths eventually. I think they'd be useful monitoring a highly confined, infrequently-used space with low-value wool, stuff you wouldn't mind tossing, but I wouldn't rely on them for keeping your nice stuff safe. I also tried the other brand sold on Amazon. It was more effective, but still only in 3-star to 3.5-star territory.BTW, if you want to make sure any seemingly unaffected clothes are moth free (the eggs are really tiny, and even the larvae are small enough to miss), you can freeze or bake them. In a lab setting, all stages of clothes moth are killed at less than 10 minutes at 128F (30 min at 120) or 24 hours below 0, so I bake everything in a hot car in the summer sun for several hours--over 130, according to my oven thermometer--or deep freeze for a week or two. I figure the overkill will make sure the temperature penetrates through the fabric/fiber.
B0017M5V9A I have also tried theSafer Brand 05140 The Pantry Pest Trap, 2 Moth Trapsand this seems to be the same product in different packaging. It is a tent-shaped piece of cardboard that is sticky on the inside. It comes with with a lure packet that you open and place a small square-shaped piece of lure onto the sticky part of the cardboard. The lure is suppose to lure moths to the sticky patch and the moths get stuck and trapped.The lure/sticky combo works fairly well. I have quite a few moths in the trap but I'm not overly impressed with the results.For this particular productSafer Brand 07270 Clothes Moth Alert Trap, it is only to alert you to moth activity and does not address the problem of moths damaging your clothes.This is on the package - Note: This product is designed to alert you to a potential problem, and is designed to trap adult moths, NOT the larvae which do the actual damage.Right on the box, they state that it does nothing for your problem except alert you to moth activity. For me, seeing damage or actual moths flying around is just as effective and much cheaper.
B0017M5V9A What is it?A moth lure made from folded postcard-type paper to form a triangular box.  Two surfaces inside are coated with sticky adhesive (flypaper) to trap moths that lay eggs which turn into larvae that eat clothes made from wool, cashmere, or other organic materials.How to use it:>Open up the sealed packets and drop the tiny 1cm x 1cm moth pheromone laced lures onto one of the adhesive surfaces through a hole in the bottom.  I found it easier to more precisely place the lures using tweezers.>Hang the traps at eye level where moths are damaging clothes.How did it work?>After one week, no moths caught.  I clearly see tiny moths that sneaked through the window screens so I place the trap directly on top of a landed moth.  It didn't move towards the lure so I shook the trap and the moth just bounced off the adhesive surfaces a few times, leaving scales/stains, but still escaped.>***Updated Sept. 9, 2013: After a little over one month, the trap in the kitchen caught two small moths!***  The trap does work just takes proper placement (location!) and some time.Redeeming quality:Product descriptions and directions do inform consumers that moth larvae not the adult moths damage clothes.  Trapping adult moths is a preemptive strike.  All clothes made from wool, cashmere, or other animal/organic material are susceptible to moth damage but keeping clothes clean and free of human sweat/oils/stains will minimize damages.Overall:Too early to tell only after one week whether trap will eventually work but short term results are disappointing.  It's safer to keep wool, cashmere, and organic material made clothes clean and in a sealed garment bag to protect against moth damage.  If all else fails, just use the tried and true naphthalene moth balls (but smelly and health concerns) or natural camphor moth balls.
B0017M5V9A This is a difficult product to evaluate because the desired result is that it catches _no_ moths (as an indication that you don't have an infestation). You want your normal practices to largely prevent eggs from being laid in your woolens and then to kill any eggs or larvae that wind up there. These traps are intended as a warning of an otherwise undetected failure in those practices. When this product traps clothes moths, it means that there are already enough larvae (doing damage) to produce enough adults to get caught, although this trap may have some/minimal/no protective use in trapping the stray clothes moth that happens into your house before it can lay eggs. Consequently for me, a crucial part of this product is knowing how to deploy it in the _most_ effective manner, and that was not provided.Although I have very good Web search skills, most of the information I found was of unknown credibility because of unspecified or ambiguous provenance. Was it the result of scientific studies? Or simply an intuition of some unidentified person? Or based on filtered and distorted second and third hand information? Or...?I had an infestation and have done an extensive clean-up of both the woolens themselves and the places where there might be residual larvae and eggs. There are so many mistakes one can make and I don't know which one(s) it was, so I have deployed traps in case I missed the actual cause -- I hadn't previously used traps because I hadn't had problems.I was given this product for an honest, timely review, and at the filing deadline, the traps have caught nothing (hopefully good news).----Deficiency: Confusing cues about orientation of the trap. Most triangular traps I have encountered have adhesive on all three interior surfaces, but this trap has no adhesive on the short side. Consequently, this might be a non-trivial distinction. When I have seen triangular pheromone traps, the point has been facing upward. The \"Safer\" logo on this trap cues you to install it pointing downward, with the short edge on top. The product picture on the website shows the short edge to the back.----Inconvenient hanging: You are instructed to hang the trap, but there is no pre-punched hole through which you could simply pull a string (the hole is a feature on some other triangular traps I have encountered). Because of the adhesive inside, it would have been so much easier if you didn't have to do it yourself. This is a little thing, but reflects on the (lack of) thought that went into the product design.----Instructions:Minimal instructions on the package and no pointer to additional instructions.- The package instructs you to hang at eye level. My _assumption_ is that this is purely to allow for easier inspection and not because of any habits of the moth.* My understanding is that clothes moth _larvae_ need darker places, and thus I infer that the adult moths will have a preference for such locations (so that they lay their eggs in dark spots). Consequently, a location that is easily inspected may be one that the moths naturally avoid. The attraction of the pheromone _might_ be a more effective attractor in an non-repulsive location. Plus closets have lots of \"dead air\" and the placement of the trap in an easily inspected location may mean that the pheromone scent-trail only weakly reaches the prime locations for the moths. Plus many people I know routinely leave their closet doors open, so only the more remote locations are dark. I wish the manufacturer provided more guidance on the factors and tradeoffs.- The package contains the cryptic instruction \"Optional: Remove adhesive release paper for additional placement options.\" which I assumed meant placement of the trap, but there was nothing that seemed to be \"release paper\".- How to identify a moth in the trap as a clothes moth? Other types of moths might inadvertently enter the tunnel and get trapped, and moths caught by the adhesive tend to do a fair amount of damage to themselves trying to break free. Neither the picture nor the description on the website would have helped me much if I didn't (unfortunately) already know what these moths looked like.- Does the lure attract any types of moths other than clothes moths? Although I know that the _common_ types of household moths respond to different pheromones, that doesn't tell me that there aren't some other type of moth that might be attracted to this one. Aside: my professional experience has sensitized me to false positives.----* Height of trap: For some types of agricultural moths, my recollection is that height was far more important than I had suspected (but \"obvious\" once the various factors are presented).-- Douglas B. Moran
B0017M5V9A I've used 'Safer Brand' Pantry Pest Traps for several years. They're very effective at controlling the ravages of pantry moths.I expected their Clothes Moth trap to be equally effective.It might be, but after three months, I can't tell - not a single moth has been caught in the trap.I know that I've set the trap correctly, with the pheromone lure and all that, but either it isn't doing its job or we have no moths. The occasional moth hole would suggest that the latter assumption is incorrect.Amazon Vine insists on a review after three months, so I can't experiment any further.I've given the product a neutral rating of three stars.
B0017M5V9A Since moving to the country, we've had a problem with clothes moths. Mothballs in the cedar closet help, but we have other non-cedar closets and don't want all our clothes to smell like mothballs. The little moths are very happy with our carpeting, upholstery, and our clothing no matter how often we vacuum or clean. I placed one of these traps in two different closets, both of which I knew to have more than just the occasional moth. In both cases, over the course of about three weeks, the trap caught a single moth. And in both cases, I spotted more than one moth on the wall and dispatched it more directly and vigorously.These traps are a single sheet of cardboard folded over to make a triangular opening at both ends. On the inside is adhesive, like fly paper, and onto that you place a small square of bait. Maybe there's not enough bait, as the adhesive seems pretty strong, or maybe the moths I have don't like this particular bait. In any event, I'm still looking for a moth solution.
B0017M5V9A Something has been eating my clothes but I am unable to detect the culprit whenever I search through my closet. I wanted to give this Safer Brand a try because wearing clothes with moth holes is sort of tacky. In reading the back of the box I was surprised to see that this product only traps adult moths which Safer Brand says do not damage my clothes. They are emphatic in declaring that this product does not trap the larvae which do the actual damage. Nevertheless, I proceeded to follow the directions to remove the lures and slide them under the top flap so that they get caught by the flypaper on the interior of the traps.I check the traps every day. So far they have remained clear of moths. I give my clothes a shake every visit so that the moths know I want them to fly around and land on the flypaper. I have not actually seen any moths off the flypaper or on the flypaper. I am not sure what is a fair rating. No moths have been trapped and I have no proof that I have moths only that something is eating holes in my clothes. I don't see larvae either but this would not trap them in any case. I will have to take the middle road and award three stars because these traps may work but I can't prove it one way or the other.
B0017M5V9A In my opinion, the product description is misleading, however the box this product arrives in is very clear. It states, \"This product is designed to alert you to a potential problem and is designed to trap adult moths, NOT the larvae which do the actual damage.\" If you catch moths in your closet, you are advised to thoroughly clean all clothing.The product is basically two cardboard traps with sticky sides and bait you unwrap and insert. There was no picture showing how to insert, so I'm not sure if I have installed it properly. They recommend hanging the product at eye level, but there is no attachment for hanging.Basically I found this product to be very cheaply made with a misleading description on Amazon and very poor instructions. So I am not pleased and can't recommend this product.
B0017M5V9A After I began noticing little holes in some of my clothes and assuming it was possibly moths, I tried several remedies, including lavender and cedar smelling deterrents, and washing the drawers, which seemed to help.  Additionally, I ordered the Safer brand Clothes Moth Alert through the Amazon Vine program.  It claims not to have a moth ball odor that will transfer to your clothes, as well as being both a repellent and a trap.  My package contained two traps with two lure packets to be attached to the traps and then hung in your closet or room.  Traps are meant to be replaced after 12 weeks. They also are intended to trap adult moths, not larvae.  A list of suggestions on how to get rid of larvae, too is included.Overall, it did what it promised.  After a couple of weeks, I don't see any adult moths stuck to the trap, so I'll assume that they're vanquished for now.  My only quibble is the size of the lure itself - as small as my thumbnail which makes it easy to lose if you're interrupted in the midst of transferring the lure to each trap.  However, it's both easy to assemble and does not have that strong moth ball odor, which makes it a less pungent alternative to traditional moth balls.
B0017M5V9A I love these self contained moth traps. Just place and forget about them. They wpork more like fly paper in catching the moths and they do really work I have not see any more moths since I got them a week ago.  Will not solve the total problem, but will catch the parents.
B0017M5V9A Because I am such a big fan of the Safer Brand Pantry Moth Trap, I am trying this Clothes Moth Alert Trap for the Vine program to see if I have any moths that would ruin clothes.  I haven't seen any moths, but better safe than sorry.  The traps come two to a box.  Each trap is a tent shape, open at both ends, with sticky surfaces on the two inside walls.  The scented bait square is dropped through a hole in the bottom and sticks itself at the center of a side wall.  Moths can smell the scent, but humans cannot. After two weeks in my closet, the clothes moth trap didn't show any moth activity, so I placed it in the garage where I get pantry moths.  At the same time, I placed a new pantry moth trap in another spot of the garage.  Both brands are Safer.  Within a week the pantry moth trap has at least a dozen little moths stuck to the inside of the tent.  The clothes moth trap has none.  Does this mean the clothes moth trap is ineffective?  Not necessarily -- it could mean I don't have this type of moth.  The Safer moth traps are geared toward a specific moth, and you need to figure out what kind of moth you have in order to purchase the correct trap.  Based on my experience with pantry moths, I have confidence in the Safer brand and wouldn't hesitate to buy this product if I saw clothes moth activity.  While I give their pantry moth trap an enthusiastic 5 stars, the clothes moth trap remains unproven.
B0017M5V9A I have used this in my large walk in closet. Already, I have caught more clothes moths than I wanted to know I had. I have only had this out for a little while. As many moths as I have caught I will definitely repurchase this product and try to get them all.Make sure that the moths you are trying to get are the ones this product is designed to get. It works beautifully for it's intended purpose.
B0017M5V9A Well this is a bit of a let-down. I was searching for something other than old fashioned moth balls (y'know that smell) and thought this would be a nice thing to try out. First, it's not a trap but rather an \"alert\" trap..if you find an adult moth on this thing then it indicates the need to trap the larvae which do the actual damage. I give the product a point just for explaining that fact which frankly, I had no idea.But, that is where the good starts and ends. Once opening, I expected something that could be hung up...especially since the instructions direct the user to do so...but all that is included is 2 triangular pieces of cardboard with a hole in the middle and a place to position the lure bait (also included in the form of 2 small packets which approximate a wet wipe from a restaurant). Opening the bait lure is messy - much more so than I'd like - and trying to position and then hang this uber cheap feeling alert is annoying. It's too flimsy to stay put but not flimsy enough to stop bouncing around.
B0017M5V9A This product did help protect my cloths.  In the past I have had good success with cedar blocks.  I would have liked more instruction on using this device, but it is handy and shows results.  It could have been made easier to hang, but it is simple to punch a hole through the trap.  Overall an inexpensive way to safeguard your clothes.
B0017M5V9A This is essentially a hanging glue trap, I don't think it's going to solve your issue by itself, and while it's true there are no chemicals to use the \"glue square\" really isn't that large so you can only use it for a short period if you have a large moth problem.It will work to \"catch\" the moths, but it isn't going to be your one solution, cure all.
B0017M5V9A I have seen a few holes in some of my clothing so it will be interesting to see if these traps will catch any moths.The trap are pretty simple. They're a simply a triangle of folded cardboard with flypaper inside. There's a sealed packet with a tiny piece of moth pheromone laced cardboard inside. You push this cardboard on to the flypaper and hang the whole thing up at eye level in your closet where it will attract the male moths. Each box contains 2 of these traps.This contraption doesn't get rid of your moth problem. If it catches moths, then it means you have a moth problem. I guess that is why it is called a Moth Alert Trap. Like another reviewer said, it's a small investment to catch a big problem.
B0017M5V9A The Safer Clothes Moth Alert Trap is easy to set and place. Each package contains two traps and two bait packets. The traps sticky interior surface traps moths that are drawn into the trap using the included lure, which is a small, square bait that comes in a sealed, stay-fresh pouch.This product traps the moths to alert of the presence of moths. If I find a moth in the trap, I know it's time to send everything through the wash, as the larvae of the moths will be the destructive force for the wardrobe.This is an excellent warning system. This is similar to Safer's effective pantry moth traps. These are compact enough to mount in an unobtrusive location; they can be pinned up near my wardrobe, or simply set on a shelf with ease.
B0017M5V9A Earlier this year, I put some Safer Pantry Moth Traps in my kitchen and essentially watched my moth problem disappear. The pheromone-based trap was a powerful magnet for moths and within a couple of weeks, I had dozens of dead moths stuck to the inside of the trap. So I was optimistic about Safer's Clothing Moth Traps, since I began noticing tiny moths flying around my bedroom. Unfortunately, after two weeks of having the traps in the bedroom and closet, I haven't caught one moth, though I still see them flying around. I'm assuming the pheromone is different since these moths are not the same as those who infest pantries. Whatever it is though, it isn't working. Not recommended.
B0017M5V9A This trap must be either hung up in the closet or set on a shelf or something. It's not something that you can toss into a box of wool sweaters like cedar blocks.  I was hoping I could toss into a box of sweaters that I have, but obviously can't because the trap is sticky paper which attracts the moths and they end up getting stuck to it.  The wool sweaters will just get stuck to the trap.  I can see how this would be very useful if you have wool or wool blend clothing hanging in your closet, but I don't have any wool clothing hanging in my closet so I really can't tell if this trap works or not.
B0017M5V9A Please learn from my mistake!  I didn't read the description of this item. I thought it was a MOTH MOTEL that nabbed all the clothes chewing moths residing in my closet. WRONG, it detects the moth problem by capturing the adults, which alerts you moth eradication action is required to rid the closet of munching larvae damaging your clothes.Once again, my speed reading hit a speed bump :(
B0017M5V9A I have used the Safer Brand Moth traps for the moths that live in things like flour and, in my case, bird seed.  They have always worked great at getting rid of my moth problem when I get new food for my birds.  When I saw these, I decided to try them for clothes moths.  Once again, they worked well.  The traps attracted the moths with the pheremone scented square and the stickiness kept them there.  Important to note, the instructions tell you that just trapping the adult moths will not keep your clothes from being eaten since it is the larvae that eat them.  Follow the instructions and you will eliminate your clothes moths.  If you have the other kind of moths that live in your pantry, check out Safer Brand's other moth traps.
B0017M5V9A Save your money.  I only tried because my originals aren't carried any more.  I'm trying Pro Pest next.  These are AWFUL!
B0017M5V9A I have ordered and reorder Safer Brand Moth Traps for Pantry Moths but this is the first time I've ordered a trap for clothes moths. I have watched the pantry moths dive for the Safer pheromone traps, so I have great deal of faith that Safer puts the correct pheromone in each trap.  However, I have yet to capture a single clothes moth.Because I have seen how effective the Safer brand traps can be, I can only assume that I have no clothes moths.  What I do have, however, are moths that congregate at the doors during the evening hours waiting to get in the house -- they're just not clothes moths.So why would I give this product five stars when I have captured no clothes moths?  It's because I have experienced just how effective the Safer brand traps can be.  If you think you might have clothes moths, give this brand a try.  It works for me when I correctly match moths to traps.
B0017M5V9A We have a problem with pantry type moths which apparently come into the house with dried grains and such, but once they've arrived they seem to multiply like crazy. We tried these moth traps which are safe and non-toxic. I like that feature. But the thing is that they catch very few moths. I purchased another brandCatchmaster Moth and Pantry Pest Trap: Three Packs of Twothat trapped more moths in a week than this brand did in two months. So I now purchase that brand instead.
B0017M5V9A I selected this product because I am a long time user and needed a replacement. Set up is very easy and I use these for peace of mind in both my clothes closet and my yarn hutch. As a knitter, I have thousands of dollars invested in yarn, some which can never be replaced as the mills no longer exist. Protecting my clothes and yarn is a high priority. These traps are an early warning system.Vigilance, cleaning clothes before storage and mothballs also are part of my arsenal. However thse traps serve a very helpful role in
B0017M5V9A I had a terrible infestation of clothing moths at our last apartment, where they lived in the built-in dressers in the wall and were barely ever visible. When we moved, I threw away so many sweaters and thoroughly washed the rest. However I was worried that the same could happen with little outward evidence in our new apartment. So I put these traps out and I have the piece of mind now knowing that there are NO MOTHS!  This is especially important to me as I am a crocheter and often buy bulk skeins of expensive wool that, while bagged in my closet, would still be ruined if the moths got to it somehow.My only complaint is that the directions are kind of ridiculous - you can just place the lure on the sticky spot. There's absolutely no need to try to slide it through the odd hole in the side. So now you know. Oh!  And I threw one in the pantry just in case this works for pantry moths too (I can't remember if it does). Those things are the WORST for ruining flour and grains. Definitely recommend everyone have a few of these in their house.
B0017M5V9A I bought these moth traps, because the moths were eating through suits, shirts, and even my cotton shower curtain. I had them out for at least two weeks and they didn't catch one moth. If I could give these traps a\"0\" I would because that is how many moths they caught. I started using Pro-Pest Pheronet \"Pheromone Trap\" and they caught moths right away and many of them, by day's end.
B0017M5V9A The first thing you should know -- in case you missed it in the product description -- is that this will trap clothes moths (and that's a good thing because a moth stuck to this is not going to be laying any more eggs), but seeing moths in this really only shows that you have a problem and need to deal with the larvae which are the things putting holes in your wool clothes.I am happy to see no moths in my alerts so far.  It was easy to put the lure into the trap.  My only criticism is that this needs some type of loop so you can hang it on a clothes hanger.  Right now mine are on shelves in the closet but hanging close to wool clothes would be better.
B0017M5V9A This moth trap works a little bit like most pest traps, it lures the moth into the trap using the scents allure of the opposite sex. Once inside, the moths are trapped by the sticky paper (think of fly paper). Will this work? Yes. Is it gross to see a bunch of moths stuck to the inside of a sticky triangle. Yes. Personally, this is not my cup of tea. It's essentially fly paper for moths, so be prepared to remove a moth pyramid of death when it's time to replace it. It essentially works by catching the adult moths before they have a chance to produce larvae (which is what actually cause damage to material).
B0017M5V9A I placed one trap in my basement and one in my bedroom where there is the most clothes.  The traps caught more moths than I thought were around though not too many. I don't have a moth problem so the number seemed right.This comes with two triangle shaped traps that need to be placed at eye level in rooms or closets. The male moths get attracted to the traps and get stuck on a sticky substance on both sides of the traps. This only attracts male moths and does not attract and kill female ones or larvae. This helps break up the breeding cycle as well as alerting people about a problem.These are simple, pesticide free moth traps that work. It states on the box it is a Clothes Moth Alert and it certainly let me know some moths were around.
B0017M5V9A I imagine the people giving this product low ratings either a. don't have clothes moths and expect it to catch all kinds of moths, b. didn't actually put the pheromone in the trap (you have to open the package and drop it in that hole in the top), or c. didn't read the package to see this only traps the MALE clothes moths and does not kill the larva which is what actually eats your clothes.First off, the type of moths that eat your clothes are very very small and very very fast. They also hate light so they are very hard to just spot. Most of the times I've seen them have been when I was watching TV in the dark and one fluttered by the front of the TV or I've found them hiding in cracks in my closet.I had a serious moth infestation in my clothes. I sorta ignored it until they ate about 10 of my sweaters. They were literally in shreds. When I threw all the wool clothes away they started eating the cotton stuff as well (although not as successfully) so I decided to get these traps because I didn't want to use poisons or whatever. They did a good job of trapping a lot of moths but like the packaging says, these basically will ALERT you that you have a problem they aren't going to totally solve it.Eventually I threw away a lot of old clothes and then washed everything else all at once and put anything wool into plastic bags. The moths WILL attempt to eat your cotton stuff but they don't tend to be as destructive to it (you'll see the cocoons on the clothes but they won't be all full of holes like the wool stuff) Vacumming in your closets will also help get rid of them. I then put cedar chips in my closet. Not quite sure how useful that is but I have definitely slowed them down and haven't seen any more destruction since.I uploaded a photo of one of my traps that caught about 20 moths to prove these do work. Just realize to get rid of your problem you're going to have to do more than just get these traps.
B0017M5V9A A while back I went into a closet where rarely worn clothes are stored. I do not mean seasonal...most women have an article or two of clothing from younger days. We are absolutely certain that one day we will fit into something we had as a teen, even in our 50s.Ok, maybe not very many are that much in denial, but what can I say...even though I haven't seen a size 12 since I WAS 12, I might be able to wear that prom dress again, right?I selected a thin wool dress with sheer sleeves, and parts of it literally disintegrated in my hands. It was so odd, it looked like patches of lace that broke apart at the slightest touch.NEVER AGAIN.If you have even one article of expensive clothing archived, a dress, a tux, be safe and get one of these. I had no idea I had moths. I knew I saw some pantry moths, but no idea my clothes were at risk. Small investment.
B0017M5V9A This kit worked like they said it would for me.  Results definitely vary based on the type of moths you have and luck.  Based on my positive experience, I recommend this kit to a family member in a different state, and for them it didn't work at all.  I would buy both this kit and the one from Pro-pest and see which one works for your moths.
B0017M5V9A I like the idea of these traps, and I have to reiterate - as others have here - that they are lures to identify whether there is a problem, not a cure for a problem. Do note that the lures need to be replaced every 12 weeks.That said - cedarballs or mothballs may be a better solution. Sure, they smell, but they also repel. These traps don't repel, they alert. Moreover, I found the lure suggestions to be confusing at best: \"Remove the lure from the protective packet. Slide lure under flap as indicated on the trap. Lure should drop through hole.\" Just drop it through the hole, no sliding necessary.
B0017M5V9A I don't know if I have moths, and I have not seen any damage to my wool coats. The Safer Moth Alert is supposed to let me know if I have moths, then I can treat them accordingly. I've had this in my closet a few weeks and it's still empty. I would assume that means that I don't have anything to worry about. I'll leave it in place, in case moths come in later. I'm glad that I don't have to put mothballs in the closet, and I even don't like the scent of cedar. This is an easy way to know if additional action is needed.
B0017M5V9A Caught 3 small moths within the month, so it does work. But I am guessing that I don't have a moth problem. However, as the product uses pheromones to attract the moths to the trap, it would be better if they had more than 2 in a box.I think this is a fairly expensive product as a bunch of mothballs would also result in the same effect - as in keeping moths out. That being said, mothballs smells like bleh amongst your clothes. So pick your poison... ;p
B0017M5V9A These moth traps by Safer Brand work well at what they do, but they will not completely take care of a moth problem. They are simply one part of a total attack plan.Moths do not eat your clothing, rugs and furniture. Their larvae do. This product does not kill larvae. You will need to vacuum a lot, perhaps use insecticide sprays and wash or freeze any items of clothing with evidence of larvae or larvae damage along with using these traps.These traps are essentially a sticky surface which the adult moth lands on and gets stuck to. They die being stuck there. That's it. By killing adults, they can no longer lay eggs on your clothing and soft furnishings. But you must make sure that you place the included lure (which is a chemical attractant) in the trap or it won't work.That's why I've deducted 1 star for these traps - the directions on the back of the packaging only mention the lure briefly and in small print. The lure itself is in a tiny plastic packet in the bottom of the box and is easily missed. I suspect that lots of people miss the lure completely and are then disappointed that the traps catch no moths.This is the way you use the traps: inside the box you will find 2 paper traps folded into the shape of a triangle. The inside of the triangle is covered in a very thick, sticky glue. You will also find two small packets. Open a packet and drop the tiny, lure-impregnated square through the hole in the bottom of the trap. It will stick to the inside of the trap. Repeat this with the other trap and then place the traps at eye level in the room or closet where you have moths. Adult moths will be attracted to the lure and fly into the trap and become stuck and die.The lure loses its effectiveness over time and Safer Brands recommends replacing them every two months.These traps are safe and have no odor at all. I found a couple of moths in my traps the very next day and more in the days following. I think it's an excellent way to get rid of adult moths.
B0017M5V9A We definitely have a small infestation of moths in our home. This problem just started earlier this year, and never had a problem until now. But sadly, the only thing this lure trap collects is dust.The box contains two triangular folded traps with glue on two walls inside of them. The bottom is where you put the .5\" paper which contains pheromones to attract the male moths.Knowing that we definitely have a problem and understanding that this is designed to lure the males to it, I just can't imagine that they would all be females.Sorry, I just cannot recommend this Safer Clothes Moth Alert trap, at this time.
B0017M5V9A This product only alerts you to the presence of moths, it just traps the moths. If you trap moths, then you need to do something about them.The instructions and the lure assembly don't make complete sense. It says drop the bait through the hole in the trap, which means it can fall anywhere on the lure. If you place it on the sticky area yourself it will be in the middle. You are going to touch it anyway - why not place it where it will be in the middle?As for the lure working...ours trapped nothing. Yet recently I found a couple suspicious holes in my daughters' wool skirts, so if we don't have moths - something else is making moth like holes.It looks like I will have to use another method or just take the steps to kill moths anyway, these told me nothing.
B0017M5V9A We've been pretty lucky lately - not too many holes in the clothes - we try to keep the closet door closed as mcuh as possible, plus we have all sorts of cedar, etc.I was given the opportunity to try this out - was not expecting to find any.  Sure enough, within about 3 weeks we caught two moths.  Guess we need to  be more careful.
B0017SUEE6 It replaced a smaller brush provided to us when we purchased our pool.  The first brush had worn the bristles completely off so it was a noticeable difference to be using this larger, better brush.It snapped right onto our handle and is easy to manipulate.  I've used it for a couple of weeks now with no problems.
B0017SUEE6 Perfect.  What else can I say.  Sturdy construction, good bristles.  Works great in my concrete pool. Fits the pool pole snuggly, and does exactly what you expect it to.
B0017SUEE6 I have used many pool brushes. Some like to skip off the sidewall of the pool, that's no good. I tried that whale tail thing, it was too hard to push and quality of the bristles was low. This one is really great. It is strong, well made, and hugs the side wall just right, and the bristles do their jobs well.This is by far the best brush I have used and though I have only had it for a few months, the quality of construction makes me think it will last for several years to come.
B0017SUEE6 Bought this hoping for a premium scrub brush for the pool that would last more than two seasons. I think I found it here. This is solid aluminun with nylon bristles for cleaning. Worked well for my pool and is still working today. Money well spent.
B0017SUEE6 This brush and the other brush I bought are just as good or better than the brushes I bought from my pool store and paid a lot more for those.I will be using these from now on...
B0017SUEE6 Bought one for my new house.  I dont have a pool guy so I scrub the pool every other week or so myself.  It has been sitting outside in the AZ sun for all summer and all winter and still going strong.
B0017SUEE6 So far I am really impressed by the quality of this brush. The handle seems pretty typical for this type of product, but the nylon bristles are very good. They are stiffer than the cheap Walmart plastic ones, which helps get into the crevices of my Pebbletec pool coating. And, I scrubbed vigorously at the pool and tile with it, and NO bristles broke off like the cheap Walmart ones do.I'll try to remember to update after a summer in the sun, but I don't anticipate it breaking down nearly as fast. But even if it eventually does, it's worth the extra $3 on it over the Walmart version.----Update June 2014: I've had this brush for two years and the bristles are still in good condition with almost no shedding, and the metal hasn't bent or warped (and I leave it outside year round). I did replace the retainer clips but those are only a few bucks at a pool store.
B0017SUEE6 I paid a little bit more to try a higher quality pool brush and wasn't disappointed. I don't have the bristles flaking off every time and it's holding up well. I recommend this.
B0017SUEE6 So far haven't had any issues with this brush.  It cleans the pool just fine.  I use it mostly on the steps as our automatic pool cleaner never gets that area.
B0018D6CVO After pricing various tillers and cultivators, and examining them in the store, I decided on this one for several reasons, most of which involved our specific needs. When I mentioned on a gardening forum I was getting a Rototiller, they thought I said Rottweiler, and the name stuck.We do not have rocky soil, and are putting in a vegetable garden area and border around our yard, which is 1/3 acre. We needed something, but didn't need a huge piece of equipment. This is lightweight enough for me to use, and yet it gets the job done. Since I just hit 60 years old, I really appreciate how easy it is for me!It came almost completely assembled, I only had to fasten the handle on, then plug it in. We already use electric gardening items, so I had the necessary cord on hand. Everything adjusts and clips on easily, really a no tools required machine. The safety buttons and features are awesome for a novice like me.The manual advised that I should try getting used to the controls, and I am glad I did! It pulled forward like it really wanted to take off like its nickname, Rottweiler.  After a couple of tries, I was able to work it easily. In fact, it tore through an area that would have taken hours to do by hand in only a few minutes. We had mowed the grass short before I started, and it chopped through, breaking up the soil, grass and weeds!We will be collecting cow patties from a friend and mixing them in to create a good blend for next spring, so it is doing all of the hard dirty work for us. But for now, I'm taking my little Rottweiler for a walk during the morning and getting things ready.*** Edit - it is now Spring, and I want to report that this little monster is still chewing away. I set up my garden patch with it and took it over to my daughter's home where we cleared out several patches of grass (after knocking down the weeds with a Weed Whacker), into the rich deep soil that is in her yard!Probably my only problem is that since my yard is so large, I had to buy a longer cord to run it.It runs forward quickly, then tills more deeply as you pull it backwards. The work isn't \"easy\" like it would be on a riding one, or one that was really heavy, but for our garden work, this is awesome.In her yard, I tried tilling where there were some heavy weeds, and they got tangled pretty badly, so I had to clean them out, but it wasn't a problem at all, just took a couple of small gardening tools and worked at it for about 5 minutes. After that, we made sure that we cut down the weeds a bit first.Still very pleased.
B0018D6CVO Have a big yard project going on right now and need to level out some areas.  Our yard is too oddly shaped with too many things to go around to bring in a large gas-powered tiller.  Decided to take a chance on this electric model as I figured I could control it easier around the many damageable items in the yard (edging, sprinkler system, fences, etc.)Unpacked and put handle on to main body in minutes.  Already had electric extension cord rated for this kind of item.  Fired it up and was surprised at the amount of power this thing has!  Had to get used to handling, it will jump and dance if not controlled but that seems to be an issue with most tillers.  I am short-armed so it took me a while to learn how to control it better.This tiller tore through our hardpan-like soil instantly.  Since time is not an issue, I have been using it when possible on weekends to level out various areas of the yard.  Does pretty well.  We have lots of rocks and tree roots in the yard so it gets jammed often but it shuts down right away so the engine does not burn out.  For a larger area, a gas tiller would make more sense but for a household yard, this is just about right.FOLLOW ALL SAFETY PROCEDURE ABOUT UNPLUGGING FOR MAINTENANCE as the tines are sharp and dangerous.  As with all electric outdoor tools, managing the long cord can be a chore but the cord keeper on this makes it a bit easier.  Can't beat this for the price.  Very compact and even a small person like me can carry tiller with the built in handle.
B0018D6CVO I borrowed a friend's electric 3-speed Mantis and was thrilled by how quiet it was and how much control I had.  It didn't like clay soil much, but it did a GREAT job on everything else.  When I decided I needed a small tiller of my own, I looked at the price of a Mantis and then decided that I would buy the Troy-Bilt, as it was about 55% of the price of a Mantis 3-speed unit which I had borrowed. And, this Troy Bilt has good reviews.After using the two side-by-side, I would say that the Troy-Bilt unit \"does the job,\" but it's not as user-friendly, not as powerful, and not as quiet.  But it still does the job, even if the job is slower and slightly noisier.Sooooo --- After using this pretty steady for five days, I'd say if your tilling needs are relatively few and far between, are relatively small jobs, and you have a little extra time, this unit works just fine!  But if you think you'll be tilling more and needing more power, consider spending the extra money to get the 3-speed Mantis. It's a workhorse that I'd rather have, but since my needs are rather sparse, this one (for the money) is plenty sufficient.Downside of this unit vs. the Mantis:  Rocks of about 3 - 4\" tend to get stuck a lot easier in the Troy Bilt, jamming the unit.  The Mantis mostly just kicked these out.  From my experience, I'd say the \"jam\" rate for the Troy-Bilt over the Mantis is 8:1.Bottom line: If you do more tilling or can afford the extra $160, get the Mantis. If you only till occasionally or if money is an issue, this Troy-Bilt unit will do the job.UPDATE:  Three days after writing the above --- after using the unit for *only* eight days --- it gave up the ghost.  Sad.  I ended up taking it back to the store where I bought it.  The employee recommended the Black & Decker TL10 8.3 Amp Corded Electric Front Tine Tiller, which, it turns out, has good reviews and is only $50 more on here on Amazon.  So --- I ordered that unit.  It operates on 25% more amps, so hopefully that does the trick.My original review of the Troy Bilt was four stars ... and even though the thing died on me, I'll still giving it three. If all I had to till was my own garden, this Troy Bilt would probably by fine.  But doing the rounds of tilling my family and friends' gardens as well was probably too much for it.
B0018D6CVO I had read some of the other reviews on electric tillers and was worried about this one constantly overheating and cutting out.  That did happen to me when the tines are clogged with St. Augustine grass shoots.  Once I had eliminated the grass, this thing was a worker.  I ran it for about 90 minutes without overheatings.  It is strong, tills deep and well, performs almost as well as a gas tiller with far less maintenance and noise.  I definitely recommend one of these bad boys.  They are really work savers.
B0018D6CVO I bought this tiller for two purposes; to till my garden and to dig up the many large bare spots in my lawn.  I also was tired of problematic gas powered lawn equipment, so an electric tiller seemed like the simpler way to go.  When it came, it was easy to just attach the upper handle and it was ready to use.  I decided to try it out in my garden first.  My garden has relatively hard compact dirt with many weeds.  The tiller doesn't weigh alot and I was able to carry it easily to my garden.  You turn it on by pushing the red button and then pulling back the bar.  It actually had a bit of a kick that I wasn't expecting.  I haven't learned how to maneuver it around easily - if that is even possible - so I had to keep turning it off and on as I dragged it to the next place I wanted to till.  It wasn't hard to move and it was only minorly annoying to have to keep pressing the red button and pulling back on the bar each time I stopped and started.The tiller did a great job of digging up the hard dirt and kept it's power even though the tines were quickly encased with long weeds.  I needed a knife to cut the weeds off of the tiller because there were tightly wound around it.  I am very impressed with the power of this tiller.  When I test it on my very hard, Texas lawn/dirt, I'll write an update.  Great purchase!
B0018U03AS I wish I would have installed this when I first bought the mower.  It has completely transformed what was already a good recycling mower into a great one.  The cut is so even across my lawn I can hardly beleive it.  The clippings are barley noticeable even when used on semi-wet grass.  I always mulch, so it is important that the fine pieces of grass left over do not clump and make mold piles.  I've used it three times so far and couldn't be happier with this blade.NOTE:  For owners with new models that have two holes instead of one in the center, this model now has three total.  One in the center for us older owners and then two directly next to the one for the newer owners.
B0018U03AS I bought this blade to replace a Toro Atomic Blade on my Toro Recycler. I tried to use this a a mulching blade and it left clumps everywhere.  With bagging, it cuts reasonably well, but the bag now only fills halfway before I need to change it. I generally buy a new blade each year but I am considering putting my old blade back on. The blade's sharpened edge is painted so I am hoping it's performance will improve with repeated use.UPDATE 9/2/12: Blade did improve after the first few mows. It doesn't work as well as the OEM blade in my opinion, but it worked better than my old blade and worked adequately over the summer.
B0018U03AS Great replacement blade.  I purchased to replace worn-out blade for Toro mower.  Definitely noticed a difference.  Does leave a few more clippings on mulch mode, but no clumps and its barely noticeable.  Also, I have not experienced any clogging at all since I've replaced with this blade.  I'm not sure if its the different blade profile or just being sharper, but my old Toro blade used to clog all the time wet with wet grass and anything longer than a 1/2 inch.  Would definitely purchase again.
B0018U03AS After using this for half a season I finally got tired of a bad mow job and having to take the blower and go around the lawn and blow the clumps apart.  I mow often, every 3 days, I even tried raising the deck to see if that would help.  I bought an OEM Toro blade and swapped it out and just mowed the lawn.  My lawn looks great again, no streaks, no clumps, I even lowered the deck a notch before I started mowing.  It's night and day, I thought from reviews this might do a better job at a lower cost, not for me.  Maybe different grasses have different results, I live in Minnesota and have thick grass.  I would not recommend this product and would never buy again.
B0018U03AS Works well, just like a mulching blade should. It has 3 holes, unlike the picture but my mower only used one. The blade is heavy and painted black (which won't last long). The edge so far has been good. If you want any blade to work, especially a mulching blade, make sure you mow your yard when the grass is very dry. Any dampness will cause your mower to clog with grass and then conk out. One more tip, make sure when you sharpen the blade disconnect the spark plug wire and tilt the lawn mower with the carburetor facing up. Good price on the blade over my box store prices. Highly recommended.
B0018U0A3S What can you say... this is chain saw bar oil, it works great, you gotta have it.  It is good quality and worth it to protect the expensive Oregon battery chain saw. Enough said.
B0018U0A3S I have about two acres with many trees and large bushes. This requires a lot of pruning with my chain saw. This oil keeps the chain on my saw and the bar it rides on  well lubricated which means it is a big aid in reducing the workload of chain saw usage.
B0018U0A3S Bought it because it was recommended but I'm sure there are cheaper alternatives. I don't use the chain saw that much so the purchase was no real burden.
B0018U0A3S What can I really say here that hasn't already been said by the other glowing reviews?  Price is very fair and it works really well.  I use it to lubricate my Remington RM1415A 14-Inch 8-Amp Electric Chain Saw which I also bought on Amazon.  Haven't had any problems as of yet and am quite happy with the performance of the bar and chain oil!
B0018U0A3S It is a bottle of chain saw bar and chain oil...looks good in the bottle...maybe I'll test it if I ever assemble my new chainsaw
B0018U0A3S This product goes a long way.  One quart is more than enough for the few tools I have in the garage.  It works well, no smell, easy clean up.  Does a good job exactly as I expected.
B0018U0A3S This of course is a much needed oil if you own chain saws.  It is just the right grade and easy to pour.
B0018U0A3S This is no better or worse than other bar oils I have used, it is effective and that is all that matters
B0018U0A3S I guess it is fine, the chain saw has not stopped working.  How would you know if it were no good otherwise?  I have not subjected it to a rigorous analysis as I have better things to do.
B0018U0A3S It's just a chain oil, and there has not been any issues so there is nothing negative about it.Works fine.
B00192AO90 Some of my herbs were completed invaded by insects a few months ago. I tried using this and didn't seem to work too well. The herb that was infested was completely eaten to the stem, it was sad. I managed to save some of them though! The ones that I saved I didn't put anything on. Seemed the bigger plants got worse with insects after I added the killing soap to it.
B00192AO90 i don't like using a lot of chemicals on my garden, i love the safer brand and specifically this soap.  i have some smaller citrus trees that are prone to the citrus leafminer.  that is why i got the concentrate to mix a big batch and put in a sprayer.  this soap is effective on everything i've tried it on...grasshoppers, leafminers, leafhoppers, mealy bugs, scale, ants.  i even spray it on my orchid flowers to deter the grasshoppers and it has no deleterious effects on them.
B00192AO90 I live in the south where nearly  every bug known to mankind is in attendance for the entire growing season. I use this on my herbs, used it all last summer and then used it in the house when I transferred herbs inside for the winter, and used it on my house plants inside.  I love knowing that I am using something that is safer than a lot of other bug sprays I could use.  Will continue to use this product which performs extremely well, as good as the chemicals we used to use and much safer for us and the environment. This year I have started using them on my lilies, lavender, roses and annuals, So far so good.
B00192AO90 I use this and Neem oil to spray over 20 orange trees and other plants to knock down pesky gnats, fruit flies, and similar pests. Spraying once or twice a year does a good job controlling, leaving just enough bugs to keep some lizards happy.
B00192AO90 I start close to 500 seedlings every year under lights and this is a must have for aphids and white fly which always seem to find their way in some how.  Safe to use inside and around pets and most effective.  I am never without it.
B00192AO90 Helped in the yard.
B00192AO90 I purchased this as a gift for my daughter, she is new to gardening. I have always used this for insects in my gardens with very good results.  I like it because it is approved for organic gardening, which is what I do and she will be doing as well.
B00192AO90 I use this product primarily to keep aphids off my broccoli, cabbage, onions, kale, and plum tree.  So far, I've had a lot of good success with it and it hasn't damaged my plants like some other products that I've used in the past.  There's a couple of tricks to this product.  First, most of the pests congregate on the bottom-side of leaves so you need to have a strategy to access and spray the bottom-side.  Spraying the topside of the leaves is a waste of time and won't do anything for you.  My method of getting to the underside of the leaves without being a contortionist is to use a pump sprayer that has a wand with an angled tip.  TheSecond, don't be cheap.  Once you access the underside of the leaves, give them a good spray and make sure all critters are fully soaked.  Ever notice how your hands feel dry if you wash them often with soap?  That's exactly how this product works...it \"dries out\" the critters.  That's why it's so important to make sure the critters are fully soaked.  As an added bonus, I've realized that this product can also kill soft bodied green caterpillars that also love to chew on most plant leaves.  I'm now regularly spraying my apple and cherry trees with this product to get rid of the caterpillars; the only trick is that you have to catch them in the act.Buying the concentrate is the way to go from a $$ perspective.  It's not that hard to make a spray solution.  I use 4 tbsp of the product in a 1 gallon pump bottle and then fill it up to the top with water.  Shake well and you're ready to go.  A funnel is not necessary but certainly makes it easier to fill the bottle without getting the concentrate or water everywhere.  Depending on the level of infestation you have, you can adjust the concentration up or down by adding a few more or a few less tbsp of the concentrate.  I recommend starting at a lower concentration (i.e. 2 tbsp/gallon of water) and working your way up based on an assessment of how effective the previous spraying was.
B00192AO90 While this killing soap works well, I believe pesticide works better, I actually prefer the faster more guaranteed methods of killing bugs.
B00198IUKY This thing is very cool.  Yes it is made of plastic and not a work of art but it does the job very well.  I've purchase tons of grill cleaning tools and this has been the best one yet.  I don't know if I'll ever find the magic tool that makes my grill look brand new but in the mean time, this works great.Although the reviews claim it is kinda of ugly and plastic (which is true), it works very well.
B00198IUKY My husband hated grilling out because he didn't like to clean the grill. He always complained about how the food got stuck to the cast iron. I got him one of these and now, he LOVES grilling. Clean up is a breeze! He closes the top and heats everything super hot for about 5 minutes then puts water in the handle and steams it off.I really didn't think it would work, but it does.
B00198IUKY This is a great product - its big enough to where you can put some muscle behind it.. and the water works better than I would have thought.. I've already ordered another as a gift.  Highly recommended!
B00198IUKY This brush cleaner works very well with water.  I cleaned my Weber gas grill grates which had melted cheese, glazes and rubs which included sugar caked onto the grates.  Within minutes the grates were cleaned very well as if they were new.  I set my grill to it's highest setting and when it reached 400 degrees I began scrubbing the grates with the water knob on all the way.  For tougher jobs, the description on Amazon indicates to loosen the resevoir knob to let air flow in to push more water out while cleaning.  So much steam was generated which helped with the ease of scrubbing.  As far as other reviwers writing that theirs broke after very few uses, I don't see how unless it was a defective item or these guys are literally standing on their grills and using their bodyweight to clean it.  There's no need for that much down force to clean the grates.  I'm 6'1 at 215lbs and mine hasn't broke or showed a sign of breaking after one year of continual use (I grilled every weekend from early May to late October and I also grilled on some wkds during the Winter months).  If you let the grill preheat high enough the bristles and the steam will do the work for you.The only downsides to this brush is that after some time (for me was about a year) the steel bristles began to fall off of the brush while scrubbing.  Although very hazardous, this is typical for grill brushes so that was expected.  Just be sure to inspect your grates after cleaning to remove any loose bristles or your future food will be served with a steel spike.  Another minor downside is the gunk that the steam and brush loosen up can splatter all over the front of the grill area and on yourself.  Be sure that you're wearing a barbecue apron or your clothing will get filthy.Aside from those minor downsides, this grill brush works very well and does the job.  I highly recommend.  I just purchased a new brush head and will update my review if I run into any issues replacing it.
B00198IUKY I bought this for my husband based on the good reviews.  When it arrived, I saw how big it was and thought he'd hate it.  But he loves it and best of all, actually uses it to clean the grill.  Must be fun to use since he never really used the other grill brushes we had.  Great product, holding up well after 3 years...
B00198IUKY This is the best grill cleaner ever! Use the water feature on a hot grill really helps clean well. I would recommend
B00198IUKY I've only used it once, so I can't speak to the brush's longevity, however, it worked like a charm on my grill this past weekend.  It was easy to fill with water, simple to use, the handle is long enough to reach to the back of my huge BBQ without burning all of the hair off of my arms, and it really did steam the gunk off of the grill.  I hope it lasts!
B00198IUKY Yeah, right, I should have known it was too good to be true for the price, and lo and behold, I was right.  The advertisers say this unit uses steam to clean your grill.  Well, under certain circumstances, that is right.  If the grill is still boiling temperature hot, and you squirt or use the unit on the grill, it will vaporize the water, making steam, and allowing your steel bristles to do a good job.  Now, let's think about this, when it is that hot?  For me, only when I have finished cooking my meat, then I want to EAT; I don't want to take the time to use this unit.  By the time I have finished, the grill has cooled, eliminating the advantage of this unit.  It was my own fault; read the fine print, and you will see that you must use this when the grill is really hot.  There is no steam in the water you put into the unit (there is no heating element in the unit).  Anyway, live and learn.
B00198IUKY First off, it's HUGE, and it's plastic.  So yeah, it should only be $15, it's a big piece of molded plastic with a metal brush.  But, the brush is replaceable.  The water flow switch works great, and turns OFF completely, no dripping.  The water/steam cleaning works great.  The size really is perfect for a quick 2-hand scrubbing of the grill surface.  They include a folding hanger ring.  Overall, not a bad deal, very well designed.  I've only used it a couple of times so far, and I am being careful with it since it is plastic, so I can't comment on the long-term use of the brush.
B00198IUKY When my wife bought this based on a TV infomercial, I was skeptical because many products shown on TV simply do not work the same when you try them at home (I know because we have our fair share). But this product was a pleasant surprise. It was easy to use and worked quite well at cleaning our backyard gas grill.Simply fill the Grill Daddy with water, pre-heat your grill (I recommend with the cover closed) for ten minutes, then turn it off and use the Grill Daddy. As the water comes out it turns to steam and makes cleaning the grill a snap with a little \"elbow grease.\" There are two cleaning heads: a brush that works with the steam, and metal wires for more heavy duty scraping and cleaning between the grates.I suggest you wear a cooking mitt when you clean the grill to avoid burning yourself with the steam.Although this product is made of plastic, which obviously is susceptible to heat, this was not a problem in cleaning the grill. As long as you don't touch the grill with the plastic, you don't have to worry about it melting.This is much easier and more effective than using an ordinary brush. The water not only creates steam that helps remove the buildup, but also reduces the friction of rubbing, so you don't have to exert as much effort as with an ordinary brush.Bottom Line: This is a very simple way to clean your grill with a minimum of effort, and you will see that it is much cleaner than if you had used an ordinary brush.Update September 8, 2012: My original Grill Daddy \"walked off\" so I had to buy a new one. It works just as well, and seems even sturdier than the original one that I bought three years ago. I recently got a Bull Brahma grill that has five different burners and lots of cooking surface to clean. The Grill Daddy makes cleanup a breeze.
B00198IUKY I haven't tried it yet to clean a grill, but thought I'd mention that it is humongous.  Seriously.  This thing is almost as long as my arm.  Easily twice as big as any grill brush I've used before.  I guess they want to keep your hands away from any steam.
B0019ACHR4 these filters are very in price when buying them in group of fives. way cheaper than buying them one at a time in store where are about 7.00 or 8.00 buck  a piece
B0019ACHR4 Briggs & Stratton 4101 5-Pack Of 491588S Flat Air Filter Cartridge  IS NICE TO GET IN A 5 PACK. WONDERFUL
B0019ACHR4 Briggs & Stratton is the only mower engine I will buy. The air filters were the exact ones I needed. Your mower will love you if you change the filter regularly. It is very easy to do when you have this 5 pk.
B0019ACHR4 This filter fits many lawn mowers that have a Briggs & Statton engine.  I purchased the five pack because I have 2 lawn mowers and they get dirty in a dusty environment.  They can be washed but do eventually rust and are supposed to be replaced at least once a year.
B0019ACHR4 For years I picked up filters locally paying 6 to 10 dollars per filter. These filters are less than four dollars each and are just as good as the ones I've been using. The filters are not individually wrapped (a good thing) and on each one is stamped - \"Briggs & Stratton 491588S. With this pack of filters on the shelf, maybe I won't be such a tightwad and will change the filters as often as I should for good lawnmower performance.
B0019ACHR4 I was amazed how much better my lawn mower ran after changing this filter.  It's easy to forget the fundamentals.  The air/fuel mixture is many more times &#34;air&#34; than &#34;fuel.&#34;  With the engine so close to the ground, the filter gets clogged up more quickly than I realize especially in dry/dusty conditions.  By getting five of them at a time, I'll always have a replacement on hand.  They are easy to replace.  Fit perfectly.  The Amazon price is much better than my local hardware store.
B0019BK8AG I hang these in our home during the summer. It is the one thing that takes care of the flies! We recently purchased a home with a sun porch, and I will be adding this to the area there, since we get a lot of flies there as well. It isn't immediate like a spray, but it has worked for us.Best of all, no sprays or pesticides, an important fact with my allergies!Edited:As flies have increased, we see an occasional one flying around, particularly if we leave aging fruit out. However, within a day or so, they are gone, once we remove the offending item. I currently have two in the house, one in the dining/kitchen area, and one in the living room.
B0019BK8AG I have used these pest strips for around 3 years now to control moth damage to clothing. Since using these strips I've had no more problems with moths eating holes in my clothing.The strip is good for up to 4 months and 4 months goes by pretty fast where the use of these strips is concerned. I've found it best for me to mark the bottom of the strip with the replacement date using a permanent felt tip marker. That way I have a reminder when the strip should be replaced.This system has worked pretty well; I still sometimes let the replacement date slip by before I replace it. What I've been doing is putting up a new strip and then move the old one to another location in the same room to get any residual benefit it might offer.It is odor-free and leaves no evidence that such a strip is in use on the clothing. I recommend it for moth control as it has worked well for me.
B0019BK8AG Works very well. I hang two in my garage and two in my attic. Helps to control flys and many other insects. Do not use in living quarters as this is toxic to humans if exposed over long periods of time. The strips are easy to hang and last about 4 months (maybe a little longer) as advertised.
B0019BK8AG After several years of spider mites,I found this works well in indoor small spaces, 10 x12.No pest destroyed the population after a week. Pest is soaked with a spray, wear a mask when you open the package! I lay the strip on a tray and move around the room under the worst of my plants with spiders, since the spiders hide under the leaves. The vapor rises and kills them.**** yahoo, plants that were gently annoyed were clean in two weeks after I turned the fan off for six days. both rooms are clean, with only once a week neem. this works well.I appreciate hard to find items like this on amazon, the local stores get so they only carry items \"seasonally\", tell that to my plants.
B0019BK8AG After bringing in a bag of infested birdseed we developed an annoying pantry moth problem for years. One pest guy told us that the best we could hope for was to 'control' the moths, but we probably could not eliminate them. We used the traps, and though we caught many of them and they seemed to stay out of the food, we could still see them flying around. It drove me nuts.Another pest guy said he had a similar problem and got rid of his moths with this strip. Guess what? It worked. I haven't seen one in weeks, and I am thrilled.
B0019BK8AG We hang these in the tack room, laundry closet, vestibule, and rooms infrequently used.You should not hang these in rooms occupied more than 4 hours a day. So they have limited use around the house. When you do use them, they do work though!
B0019BK8AG We have had these for a few months now and they don't really seem to do anything.  Back in the '90's before the EPA stomped on the ingredients these worked great.  Don't waste your money on these.
B0019KSUG6 I heard about this product on a DIY talk show that I listen to on the weekends.  It sounds too good to be true, but I'd hate to miss out on a possible good product! :)The pros:+ 1 gallon concentrate makes 6 gallons of ready to use product.  Covers approximately 750-2250 square feet.+ Non-caustic, Non-acidic, Contains no bleach.+ Safe on any outdoor surface.+ One step process... Wet & Forget!+ EPA approved one step process that requires no scrubbing or rinsing.+ Safe around plants.+ Continues to clean for up to a year.The cons:- For some applications, it can take 6 to 12 months for this product to work.- On the expensive side, as you can spray a gallon in an instant!- Slight bleach like smell when it's first applied.Closing comments:&#9642; I sprayed the side of a shed & fencing that had green algae on it.  By the next day, it wasn't green, looked white, which should wash off when it rains. :)&#9642; I sprayed lots of different areas, so if Wet & Forget Outdoor works as advertized, I'll be back to update this review & I'll consider increasing my product rating.Lastly, when I was reading the instructions on how to dilute the concentrate... 1 part Wet & Forget Outdoor to5 parts water, I thought there had to be easier instructions.  I found this on the Wet & Forget website FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions).&#9642; For a 1 gallon container or sprayer, add 2-1/2 cups (20 oz.) of Wet & Forget Outdoor concentrate & fill with water to the 1 gallon mark.&#9642; For a 2 gallon container or sprayer, add 5 cups (40 oz.) Wet & Forget Outdoor concentrate & fill with water to the 2 gallon mark.&#9658; Update - June 25, 2014I sprayed the green on the fence & on the concrete under our hose reel yesterday.  Today, all that green is gone!  Not everything I sprayed shows this kind of results, but so far, I'm impressed enough to up my product rating to 4 out of 5. :)
B0019KSUG6 I applied when the temperature was just over 50 two weeks ago.  Covered stairs, deck and an outdoor swing.  I noticed that after the rain this week most areas were 40 to 50 percent better even if they say it takes 6 months of longer.  Proof will come this Spring and a second application but so far I am pleased.
B0019KSUG6 I purchased this about six months ago. I live about 35 miles outside of Atlanta near a lake. Mildew and fungus are two constant visitors. I began spraying my driveway and walkways with this Wet and Forget as soon as I received the shipment. Initially I did not think that this would work because for the first few or more days I did not see any results. However, eventually the Wet and Forget kicked in and as time passed the mildew and fungus were eliminated.The elimination is not a final result because the mildew and fungus will keep returning. Whenever I feel the slightest inkling that these unwelcome visitors may return I do a thorough spray down and my driveway and walkways remain clean of this nuisance.Using this product requires patience. If you expect immediate results you will be disappointed. If you can remain patient for a while you will be pleased with the results.
B0019KSUG6 The active ingredient is benzalkonium chloride, the same antibacterial and antifungal agent that makes the popular Lysol spray, except in a much higher concentration.  This also appears to contain some kind of sudsing agent because there were soapy bubbles when I sprayed it.  Benzalkonium chloride, also known as ADBAC, has been used for many decades to disinfect hospitals and household surfaces and is safe, in fact it is even used in contact lens solutions.  I sprayed all of the stucco on our house and the entire wood shingle roof using a Miracle-gro garden sprayer.  The runoff appears to be safe for plants because they're doing fine after I used four entire gallons of Wet and Forget a few weeks ago.  I found this to be a safe and powerful way to get rid of mildew, bacteria, and fungus on large outdoor surfaces.
B0019KSUG6 It does what it says. You wet the surface and forget about it. A lot cheaper then the other product I used to use.
B0019KSUG6 I bought this last year and used it on one house of mine in the late Fall.  Went up on the roof with a sprayer and sprayed the roof.  By this Spring the mold was all gone.  Between the snow and rain it worked gently and cleaned the roof.  What went down the gutters did no damage to my lawn or rain barrel water.  I just bought this container for a second home with the same issue.  I sprayed it on it last month so we'll see what Spring brings but I am sure it will work.  This second home does not have gutters so this will wash onto some brick steps with the same mold problem.  I am hoping it cleans those also.
B0019KSUG6 I live in a very damp area and moss around my driveway and the retaining walls in yard are a significant problem. This fixes the problem well. I highly recommend it. Works well in just a couple of days! I'll make this a part of my regular Spring and fall maintenance plans on the yard.
B0019KSUG6 My wife and I moved into a house 9 months ago and it was unoccupied for a couple of years.  There was a fine coat of green moss on the front walk way, the patio, roof, and in shady areas on our brick exterior.  I read here that this product is something you apply and over a period of time, it will eliminate moss.  I have found that to be completely true.  On every area that I applied to, I noticed after 30 days of a significant reduction in moss.  I had it mixed up in a pressurized canister and sprayed it on my front walk way, but I ran out with about 20 feet left. I figured it would be a good test to see a compairison side by side of the results.  It took about 2 weeks until I thought there was a difference, but after 2 more weeks it was very clear.What I didn't apply this product to was some moss I have on some rather large stones in my front yard.  The moss on them was thick, about the thickness of a bed comforter.  I'm sure this product would have killed the moss, but would not have removed it.  In this scenario, I had to use a pressure washer, but I did apply this stuff afterwards and it has kept the moss from reappearing.  I don't mind using a pressure washer, but it is just a messy process and makes mulch beds look ugly.I live in Northeast Ohio and it tends to be very wet in the Winter and Spring, and that leads to a perfect environment to grow moss.  This product will be applied before the snow falls just to see how it performs during the spring thaw.  But as far as the performance during the summer, I couldn't be more pleased!  Mixing instructions are simple and right on the bottle.  Follow them, they make it very clear to do just that.  I'm not sure what can be gained or lost by using different mixing ratios, but as far as I can tell, there isn't a need to deviate from what they have.
B0019KSUG6 I use this on our brick patio and on our steel roof where moss just grows crazy.  It truly helps eliminate the moss and prevents it from coming back the next time.  You just have to remember to reapply the product before the moss shows up.  I've used it every spring and so far no moss.  If I forget, the moss comes back and then I have to either use this product or pressure wash the patio and roof.  This is much better than pressure washing.
B0019KSUG6 In some cases this Wet and Forget works better than Industrial Chlorine but not all. Don't expect it to be a panacea for every driveway, deck or sidewalk discoloration. It does work on moss growing in between paver blocks fairly well. On decks it only seems to work moderately so I use a bath of industrial chlorine to get the stains out. It did work well in getting rid of mold/mildew stains on some landscaping stones. I use it every year and will continue to use it. Worth trying if you have moss or dark discolorations on your driveway or landscaping. Not all stains are mold or mildew so don't expect this Wet and Forget to work on oil stains.
B0019KSUG6 Used Wet and Forget on the brick floor of our front porch.  Living in Florida this floor was covered with a green growth, especially following rains.  As advertised, Wet and Forget did the job and it continues to remove more following each rain.  The only reason I gave it a four star was it is not as efficient in cleaning a wooden swing, admittedly badly covered with mildew and mold.  Great product and I will definitely order more when this is gone.Now, two years later, I find that I only have to use this product once per year and I have enough remaining for 2012 from my original order of two gallons.  I have raised my rating to five stars.  This is a really great product!
B0019KSUG6 We bought two gallons of Wet and Forget at Costco. Applied per directions to some very moldy/ mildewey wood decking as well as a very mildewey painted wall and waited as directed. After 3 months of zero improvement, we applied again and scrubbed with a brush, (but did not rinse). This loosened up about 50% of the black mildew and with the next rains, it rinsed away. One year later, we can see some minor \"peeling\" effect of the remaining mildew layer on about 25% of the deck, but most of the deck simply returned to it's original back nastiness. I would say that the mildew has actually gotten worse over the last year, not better. We finally pressure washed it and then reapplied the wet and forget thinking that it might help prevent the return on the black mildew, but it hasn't. In the deck areas that get hit by the sprinklers, the wood is black again after only 4 months. The moldy wall never improved beyond our scrubbing efforts despite reapplication of the Wet and Forget. I don't know if the product just can't perform in extreme hot/humid conditions like South Florida or we got a bad batch, but I would not recommend this product. We went back to pressure washing after one year of trial with Wet and Forget. Pressure washing takes about the same amount of time to do as applying W&F and results are instant and beautiful.
B0019LY8QG A lot of trouble for very little result.... I followed instructions closely and I've been using this for several weeks. In that time I've only trapped a total of six wasps and zero yellow jackets.  I finally threw it in the trash yesterday.  Not worth the time to maintain it.
B0019LY8QG I tried baiting it with apple juice laced with Karo Syrup, root-beer,7-up, and fruit jams, all of which the wasps find attractive at our dinner table - but it was a no-go in this trap.  In the trap's defense, I bought 3 different styles of traps and none of them was catching anything.  Then I chanced upon the right bait and all three traps quickly filled with wasps & flies:Traps: mix solution in a large container and keep it in the garage fridge, refilling the traps with it as needed.  Wasps cannot resist it, but honey bees are not attracted to it because of the vinegar.* 1 bottle beer* 2 TBS white or cider vinegar* 1 TBS lemon juice (I use the bottled kind from the grocery store)*   tsp dish detergentWasps love beer and are not deterred by vinegar, but honey bees hate vinegar so it keeps bees from accidentally getting lured into your traps.  Only add a small amount of dish soap to avoid overpowering the smell of the bait. Less than a teaspoon is more than enough. The soap sticks to them and removes their protective coating. The acids in the vinegar and lemon juice then kill the wasp. That it also attracts and kills flies is the lagniappe that comes with this recipe.Spray their nests:* 1 gallon water* 1 cup dish detergent* 1 cup vinegar*  cup lemon juice*  cup peppermint extractThe detergent/vinegar/lemon kills the existing wasps in the nest.  Wasps are absolutely repulsed by the scent of peppermint so any wasps who escaped will not return to the nesting area.  Put solution into pressurized sprayer and spray nesting areas after dark when wasps have settled in for the night.I now keep small bottles with a couple cotton balls inside that are saturated with baby oil and peppermint oil near the gutter entries that the wasps favored and I've been wasp nest free for the remainder of the summer even though the traps continue to catch a couple wasps every day.4 stars because it isn't as easy to clean and the liquid needs refreshing more often than in my other traps, but if you keep a close eye on it, it does as good a job keeping down wasp and house fly populations as the far more expensive glass traps.
B0019LY8QG This is the third wasp and yellow product I have purchased in the last several years. It works. It really attracts flies (a real bonus) in addition to yellow jackets and wasps. You do have to maintain the liquid level or it will dry into a hard lump making it far less effective and harder to clean.I recommend this item to friends.
B0019LY8QG Great job attracting wasps (and other bugs).  You absolutely need the right mixture/bait.  I usually use Apple Cider Vinegar with some sugar or regular Coke.  Not only catches wasps but also fruit flies.
B0019LY8QG This item simply didn't work. I got a few hundred little ants and that was it; the yellow jackets were not interested. Apart from anything else, you can't put much juice in the container, otherwise it spills out through the entrance holes. The result is that, after a day in the hot sun, the juice has dried up, leaving a thin, solid residue on the bottom; something which seemed to attract only the ants.
B0019NACTG At one time I was an avid user of chain saws. Cutting up entire trees for firewood and to clear space. Now I cannot start a chainsaw due to a bad shoulder and I am extremely frustrated because even the small stuff is overgrown due to no longer being a goat owner. Enter the alligator lopper. It is quick and safe to use, I carry the oil in my pocket and I can trim to my heart's content. This is a great product. I bought the chainsaw also so I am ready with three batteries and enthusiasm that comes with a product that lives up to its advertised purpose. I love this thing.
B0019NACTG I'm a big fan of the 18volt B&D; line - have their regular hedge trimmer, the extended trimmer, the pole saw, the chainsaw, blower, and several others. I've always wanted one of the Alligator cutters since it came out, but the fact that it was corded held me back. Most of the time, the time and hassle of dealing with an electrical cord makes doing it by hand easier.So pleased to see that B&D; came out with a cordless version of the Alligator! Works great, and solves one of the biggest problems of cutting limbs - chopping them into smaller lengths for disposal. The cordless chainsaw does a great job of getting the limb to the ground, but you have to prop up the limb before cutting it into pieces so you don't hit the ground with the chain. This is where the Alligator shines -- the protective cover keeps you from hitting the ground, so you don't have to spent the time propping up limbs. Just grab and cut.It's also very helpful on limbs. While it can't cut through as thick of a limb as the cordless chainsaw, for smaller jobs it's all you need. Also fantastic for cutting thick, overgrown bushes -- it handles the thick stalks that stops even the biggest hedge trimmer.The downside with this, and all other B&D; cordless products, is battery life. Get a spare battery (or two) and the one hour charger. When the battery dies, swap it out and keep going. If you need batteries, keep an eye out for sales on the cordless blower. It comes with two batteries and, when it's on sale, is cheaper than buying just the battery.Oiling is a bit of a pain -- wish they provided a system like they have on the cordless chainsaw. It's workable, but you nearly always dribble out some oil, so make sure you're standing where a couple of oil drops won't cause a problem when they hit the floor.Fantastic product that is easy, safe and (at least for me) fun to use.
B0019NACTG I am impressed. The little bit of set-up was a snap. The manual is helpful. Getting ready to use this takes only a few minutes (as long as you already have some bar & chain or 30W oil).Using it is also simple. Using it can also be dangerous. Getting used to the jaw and the timing of starting and stopping the chain takes a little practice.I used this pruning and cutting up everything from twigs to 3.5\" limbs. It cut them all quickly and cleanly. I made over 50 cuts of at least an inch and there was no sign of the battery weakening.Next up is 80' of hedge. Though the limbs aren't \"large\", they are too large for my hedge trimmers (also B&D; 18v).There a few negatives, but nothing to even cost it part of a star. There is no oil reservoir. You periodically add oil from a plastic squeeze bottle (supplied). Also, even though it is very well balanced, it is heavy (at least for a 66 year old guy with bad legs and back). I had to take frequent breaks.I have several of the B&D; yard tools in this series and they have all been a pleasure to use.
B0019NACTG When I first saw the B&D; lopper my first thought was why didn't someone come up with this idea sooner! My husband and I have both used this lopper several times and it makes quick work of trimming trees and bushes. Since this lopper's blades are somewhat \"enclosed\" it is safer than standard chain saws. Although, it is limited in the size of limb it can handle, it will cut fairly large limbs.As a woman, what I love the most is that it is lightweight, quiet and very easy to handle. No more lugging a heavy gas powered saw, yanking on a starter \"pull rope\" [never been successful at that], dealing with the noise level or trying not to spill gas while filling a tiny gas tank! This saw is powerful enough so that it takes very little effort to cut through limbs[you just \"hold\" it using a scissor like motion.]Note: we purchased an \"extra\" battery and keep both charged to extend the saw's \"work\" time. We have lots of trees so for us the B&D; Alligator was a very good purchase indeed!
B0019NACTG I don't normally name tools, but this one was so useful and fun to use, that I took to calling it \"Old Snappy\" even though I had only had it a week when I used it.  I trimed 3 large Crape Myrtle tress with.  Normally this is a pain because if you use a chain saw the flex of the branches results in a ragged trim, but the jaws of the Alligator Lopper hold the work (branch) tight and you get a nice clean cut.  I used the battery that came with it for the first tree and was not shocked to find I had to go to a second battery for the next tree.  New batteries have a break in time before they reach full charge.  The second battery finished the second tree.  (This battery really should have had more life).  The third battery trimed the third tree, trimmed up the fallen branches, and still had power to run my B&D cordless air broom. \"Old Snappy\" went through 3 and 4 inch limbs with out a problem and was able to take on bigger limbs if your able and willing to cut from each side. I really like the chain adjustment.  It is the easiest I have used, loosen the bolts and the tool does the work. However, I usually give the bar a light pull forward to help, then tight the bolts up with the supplied tool.  Oiling was not a problem, I used the oil hole on the tool, but also applied oil directly to the chain and bar, much like the B&D pole trimmer.  I already have a shallow pan where I sit my 18 inch chain saw (which leaks all the time), so I do not consider oil leaking a problem.  All and all I really like this lopper, which will do duty as a light chain saw. Amazon ordering was painless and the product arrived right on time.  Another good Amazon experience.
B0019NACTG We have four B&D; 18-Volt tools, a blower, hedge trimmer, lawn edger, and this lopper. Consequently we have the 4 batteries that came with the tools. This means I almost always have spare charged batteries. We have a large property with dozens of trees and bushes that need year round work to keep them trimmed. The hedge trimmer and this lopper are useful for 98% of the trimming I have to do, the rest is done with a hand snipper for the really small cuts. I've used the lopper quite a bit and it works like new after almost a year of use.This B&D; Lopper is light weight, very safe because it requires two hands to operate the two switches built into the handles, and it works very well on branches up to about 3\" in diameter. It has sufficient power to do the job, cuts cleanly, and I've had only a little problem with clogging at the motor end of the chain where twigs can build up after a lot of use. It is great not to have to deal with AC cords when working on our 1/2 acre property.I recently did a big job on bushes in the side yard. These are fast growing bushes that hadn't been kept trimmed by the previous owners. After trimming about 30 feet of bushes I had to quit because the chain was simply worn out after almost a year of use. I purchased a new chain (and a spare for next time) and installed it in about 15 minutes. Now it operates like new again.I highly recommend the B&D; lopper and all their 18V tools.
B0019NACTG I was very disappointed with this product.  If you have a chain saw, then use it instead.  This is designed okay, just not very practical for doing more than a few cuts.
B0019NACTG I used the Black and Decker corded Alligator Loppers for a couple of years and was very happy with them. I was excited when I saw that they offered a cordless version so I snapped them up! They offer the same amount of power, but are much more convenient. They grind though brush in just seconds! They are easy to clean and keep maintained. They don't hold a charge very long, but I have a second battery that I keep charged and handy to slip in if I need them for a long time. This is my favorite garden tool.
B0019NACTG Receive this Alligator Lopper just in time to help cut up a downed 30 ft. White Pine. Used it to cut all the limbs off of the trunk; mostly less than 2 inches. The tool worked flawlessly and quickly, but considering its weight, wouldn't want to have to use it for an extended period. A standard manual lopper would be easier to use if you're cutting above your head, butg since this tree was down on the ground, it wasn't so bad. Was slightly disappointed that the cuts weren't very clean; it left somewhat jagged edges. Not an issue for this project, but if used to prune a live tree, I would rather get a clean cut. This is why I rated 4 stars instead of 5. I will try tightening the chain for the next trimming.
B0019TEHBE Creates a very attractive fountain that I use in my half wine barrels. The adjustment in our low water pressure system maxed out at about 20&#34; radius. Not too bad.
B0019TEHBE I have some very large potted plants, and I have found this product to be great to getting water across the whole area with out having to use several emitters.
B0019TEHBE I'm confused why the micro bubbler needs to be staked.  I thought this was a microspray since it is staked, but the pattern reaches just a few inches from the emitter.  I guess if you were watching the spray as the system was on and you wanted the LOOK of the pattern being level, the stake would be useful.  Other than that, it seems unjustifiable expense.  I'm glad I only bought one pack.If you want a micro bubbler and don't need it staked, then I recommend the Nsstar set B00DW5GN0G.  A much better value (without a stake.)
B0019TEHBE These Rain Bird MBF-4PK Landscape Dripline System Full Circle Micro Bubbler, did not work with my hydroponic pumps as hey did not provide enough pressure to be effective, HOWEVER when hooked up to public water supply (house water supply) they had enough pressure for the outside plants.
B0019TEHBE There are several different heads so watch what you select in order to get exactly what you want. The heads rand from drip, umbrella, and spray. The handy little tube connecter is attached so you don't have to go hunt for hunt one. They work perfect for me.
B0019TEHBE Got some that just bubble by mistake, and found these here on Amazon.  We have them in individual pots, connected with tubing, all connected to our sprinkler system.  The circle spray can be adjusted for each pot.  Sure beats hand watering.
B0019TEHBE They work great.  I tried to save some money this year by purchasing Orbit branded bubblers instead of the rainbirds, and that was a bad decision.  The orbits need to be adjusted constantly to keep a stable flow - these rainbirds do their job without a lot of fussing or adjusting.I haven't found better drip bubblers yet!
B0019THNCE I have installed my first drip irrigation system in the spring of 2009 using all components from DIG.  This year I decided to expand and build a new branch which required a whole new set up: the second pressure regulator, hose to tube adapter, timer and of course more tubing.  Unfortunately, I did not realize there were different types of tubing material which can be stiff rather than soft.DIG tubing was soft and pliable and stayed exactly where I put it.  Rain Bird tubing is stiff and even though I kept in the sun for several hours after unrolling it did not become any easier to work with. It is much harder to control, harder to place where you want it, if you don't put a stake where the tube naturally curls it rips itself out of the stakes.  I needed to run it over the bulk head as the spigot was on the other side from where I needed water and instead of laying flat in the channel is ripples and is visible in sections.The tubing does delivery water, installing barbs (after soaking in very hot water to make the tube softer) worked fine.  So it works as tubing just fine.  However, it is harder to work with than DIG tubing and it is more visible because it does not get trained to a shape you want it to be even after several weeks in the hot sun.Next time I need new tubing I will not be using Rain Bird Dripline tubing.
B0019THNCE Good product. It does what it's supposed to. A great deal over what stores charge so I can't complain much.
B0019THNCE I bought this hose go from my 8 port drip manifold. So far I like the tubing. Easy to cut and seems to be very sturdy for outdoor use. I wish it were a little more flexible, but I won't knock it a star for that.Great product
B0019THNCE I ended up using nearly 600 feet of this stuff in my system to cover about 1/4 acre of planting beds.  Most pieces are between 2' and 4' long from the distribution line.  I initially ordered 300' but probably would have ordered 500 if It was available in that quantity.The price is ok for 100' and since it is prime, it's still somewhat competitive to 500' of orbit line.  The generic line B004QJ2SE2 is cheaper and probably would work fine (though I haven't actually tried that one.)
B0019THNCE The Rain Bird Landscape Dripline System 1/4-Inch Tubing is a super fantastic deal for a 100-Foot Roll of tubing. I highly recommend this product.
B0019THNCE This is a great value for this tubing. I needed 2 of them and have already used over 100 feet.
B0019THNCE Perfect product for a successful drip line garden watering system. I have a complete &#34;water smart watered yard and I i=use this product exclusively.
B0019THNCE The relationship between this 1/4&#34; Rainbird Dripline the 1/4&#34; Rubber Grommet and the 1/2&#34; Rainbird Dripline is a perfect match. The 1/4&#34; line fits comfortably into the grommet and supplies water at a substantive rate to my system. I was also fortunate to utilize it for attaching my air stones to my air pumps.
B0019THNCE Works great.  Tip: it will retain its packaged curve shape so lay it out in the sun for awhile if you want the pieces to lay straight.
B0019THNCE I used this to irrigate our landscaped plants over the summer and works nicely.  It was easy to cut with a utility knife (i.e box cutter).  Just be aware that the tubing is very rigid so plan accordingly.  I don't know if this was by design to withstand temperate fluctuation but you'll need to plan just a single slight bend (or curve) on the line.  It won't take more than that.  One advice, you'll need to use a flame to soften the plastic on the opening before attaching it to whatever you are connecting to.  Otherwise you'll have to use a lot of pressure to make it fit.
B0019THNCE I purchased the 250-Feet roll of this so (a much better deal if you need a lot) I'm adding my review to the 100' version also. It is a stiff line and does not really bend nor conform easily and some reviewers noted this as a problem on the 100' reviews. I concur that it's no where near as flexible as the Orbit and DIG lines that I use extensively in several large gardens and for tree watering. I have some gardens that I water from above to simulate a gentle rain. I run a long 1/2' feed line down some pipes that provide a framework over the gardens for shade mesh and I drop some 1/4\" lines down from that and add a spray emitter. I also run some feed lines on the ground and add risers to get the water up a few feet above the plants to water the trees. The point is that since these are stiff... and stay that way in desert heat that is about 120 degrees and in constant sun... they make great risers and extensions that will stay in place. That has saved me some bucks on stakes and on the overhead system they don't blow around mush in the breeze. If you want something that is very flexible and will stay where you put don't buy the Rain Bird 1/4\" lines... go with the Orbit or DIG. I gave it 4 stars because it served my limited use but if I wanted something flexible to run on the ground this would be getting about 2 stars.
B0019Y0YCA i bought the larger one and this smaller one. I think i prefer the smaller one because the birds tend to drink from it more frequently. It may have to do with the fact that they can finish the solution faster and it doesnt sit in there as long. it takes longer for the larger one to empty and the solution can turn yucky faster. all in all, i love these style feeders. Super easy to clean and love the bar they birds can sit on while they drink.
B0019Y0YCA I wasn't crazy about the first two that I bought, but then I remembered that our hummingbirds (Anna's and a few Rufous) have a breeding season, and both migrate. Now, they're here in full force, enough so that I had to buy a third feeder. And there was a bonus: the ant moat which evidently the ants read as a \"swimming pool,\" attracted our beautiful, tiny Northern California Chestnut-backed Chickadees that climb down the center post and drink from the moat! (See the two photos posted.)These are much easier feeders to clean and fill than the bottle-shaped ones. The top just \"unsnaps,\" cleanup takes two minutes (for all three), and the fill, put the lid back on and hang them. The hummers love to sit on the rim, but when we get more than 2 or 3 at a feeder, others will either take a quick sip while in flight or hang out in the tangelo tree an wait their turn.During a normal summer when it's very hot in the Diablo Valley, replacing the nectar every three days is a must. But this year it's been cooler and we've had so many more hummers that the food doesn't last more than 3 days. They entertain me, and they're more than worth their upkeep.
B0019Y0YCA Why did I waste so much money over the years with other feeders?--this one is the BEST.  I especially love the moat that captures ants, etc.
B0019Y0YCA Love this little hummingbird feeder!  Easy to clean and fill.  Attracts lots of hummingbirds, not bees.  My only mistake is that I did not get two.  Will get another so bossy pants doesn't scare the others away.  I live in New England and we do have plenty of hummingbirds, but feeding them brings them into visible range.  It also helps us that we have placed this feeder on a deck, near potted flowering plants, which the birds also enjoy.  Great find.
B0019Y0YCA I like this one, it's easy to clean, fill and hang.  The bug moat works too.
B0019Y0YCA Our yard usually has 8-10 hummingbird feeders out at the same time, all different varieties.  I bought two Aspects Hummzinger feeders for practicality purposes--easy to clean, holds small amounts of nectar, and has perches.  Hummers do frequent these feeders, but I have found the nectar in them turns bad much more quickly.  I am constantly cleaning and changing them out.Reviewers comment about feeder preferences, but I have found location to be more crucial than what type feeder is used.  Our hummers drink from all, but guard certain ones like hawks.  The feeders surrounding the garden area (loaded with favorite flowers) are preferred.  To keep peace, other feeders are spaced out among foundation shrubbery and yard/wood's edge.Any feeder seems to attract hummers around here, but for some reason the nectar in the Aspect Mini Hummzingers turn syrupy and bad within a day's time (no, they are not in the sun and I clean regularly).  I still use them, but won't buy any more.  Instead, I recommendBest-1  8oz. Hummingbird Feeder, which also holds eight ounces.  They are inexpensive, easy to clean and the tops/bottoms can be bought and replaced separately.  Each year I try a new feeder out, but haven't found any as good as Best-1's.
B0019Y0YCA 3 days and I have hummingbirds !!! Only used it for one year so far, but not a single bug found it's way to the syrup !Very easy to clean (use a pipe cleaner for the openings). The hummingbirds like to perch on it and hang out. They'll stay perched on it for a minute or so, taking sips and looking around. Very happy with this product !
B0019Y0YCA Here in Las Vegas we have a great number of hummingbirds, these feeders have been very popular with the birds.
B0019Y0YCA Easy to clean, easy to fill and the hummingbirds love it. Holds the perfect amount of sugar water - too much and it goes bad.
B0019Y0YCA I really like this feeder - it has a wraparound perch, so that the hummers can sit while they drink, allowing them to rest a little bit, and affording me a good long look at them!  Also, it's very easy to clean.The reason I only gave it 4 stars is because after a while, the perch will crack, and the part that the brass hanger screws into can crack.  I've fixed both of those problems with a combination of Crazy Glue and duct tape, which gave me another year of use.For the person who claimed the hummers can't reach the nectar unless it's full, that's not true - their tongues can reach all the way to the bottom - I've seen it.Here's a good tip:  I bought two of these feeders; while one is in use, the other can go thru the dishwasher.  I refill them every few days anyway, so this is a time and labor-saver.Recommended.
B0019Y0YCA Experiments have shown that BPA is harmful to animals with negative impacts on functions including development, metabolism, reproductive activity and many more (E.g., see Science Daily \"Harmful effects of bisphenol A demonstrated experimentally\", January 22, 2013, or Google for a very long list of other articles. The danger of BPA has pretty well become common knowledge at this point and doesn't seem to be disputed.)I emailed Aspects to ask if this feeder contains BPA because it was not clear that it did not. They replied that Aspects does use BPA in this and all their other polycarbonate feeders. They also explicitly stated that they have no current intent to make a BPA-free feeder. Let's encourage them to change that stance!I think it goes without saying that we should not be feeding our beautiful wildlife chemicals that harm them if we care about them as much as we like to think we do. Even if one isn't concerned about the first generation of hummingbirds, consider the likely possibility that the chemicals are also transferred to offspring during gestation and may accumulate through generations. Furthermore, consider the food chain and the general fact that we're putting these chemicals out in our environment.Nalgene and other companies have removed BPA from their plastics and still make very strong and aesthetic water bottles without it. This feeder has many _great_ properties, but it's not the only feeder with them; personally I will buy alternatives (of which there are plenty) until Aspects decides to make a BPA-free hummingbird feeder to purchase one of theirs. I would love to see them do so.
B0019Y0YCA My hummingbirds like this.  I love it.  It is easy to fill and clean.  Takes just 1 cup of water...1/4 cup of sugar.  Nothing goes to waste.Sometimes my bees get into it, but I have 3 of these and bees only get into one....go figure.  Its size make it best for those of us who have highly protective birds that do not let the masses near their food source.  You would need a larger one if you attract lots of birds to one feeder.
B0019Y0YCA I've uploaded a picture showing insects in the feeder. The ant moat seems to work, but the holes look like they are big enough for insects to get through. The insects in the feeder look like very large ants, but I don't really know what they are. I've previously found a bee or two in it as well.Since I got this solely because it is supposed to keep these things out (I thought), I'm just giving it 2 stars. (On further thought, I'm upping it to 3 because it is really easy to clean and fill.)
B0019Y0YCA I use a number of different hummer feeders, all of which I have learned to like, b
B001A5OR5I I have a variety of houseplants and patio plants that require watering at different intervals. Instead of trying to dig my fingers in there and see if the plant is dry, I can just use this meter and get a quick reading that gives me an idea of the soil condition.+ Inexpensive+ Reliable+ No Batteries+ Rapid Reading+ List of Plants and Their Water Needs- Short Cord- Short Probe_Bottom Line_ Yes, I would recommend this to a friend. Many times the root-ball becomes dry even when the surrounding soil is moist, especially with a newly transplanted plant. The list of common plants and their moisture needs is very useful and comprehensive.
B001A5OR5I This little moisture meter tester has been a life saver for my plants. It is very handy.  Do I need to water this plant today.  Let me use my moisture meter and see.  My plants are happy and I am happy with this meter.  I have been using it over 2 years now, and it is just as handy today as it was the day I received it.  No batteries to replace either.
B001A5OR5I I bought a moisture meter at some discount store about 20 years ago.  It was really cheap and worked great.  And then one day it died.Appearance-wise, it was just like the Luster Leaf 1820, except the display had no colors.  It was a different brand, but since they were so similar, I chose this product as a replacementPerformance-wise, however, this item lacks a bit of luster compared to my old one.  My old one gave an instant read.  With this, you need to give it a few seconds.  But it does work well, and I do like having the \"cord\" to give me some reach.  I tried one that had the probe attached directly to the meter, and it was really a pain to use.These are not so easy to find, so I do recommend this product.  It's good to know how dry or wet your plants are, and with a moisture meter, no dirty fingernails.  I only wish it gave an instant read.  Otherwise, I'm very happy with it.  And it can be used for houseplants or the flower bed.
B001A5OR5I I bought this to make sure I didn't over water my dwarf kumquat plant. It works great. I ended up using it all spring and summer for my tomato plants, raised beds, and other potted plants. Very helpful.
B001A5OR5I Very nice gadget that really works.  I use it on all my plants.  I even used it to check the soil when planting new sod recently.  No complaints here.  Simply meter, just stick it in and look at the meter.
B001A5OR5I Bought one of these because I liked the cable. Tested it against two others and it always showed the plant as being more wet than it really was.  Might have been a defect but that was my experience.
B001A5OR5I Quit guessing... and you don't even need batteries. It is no more expensive than the last 3 plants you killed by over/under watering!!!
B001A5OR5I The Rapitest, besides having a horrible product name, cannot consistently measure soil moisture.  You are better off using your finger or a dry Popsicle stick.  In addition, the optimal meter readings that they provide for various plants is way off.  I would kill my plants if I used them.It's a shame because I really wanted to like this product because it is easy to use.  However, ease of use does not matter when the product does not work at all.
B001A5OR5I I guess I should have read all the reviews...I got this the other day and opened it tonight to try on my plants.  I tried my cactus's first...indicator showed dry...thought ok, haven't watered them in awhile.  Then I tried it on some plants I just watered yesterday...dry again.  Humm....cannot be correct.  Put the probe in a glass of water...still dry.  Obviously this is defective or cheap.  It's going back and I'll look for another....
B001A5OR5I I have used these meters for years. My only complaint is they tend to fail after several years of heavy every day usage on dozens of plants. After reading all the negative reviews I noticed that some reviewers complained that they got low readings when put into a glass of water. The package clearly states they are not made to use in liquids. The watering guide mentioned on the package is on the inside of the folded package label. It could be easily overlooked.
B001A5OR5I Haven't had any issues with it not performing as other reviewers have mentioned. I guess it could be smaller but it's not that bad.
B001A5OR5I I have plants all over the place in a 7000 sq ft building and can never remember who I've watered when. This tool takes out the guesswork and doesn't leave me with dirt all over my hands from shoving them into each plant. It's cheap and effective-- what more could you want?
B001ACNWVQ Not mentioned in the Amazon description (but shown in the photo) is that this product contains 0.1% IBA (indole-3-butyric acid), a synthetic plant hormone. Powdered rooting hormone is usually available in 3 formulations: 0.1%, 0.3%, and 0.8% IBA. The lowest concentration is used for \"soft\" cuttings, like African violets, plumerias, mums, carnations though some harder wood plants can also use this. Woodier cuttings need hormone at the 0.8% concentration. You can Google \"Hormodin product label\" for a PDF of what plants should use which formulation. The 0.1% concentration is safe to use on all cuttings while stronger concentrations can damage or even kill more sensitive plants.I use this product mostly for roses and plumerias as a disinfectant. I'm not sure of its exact role in the promotion of roots (rooting results can vary greatly based on a number of conditions, including weather, cutting health, plant variety, or just pure luck), but one benefit I am sure about is the anti-fungal properties of the powder. I am obsessed with plumerias and have ordered at least 2 dozen cuttings off eBay this year. Using this prevented my plumeria cuttings from rotting. The cuttings I did not treat with powder started to rot from the bottom up. With periodic checking I saved my cuttings by cutting off the rotted part and treating with Green Light.To use, all you have to do is wet the cutting in water so that the powder sticks to it, then dip the cutting into the bottle. Tap off any excess powder, make a hole and gently firm up the rooting medium around the cutting. I've useMiracle-Gro Perlite(alone or mixed with 30-50% soil) with fantastic results. The perlite holds moisture and provides air pockets, creating perfect conditions for rooting of many types of cuttings, resulting in much faster rooting than planting in straight soil. I've use this method for epiphyllum, goji berry, portulaca, and sometimes for coleus (which roots easily in water).
B001ACNWVQ The directions said to use this with a potting medium, but didn't feel like buying special soil amendments. I put my herb cuttings in water instead, and after about 10 days roots grew! Awesome product, prevents the cuttings from rotting like they usually do in water!
B001ACNWVQ This is an excellent product! In only a matter of weeks, my two solitary Rose of Sharon bushes have become next years hedge! This product does an excellent job of encouraging rooting from cuttings of woody-stemmed bushes. All cuttings now have strong root growth and are about to be transplanted into pots to continue to develop a root system over the winter on my cool porch.  I've never felt so confident of my green thumb as I do now withGreen Light Organic Rooting Hormone - 2 oz 06920A.
B001ACNWVQ This rooting hormone has never disappointed me personally. I use it to propagate cuttings of ficus, dragon fruit, life saver plant, hibiscus, desert rose, Asian jasmine, etc. Most of it goes to propagate Asian jasmine, though, as I am currently planting a large area with this ground cover. As far as the jasmine goes, I calculated that my cutting loss turned out to be about 20% for approximately 1800 cuttings&#8212;not a bad number at all, in my opinion. I must mention that since Asian jasmine is a ground cover vine, its vines are thin and I suspect that most of the 20% loss is due to me cutting too thin or young vines. In any case, I am still very pleased with this product. With the other cuttings I deal with, I lose maybe 1% of the propagated cuttings, and this percentage is almost exclusively hibiscus cuttings.I will always use this hormone for any of my propagation needs!
B001ACNWVQ I've successfully used Green Light Rooting Hormone for years - it's wonderful for promoting feeder roots in cuttings or all types of ornamental plants.  This product is a man-made chemical and is not \"organic\" (such as \"organic\" hormones derived from willow bark or roots).
B001AHAJXK 7/12/12: OK, now I don't know how long this thing will hold up, but I can tell you that it's the best weed whacking head I've ever used, so far.  I can speak with some authority, here, as I'm a Certified Arborist who works around outdoor gizmos all day long, everyday. I used this unit for part of my home's grounds, though, as I don't get into lawn work in my day job.  I whacked about a half-acre using just the string that came with the head.  I never changed out the originals.  With every other head I've had it's been whack 3-5 minutes, change out the string.  This head kept going for forty minutes.  I honestly wonder how those who ranted on this thing used them.  I suppose if you crash the head into fencing, brick walls, sidewalks, etc., you will need to change the string.  I know how to trim around the aforementioned, so maybe that's why I'm having great results.  The head went on my universal power unit's shaft in under a minute.  No problem, whatsoever.  I will carry a piece of hanger wire to get the nubs out, should the string break, the next time I get out the unit.  I suppose that a tapered punch or nail set would eventually break the string holders.  I'll update, in here, if this head gives me any trouble.  UPDATE: 8/8/13: I had to replace the unit,  yesterday. The plastic, inset head, that the hex bolt goes into to drive the unit, wore away to the point where the shaft spun and the head didn't. I got a year out of the unit, and for the money, that's fine with me.
B001AHAJXK So evidently Murray branded trimmers are the odd man out when it comes to aftermarket trim head replacements.This one works like a charm though!Like any aftermarket trimmer head you just have to be careful NOT to overrev the engine as the added weight can damage it.This thing chews through grass better than the stock unit.
B001AHAJXK Used to see so many of these type replacement trimmer units sold on TV and always figured they were junk.Now they all seem to be gone from the marketplace except for two types that I found, I bought this one because it uses plain heavy duty .095 trimmer line and not special made blades that might be hard to find at some point.This can be set up to use 2 or 4 sections of line (bent double to be 4 or 8) I've been using it with only 2(4) so far and it works at least as well as my old stock unit that kept needing repairs and wasting line.Cutting pretty well, but makes the engine seem to run a bit slower and I feel the need to give it more throttle.I might try it with all 4 lines at some point to see if there is an improvement in cut, but happy as is and saves line too. (8 lines in use after you fold them over and insert) not sure what all 4(8) lines will do to the RPM range however, might not let my engine come up to full speed.This same item is also sold under the \"Rino-Tuff\" brand, but made by the same company.Check the pre cut replacement string package, for just a dollar or so more you can get 100ft of .095 line and cut 100 pcs pretty quick.Was quick and easy to install and has given no trouble so far with a few hours of cutting with it. (still the same line that came with the unit)They claim 20x the life for the line, but who knows.. even if it gets the same life per foot as the old coil loaded in, it's still easier to deal with no mechanical parts and uses low cost rolls of line.On the subject of line life, one thing to keep in mind is that when you do wear line it is not replaced by more from a spool so just gets shorter and shorter.. how long will you keep using it at it's shortest length before you put in new line?  A variable that will cause owners to report different findings on line wear times I'm sure.Claims to fit 99% of the gas trimmers out there, but no way one person can know if this is true.  Does come with a good assorment of sizes for nuts and bolts to fit what you have though.No way to know how this will hold up, but time will tell and I'll be back to say if it didn't do well 8-)NOTE;  Be sure to read the comments attached to this review before you buy
B001AHAJXK this trimmer is amazing..no need stopping every few seconds..it cuts great..easy install..it took me couple of minutes..no brainer..its is a amazing tool..worth every cent
B001AHAJXK Reading the hype on the packaging, the Rhino-Tuff looks impressive. First, the unit employs eight cutting strings instead of four or two. Second, the round rubber string holders are able to rotate 360 degrees with ease. This design minimizes shock and abrasion on the cutting strings - requiring less reloads and saving money..After using the Rhino-Tuff, I find the product ineffective. Here are my complaints:.1. The retail price is twice the price of its competitor, the Grass Gator 5600..2. The rotating string holder works great in avoiding string abrasion and breakage. When the cutting strings hit concrete, a fence, tree, or rock, they pivot away - shock and abrasion are minimized. After trimming my yard, there is very little wear on the strings. Compared to my Grass Gator 5600 Trimmer Head, I average two to three reloads..Unfortunately the Rhino-Tuff is terrible in its prime function - cutting grass. When the strings hit grass, all pivot away instead of cutting through. They bunch together and knock the grass down in a circle. The situation requires you to do a second, third, or fourth sweep with the weed whacker to complete the cut. As a result, it takes two to three times longer to do yard work. . . . The few cents savings on string are not enough to compensate for the extra time needed to trim grass..3. The Rhino-Tuff is not 100% compatible with all the grass trimmers in the market. The kit comes with three stainless steel nuts to attach the unit to the weed whacker. That is not enough to work with minor brands like Hitachi, Tanaka, or Stihl..I have a Hitachi CG 24EKS. I was able to attach the device by using one of the nuts from my Grass Gator 5600 kit and purchasing a steel washer with a 0.5 inch hole from Lowes..Given all the reasons listed above, the conclusion is obvious. Save your money and buy the Grass Gator 5600.
B001AHAJXK I hesitate to write an over the top gushing review because you might think I work for Pivotrim. I do not. I did not buy my Pivotrim on Amazon either. I just came hear to write a review that I hope influences you to make a smart decision.Four weeks ago I bought a Poulon bump-n-go 2 cycle gas trimmer and after the very first use I was really ready to just toss it in the garbage. Bump-n-go my butt.Today I installed a Pivotrim head. Took me eight minutes. Should have taken three minutes, but I was too macho to read the directions and be reminded that the bolt on the Poulon might be counter-threaded. Once I had that figured out I was in business. I trimmed all of my yard and most of the empty lot next door.I was actually trying to see if I could break the line! Finally succeeded when I got into some bamboo and small loose tree branches.I bought my Pivotrim in a store. I paid $20. No shipping, no handling. I love my Pivotrim and it saved my Poulon gas trimmer from the junk pile.You do not need to buy Pivotrim extra string. I have a big reel of string that I bought for $4. I'll just cut some to the right length and stick'em in my back pocket when I am trimming. I really does only take five seconds to load a fresh string.
B001AN7RGG Fill your Weber chimneyWeber 7416 Rapidfire Chimney Starterand place it over a lit cube. No bits of newspaper to blow around either. You will have charcoal ready in about 15-20 minutes. Done!
B001AN7RGG I have been starting fires for a long time. For my grills and smokers, I know that sentence makes me sound like a pyromaniac, but I am not.  I normally use charcoal for the grills and smokers, sometimes I use wood chunks.  I do not use lighter fluid because I am not a big fan of the chemical tastes it imparts to the food.  Plus liquid lighter fluid is just plain blasphemous to any legitimate Master of the Grill.  We would rather boil a rack of ribs than use lighter fluid to start a grill.I normally used some newspaper at the bottom of my charcoal chimney.  It works great 90% of the time.  Except that 10% of the time when it is pretty windy outside.  Then the burning paper ash blows around and lands on my wood deck.  No bueno.  And there was no way I would consider not grilling a juicy steak just because it is windy outside.  Then I tried these fire starter cubes and they work great in the chimney too.  I put in some coals, then the fire starter, light it, then add more coals.  Works great and no paper ash blowing around.The reason I started using these fire starters was because I finally elevated myself grilling/smoking to the next level and got a Big Green Egg, and everyone who has one recommends starting your charcoal with these fire starters.  I had wanted an egg for many years, but they are expensive, and seriously, are they really even worth the extra money.  Turns out they are worth it.  On my third smoking session with the egg I cooked a packer brisket for 15 hours in single digit weather.  Without a doubt it was the best brisket I have ever cooked, and the egg holds temperature like a champ!Starting the egg with these fre starters is very easy.  I fill the fire ring with charcoal then make a small depression in the coals and place half of a fire starter in that depression.  I light the fire starter, let it burn for about 20 seconds, then push some larger chunks of charcoal over it and in minutes my egg is light and i can start adjusting the temperature.  I let the temp steady out for about ten minutes to stabilize everything and to burn off the rest of the fire starter, and then I am ready to start cooking.I highly recommend these.  I cannot believe I did not start using these years ago.
B001AN7RGG I was timid on these at first thinking I would still need paper or lighter fluid, and wow was I wrong, loaded my chimney up, lit one of these and BAM my lump charcoal (which is what any good pit master should use) was white hot in no time at all.
B001AN7RGG I use one cube to start the fire in the fireplace. It lasts about 15 minutes. Awesome product. Leaves no residue or smell. Highly recommended.****** Money saving tip*******HomeDepot sells these cubes for $3-4.
B001AN7RGG Really got my fire going fast. I use a chimney starter and this is perfect.
B001AN7RGG They beat dealing with news paper as getting ash everywhere.  They light up quickly and last long time. The price could be cheaper though. I've found them for about three bucks at a certain depot
B001AN7RGG These make BBQ lighting a breeze. Thrown under a chimney starter you know it will light every time no matter how windy.
B001AN7RGG In General, I simply use my newspaper to start fires in my Weber 7416 Rapidfire chimney Starter. The problem is, windy day, the whole getting burnt out newspaper before embarking on my patio and patio furniture. After reading the reviews this, I thought, they were worth a try. WOW! I used these for the first time since it was very windy outside today. A chimney Starter cube filled with coals underneath was all it took! These are exactly as I wanted and expected. In the calmer days, I'll stick to the newspaper.
B001AN7RGG These can be used for starting camp fires and kept in emergency kits for fire starting . They will burn while floating on water and light with a flint fire starter or match . (Just scrape a small amount of flakes or dust on top and strike the sparks into it and instant flame) I use about 1/4 cube and wood to start a fire in my Kelly Kettle and one cube by its self will heat a 2.5 pint kettle to the point of steaming . No doubt two would cause it to boil .  Cubes are large enough that they can be cut in sections and used to stretch them further .  My point is this is more than a charcoal starter and is the best you can buy at a great price .  This is one great product .Thought I would add I do use them in my Weber Chimney for charcoal and they work great . I also noticed one reviewer said they melted. I have never had one melt or run, and I've used many of them . I'm not sure they are using the same product .
B001AN7RGG Good to have these and able to get anytime as when we are at Home Depot/Lowes they don't always have.  We grill all year and these are good to start the Green Egg we have
B001AN7RGG These little cubes are so easy to use it should be illegal.Place one on a fireproof surface, light it and place your charcoal starter chimney on top.No chemical smells, burns clean and complete.I use these or the newspaper technique and lump charcoal because I want my meat to taste like meat instead of the chemicals in briquettes or the mineral spirits saturating the self lighting ones.
B001AN7RGG I have lit charcoal for my grills a few different ways over the years.  Now that I've tried a Weber chimney with these fire-starter cubes, it's the only way that I light charcoal these days.  One cube does the trick without making a mess, and there's no concern about adding a lighter fluid taste to my food.
B001AN7RGG This little things work great.  I love to grill on my Weber Charcoal Grill.  I hate lighter fluid, and dont want to mess with an electric starter.  I have a Weber Chimney Starter to get the coals going, which in my opinion is the only way to go.  I was originally using newspaper in the chimney which worked, but put off ugly black smoke and left ashes flying in the wind.  Decided to try these for a better way to go.For $5 for a 24 pack, it works out to about 20 cents each.  These work great!  Light easily, and one cube will light a full chimney of Kingsford.  Very little smoke and no ashes!  Worked better than I ever expected, I would highly recommend these cubes.  Ran out once and ordered more, but wanted to grill that day.  Went and found other paraffin at the Lowes where you light the entire package with a small amount of paraffin in it, these did not work nearly as well.  Went back to these and have had zero complaints.These work so well we began using them to light campfires, as well, while camping.  Just build one in with the kindling and it has started the fire every time.  Easy to light and work like a charm!  Couldn't recommend them more, and they are not expensive at all....
B001AN7RGG Love these little things, easy to use, just light and place under Chimney Starter. After 10 to 15 minutes you'll good to go. One cheap pricey that has 26 or so burns.
B001AN7RGG Makes getting your charcoal to light easy, even on a windy day. Would recommend these to everyone trying to start a campfire too.
B001AN7RGG I used these and they did the trick. Clean fast and simple. Put 1 or 2 cubes in under your Chimney Starter (mine is a Weber) and light. Done. Cleaner than newspaper and left no foul taste to the food. Will get these again.
B001AN7RGG I buy the 24 pack regularly at Home Depot or OSH for just over $3.Great for starting your chimney full of briquettes or any other fire.  I have a wood fired oven and use these all the time for that as well,  It only takes one cube and there's no sooty ash as with newspaper and no chemical smell as with lighter fluid.
B001AN7RGG Not much to say except they work great for starting the coal for a Weber Rapidfire chimney. I will use these for now on instead of newspaper.
B001AN7RGG I use these with my chimney starter to light my charcoal and there is nothing better. Leaves no smell on the charcoal like lighter fluid and is safer. I use one cube under my chimney starter and 20 or so minutes later I spread my charcoal and start cooking. Great product and cheap.
B001AN7RGG The way they are pictured, it seems simple to just place them individually and light them. In fact, they come in one 6-cube by 4-cube mass of cubes. Each cube is attached to at least three other cubes by the plastic cut that surrounds each cube. Also, each cube has a aluminum foil on top of it to seal the flammable material in the plastic cup.The first challenge is how to separate them. They do not just pull apart. I cut mine with a scissors, which resulted in small pieces of the flammable material all over my counter. Then I wondered, do I remove the foil? Is the plastic cup flammable? There are no answers to these questions on the packaging.That precedes the question of how to ignite the cubes once charcoal has been stacked on top of them. There are three answers to that question, a long fireplace match, a propane torch or charcoal lighter fluid.  My choice was the latter and viola, instant flames, and assumed Weber lighter cube ignition.What seems simple when reading the sales literature is in fact, not simple at all. And if you are using a chimney starter to light your charcoal, the problem will be magnified, although you could probably put charcoal in the chimney, hold it over your head to be able to see the cubes and ignite them with a butane lighter. (I would not recommend using this procedure if you would need to use lighter fluid to ignite the Weber cubes - unless there is a shower nearby with plenty of soap and water available.)
B001AN7RGG One of the things I've always hated about grilling is how long it takes the coals to be ready to grill. These cubes get the party started quicker!The first time I used these cubes with my Weber briquet holders, I used 1 cube per holder full of charcoal, but later discovered that just 1 cube will do the trick for my 18 1/2 Weber kettle as long as the briquet holders are close enough to one another for the fire to jump to the other bin of charcoal.I hate using lighter fluid, especially the smell, and I detected no smell from these cubes burning. The product page says they are even safe to burn indoors. Weber lists them as non-toxic.The small cubes come in a little plastic \"ice cube tray\" with foil covering the cubes. At first, I found it a little tricky to peel back the foil and pop just one cube out, but mastered that pretty quickly.These cubes really made my Memorial Day barbeque a breeze. My friends and I spent the  morning at the beach and were going to have the cookout after returning home. While they were showering, I got the burger patties made, the grill lit and the dogs and burgers cooked. When my friends came back, everything was ready and the table was set--they were amazed!Quicker, cleaner, less smelly grilling...I'm sold!
B001AN7RGG I have used starters for years in my wood stoves and could probably have used them to start my natural charcoals in my grill&#8230; but I needed an add-on to get to the free shipping. These are pretty nice and it only takes one to get my small Smokey Joe going strong. Not much you can say about a starter but it seems a lot better than imparting a petroleum flavor into my cooking by using a starter fluid&#8230; each to their own. It works so it gets 5-stars.
B001AN7RGG I normally just used long neck lighters, but these things are great. You can light one and then grab it with the tongs and use it to light the fire. It normally produces and 6&#34;+ flame so you can set it under the grate in the fireplace.
B001AN7RGG Good product.  Quality item at a great price.  Don't waste time or money....  This is a good way to go.  Saves time and doesn't make a mess.
B001AN7RGG I use them for when I am camping.  I use half of one cube for my Weber Go-Anywhere under a chimney starter.  Camping in December in the mountains, the fire started immediately and the charcoal was flaming in just a few minutes.I also put them in an emergency kit.  I used a striker emergency lighter on a test run and it lit up fine after a few tries.  The trick I found is to shave some little pieces off to aid in ignition.
B001AN7RGG It's so pleasant to light charcoal and not have to put up with the lighter fluid scent. These take about twice the time to get the charcoal going but I guess there's always a trade-off! They work faster if you use a chimney starter.
B001AZJK46 Aunt's dog lapped it up and wanted more. It was a sweet treat for my aunt's dog and she was extremely happy when I had some doggie treats during the 4th July celebration BBQ party we had at our place.
B001AZJK46 This is an effective rat snap trap that can be reused over and over.Arguably, it is not the most humane way to deal with an infestation of rats, but it will definitely do the job. There is no guarantee that the rats that get caught in it will get hit in the head (beheaded, if you will). Often, the rat will be trapped with a paw, in which case they will be left to suffer in the trap. For this reason and for reasons of sanitation, check your traps regularly, and at least once daily.This might not be the most pleasant way to get rid of the rodents but it will definitely get the job done and is better than using poison that might affect pets and other wildlife.
B001AZJK46 Works wellMotomco Tomcat Rat Snap Trap 33525Category: Pest ControlI was a bit nervous about this trap.. but more nervous about the rat that decided to come raid my house without paying rent. Kinda rude ya know? Anyway this works as decribed.
B001AZJK46 I found evidence of a rat in my attic and purchased one of these traps at Lowes.  Loaded it up with some peanut butter and left it where a rat had chewed on some boxes we had in the attic just above our garage.  Not two hours later, I just happened to be in the garage almost directly under the trap when I heard it fire and then a bunch of noise.  I knew two things... I had something... and it was dead yet.  I loaded up for battle, headlamp, gloves, eye protection and a respirator and pulled down the attic door/ladder not knowing what to expect when I poked my head up.  Sure enough, there it was, with tail it was about 1 foot long and it's head was stuck in and trying to get out.  I grabbed the trap and took him outside and finished the job.  I would have rather not been involved in the killing process, but I'm happy that within two hours of setting the trap, I got my target.  I never expected it to work that quickly and can sleep in peace knowing there's not something chewing away at my possessions.I reset the trap in case he/she had friends, but so far it's been quiet.
B001AZJK46 These rat snap traps are designed to be easily set with bait and to reliably snap and kill the rat when the rat goes after the bait. While these are pretty good at functioning as designed (in my experience) this is a messy way to kill a rat. The snapping teeth will often cut and maim a rat without instantly killing it, and this is cruel to the rat and unpleasant for the person wishing to exterminate the rat. When this caught and killed a rat I just threw it away rather than trying to extricate the rat and clean the trap for reuse. For reusable traps I recommend the electronic ones, that will electrocute the rat when it goes in after the bait. Those electronic traps work well indoors but can't be used outdoors. With any trap it is important to bait it and place it properly, and to check it regularly. The Tomcat snap trap is fairly good at killing rats but not a clean, humane method. It is OK for some people but it's not my preference. I've tried multiple types of rat traps and none are perfect, so I would say it's important to consider the pros and cons of each design relative to what your specific needs are.
B001AZJK46 With apologies toUB40, I've got rats living in the ivy in my backyard (black rats, not Norway rats).  I wouldn't mind if they'd just stay in the ivy but they've developed a taste for my vegetable garden.  And since I can't get rid of the ivy (shared fence with lots of neighbors) I've tried just about everything I can think of.  Regular snap traps seem to be the best - or at least I have proof of a kill and I don't have to worry about the neighbor's dog or any owls eating poisoned rats.  And maybe they've just gotten a little too smart for me.  This trap is really easy to bait and set - much easier than the wooden ones - but I haven't caught a single rat in nearly a month.  I know they're there - I can see the damage they do - but I'd sure like to see them dead.  Or even just one or two once in a while.  Oh well, I don't have much choice except to keep trying.
B001AZJK46 Boy, this thing could certainly snap fingers if you're not careful. However, I think this would be safer and easier to use than one of those old fashioned wood rat traps. I love the smaller wooden ones for mice, but the larger ones for rats are just outright dangerous.  This snap trap seems to be a safer alternative while still being effective.  I like it, just hope I never have the need for it.  The suckers it catches would be huge.
B001AZJK46 These won't catch a mouse they are large. Think squirrel size. I would say anything from about 6-7&#34; and larger are gonna have trouble. Works well in the barn on the large rats.
B001AZJK46 This is a new treat for the rats that are living (for the time being) around me.I've had great results using Tomcat to get rid of the pests that show up each year and I'm ready for them this year!Thanks Tomcat!
B001AZJK46 We've tried just about all the traps out there - and basically, after tracking performance for about a year, the top performer in our warehouse was an old fashionedVictor Mouse TraporVictor Rat Trap.However, we had a trap-shy rat get inside the house. I was afraid it might be pregnant looking to nest (it *was*) and wanted to catch it quick before any pups were born. I tried D-Con poison only to learn that it could take up to 10 days for it to work, and I couldn't wait.I set several types of traps, including this one (I paid $4.98 at Lowes) since the bait cup is large & you can put anything in it. The rat initially came upstairs to seek out some large chunk dog food, and since it was trap-shy, I thought it would be best to bait it with something familiar (the dog food is too big/heavy for a traditional trap).After 8 days of eluding us, this method worked within 4 hours (I give as much credit to the bait as to the trap). But it did NOT kill - the neck was stuck between the teeth of the trap. In an old fashioned Victor trap, it snaps on the neck, not the head, which is instant & humane.This was in the kitchen, I was not home, and my wife was severely traumatized. It was flopping around everywhere, bleeding and contaminating *everything* in the kitchen, peeing and pooping everywhere. It's rear claws scratched up the cabinet doors. My wife had to lock up our dog & cats, who were curious but were in harms way. Awful, awful, awful. This was hours of cleanup, and it was terribly inhumane.With a few tweaks, this could be a superb trap. But it did not do the job, and this was just awful folks. It doesn't matter if it's in your living space, or a basement, attic, warehouse, garage, etc ... do you really want to spread blood, potential disease/tick/lice/etc everywhere?Ok, so here's our apples-to-apples comparison. 9-month experiment, testing 7 different products. We eradicated all the rats (11 total), and the oldest, simplest, cheapest trap is the clear winner:*Victor Old Fashioned Rat Trap- 7 (caught 7 of 11)* Tomcat Rat Snap - 1 (caught 1 of 11, but did NOT kill it)* D-Con Baitbits - Killed 3, but the bodies all ended up in a wall or floor, causing a HUGE stink and a HUGE mess to dig out. In one instance we had to remove part of a floor - took hours and cost hundreds of dollars. Given time, all the rodents may have eaten the bait, but the poison takes 3-10 days to take effect so it's hard to say. Poison has other problems - it gets spread around, it can be eaten by pets, or, a pet or wild animal might eat the dead/poisoned rodent. If you're going to use poison bait, we strongly recommend also using traps.*Victor Multi-Kill Electronic Mouse Trap- Zero (O). Left out for continuously for 9 months (270 days)*Tomcat Block Bait- Zero (0)* D-Con Rat Glue Traps - Zero (0) - This is an awful idea, just makes a mes. Avoid this!*Tomcat Wood Rat Trap- Zero (0), but the rat steals the bait every time. They do not snap. I whacked the trap with a broom handle and it still won't snap. Makes you wonder if the rat designed this one!Final note: If you need help placing your traps or learning about best baits, go to the Victor web site. Good information, quick & concise. My two cents on bait: any nut butter (peanut butter, etc) works great, mix in a small piece of bacon for good measure. However, if your rat came into your home/garage/building because they found a food source (like dog food, grain, etc), use that to bait your trap. Good luck!
B001AZJK46 I ordered this to place on the edge of my flower garden.  I have been having a problem with pesky chipmunks eating certain flowers, digging everywhere and just making a mess.  This trap works in getting rid of them.
B001AZJK46 i own several of these rat snap traps and they work pretty good. they helped me to get my mouse and rat problems under control in the past few months. i am glad that i tried them. i showed them to several neighbors and they in turn tried one of them. i am happy with this product.
B001AZJK46 Set these up at our business in the back because we thought we were having an issue with rats. Turns out, we didn't and we caught a mouse instead. Anyway, the mouse didn't suffer with this one because of the size, I'm thinking. You set this one up by either squeezing it or stepping on the back of it. It doesn't set off too easily, which is good because I had to move it a couple times and it didn't spring shut. So anyway, it works great as far as I can tell and the mouse wasn't alive after being caught... But not sure how great it will be for an actual rat- though I'm sure it will work fine. And the price is good for something so easily to rebait/reuse.
B001AZJK46 This is a great rat trap.  It's almost exactly like the everyday, large spring-loaded mousetrap type of rat trap, but very easy to set and with much less risk of setting it off on your hands (which, admittedly is easy to avoid, but you do hear stories of people breaking their fingers).  Also great is that you can dispose of anything caught without even touching it, and then just place the trap again with one hand or even your foot.
B001AZJK46 I've used or at least tested several traps, and this is definitely the most effective one.  The apartment complex where I live has a large garden, and rats do occur at times.  This trap used with peanut butter as bait works and kills immediately, so this is the one I most heartily recommend.
B001AZJK46 I am sorry to hear of the malfunctions other reviewers have experienced. I bought one at the local Tractor Supply store and it has been a repeat performer. If it had notches like cowpokes used to put on their guns for kills, there wouldn't be any of the hard black plastic left. One time it got three mice at once. Only once have I had the most unpleasant chore of putting a cute little mouse out of its misery because just its paws got caught. (Horrible, horrible, still lives painfully in my memory.) Most of the time this trap has been perfectly effective. Well, until this last pair of tiny mice that has moved in and can clean the peanut butter out of the little container without tripping the plate. Also twice they have taken the container itself and I have been able to hear them working on it under the dryer, grrrr. Gotta do something cuz if this pair reproduces, which is guaranteed, there may be even more intelligent unwanted inhabitants chewing up my extension cords and competing for food. I think the problem is - based on the miniscule droppings - that these adult mice are so small that their weight is inadequate to trip the plate. Sooooo.... off to Tractor Supply to get the mouse variety of this rat-sized trap.
B001AZJK46 Several reviewers have reported problems with this trap, such as the trap not being strong enough to actually kill the rat.  I wonder how many times this happened to each of these reviewers before they concluded the trap doesn't work properly.  No trap works perfectly every time, but I've had a lot of experience with rat traps, and I can assure you this one works better than most.I've deployed six different types of traps: two types of glue traps, the old standby classic by Victor, a knock-off of the Victor, an elaborate and beautifully designed, Japanese-made cage to trap them alive, a second kind of live trap, and the Tomcat.  I've caught quite a few rats, so I can claim a little expertise on this subject.As I said, no trap will work perfectly every time in every situation, or they wouldn't have invented so many different types--we'd all just use the classic wood-and-metal type, which doesn't cost very much, and be happy and rat-free.  Each has its purpose--except for some that in my experience don't work: I haven't caught a single rat in the cheap Victor-type knock-off.  In all of the others, I have, but the Tomcat has been the most successful.  So I assure you, it does work, at least when I've use peanut butter as bait.Second, it it easy to set.  No need for worries about getting your fingers caught (and some of these traps can inflict some real pain). Once the trap is cocked open, it stays open; you don't have to be super-careful every time you get within two feet of it for fear it's going to snap.  The bait is inserted into a removable little tube, so you can take the tube out, put in the bait, put it back in without setting the trap, or even while the trap is already set, without a problem.Third, being plastic, it doesn't rot or get very rusty outside; the Victors do both eventually. You can even wash it once in a while, which is probably a good idea if you catch rats in it. (There's a spring in the Tomcat that does rust, but very slowly.)Fourth, it's reasonably priced, and unlike glue traps, it's endlessly reusable, doesn't catch any and all living things (bugs, frogs, roaches, lizards, whatever) that may wander across it, or present you with a glued living rat you have to get rid of.I did have one rat that got caught by the leg, and it was not a happy situation, least of all for the rat, which I put out of its misery.  But the same thing happens with every kind of snap trap once in a while.  As for the spring not being strong enough, tell that to the many rats that have been killed instantly in my Tomcat.
B001AZJK46 This winter was terrible for everything - plants, animals, and apparently rodents as well. Bought this after finding rat droppings in our shed (must have made this his house after our -15 degree weather!), and within a week we successfully killed a bigger rat than I thought could exist! One word of the wise - while we didn't run into this issue, this trap closes on anything that touches it just right - and that includes dog tongues/faces. Make sure if you have this to keep it out of reach of fido or he'll have a not-so-nice surprise and you'll have an outrageous vet bill!
B001AZJK46 This item is really easy to use. It sets up quickly and it has a removable bait tray. I have yet to catch a rat or mouse but it was easy to position along a fence in my yard. I have little doubt if a rat comes along it will work. I give this 5 stars as it is reusable, very easy to use and built to last.
B001AZJK46 If you have huge Norway rats, like we get occasionally (we live on a dairy farm) than these traps my be too small to kill as fast as they would on smaller rats. We love the ease of setting these, plus the ease of body disposal after the kill.
B001AZJK46 This trap is easy to set. Just unscrew the bottom for the bait, press down clamp and you're set. Made of hard plastic, very durable. Great trap for rats and small critters.
B001AZJK46 I admit to being a softy when it comes to killing any animal, even rats and mice, but there are times that it has to be done. I tried using live-catch traps but they did not work for me.  I have use the traditional wood and steel traps but they did not seem to be very effective, kind of hit or miss.I own several of these traps and they do the job.  I have caught a couple of big rats in the backyard and they have always had their head caught in the trap and passed away quickly.  The traps are easy to set and the bait can be accessed from the bottom of the trap.  I use either peanut butter or cheese and that seems to work well.  If I had rats caught but still alive I think that I would not use these anymore but so for that has not been an issue for me.
B001AZJK46 The best way for me to evaluate this trap is to compare it against the venerable wooden Victor type trap . . . the one that's been around forever, and I have used and am quite familiar with.The traditional wooden trap WORKS, but has two drawbacks:1.  Very touchy to set and then put in place.  Jarring or improper setting of the trip bar can result in an unexpected trip (and possibly broken fingers).  This Tomcat Rat Snap Trap is super easy and safe to set.  Use hand or foot to depress the set pedal down until it clicks.  Bait is inserted via the bottom using the removable bait cup.  You never have to put your digits in the kill zone.2. With the old-fashioned wooden type trap, there is the possibility of the rat approaching the bait from the reverse side of the trap.  This can cause the rat to be tossed clear and result in a \"non-catch\".  You can bet the sly rodent will now be trap-shy.  With the Tomcat, the rat can only approach from the \"business-end\" of the trap (front or sides), resulting in a reliable catch/kill.  In the case of a capture but non-kill, the Tomcat's interlocking teeth are more effective that the old smooth metal bar at preventing withdrawal and escape.A well thought-out and effective trap.  More expensive than the traditional wooden ones, but the cost is justified, I think, by the superior design and performance of this Motomco Tomcat Rat Snap Trap.  Can be used over and over for years.  I really like it.
B001B091RG It is still early for planting in the ground, but when my granddaughter was here I wanted to have her help start my garden. We used theJiffy 5032 Professional Greenhouse 25-Plant Starter Kitand had a lot of fun starting the seeds. However the pellets in the greenhouse are wonderful for starting the seeds, but my plants are quickly outgrowing it,, and the planting date is still four weeks away!Voila peat pots. I purchased two sizes of these and filled them withJiffy 5605 Seed Starting Mix - 4 Quart Bag. I buried the pellets with the seedlings in the soil, then watered from the top and the bottom till the peat pots were fully moist. It actually took a couple of days for the moisture from the bottom to be fully absorbed to the top.But all of my seedlings are thriving in this new environment!Since these are available locally, I suggest you check prices to get the best deal.
B001B091RG I ordered these pots on a whim just to see if they would work. They did I started all of my tomato plants and they all are doing fine. Even the ones that I have not planted in the garden yet.
B001B091RG These Jiffy pots are exactly what they claim to be. They are small so be mindful of size when ordering, but they are great.Transplant shock? HAHAHAHA I don't think so!
B001B091RG Nice little pots. They were here fast and they are in perfect condition. Makes transplanting a snap without disturbing the spouts.
B001B091RG Don't get me wrong, these containers are nice for transplanting starter plants from a greenhouse kit into the garden, but don't expect the peat container to dissolve any time soon. My suggestion would be to cut some slits in the bottom and side before you transplant these into your garden or container so the roots can actually leave the container.
B001B1KGCO I love all Terro products.  My experience thus far has been inside the house.  At one time the house was invaded by little tiny sugar ants.  No more.  So outside I noticed swarming of ants in different locations in the landscaping.  I also noticed that when it rained carpenter ants would come out of certain cracks near the foundation.  So I got the Terro 901 Ant Killer shaker bag.  We'll see in the coming months if it can eliminate the ant problem near the house.  As far as application goes, the bag is designed to spread the ant killer from the bag.  You don't need a spreader.  That is so convenient.I will post in a month or so and report how my ant population is doing.  I have high hopes, however, because Terro has so far not let me down.
B001B1KGCO I have tried many formulas in my arsenal on the never ending battle to see just who territory this is.But nothing else seems as efficient as \"Terro 901 Ant Killer.\" It works as a preventer but I prefer to drop it on their little heads and see that they have checked out the next day. I wait for them to pop up. The only place I use it as a preventer is a small trench between the patio and the external brick wall.Even if Terro was not that good, the packaging design with the \"Shaker Bag\" is a fantastic and very useful design. Standard spreaders have two problems, accuracy and wind. Water based products are too much trouble and I am not sure of their potential. However I do water this stuff immediately in most cases.I know this is designed for all kinds of bugs but mi target is \"Them!\"Them!
B001B1KGCO This is  a handy way to apply ant killer. I opened up the zip-lock bag and shook out some granules on an ant hill near our back door and lightly watered it down (as per directions). The ants were dead the next day and haven't returned. I like this application for the convenient application and packaging. It is kind of like a huge salt shaker with a zip-lock top with a handle on the bottom to shake the granules out easy and fast.
B001B1KGCO I use this in conjunction with the Terro Ant Bait and so far it seems to have done a good job of keeping the ants out. Though we use a commercial PCO, we still find ourselves in a constant battle to keep ants away. This treatment has been a nice addition to our defense and seems to work well if you are careful when you apply it and keep it close to the house. Any developing mounds that you put this on dry up within days. Easy to apply and good stuff.
B001B1KGCO Fire ants are major pests here in the warmer climates and I have relied on several different store- purchased treatments to attack the mounds and get the problem under control. Terro 901 Ant Killer is my latest in an ongoing and never- ending battle with these pesky little creatures and it has proven effective for my needs.This product comes in an easy to use shaker bag and the manufacturer recommends spreading it around the perimeter of your home to keep the little buggers at bay. This is a good idea, but you have to be very careful to spread a very thin strip if you want the product to last. Start spreading too wide of a strip and you will run out of product. You need to keep it under control or, if preferred, use it to spot- kill ants still in the mound. This is how I decided to use the product and I have had good results. You have to water it in, but it goes to work quickly. Ants slowly start to appear moments after the treatment is applied, scurrying for dear life. But they won't get far, as a product like this sends them to their grave in minutes.Those who use this product to treat the perimeter of their home may run into some challenges. Besides possibly running out of product, another problem may result if the edges of your home are covered with mulch. If they are, then the mulch will have to be raked back, away from the home, so that the product can be applied directly to the dirt. This is part of the reason why I didn't use my bag for this purpose. That and, as mentioned above, I just don't think there is enough here to treat a home of my size effectively. It would require spreading it too thin to work, or else having to purchase more product to finish the job.The fight against fire ants and other insects is never completely won, but you can at least keep these annoying pests controlled with the right product. Terro 901 Ant Killer does work reasonably well when applied directly to an ant mound, killing them quickly. I could see how it could get frustrating when used in other ways, but its performance for spot treating is good and for that purpose, it deserves a recommendation.
B001B1KGCO Well, we used this product as directed and the ants seem to have disappeared from the yard... but possibly relocated to the neighbor's yard. An anthill showed up on their property (just over the line of where we were treating) just a week after we started using this product. So, yeah! No more ants for us- but did it kill enough of them or did they simply relocate because of the treatment, I don't know. We will continue to use for another week and see if they move further away or disappear. It can take a few treatments to get rid of a large colony like we had (they lived next to and under the driveway as evidenced by coming up through the cracks).
B001B1KGCO I have had a running battle with a nest of big red fire ants that's been going on for about 10 yrs or so. I've tried everything I can get my hands on to kill out this nest. I gave it a good treatment of this stuff and watered it in like it said. It did kill several but the nest is still working away like ants do. These are some smart ants that's for sure! I can stand a few feet away from the nest and they will ignore me. Till I reach out and shake some of this down on them! Then they literally start charging right at me until I retreat at least 15 to 20 feet away from the nest. Then they start carrying this stuff away. They pick up all they can and will put it in a small area about 6' to 8' away. Those that carry it die and then others put the dead with the poison and then they stay well away from the area where they put it. I've dug into the nest with a shovel turning all the dirt over down the length of the shovel's blade and out to a circle about 8' across. Then sprinkled & sprayed every ant killer and bug killer I could find on it and turned that into the dirt too before finally soaking it pretty good with the hose. And tell you what, doing that without getting a bunch of them crawling up my legs wasn't easy! Thought that would have finally killed them out. Wrong! Nest is still working away with what looks like several thousand ants gathering food and taking it to the nest. I fallowed a stream of ants one day. It was like a ant Freeway with at least 20 or more for each foot of travel. The line of ants went around the end of my trailer, up along the fence line between me and my neighbor and into a stand of tall grass that is at least 120' to 130' away from the nest. I've never seen them travel so far or so many of them doing it.Any who, I'm going to try this again later today after it cools down a little this evening. Sooner or later I'll have to put a dent in the nest's population. But so far, nothing has done much to it. I even tried plain gasoline and a couple pounds of salt that I use for melting the ice. Tried \"salting the earth\" which is supposed to kill anything that tries to live or grow on the area. It didn't work either.
B001B1KGCO We had large colonies of ants in our flower bed mulch in several different locations and in the mulch around some of our trees and they started to climb up the side of our house and find their way into our basement. I had tried several different insect sprays that have provided some relief but none of the worked quite as well or lasted as long as this Ant Killer. All you have to do is open the bag and turn it upside down and hold it by the handle. Then you walk along the perimeter of your house and shake the bag. The bag has a built in spreader so too much won't come out at once. This bag contains 3 pounds of Ant Killer pellets and it was just enough to make about a 5 foot wide barrier around our entire house. The barrier was really effective and I haven't seen any sign of Ants for quite some time. I think this is a very good value when you consider the amount of Ant Killer that you receive and how effective that it is. I would definitely use it again.
B001B1KGCO Found this to be very easy to use and am happy with this product.Pros:1) Just tear the bag open and sprinkle in areas needed in the yard.2) It seems to last a long time.3) Covers a fairly large area.4) Ants are now gone!
B001B1KGCO worst fire ant killer ever bought in entire life. I applied to over six large fire ant hills and it did absolutely nothing at all, even when applied tons of it and few days later, still nothing, if anything mounds got even larger. will not buy again. I called customer service phone number on bag and lady sounded like an idiot. She said she will note to her managers that the product doesn't work on fire ants. thanks alot retard. will never buy again. total waste of money.
B001B1KGCO After applying this around my home, I haven't noticed any crawlers in my house.  It has definitely helped with the ants, but for the other bugs listed, how will you know if you never see them?  :)  Anyway, I poured the bag around the foundation of my home (which is river rock) in the grass and bark that is also around the home.So far so good.
B001B1KGCO I'm very pleased with the Terro Ant Kilelr. I started out the spring with ants in my kitchen. I followed the manufacturers directions and used this around the perimeter of my home and now there are no more ants in my kitchen spoiling my cooking! I didn't use the shaker bag but instead used the product in a spreader and that worked fine.
B001B1KGCO This particular Terro Ant Killer in the shaker bag is obviously not meant for indoor use.  In the spring I usually set out those small ant traps here and there and that seems to do the trick.  I wanted to try this because I had a rather large and annoying infestation of ants on a small section of my lawn that seemed to keep growing.  I simply applied about an eighth of a cup to the area after watering it (a guesstimate).  A check a few days later shows the colony had moved.  Mind you, I only did a spot treatment and didn't use this around the periphery of my house.Prior to application I watered the area and then again after I watered it again.  I didn't see any ants scrambling to grab the granules, but rather they seemed to be more interested in leaving town.  The reason I was interested in spot treatment was because the area seemed to be growing a bit and every time I mowed the lawn I'd end up carrying a few around on my sneakers for a while.  No, I don't like using pesticides (in fact I hate it), but perhaps because of the rainy weather it's perfect for insects around the house.There are several cautionary notes right on the bag, but perhaps the best thing is for anyone wanting to buy Terro Ant Killer is to do a little research before purchasing.  If you have large infestations I might suggest going the exterminator route.  For my spot treatment it was just the ticket.  On the website it has addition information, including information about fire ants.Controlling Fire Ants:\"To control fire ants, apply  cup of ant killer granules over and around each fire ant mound. Immediately following application, water the product in completely, applying a minimum of one gallon of water to each mound area. To prevent the disturbance of the fire ants, water gently.  The use of a high pressure hose may disturb the ants and cause migration, reducing the product's effectiveness. For best results, apply in cool weather between 65 and 80, or in early morning or late evening hours.\"
B001B1KGCO Let me start by saying that I love the design of the bag. Using the bag as a shaker is brilliant. I used this around the outside of my house, then I sprayed it down with the hose. I didn't see a reduction in the amount of ants that were outside until a couple of days passed. I then noticed that there were less after the first rain fall. So I think making sure that you really soak this is the key here. I also use the liquid bates for inside my house, but I haven't needed to use them yet this year, so maybe it has to do with using this outside my house this year.
B001B1KGCO Before you use this product, you need to read the instructions very carefully to get the results you want and avoid environmental contamination. One package is just about right to do the perimeter of a 3- to 4- bedroom house, treating 5' x 200' space. The application looks easy enough. Unzip and open package to expose the shaker. Hold bag by the bottom hand and distribute around your house from the foundation out to 5' away; the problem: if you finish the bag too soon, you know you put out too much. Unlike a fertilizer spreader there is no way to judge speed of distribution.One particular concern I have--and it could explain why some folks get poor results with this--is that you are to rake back the mulch to apply this product. My house is lined with flower beds, so that means I have to remove the mulch apply the product and put the mulch back again, if I want mulched beds. After I got done reading the instructions for this product, I decided it may be more expensive, but much, much less time intensive to call an exterminator!So for those who don't mind extensive prep and careful application, this could be a real money saver. As for me, next time, I'll call the exterminator.
B001B1KGCO Every year it is the same thing. I do battle with the ants in the bathroom, in the kitchen, and in the mailbox. Terro ant traps inside, this ant killer around the perimeter where the dogs don't go, and ant spray in the mailbox.Then I do not see any ants.Then my peony bushes are all full of tightly glued together peony flowers that will not bloom if the ants don't eat the sappy stuff that keeps the flowers closed. Then I feel guilty for killing the ants and worried that my peonies will never bloom and it's all my fault. But enough ants work on the peonies, they bloom and look beautiful for 1 day. Then a thunderstorm comes and the peony bush flops all to heck and the petals all fall off.Anyways, this product kills ants.
B001B1KGCO Anybody attempting to do their own exterminating with only one product is like a plumber trying to do his job with only one tool: a screwdriver.There are at least a dozen different types of ants in most regions and some require different types of treatments. There are sugar ants and protein ants each requires a different bait.  Many ants march in trails 50 to 60 feet from their mound or bed.One year, I sprayed ant trails all summer long and couldn't find the bed. That fall, I moved a whiskey barrel planter located 60 feet from the house and discovered a huge bed underneath.I've been doing my own exterminating for 30 years. It took me 10 years to get it right.Professional exterminators will tell you that DIY methods are ineffective. That's not true. It can be done. Granted, licensed exterminators have access to certain chemicals that homeowners do not. Even so, it is possible with the available chemicals if applied correctly.The most common way to see an ant die immediately is to stomp it or spray it with poison. While you are stomping or searching for a can of spray, the queen has laid a dozen more eggs.We live on a heavily-wood hilltop in the middle of 10 acres surrounded by pastures where fire ants and many other kinds of ants thrive. There are many kinds of invading ants and they have different diets, characteristics and preferred environments.Save yourself a bundle of money. Over the past 30 years, I've saved $21,000.00 based on a savings of $700.00 a year less than the professional companies charge my friends and relatives for a termite contract.In the foundation holes of my house, I use plain boric acid powder available at most dollar stores. The 2-pound squeeze bottle is what I use. It's cost about $4.00. It is cheap and effective. Cut the top off the spot and generously squeeze it in. It lasts for years killing ants, roaches and other invading insects.Most white power advertised as ant and roach power is nothing more than plain boric acid.Around the outside of the foundation, I apply Ortho Home Defense Max Termite and Destructive Bug Killer double strength at 3 ounces per gallon instead of the 1.5 recommended. Initially, I did this 2 years in a row. This is a liquid concentrate formula. 32 ounces makes 10.6 gallons of double strength mixture, costs about $40.00 and lasts up to 5 years. I apply every 3 years.The EPA banned Chlorodane in 1988. Chlorodane was effective for 35 years. Since 1988, Ortho Home Defense Max Termite and Destructive Bug Killer is the best termite protection the unlicensed consumer can buy.Once a year, with a spreader, I apply a granular, broad spectrum insect killer in a 50-foot perimeter around the house that has 3-month control and does not have to be watered in.For treating a small perimeter or spot treating, Terro 901 Ant Killer Plus does work well but it must be watered in after treatment and the correct amount applied. The effective life is only 8 weeks.  The shaker bag makes spot treating easy but dragging a water hose or water can around is the hard part.The next step is where the Terro Bait comes in. I've used Terro Bait for several years as my choice of bait for sugar ants. It works. The problem is that ant's taste buds change with the seasons.  I've heard people say, \"The bait is no longer working.\"  The solution is simple.  Offer a choice of baits that attracts both sugar and protein ants. I don't want to attract ants near my home. I want to kill them before they get near. I place the bait beyond the perimeter of the granular poison. When the ants halt their march at the perimeter, I offer them a picnic until they decide where to go next. They will crawl all over the bait for about 2 weeks. That's about how long it takes for the workers to get the boric acid into the mound and feed the queen her last supper.My personal recipe for sugar ants in large quantities is 3 cups of sugar, 2 ounces of honey, 4 cups of boiling water and 1 ounce of boric acid.  Stir until mixture has completely dissolved and allow to cool. This mixture will also eliminate any yellow jacket problem.For protein ants, I use creamy peanut butter instead of sugar.WARNING: Please be careful to place liquid baits where no birds or animals can get to your trap. I cover mine with 1/2\" mesh hardware cloth weighted with a rock or brick on top.  Place where rain water will not weaken formula and sun will not quickly evaporate.Check out what an exterminator charges for a contract and know that you can do it yourself for 25% of the quote...and in most cases...get far better results.Check out what exterminators charge for burying those little \"green\" plastic traps all around a house and monitoring them every month. I've known more than one homeowner protected by this \"environment friendly\" method to suffer termite damage. Granted, the contract requires the exterminating company to make the repairs. Yet still, there's all the turmoil of the construction workers, the mess and inconvenience to deal with. I've seen this happen a few times. It's a pain.Some homeowners have their exterminator visit twice a month during the warm months. They have to keep coming back because they only spray where the homeowner tells them to spray.If the job was done right the first time, they'd only have to make one trip a year...but the exterminators wouldn't make nearly as much money either.Don't take the bait unless you don't have a choice.
B001B1KGCO These bags open at the top (carefully) and then there is an inner mesh with holes in it so as you pour or shack the open bag over the area to be treated, the mesh helps you not pour too fast, and it creates a sprinkling effect to disburse the dry granules evenly.  I used some of this on some large ants, earwigs, and other insects that had infected some old wood.  I know that's what insects do, but the area was close to a swing set, the wood was a tall post holding a bird house, and I just didn't want all those nasty things around.  One treatment, and they disappeared.  I also put this around the outside of our house to create a perimeter a few feet wide, but with all the plants and wood chips, I still see earwigs from time to time so this stuff is not perfect.
B001B1KGCO I had gotten some new mulch spread around the house and flower beds.  I wanted something to kill the ants if any came travelling in the mulch.  This product was easy to spread, you just sprinkle and go.  However, within a day we had ants everywhere.  I don't even know if the mulch had ants in it but after using this product I had ants coming and going.  They were in the house, on the countertops, going back and forth across the deck.  They were under the bathroom sink for goodness sake, in and out of the dogfood bowl, up and down the walls.  I can't say enough but we had ants everywhere.  So I guess if they product works depends upon your definition of effective? Did it get rid of the ants from the mulch? Yep! But it didn't kill them they just went berserk. It has cost me a fortune for using this product because now I've got borax and chemicals all over my pantry and countertops to actually kill the ants that are now all inside my house.  I think it ran in ants that were quite content living in the ground OUTSIDE my house. Be forewarned.
B001B1KGCO The ants have been terrible this year, with all the rain we have had in the Northeast. This product does not seem to be doing very much to stop them; perhaps the sheer numbers are just too huge. However, my complaint is about the awkwardness of the shaker bag. It may be because I have small hands, but I can't seem to get the right \"shake\" going. I wind up with too much in one spot and not enough in another. By the time I worked on my technique a bit, the bag was empty.
B001B1KGCO This product contains the same pesticide that many professionals use but without the professional application cost.  It eliminated the last of the ant infestation in our kitchen that non-toxic alternatives we used inside had only reduced.Just zip the bag open, break the new seal exposing the perforated shaker, invert the bag and shake the particles next to the foundation of your home.  Remarkably, little pesticide comes out until the bag is shaken, making it easy to apply evenly without clumping and spills.  Then water the particles to release a toxic shield that prevents further insect infestation.The zip top easily reseals the bag, keeping the remaining pesticide fresh and dry for additional applications.  This is the simplest, least messy ant poison that I've ever used and it's effective.  Rain doesn't quickly wash away its potency and this bag should treat the entire perimeter of an average sized house if necessary.
B001B1KGCO I have an on going battle with those annoying teeny little ants that can smell a tiny crumb from miles away. It took alot of trial an error to rid myself of them, but Terro helped me do it. I was able to find the entrance to several ant beds and liberally put the granules all around, within in about the next 10 days I noticed very, very little ant activity. Before putting out the granules, the area was like Grand Central Station. I still had some issues though, I'm assuming from beds I didn't find. I bought some Ortho Max and use the spray inside when I notice ants coming in and all around the outside of the house. The combination of Terro and the Ortho Max spray and finally rid me of the pesky ants. The granules work best if you know where the nests are. I noticed granules I put in other areas where there were not obvious nests didn't seem to be touched, but putting them where I knew the ants lived or on paths they traveled, they granules became noticeably less and less. I can't say the granules totally solved my problem but in combination with the Ortho spray I am happily ant free.
B001B1KGCO Good ant killer for red ants and black ants alike.  Strange thing is, I do not like the shaker bag at all.  It is especially not useful for me because the ant hills we have are tiny and the shaker bag spreads the nodules in too many directions.  So even though I thought the shaker bag would be convenient, it is not for me.  But good quality ant killer--remember that part!
B001B1KGCO I have used similar plastic shaker containers and liquid sprays around the outside perimeter of my previous and current homes. You need to follow the instructions carefully, these call for water the shaken pellets after deploying them, and also calls for removing leaves and vegetation in the treated region. I did the former, but was by no means complete on the latter process. Treatment seems pretty effective, though by no means a magic bullet. Needs to be repeated a couple of times each summer season (in the upper midwest). I do not use anything indoors in parallel with this.
B001B1KGCO I'm still trying to decide just how well this works. I have ants already in my house (old, old house), so until these begin to die off, I will still see some ants. However, I'm confident that it's at work to prevent new colonies from moving in. I really wish there was some way to use this inside to get rid of the carpenter ants that already live here!This is convenient in the shaker style package. I loved that I didn't have to mix up spray. However, it's important to know that it has to be watered after application. Some might find this inconvenient. If you don't have a hose near where you apply, you will need to use a watering can. It says not to water until run-off and not to apply in the rain. However it says water brings the ants near the surface, to water is important. Sounds a little tricky to get the right amount of water. I'll admit, I cheated a little. It was about to rain, so I applied it. Then we had a gentle rain for an hour or so. I felt this was perfect. Sorry Terro. I'm a rule breaker. Sometimes.One thing that I couldn't figure out was what I should do on the deck and steps. I couldn't just sprinkle the deck that comes up to the house with this, but I wanted to get at the ants that I've seen there. I ended up sprinkling it along the house on the deck, then lightly hosing it off the deck in hopes it would go through the cracks to underneath. My stone steps were another story. I could see ants crawling near the door, but didn't want to put this on the stone steps. Maybe the ants on either side of the steps will haul enough home to kill the ones crawling on the steps.I think that Terro spray might be more effective in some areas around my house, but this was good for the grassy area around the foundation. My deck and stone steps might be better if treated by spray.I'm guessing for best protection it would be smart to have both a spray and this.
B001B1KGCO I've tried various ant poisons, and Terro is the only kind that worked.  This probably has a lot to do with my local ant population rather than Terro being the ideal solution in all cases, so I would not splurge on a massive amount right away.  This is the first time I've used a shaker bag, and I was impressed.  In the past, I've used a spreader, but the shaker actually works well for spot or perimeter treatment.  I would like longer-term treatment, but so far, Terro seems to be the best.
B001B1KGCO Every year we were having ants sneaking into our bathroom through the tiniest hole in the tile.  In spite of putting down multiple types of poison INSIDE, it wasn't until I tried the Terro Ant Killer that I noticed the lack of invaders.  So it definitely works great.As far as ease of application, I give it a huge 5 stars!  It is easy to shake out and simple to spray down and that is all it takes! Simple, easy to use, and works great. What more can you ask for?
B001B1KGCO This is the second Terro ant product I've used with less than mediocre results.  I had hoped the soak-in method this provided might have some better effect on the larger colonies, but they just moved a few feet away.The shaker bag really isn't useful.  It's just a perforate plastic sheet in the opening and it doesn't distribute the granules consistently.  It also dribbles so you're constantly flipping this bag up and down as you move from place to place.
B001B1KGCO Oh happy day I have not seen an ant in what seems like forever.  I don't know what it is about this house but the seem to congregate on our patio.Its very annoying,  plus the kids keep getting bit and that's no fun.  However after an easy application around the foundation of our house those ants are no where to be seen.This stuff is worth it,  so if you have an ant problem do yourself a favor and go pick some up.
B001B1KGCO The Amazon description says the product is .25% Permethrin, one of the best flea repellent and eradicators, yet the bag describes the active ingredient differently (Lambda-cyhalothrin). All I know is, my ants do better (worse) with Boron, but I was looking for a good way to treat my perimeter for fleas, and I think the shaker bag is the answer. My cat is indoor only and yet was able to acquire an infestation on the 2nd floor unit. Obviously this leads me to believe that the perimeter needs attention before flea season, and I think this shaker bag is just the ticket. Again, this is my opinion only, but based on others experience, and my research into pest control chemicals, I would say it is probably a mistake for Terro (a great name in ant control) to overemphasize this product as ant killer. I would bet money it is most effective as flea control.
B001B1KGCO Treating the perimeter of the house for ant is always a good idea, especially if one lives in a wooded area.  Over the years I have tried several products for ants and I think Terro Ant Killer is the best.What about it is the best?  The stuff works!  And it is easy to apply.  It comes in a bag that has a screen with holes so one just has to turn the bag upside down and shake gently to apply.  The years I used this product, I didn't have to treat the whole house again (some other products just didn't cut it and I had to reapply the whole perimeter in just a week or two).  Of all the products I have had, I have had the best luck with Terro.For a 1200 square foot house footprint, I recommend using at least two bags.  While some think using just enough to do the job and no more, I don't hesitate in using a little more.I would recommend using this before you notice ants in the house.  So once it starts to warm up, it isn't a bad idea to treat the house.  Most of these types of products last about 3 months, so between spring and summer, you may have to treat twice.
B001B1KGCO Let me first comments on the brilliant design of the package, for spot treating, i.e. in \"flower beds\" of shrubs, flowers, etc around house foundations, this is the product design one needs to get insect poison to those difficult places where a rotary spreader or even hand spreader will not work well.  This product basically works like a huge salt shaker, and the granules are so light that the package can be handled with ease.Now to the carpenter ants: we had been having a problem with a lot of carpenter ants coming inside our house, from the trees in the yard, they come in not via the tree branches but from the ground.  I used this Terro shaker bag of ant killer, along the two sides of our house where the ants are known to have entered and both are \"flower beds\" full of shrubs and an AC unit.  Watered in the granules per the instructions, after a week, zero ants.  Matter of fact we saw only one ant inside after the granules were put out and that is amazing as we were finding upwards of 6 or more per day earlier.  I recommend this product for carpenter ants.
B001B1KGCO Terro has been my go-to brand for ant problems for years.  When I get ants in my kitchen, I useTERRO 1 oz Liquid Ant Killer ll  T100.Over the past several years, ants have been causing problems with my patio -- these are the garden variety of ants, not fire ants or anything worse.  Normally I have no problem with ants that are outdoors and not in my kitchen.  But they build such large colonies underneath my patio that the pavers are starting to settle unevenly as the ants dig out the sand beneath them.This makes it easy to shake over my patio pavers where I see ant mounds and get rid of the ants.  I haven't tried this on any of the other insects listed on the bag so I don't know how it would work with them.
B001B1KGCO This did little to slow the ant population.I feel doubly bad because I try to use as few pest products as possible, but am experiencing a LOT of them this year, from crawlies like ants to fungus on my grapes and apples.Using this was a last resort, but even so it made little difference. Sprinkled and watered, as directed, but not very effective, at least on my strain of ants.
B001B1KGCO There are usually numerous fire ant mounds in my horse pastures and all over my lawn in the summer. It has gotten so much worse over the last few years that I had vowed to do something about it. At the beginning of the summer I treated the visible nests, mounds, hills, whatever you want to call the forts from which the fire ants attack humans - just kidding, sort of. I should have remembered that treating the home of the ants will get rid of them by driving them down and over to another location unless you go deep with the treatment.So I was clipping a hedge in my front flowerbed when my legs started stinging horribly. I looked down and there were fire ants all over my legs and ankles, all the way up to the knees. I was standing in the middle of a mound the size of my kitchen table - about four feet in diameter. After swatting and smacking and dancing around and taking my shoes off and banging them on the ground, I got rid of the ants, but of course not before they had bitten me in about 20 or 30 places. The bites itched so badly I was nearly wild with a need to tear my skin off. The expected little blisters full of venom formed shortly after and I won't go into what I went through for two days after that.As the sun rose on the third day, I picked up my bag of Terro Ant Killer and, with a grim gleam in my eye, I made my way to the enemy lines. It was all over pretty quickly. I shook out the Terro and wet it down with the hose. The bag would have done a larger area, but I wanted it to saturate and go down as far as the ant tunnels reached so I used all 3 pounds of it. After a couple of days I was assured the mound was neutralized  and I have yet to see another eruption in the lawn, the pastures or the flower beds.Again, the key to fighting ants is to go deep. Just destroying the ones outside the nest or even a couple of inches down is only going to make them divide to conquer. Terro seems to do the job.
B001B1KGCO I got this shaker bag of ant killer to go with the ant baits I had already strategically placed around my beach house. I believe my house was built on an anthill because in the past there have been ants everywhere. We even had to have the siding replaced because carpenter ants got in the wood and wreaked havoc on the building. So far I haven't seen any ants at all since I spread this around the perimeter of the house. But I hadn't seen any for a couple of weeks prior due to the Terro Liquid Ant Baits I had already used. I'm hoping that when the ants eat all the delicious liquid in the baits, they will then move on to this granular ant killer for dessert. Whatever they decide to do I am pleased to think they will be doing somewhere other than around my house and yard. So far so good.
B001B1KGCO I do alot of pet sitting in rural areas and it never fails I come across fire Ant hills.  This works great on the fire ants and all other ants I have used it with. I have had a problem with small ants , the ones that emit an odor when you squash them! It works fast is easy to apply and  a good value. I applied  it following the package directions  and  it works great. You do have to use caution as to where you apply so domestic animals do not ingest it. I highly recommend!
B001B1KGCO We've had a major problem with ants in our flower beds and around our trees this year.  When disturbed, there are hundreds if not thousands crawling all over our foundation.  They're very pesty and we wanted them gone.  We were very happy to give this product a try.  We waited until we had a light rain on the way and applied this product.  2 weeks later you can't find an ant in the treated areas if you tried.  Love it!Using this product was very simple.  I love the \"Shaker Bag\".  It's design is great and very easy to use.  It's nice that it's resealable too so that you can use it again and again until it's gone.  This is great if you're just using it for spot treatment.This product has worked great for us and I would highly recommend it to anyone with an outdoor ant problem.
B001B1KGCO I got this because I have a huge ant problem outside this year - they're everywhere, they're everywhere! AND we've had several invasions into the house, of a couple of varieties. I used this product, even with some concerns about our pets - we have two cats that are indoor/outdoor, and I really do not want to hurt them.I did as the instructions say - I sprinkled around the foundation of the house, and put a couple of tablespoons right on some big ant mounds.One - it did kill some kinds of ants. The general scurrying-around population dropped by about half. BUT it did not get rid of my entire ant problem. I still have lots of the critters around.I guess this is not a bait like some ant products - the kind that says they'll carry it back to the nest, get the queen egg layer to dine on some, and the rest are toast. No - this says it kills on contact, and does not discriminate among ant types - or many other insects, including cockroaches. With the bait products, the question always seems to be what kind of ant is it? The type with a sweet tooth, and therefore you need sugar soaked in killer - or grease, or meat, or - especially, dry pet food. That always seems to create an ant highway for the army that enters the abode. Whatever kind I get, with Murphy's Law in play, it generally seems to be the wrong kind for that particular invasion.I haven't given up on Terro Ant Killer - but after two applications (followed by light watering, as per instructions), I have not set off the desired ant bomb. However, it did get rid of a bunch of ants, so I give it 4 stars, with one withheld for the rest of the critters who are still with us. And I'm after them as well. If I end up annihilating the busy six-legged ones, I'll come back and add the 5th star.Reinforcing the stars already assigned - the 3 lb shaker bag is a good idea. No need to measure out and sprinkle with a spoon or something else: just open, upend, shake gently, and the inner bag, with holes in it, lets out a decent amount, fairly evenly distributed. However, don't do like I did the first time and use it on a windy day! The stuff is super light, and I got some blowing up on me. As I was not trying to poison myself, I quit and waited for a quieter day.The bag has a zip lock resealer, which is no big deal these days, but a good idea.Overall, recommended - with the warning that it might not get rid of all the ants you are trying to kill.
B001B1KGCO First about the dispenser \"shaker bag\":  The setup instructions were vague but it was easy enough to figure out.  The 3 lb bag has a handle on one end and a zip lock seal on the other.  So I opened the zip lock seal and pulled apart the inner seal which exposed the shaker holes.  From there, you simply invert the bag, hold by the handle, and shake lightly to dispense where and how much you want.  Reseal bag when done.  Nice design and keeps your hands clean.Effectiveness?:  This is a general insecticide that will kill ants, roaches, etc.  My need was very specific . . . vigorous ant activity this spring, producing two monster ant hills in my yard and a lot of ant excavating around cracks in my driveway.  I had used my old standby method of applying 2-cycle gas/oil mix right out of my weed-eater supply can.  Usually works, but not this year, as I saw an initial decline in activity followed by what seemed to be a re-growth in population and activity.  Plan B was application of the Terro Ant Killer.  I sprinkled it on right after a rain while soil (and my driveway) was moist.  In 3 or 4 days ant activity has stopped cold.  Nothing. All gone. Looks like this stuff works.As a preventative measure, per instructions I also shook out a perimeter application around my house and especially the enclosed porch, basement window wells, and other openings.Based on my visible ant problem results (success), I think this product works well, and is certainly easy to apply.
B001B1KGCO Years ago, I had an awful experience with an ant swarm, and TERRO was the only product that worked. Since then, I've used their powder, traps, etc, and this product is just as dependable as the others that I've used. I didn't necessarily find the shaker bag especially convenient, but the ant killer worked.This summer, our entire neighborhood has been struggling with a serious ant problem, and I've been recommending TERRO products to everyone. As a result, we've been able to keep the ants out of our houses, without having to hire expensive exterminators.
B001B1KGCO The first thing that is good about this product is the shaker bag and not having to touch anything that is inside. The problem with these chemicals is that you have to make sure to keep pets and youngsters away and with a 3-5 foot swath around the perimeter of a house that creates some difficulties.The ants seem to be under control after using this. We had some very small ants and some large black ants and it has been awhile since I have seen them - so for that and the ease of application the product is pretty good with our usage.
B001B1KH1Y After three weeks the residue is beginning to fade, but its still noticeable. I'll update in 8 months when it is supposed to have stopped working.
B001B1KH1Y It works very well.  I found that it killed ants.  (They were living in my potted plants outside, so I put it under the potted plants.)  It works very well but the dust seems to stick around indefinitely.  It's also very fine so it blows easily, much like baking flour or cornstarch would.  If you have animals, it would be VERY easy for them to \"sniff\" it up.
B001B1KH1Y I sprinkled this around some areas that we've been having ant problems.  The powder is white and stays visible for days or weeks, which is somewhat annoying if you use it somewhere that people can see.  Looks almost like gym chalk spilled on the sidewalk.  And the ants were back not long after, so all in all this product did not meet my expectation.
B001B1KH1Y This is the third Terro product we've tried this year.  The first,Terro 300 Pre-Filled Liquid Ant Killer II Baits, 6-Pack, proved successful in enticing carpenter ants to eat its tasty poison. You can see inside the 6-pack bait, and can tell instantly if the ants have been eating it. All 6 of ours were emptied within a day or two of the ants discovering its goodness.  So, we orderedTerro 1800 3-Ounce Outdoor Pre-Filled Liquid Ant Baits, 3-Packand were a bit dismayed that we couldn't see inside; however, we're confident our carpenter ants like it too.  But, every day, my hubby would say, \"I don't like all these carpenter ants coming into the garage.\"  So we ordered Terro ant-killer in powder form. It works a bit differently than the liquid baits. The powder bait kills on contact, is waterproof and lasts for 8 months. Once the ants know how bad it is, they stay away from it. We have no more carpenter ants coming into the garage. We then put it around our home's foundation, and sprinkled some onto/into our railroad ties that the ants had taken up residence in...well, at least that's how it looked to us. The only problem we have is trying to remember to step over the poison, otherwise we track it into the garage...then into our home.  yikes! We must remember to clean our shoes off!  If you have pets or young children, well, any kids that play around the house, you might want to be careful where you put this powder.I like Terro ant killer enough to cheer about it!
B001B1KH1Y I get this product every year although the big box stores did not carry it or sold out. What I do is sprinkle this product 12 inches from the house outside and it serves it purpose.
B001B1KH1Y The active ingredient Deltamethrin works well on odorous ants here in New Mexico. We use it outdoors near doors, patios, and on any visible ant mounds. Once this product has been applied the ants disappear. While it may be water-proof, NM rains wash it away and it must be reapplied.
B001B1KH1Y In certain applications, Terro's Ant Dust can be an effective tool in attempting to control ants.  Contrary to what some have said, the dust does not kill ants on contact, but given some time, the dust does seem to be effective in combating ants, as they will generally avoid areas treated by the dust.  As the dust is white, it's usually easy to tell where the dust has been applied, unless the area happens to be white.After spreading the dust under bricks and various rocks where ants are nesting and egg cases are present, I found that there were no live ants in the area the next day.  When dust was sprayed into cracks in rock walls and sidewalks where ants were present, once again, no ants a day later.  The dust will keep them out of the area for a while, although how long depends on things like the weather.  The powder isn't quite `waterproof' as cIaimed, but it does resist watering or rain washing it away.  You may need to reapply occasionally.The thing about ants is that they are resourceful, determined, and relentless.  Unless the ants are killed, they almost never give up.  When this ant dust prevents them from taking a particular path, the ants will take an alternate route, if one is available.  Be prepared to either spread more dust, or kill the ants.  Unless they have no other options, they will probably keep coming.Of course, you always want to use this product in a safe and approved manner.  Do not apply it anywhere near where food is prepared, or where there is any possibility that children or pets might be exposed to it.  I only use it outdoors, and recommend wearing a surgical mask and safety glasses when applying, especially when there is wind.  Shaking the dust from the container works fine for some applications, but with the one pound can, you may not have a lot of control.  Applying the dust into a tiny hole or crack could be a problem.The dust is very fine, and can be applied as a spray, but the trick is that you will need to come up with a suitable spray container.  An empty nasal spray bottle, works well for me.  Enlarge the opening in the nozzle, and with a little practice, you should be able to apply the dust into nooks and cracks.  The dust isn't always easy to apply evenly, so I use an old toothbrush to spread it around when necessary.This dust probably won't wipe out the colony, but could be an effective tool for helping to control ants.  Ant colonies are generally sensitive to any kind of attack, and often will withdraw when they experience losses of life.  Good luck! :)
B001B3PI1G Not sure why I can't find black ones since the tubing is black. I bought the more expensive easy-fit ones that are black for anything that was visible and these for the ones I planned on burying underground. Only complaint is that these are really hard to put on.
B001B3PI1G THESE ARE GREAT. A LITTLE TIGHT, BUT ONCE ON THEY DO NOT COME OFF. THE BLACK ONES ARE EASIER TO PUT ON..
B001B3PI1G My choice of five stars is predicated on the manner in which the elbows were so easily installed without any adhesive and it fitted perfectly without any signs of leaks. I love the technology it goes in easily but very difficult to be removed. It has been serving me to my satisfaction. It is unique to the specific 1/2' Rainbird line no other pvc elbows can be substituted.
B001B3PI1G Nice and price is very good.  Takes fair amount of effort to put together but will NOT blow off- pretty much have to cut the hose to get them off.
B001B3PI1G I purchased these to use with an aquarium setup, using clear 1/2 inch tubing.  I don't know if landscape water tubing is easier to install, but it took a lot of pressure to install the clear tubing on these.  The good news is that it's nice and tight. Because it is a pressurized setup, I also used worm-gear clamps to hold the hose to the elbows.  All in all, very pleased.
B001BO8BWI Last summer was the first that I used my Tanglefoot traps. I set one in the front yard and one in the back. Grossly, I think I captured a bazillion of them in just a month or so. Each time I emptied the traps, I was amazed by the volume of the catch. The trap is probably 6\" in diameter and 10\" or so tall, and they would be completely full of this little buggers (literally, little buggers). This got me thinking that there isn't a lot of thinking that goes on inside the heads of Japanese beetles. If you were out for a walk and saw a hole with about 10,000 people trapped in it, would you jump into it? Of course not, but if you were a Japanese beetle, you'd think THE MORE THE MERRIER, and you would jump right in. This trap provides yet another opportunity for parents to teach kids the hazards of doing what everybody else does, just because you were following the crowd. One moment, you are flying around enjoying the world, the next minute you are stuck in a trap and you are too dumb to get out of it, even though it doesn't have a door or cover on it.So, in summary, this product works great, and it provides a great metaphor for life.
B001BO8BWI This is my third year with Japanese Beetles. Each year, I see more and more of them. This year, I'd had enough and purchased one of those \"bag a bug\" kits at Home Depot. Those work well, but you will end up spending a lot of $$$ on bags if you have a lot of beetles and the bags are flimsy and get blow about in the wind pretty easily. I saw the Tanglefoot trap on Amazon and was sold immediately. Sure, the cost is higher, but it's reusable for YEARS. It's really sturdy and within three days, it was full of beetles.Setup is easy and within seconds of hanging it, beetles were flocking to the trap. Remember to place it AWAY from the bushes and plants the beetles are attacking so the only place they have to land IS the trap. Most websites with advice about controlling Japanese Beetles advise NOT to use the bag system as the lures attract more beetles to your yard. This is 100% true - you will see more beetles near the trap than you ever saw on your bushes. However, with the right placement, it will draw the beetles *away* from your plants and bushes and will take 1000s of beetles out of the breeding cycle, and that's a good thing in my book. Sure, I'm trapping beetles from many yards around me, but let's remember - these beetles are not breeding and laying eggs, so the numbers will be reduced.I really love that this trap is reusable. It's very sturdy and easy to remove, dump and clean. I only wish it was a little bigger! And for the price, it would be nice if they included a pole/stand.Remember to clean out beetles frequently - they STINK after awhile!
B001BO8BWI There are many options out there for capturing the dreaded Japanese Beetle.Many of them include bags, which you have to purchase in quantity and it's expensive aside from being wasteful.  My dog has chewed through the bags of other systems.The Tangle Foot trap is re-usable and saves money and waste in the long run.  The traps are well designed, can handle high wind conditions (bags often tear and lose their contents).  The expandable traps are well made and easy to wash out, have drainage holes so the beetles once trapped, do not rot in the summer heat in their own juices.I made a video where I review the merit of these well designed traps, you may view it on YouTube at [...]I don't sell them, nor have an interested in marketing them.  My goal is to educate people as to the best and least wasteful methods of capture.Don't buy bags, that's just silly....  capture and compost or recycle the beetles by giving them to chickens or other birds (kill them in soapy water first).This is hands down, the most effective method of attracting and capturing Japanese Beetles.Some will say that drawing beetles to a trap, also brings them to your yard/property from other yards?  This may be true, however, you are indeed removing them from the breeding cycle and over years to come, if you are consistent, the numbers will be reduced greatly.Without these traps, I would have lost all of my plumb trees to defoliating beetles.The only thing you have to replace with this system is the bait.  That is very inexpensive in the long run.Happy Beetle Trapping!
B001BO8BWI I read the reviews on the beetle traps and found that they worked w
B001BO8BWI I purchased this trap rather late in the season so I was not expecting great results because Japanese Beetles do not seem to be quite as active in the late summer. I figured that it would take a few days to trap some beetles. I was wrong,it only took 24 hours.I've read that the best time to place these is in the spring or early summer. That's when people get the best results. I went ahead and placed mine late in hopes of possibly cutting back on next years population.Setting the trap up was exceptionally easy. I made a separate purchase of of a metal stand to give me more versatility on where to place it. Even without the stand it could easily be hung from a tree branch or whatever you have handy.
B001BOAE46 The durability and construction on this are of high quality, but it must be mounted high enough off the ground and away from any nearby limbs (even *very* small limbs) if it's to dissuade chipmunks.  If they can get anywhere near it, they can run right up it, as they're so lightweight.  It does discourage some, though, so we're keeping it on the pole.  I'm not buying another one, though.
B001BOAE46 We have a feeder post in the middle of our yard that squirrels woudl scale.  This sits a little crooked and gets covered in bird poop quickly, but I don't see squirrels on the feeders anymore.
B001BOAE46 It's inexpensive.....it's black.....it's metal.....it's easy to install....and most importantly, it keeps those steenking tree rats (squirrels) out of my bird feeders.
B001BOAE46 It I had it to over again; I would have invested in the larger 18&#34; squirrel baffle. Right now, the squirrels look and I swear I've heard a chuckle or two from them as they eat the song bird seed.
B001BOAE46 This baffle works just fine.It's metal so those damm rodents can't chew it up.So now birds get their seeds, and the squirrels eat dirt!Would I but it again? YES
B001BOAE46 Added this product above the \"Birds Choice Classic 12 feeder with baffle\" on a tree limb.  No large bird or squirrel gets past this.  High quality, well constructed, worth every penny.
B001BOBX00 This thing is great with a small bird feeder. Sticks like glue to the window pane. Has endured gray squirrels pulling at the feeder it holds and once or twice a gray squirrel dive bombing it from above. A month ago my wife turned around and saw one of our two local bears just starting to tug on the feeder it was holding just before she yelled and scarred the bear away.  The hanger held fast.
B001BOBX00 This is perfect for hanging my hummingbird feeder on my porch window.  It's out of the sun, and we can see the hummers while sitting at our kitchen table.  This hanger is very attractive and sturdy.
B001BOBX00 I was worried this wouldn't hold a heavy bottle full of hummingbird food on my window but the suction is very strong. I have had it up for a month now and I do test when I fill my feeder, the suctions are as strong as can be. Like super glue.If you don't have a hanging hook on a ceiling and looking for a great window hanger, this is it !
B001BOBX00 Been using this for about a week now and everything seems to be fine.  Its holding a relatively heavy glass hummingbird feeder, so it seems as if they cups are big enough.  I wish the cups were a little bigger though, it would make me more comfortable with its load capability.  I also recommend cleaning your window with rubbing alcohol before application.
B001BOBX00 You just have to clean the window good and then put the suction cups up where you want the hanger.  I left mine  hang without anything on it for a couple of days.  It anchored well and I will put one of the Hummingbird feeders on it. Great way to watch the little guys eat right through the window.
B001BOBX00 This hanger is perfect for the hummingbird feeder we have. It hasn't budged since I placed it on our bedroom window. I would recommend this to anyone who needs a quick, no-tools-needed way to hang a feeder.
B001BZNWVM I bought one without knowing whether I'd really need it for my new feeder and seeing no ants I didn't bother with adding water immediately.  A week or so later the feeder was covered with tiny ants and there was a solid line of them climbing up the wall and down the wire to the feeder.  Boy did I feel dumb.  I washed everything, sprayed the wall with ant spray, and put the feeder and trap back up this time with the moat full of water.  No ants.  I'll grant that it won't be a true test until enough time passes for the spray to wash away, but so far it is working perfectly ... now that I've followed the directions.
B001BZNWVM take that ants!  no more little buggers crawling down and stealing all the hummingbird food.  genius simple design.  fill with water like a little moat protecting the castle!
B001BZNWVM I have a real problem with ants on my property and this works miracles. I no longer have to cleaner out my feeder due to ants.
B001BZNWVM This works to deter ants but we had issues with wasps and weirdly small birds kept trying to drink the water.  Actually they DID drink the water, perched awkwardly on top of the feeder.  Not sure I would recommend them for that reason.
B001BZNWVM This is a surprisingly effective and clever device for keeping ants away from the hummingbird feeder. It is easily installed and works flawlessly. A very fine product at a modest price.
B001BZNWVM This little plastic cup is an easy solution to a big problem if you have ants anywhere near your trees with hummingbird feeders in them.  I didn't understand the way the trap worked until I received it and looked at it, and then I had one of those \"ohhh!\" moments.  I included several customer images here so it's clear how the water moat traps the ants.  I hung mine on my feeder (Perky-Pet 8120-2 Green Antique Bottle Hummingbird Feeder) in about 10 seconds - recommended!
B001BZNWVM The product works as described.  Helps keep the bugs and insects off the humming bird feeder.  Would purchase again in the future.
B001BZNWVM We like the ant traps and the only thing is, you must check them everyday as the birds like to drink some of the water and they don't hold a lot of H20. The design is great and the best part of them is &#34;THEY ARE MADE IN THE USA&#34; and that's wonderful. I'm glad we found them and hope a lot of folks do the same. JB
B001BZNWVM We have dozens of humming birds in the area that feed from our feeders. Unfortunately, as soon as the ants take over, the birds refuse the nectar.This trap works very simply and just takes a bit of water every few days to keep the feeders clean of marauding ants.
B001BZNWVM After so many great reviews on this thing I don't think there is really much I can offer.  I bought one locally a while ago and it worked so well I added two other feeders and picked up a couple more traps here on Amazon, (where at the time of this writing are shipping for free).  There is only one species of hummer that gets this far north here in New England, and then only in the summer time.  So feeding them for the time alloted is a real treat.  But in the past nothing has stopped the ants from getting to the nectar.  Sometimes I wouldn't see anything on the feeder itself, only to open it for cleaning to find it clogged with them.  This very simple but perfectly designed cup creates a moat that the ants can't get by.  The cup is about the size of a large cap on a spray paint can, and the hook on the bottom and the top completes it.  Some reviewers here have talked about the water evaporating quickly on hot days.  I tried adding a little cheap cooking oil to the cup and it has slowed down the evaporation considerably.  (If you like, you can fill the cup entirely with cooking oil and all you have to do is change it out and clean it every couple of weeks or so).  The ants are repelled and cannot swim across the oil any more than they can the water.  Great little item that takes care of a very disgusting and aggravating problem.  Highly recommended... : )
B001BZNWVM Love, LOVE, LOVE these trap-it-ant contraptions!  I clean the inside of mine when I clean the hummingbird feeders!  Before that, we were overrun with ants crawling up the shepherd hooks/poles to get to the the hummingbird feeders.  Greatest invention since sliced bread!!  You won't be disappointed!
B001BZNWVM I bought red because of non red feeders and sugars solutions. Very plz with the size which is a nice large size. Product is quality made.
B001BZNWVM Filled with water, it keeps ants from getting to my humming bird feeder. I bought it for one of my feeders that does not have a water well. My Hummzinger feeders have  built in water wells so I didnt need any for those feeders. My feeders are on shepard's hooks and I also put vaselene on the pole just above the grass line. Made a little cone to keep the rain off of the vaselene. Ants hate vaselene and in hot weather the water wells dry up fast.
B001BZNWVM Low tech, for sure, but this little &#34;trap&#34; does what it has to to keep non-flying bugs from fouling your hummingbird feeders.
B001BZNWVM This seems to work great! The hummingbirds are enjoying the feeders with no ants thanks to this! I would recommend it to anyone with the Perky-Pet Pinch-Waist Glass Hummingbird Feeder.
B001CMO9NE Well those little fellas have a fiesta out there ,every day with this stuff.Every day is like july 4, the way they come around and eat it up.
B001CMO9NE Economy seed.  Mostly filler.  The picture is deceiving.  I would not buy it again.
B001CMO9NE The birds seem to like the product as well as any others I have used.  The crushed corn does tend to draw in some larger birds.  I also like the fact that everything is small enough not to clog up the feeders I use.  Price seems to be comparable to what I have found in big box stores without the trip to the store.
B001CMO9NE Fed these seeds to our backyard birds throughout this difficult and bitter winter. The birds came to the feeder and some even ate the seed right off our patio table. The packaging was good and the bag is hefty. We fed cardinals, mourning doves, red winged blackbirds,  and all other types of birds.
B001CMO9NE My birds are picky eaters - they eat this - but prefer the expensive bird store mixes.  THe price is such on this - they will continue to get this and will eventuially eat it.  lol  Price is super good!!
B001CMO9NE The birds like the food.  What more can I say?  We live in Seattle, and we have two seed feeders that take about 5lb of seed, and have refilled them twice this week already.  We have seen Stellar's Jays as well as whatever the common birds are around here (I can't tell the difference between little dark birds).  They all seem to love it, and one little bird comes to the window to let me know the feeders need filling!
B001CMO9NE I can attest that the birds in Southern California love Morningstar year round blend.  I filled myBirdscapes 737 Garden Sip & Seed Feeder(about 1 1/2 pounds of seed).  The birds sat on it all day every day and the feeder was empty in two days.
B001CMO9NE I have been with the sparrows and then  I got this new bird food, mixed it with my old and got the Blue Jays and the first GoldFinch I have seen in a long time. Wonderful.
B001CMO9NE This was attractive to many birds. I buy whole corn for the squirrels (keeps them distracted from the feeder and is cheap) and this was a good filler for the birds.
B001CMO9NE The sky is falling worry warts are out.  &#34;Poison in the bird seed&#34;.. they cry.  Stop and think about it.  If this was the case and it was at one time, would  Amazon continue to keep selling it?  Could they afford to do that?  According to what I've read, this (and yes it was awful) practice was halted in 2008.I've been feeding this seed - I just ordered another 40 pounds on prime - for some time and compared to Kaytee, Warners and a few super market specials, the birds seem to prefer this way above all others.  I barely get in the house before the feeders are 'attacked'.  Yes, it's like they were just sitting and waiting for me to fill it up.  It's a big variety I have here in south eastern Wisconsin too.  Finches, chickadees, cardinals, jays, juncos loads of woodpeckers etc. etc.As an aside, there are loads of squirrels around my wooded lot.  They do not hit the feeders.  I load the seed with the cheapest brand of cayenne  pepper I can find.  Really layer it up in the bucket I carry the seed in.  Once a squirrel has  found the hot stuff, it doesn't come back and the word seems to be passed on to the rest of the gang.  Even this year's youngsters seem to get the message.  They do clean up around the ground under the feeders though, so they still get a treat, just a second hand one.Oh yeah, I haven't seen any dead birds around since I've been feeding this feed.  It's a good buy, especially if you have prime, and I'll continue to serve it at our feeders as long as I can get it.
B001CMO9NE Really not good, lots and lots of red seeds that they do not eat, nothing eats the silage type red seeds and it is full of it, way to many and not good for my birds anyway. Ducks eat it tho.
B001CMO9NE Lots of corn and other filler looking items.  Not so much on the seeds.  I think the squirrels tend to eat more than the birds do.  I filled our feeder with another brand and it was empty in a couple of days.  I fill with this and it lasts up to two weeks.  There are still birds.  Mostly the doves that eat the stuff that gets thrown on the ground.  Nowhere near as many and as constant a stream of diners as we saw with other brands.
B001CMO9NE What the birds seem to like,is that they do not have be at the feeder all day looking for something other than millet.Morning Song Year Round Wild Bird Food does have millet,yet it is not mostly millet like some brands.And my budget likes it cause it's not overly expensive.Morning Song Year-Round may be used in Hopper,Tube &/or Platform Feeders.Ingredients: Grain Products,White Millet,Black Oil SunflowerGuaranteed Analysis:Crude Protein (min)....8%Crude Fat (min)....4%Crude Fiber (max)....5%Moisture (max)....13%Have been giving Morning Song,Scott's or Kaytee for years.Though this year i made the mistake trying other brands.Besides buying in stores (10 or 20 LB bags). This is the second time that ordered this brand (40 LB bags).With This Morning Song Year-Round W-Bird Food,the birds like it when i add a little thistle &/or small hulled sunflower seeds for the Finch Family.
B001D1FFZA This weeder works well. Weeds have overgrown our backyard in the few months we've had the house remodeled. This looked like a quick and easy way to tame the overgrowth and it indeed does its job. I probably spent more time looking for a weeder than doing the actual weeding. It doesn't quite make weeding fun, but yanking those weeds out roots and all is definitely satisfying.
B001D1FFZA How I wish I had purchased this many years ago!  We have nasty soil here in Houston and last year suffered a terrible summer drought--adding insult to our summer heat injury.  All this produced unbelievable weeds.  I have struggled with them and just gave up.  Then I ordered this handy helper and getting those large, nasty weeds is so easy!  I usually only work on weeds when the ground is damp because I don't want to hurt the tool that I have grown to love, and it does a super job.  This is tons easier than the old ways I have tried to control the weeds.  This is easy and permanent.  I love this tool.
B001D1FFZA I like this weeder better than the \"Weed Popper\" I have been using.  It is light-weight, and does the job effectively if used properly.  With the lever to either the right or left side, center the tines over the center of the weed and push it into the ground.  When pushing on the lever put the foot close to the handle and push down.  It is important that the FOOT BE REMOVED at this point when you lean towards the lever, as you might break the handle.  Lean the handle towards the lever, then pull the weed out of the ground. Simple!  I like that it does not dig up big chuncks of lawn like my \"Weed Popper\" and it is much lighter than the Popper.  I won't say you will never bend to pick up another weed, but bending will be greatly diminished, which means you won't tire as quickly.  Really nice product, glad I purchased it.
B001D1FFZA This is a great idea and it is elegant in its simplicity. The process was very simple.  I just position it in the middle of the weed, then I step on the handle then tilt it to the right and out pops the weed. This saves me from buying and using weed killers.  I did my entire lawn in 30 minutes.  It is good exercise too. I prefer well-crafted manual tools to electrical tools any day.
B001D1FFZA This is the best garden weed puller one could ever use. They are fantastic and everyone should purchase one of thesebeauties.Thanks so much for the fine service, it was wonderful.
B001D1FFZA This product works like a charm -- even in heavy clay.It makes weeding chores a breeze and is easy on the back.
B001D1FFZA Pluses: Decent quality, only works well with certain weeds in ideal soil condition.Minuses: Does not remove the entire root most of the time. Does not work well with crabgrass. Prongs get clogged up in damp clay soil.
B001DGII5O I go through a lot of garden nozzles and I've been looking for a good brass power-nozzle with no moving parts but have yet to find one.  This one has rubber seals in it and in the Florida heat the O-ring in the end of the nozzle blew out after only a few weeks of use.  It still can be opened and closed shutting the flow of water off completely, but without the rubber seal it takes a good deal of effort to get it to seal and especially to open it up again.  At least it is designed to still function without that end seal and I have gotten more life out of it than I have ever gotten out of the pistol-grip style of nozzle regardless of the price.  You can still adjust the spray pattern without the end o-ring.  This type of item should last a lifetime, but so far I have not been able to find one built to last forever even though I have owned high quality nozzles in the past (used for industrial applications more than 15 years ago).  This is the best I have found so far.
B001DGII5O This is a well-made nozzle. The knurling is very &#34;grippy&#34; and it is a pleasure to use. The twisting action is smooth and easy to adjust from a stream to a fine mist. The nozzle easily disassembles by unscrewing to facilitate replacing o-rings. However, I don't think any maintenance will be required for years especially if you periodically apply a little silicone grease a I do. A very nice piece of equipment made of real metal. I have 3 of these now, one at each outside faucet.
B001DGII5O Trust me on this one- if you want a hose nozzle that's not only always dependable but well made and built to last, look no further than a brass adjustable nozzle.  When it comes to watering fruits and vegetables where having a reliable stream of water gets me through the current situation, brass nozzles are the ones I prefer above all other types.  It seriously takes a lot to break these things.  Much better than the plastic ones I've seen.
B001DGII5O I also have owned a bunch of plastic junk nozzles, all failed and hopefully recycled and made into something useful. All replaced by this great brass nozzle.Found similar one buried in the yard, probably 50 years old. Cleaned it up, replaced the o-rings and it is perfectly good and in daily use.My tip is to pair it with a little ball valve. You can then adjust the pressure and the stream. It is a great combo.
B001DGII5O Very well made! Adjusts very well.  This is just the quality that I expected. Very pleased. I do recommend it.
B001DGII5O We are so happy with this and it works so nicely! It is easy to use and work with, its just unbelievable how something that is so classic and timeless can be so much better than \"newer\" and \"improved\" versions. Fits great, no leaks, tightens and turns smoothly every time and doesn't make your hands smell like metal..Yup its a winner!I would definitely buy and recommend this!!!
B001DGII5O We had this Dramm nozzle growing up and now, it has lasted for over 50 years for my parents.  Now, I'm back to get one for myself!  This thing is SO awesome!  Forget about those colored plastic ones that break after one season. This thing just lasts forever.  And, it doesn't gunk up so much all the time, spray weird all over the place, and j
B001DGII5O When I received my Dramm heavy-duty \"brass\" hose nozzle, I was shocked to see a warning on the package. This nozzle contains LEAD (as part of the brass), and you're supposed to wash your hands after using the nozzle. This is absurd and unacceptable, what do these companies think they're getting away with?  I can't advise anyone to buy this or any other brass hose nozzle, unless there is clearly no lead used in the manufacturing process.
B001DGII5O I have been using these Dramm adjustable hose nozzles for quite a few years now and have owned many of them.  Note that I refer to them is plural.  This is not because they break easily or constantly malfunction.  No, it is because I either (1) loose them, or (2) loan them to relatives and friends and never see them again.  I have also left a few laying about here and there where they should not have been and accidently burn them.  But hey, that is my problem.It should be noted right off, as has been noted by several other reviewers, that these brass nozzles do indeed have lead in them.  Almost all brass products that have been machined have a small bit of lead in them.  This enhances the machining process.  Many to most of your brass plumbing parts are made of the same stuff.  That is the nature of machined brass products.  They started noting this on the product label due to the fact the California law says they must.  As far as I know that is the only state that requires this.  This company, like others selling like products, always put this label on if there is any chance what so ever that it will be used or sold in California.  It also states that you should wash your hands after using...again, a California thing.  Now I grant you that Amazon should include this in the product description rather than letting the buyer find out about it after they receive the product.  That is only fare.  Now I personally could care less as the amount of lead is very small and the amount that rubs off in your hand is almost un-measureable and this information most certainly will not stop me from using this product, but that being said, this is a personal choice and everyone should have the opportunity to make that choice for themselves, ergo, they need this information before the purchase.Now all that being said:I have had very good luck with this particular model.  It works as it is suppose to work.  I personally do not use it to water the garden or flowers with as I have a number of other nozzles that are more effective now but I do use this thing to wash the walk, driveway, porch and cars.  (Truth be told I should say car; my wife's car.  I only was my truck when it needs it...which is when it rains.  My current truck has only been \"rain washed\" for over 10 years now and the dirt, grime and road tar holds it together quite well...thank you very much!).I would recommend that you check and replace the rubber washers in these things quite often as they do deteriorate over time and a nice fresh washer stops leaks rather quickly.All in all, this is a good nozzle and does what I pay it to do.Don BlankenshipThe Ozarks
B001DGII5O Well, I don't need much from the hose that this was attached to--only need it for short, hand-held jobs.  But one good thing about my hose is that it is safe to drink water from it.  Enter this item that contains lead, and that advantage is gone.  No problems, though.  I never have needed to drink from my hose.  I'm happy I purchased this item, which will be permanently attached to the hose on one side of my house.
B001DGII5O This brass nozzle is Made in the USA out of solid brass. There are only 3 items that may require replacing in a few years: 2 O-rings and the gasket for the hose attachment. These are easily found, and I expect to replace the O-rings with MIL-SPEC Viton O-Rings if the originals ever wear out. One can procure a small bag for a few dollars, which would last almost a lifetime.The hose easily/gently twists open with a light fan-cone spray pattern, and as I turn it more and more, it progresses towards a powerful stream of water. It still relies on your existing water pressure, so don't expect any type of massive venturi action to magnify the pressure of the water. I find that it is plenty strong for washing cars, and the nozzle patterns are adequate for use with a garden hose. The water stream is powerful enough to blast off residue and road debris stuck onto a car. Turning the water on or off is the easiest thing, simply turn the nozzle tip clockwise or anticlockwise, it is smooth thanks to the O-rings.The nozzle is made out of brass, so try to avoid dinging it on the ground. The one thing that does concern me is that there is a warning on the box that indicates the brass contains lead, which seems to be the norm for brass.Overall: 5/5 stars, one of the best nozzles I've ever used to wash cars. it is extremely easy to use, and built like a tank with only 1 moving part (the adjuster portion) and 3 wear items (2 o-rings and the gasket) that are easily replaceable. It is also made in the USA.
B001DGII5O This hose nozzle is larger than expected and fits the whole hand. It feels solid and the twist mechanism feels very smooth. It feels like  a quality piece and doesn't leak at all.Only reason I do a 4 star instead of 5 is that the control is quite abrupt so fine tuning can be a little difficult and the pressure is reduced a little but still enough to sweep the patio with.
B001DGII5O There are so many garden hose nozzles out there with only a few brass parts, or made almost entirely of plastic. None of these nozzles will last long with much use.I've purchased one of these nozzles for every hose at my house, and after a few months, I can say this nozzle is the most durable I've ever used. It's two all-brass pieces, one screwed into the other, with two small O-ring gaskets inside (that look like they're easily repaired).It sprays anything from a fine mist to a forceful stream, so it's good for anything from filling containers to watering new (and delicate) grass and plants.The only downside to an all-brass design is that the nozzle get get awfully cold if you're using it in a colder climate in early spring/late fall. I usually wear some gardening gloves so my hands don't freeze!
B001DGII5O I've had them all, cheap ($5) nozzles and an expensive ($90) nozzle (Griot's Garage). Given I've had the expensive nozzle for over 10 years now without a hicup lends strength to the adage; 'you get what you pay for'. But who in their right mind would pay $90 for a hose nozzle? Well, I did once but the good news now is that this $10 nozzle is the best I've ever used in this price range and unlike others in this price range, should last virtually forever (because there are no inherent design flaws).  Others have raved about the Gilmour nozzle and so I bought one only to find out that it breaks. Turns out it is made from three pieces of brass, two of which are press fit together; the inner core and the part that screws onto the end of the hose.  The outer jacket, the part that is supposed to turn to adjust the spray is the third piece.  When you torque the outer jacket down to shut off the flow, stress is induced on the press fit joint which eventually fails.  The press fit joint is now so loose, that I can't turn the outer jacket to adjust the flow without the core spinning at the joint.  That is, the core begins to turn and it leaks at the place where the two pieces are press fit together. Worse yet, I can't turn the jacket to shut off the flow. Only took 4 months of light use to happen.THIS nozzle is only two metal pieces! The outer jacket, that turns to adjust the spray and shut off the flow, and the inner core which is one piece of  machined brass all the way from the part that screws on to the hose to the center tip of the nozzle.  Internally there are a couple of replaceable 'O' rings in addition to the requisite washer where the nozzle screws onto the hose end.  The spray pattern is typical from wide mist to hard stream.Brass is soft, relatively speaking and I do not recommend leaving this nozzle outside in a presurized state after the outside temp falls below freezing.  (to help you appreciate the $90 nozzle, you could leave that thing anywhere, anytime of the year, and even bury it, only to dig it up and find that it works like new.  Combined with a good hose you could even leave the whole set up outside year round and forget about it.  Which I've done for over ten years.  Come spring thaw, it would be right as rain.)Gilmour makes some great products, like their Flexogen hose, but I'll stick to Dramm for the brass fittings.**UPDATE** 18 Dec 2012.I don't remember when I wrote this (I see it now, over two years ago) but it really was under $10 at that time....as of today it's 30% more?! The good news is that while the 'O' rings may need replacing, there's no reason the brass nozle shouldn't last a good many years.
B001DGII5O I wouldn't be surprised to find an identical nozzle in a 100-year-old archaeological dig---and (with a little grease), it would almost certainly work like new.  There's alot to be sad for \"proven technology\".PRONS/CONS> Virtually indestructible, can easily last a human lifetime.> Holds any particular spray pattern until you change it---ideal for folks with arthritis or weak grips, or for jobs when you want a particular spray pattern for a long period of time.ALTERNATIVE> Although I have several brass nozzle(since they last forever), I prefer the basically similar zinc pistol-grip design, mostly because I can change the pattern quickly, and water a large part of my garden while standing in place.Gilmour Full Size Zinc Pistol Grip Nozzle with Threaded Front 573TF> TheGilmour Select-A-Spray Comfort Grip Nozzle 594 Black/TealorGilmour Select-A-Spray Metal Nozzle 584may be a good compromise for folks who like selectable spray patterns.  It is essentially a zinc pistol grip nozzle with a full-action setting, plus several selectable patterns.MAINTENANCE> Avoid leaving the nozzle in damp acidic soil or puddles.  Even brass can corrode eventually.  Always shut the nozzle completely off when you are finished using it---even if you close your faucet as well because even very slow leakage can leave mineral deposits in the nozzle, or acidic water can corrode the nozzle.> With time and/or a little corrosion, the action can get stiff.  Unscrew the nozzle as far as it will go (to the full-open, maximum flow position).  Smear grease on the core (inside) peice and open/close the nozzle several times to spread the grease around.  Wipe off excess.  Some brass nozzles (the best, probably including the Dramm) designs are all brass and have no o-rings.  Some cheap, particularly plastic, versions have o-ring seals.  Petroleum grease can damage o-rings, and anything else made from rubber.  Silicon grease is better, especially for nozzles with o-rings.Permatex 22058 Dielectric Tune-up Grease - 3 oz.> If the nozzle leaks, try greasing it as described above.> If your water has a high calcium content (you'll know because it makes a white film on your bathroom tiles and your showerhead), it is possible that limestone deposits have built up inside your nozzle.  If greasing doesn't fix the problem, open the nozzle fully and soak it in vinegar overnight.  (This is the same fix for your showerhead and for your bathroom and kitchen faucetheads if they no longer spray evenly).CHOOSING A BRASS NOZZLECarefully examine the nozzle before purchasing.  It should consists of 2 and ONLY 2 brass parts.  If the hose connector is \"pressed-on\" to the core piece, don't buy it.  Such nozzle can leak.  Purchase only SOLID brass nozzles.A NOZZLE NOT A VALVEAlthough it does have a \"closed\" position, this is a nozzle, NOT a valve. If you want a VALVE to reduce the PRESSURE, then install aMelnor 390S Hose Shut-Offjust before the nozzle---this is also a good solution if you purchase a cheap nozzle which leaks.
B001DGII5O It's a hose nozzle. It works really well. What else can you say about it? Two parts, both solid brass. My parents have one just like it and have for 17 years. Still works great.
B001DGII5O Leaked where the hose connects.  The hard plastic washer which it ships with is junk.  Buy some good rubber gaskets and it works fine.  Great pressure but I miss the shower option on the trigger spray hose nozzle I had.
B001DGII5O This is a very solit nozzle that works great. I was surprised how small but powerfull this is. I think it will last forver, and it does not leak.
B001DGII5O 2 piece all brass works great, no issue after many year outdoors.Made in usa, expect to last forever but wish price come down a bit.
B001DKBDHK This has worked well for me.  I had a problem in the back yard with heavy growth between a fence and the edge of a pond consisting of brush, wax myrtle, small tree saplings including red maple, sweet gum and others.  Couldn't trim it from the pond side because the pond is too close and on the other side the fence is in the way.  I used this Brush Killer Plus and it worked well.  Most of the growth was killed with one application and the rest killed after the second application.  2 caveats:  you must use this stuff during the growing season and you need a stretch of dry weather so the rain doesn't wash it off too quickly.  Overall positive results and recommend it.
B001DKBDHK losing huge pine trees because of vines poison oak and ivy taking them over I was told this does the trick.
B001DKBDHK Well in my way of thinking was if this stuff was strong enough to Poison Ivy, Poison Oak and tree trunks like it claims??? Well hell surely can kill most simple vegetation???  So I thought..... Surely I would get the best on both worlds.... See I wanted to kill some simple weeds and grass in my flower bed along with some neighbors Ivy and Oak trying to grow onto my lawn. WRONG!!! This chit sucks like hell! It hasn't even killed any grass....... Ok so I thought.... Maybe I should try it on some actual brush, tree stumps or Poison vines of any kind. It has now been 8 days and I do NOT see anything I sprayed with it dying or even turning colors. Before I sat down and wrote this review. I did go back and spray everything twice but mostly three times. What a freaking joke this chit is!!! I bought two bottles. I will be returning the other. If any of you guys have ever read my reviews... I tell it the way the product has worked for me and me only. I do not speak for a neighbor or a friend. So I am saying, &#34;Stay away from this product!!! Try any other product besides this one for any use for killing any type of vegetation growing period!!&#34; Like I also said....... &#34;This chit sucks!!!&#34;
B001DKBDHK Great brand name, good product, kills weeds, etc. quickly, need to mix it with water but that saves you money.  If you want the junky stuff in your yard to go away, this is the product for you.  I live on one and one-half acres, so it sure does the job for me.  Wear a face mask and gloves while mixing if you are chemically sensitive.
B001DKBDHK Had vines that were taking over. They were creeping / had buried roots growing horizontally, which can complicate killing them. To get rid of them, I cut the upward=growing vines about half a foot above the ground. I did this so that if I had to apply the product again, I would have enough vine remaining to cut again. Sometimes if the vine (or root or base of tree or shrub) is really thick, it can take more than one application. (It's best to apply the product to a fresh cut.) In order to apply it twice or three times, you want to leave enough length so that you can make the cut again. This stuff is strong, so don't get me wrong. But, for really large diameters, leave yourself some extra in case you have to come back.I've used this on oak trees too. Just cut the sapling down to size and spritz the stub. If anything grows back, you can spray the leaves or make a fresh cut. Eventually when enough of the root is destroyed, it will not grow back.Great product. Would buy again.
B001DKBDHK This product is supposed to suppress regrowth on cut trees and shrubs. I've used it on the former hedge that was around my property when I bought it. After it was originally cut, it started to grow back. So now I'm waiting to see if it's gone for good this time. Wish me luck. It's easy to apply where needed, and not kill other plants.
B001DKBDHK This contains Triclopyr, which is more aggressive than Glyphosate.  It is also more persistent which means that you don't want to spray it close to plants you value.Triclopyr is what you need to knock out Poison Ivy. Poison Ivy and a lot of other shrubs or trees can take a swig of Glyphosate (Round Up), gargle twice with it and spit it back into your face just for giggles.  I've used this and the Ortho Brush-B-Gon.  They contain the same active ingredient and I haven't observed any significant difference.This stuff is the real deal - I found it when I was trying to locate a product called Vine-X (discontinued?) and found out that it was 13.6% Triclopyr in a penetrating oil.  You simply brush it onto cuts or active vines and it would kill the entire plant.This is where it is really nice to buy the concentrate instead of the pre-mix.  I spray the diluted version but also use the concentrate in a small bottle.  If I cut a thicker vine or trunk, I simply drip the concentrate on it and it will kill the roots and vine.  Besides PI we also have wild grapevine, Buckthorn, Box Elder, and many other invasive and nuisance plans in the woods.Because Poison Ivy is a creeping vine with multiple roots along it's length, eradication is helped with a higher concentration than the label instructs. (My observation) I use it between 50% to 100% (double) strength.It appears that if you spray it in one spot you will kill that part of the vine, but if you hit it (in enough places) with something strong enough you can kill the whole plant down to the roots.Make sure you spray it when you think it won't rain for at least a couple of days or else you will probably need to spray it again. Make sure you get all \"sprouts.\" From extensive hand pulling, My observation is that for every \"sprout\" there is another ~3 feet of vine lurking around and another sprout hiding somewhere nearby.If you've found this review helpful please let me know!
B001DKTHNC I hate mice in my house with an unholy passion. I loathe the little creatures with a burning passion but they still manage to get into the house.I don't like \"regular\" traps. Snap traps don't always make a clean, painless kill, glue traps are just plain cruel and poison not only makes them suffer, they can expire in really inconvenient places and present a danger to your pets if they find a carcass before you do.I first started using electronic traps about 10 or so years ago. Back then, all I could find was a model meant for rats, but it worked great. I discovered Victor electronic traps back in 2009 and have bought a bunch of them since.This particular model has been updated to accomodate up to three 'guests' and their departure from this mortal coil is rapid and (most likely) painless. Certainly more so than old-school traps.I like that there's a little light on top to tell me when the trap needs emptying and that I just have to flip it open and dump the contents into a trash can. It's also quite easy to bait. I use a smear of peanut butter near the deepest part of the trap and so far, I caught two mice in one night.I'm a huge fan of these traps and have pretty much all of the logical paths in the house covered.Highly recommended.
B001DKTHNC I put a normal mouse trap and this electronic one my garage. The old one caught 2 mice, this one none. It's been a pretty slow winter for catching mice, so I 'll keep on giving it a chance.
B001DKTHNC We had a mouse roaming our basement and I decided to try this thing out.  Always looking for a better mouse trap!  Well, I baited it with some high quality peanut butter and put it to work.  It's been more than two weeks and the thing has done nothing.  Maybe the mouse is too smart for it, but I suspect it's more a case of the better mouse trap just isn't.  Some reviews say it worked for them, but for me it did absolutely nothing.
B001DKTHNC Personally I hate killing anything. I often trap bugs and let them go outside unless they are the stinging or biting kind. Wasps don't make good pets. :-) So anyhow onto the mouse thing. I was using the usual spring loaded mouse traps. We get about 6 to 8 of the critters that move into the house in the fall looking for a good place to get warm and find food. I set traps in the kitchen which is where they come out when the lights go off, or when there isn't any activity in the room for a while. I hate it when I am sitting in the living room and I hear the trap snap because I know there is some mouse stuck in there fighting for his life until he is suffocated from a blocked wind pipe.I finally broke down and bought a Hav-A-Hart trap.Havahart 1020 Live Animal Two-Door Mouse Cage TrapFor the first week they wouldn't go in it even though it was loaded with peanut butter, and then finally I caught one. It seemed like after that I was catching one per night. I am only surmising this but I think since the mouse was in the trap all night and alive that the mouse dropping and whatever tainted the trap, and then other mice figured this is where everyone goes. The only problem with Havahart traps is that you need to go for a ride in the car to drop off the trapped critter. If you just let them go outside in your yard they already know the way back in. In some states it is illegal to release them which brings me to the next subject and that is just how dangerous mice are.My father's sister's daughter had a child who was playing with a ball that a mouse had urinated on and then the child put his hands into his mouth and died from the disease he caught from the mouse. The big plague that hit the US in the early 1900's that killed people like they were flies, and no one could figure out how it was getting spread until they finally figured it out; it was being spread by the fleas that were on the mice. The mice would enter the home with fleas, and then the fleas would setup residence in the home, and when they bit the people they got the plague. So they eradicated the mice and the plague stopped. So that is why in some states it is illegal to capture and release mice.So just how good is the Victor Pro Electronic mouse trap? It is April now so mice are rarer than they are in the fall, but I did see some dropping so I knew at least one got in. So what I did was spread some peanut butter on the inside of the trap. Let me stop right there. There isn't any ideal place to put the peanut butter other than on the every end of the trap all the way inside. That end plate has a bunch of little holes in it. So when you put the peanut butter in there, what happened in my case is a mouse came up from the outside, and stuck his tongue in the holes and licked the sampling of peanut butter, but did not go around the other end of the trap end enter. A whole week went by and still no one entered. So I finally created a choice. I placed the used Havahart trap down, and both of them sat side by side, and the very next morning there was a mouse in the Havahart. In all fairness it took a week in order to get them to go in the Havahart as well. So this experiment is not exactly what I would call clinical conditions.My impression what that the entrance to the trap looked kind of small and ominous. It is dark inside. It is a narrow pathway. There isn't anything inside for a mouse to feel like other mice have been there. Maybe if I baited them part way into the trap and then got a few droppings around, or in it that would have produced better results. So all in the entire mouse catching, or disposing problem is just that a problem. My main attraction to the Victor is that after the fall harvest of mice catching is done, this may be a good, and more attractive way to leave something set in order to catch that stray mouse. It is kind of a set it and forget it. Since others have had success with it, I am sure after a while it would work, and then just like the Havahart it would become a very efficient killing machine.The one thing that is very important here is that mice like to go where your food is. They are not potty trained so if you leave food out they will crawl all over it and drop what could be a life threatening package onto your food. Mice are not to be taken lightly no matter how cute they are. Even their droppings on the floor that dehydrate and them become powder only to be swept up causing a little cloud in the air; that can make you seriously sick as well. I think I am going to give the Victor a longer chance to work and try baiting it closer to the entrance. If I get much different results I will let you know.
B001DKTHNC They say, \"The early bird gets the worm, but it's the second mouse that gets the cheese.\" This seems to be the premise behind the design of this trap. The first mouse get zapped, and to other mice will follow him in and get free food... only to get zapped themselves.Sometimes when I sit in my office working at the computer I can hear mice scurrying around in the ceiling above my head. I've also found remains of mouse nests in the second-floor bedroom. I picked this trap from Vine in the hopes of catching the little critters.After reading the instructions and installing the batteries, I placed the trap where I knew the mice would find it. It took a couple of days, but I did catch one mouse in it. But the other mice were apparently not fooled. I also haven't heard much scurrying around up there lately, so maybe I got the only one... but I doubt it.So the mouse \"electric chair\" does work, but I need more mice to find out if this multi-trap works as designed. If I get the chance to catch more I will report back.
B001DKTHNC It's hard to review this because I don't know whether or not there were any mice in the room where the trap was set. There were mice there at one time but it's possible that they left and went down to the garage, where we did catch 4 mice with other traps. That was a month ago. I haven't caught a mouse in any of our traps since then.This did seem fairly easy to set.
B001DKTHNC While poisons like warfarin work, I don't like to use them around the house where pets or children might find them. This electronic trap is marvelous. You just put in the batteries, bait it with something like peanut butter, place it where mice go (mouse droppings are a clue) and turn it on.  To get to the bait, the mouse has to straddle two metal plates and thereby completes the circuit and gets zapped.  The low voltage gets stepped up by a simple shocker mechanism - lethal to mice but safe for people (but no need to try and zap yourself!).  Disposal of zapped mice cleanup is easy.  I know that the blurb speaks of having a dozen of these traps in place but if you don't have a huge infestation, you might only need one - that's all we needed.  I'm pretty sure the batteries will last for many uses.
B001DKTHNC We live out in the country on a farm and we always have mice.  We have trapped them from time to time using traditional mouse traps.  I set this trap in our basement where I have a few traditional traps set.  I had no luck after a couple of weeks so I moved the trap out to our feed room in the barn. There are always mice there and I routinely catch them.  Over the next couple of weeks I caught several mice in the traditional traps in the feed room but didn't get anything with this hi-tech electronic trap.  I'm not ready to say the trap doesn't work, but I am saying it hasn't worked for me.  I will continue to use it and will report back if I have any luck.  At this point I can't recommend buying this trap.  As I said, I'm sure it works, but it hasn't worked for me.Update:  5/14/2013 - I started catching mice!!!  I was surprised but happy to see I began catching mice in my barn.... 6 so far.  I didn't do anything different than before, but the hits have been consistent and the mice haven't even made it to the bait before being zapped.
B001DKTHNC We live in a completely wooded area and have mice, voles, etc. getting into the garage, particularly in cold weather.  We don't like using poison for two reasons, one is we have dogs and two the mouse can die anywhere and you have to find it.We used to use Victor M130 traps but the mechanism would often, very often, break after one/two/three uses and while they are inexpensive this does add up.  We currently also use Ortho Press and Set which hold up well but often don't spring with a vole or small mouse so you find the food gone but no mouse.As for the Victor M250.  First nice thing, while in a plastic package the package was easy to open, you don't need heavy duty siccors.  Second, it comes with the four batteries needed to use so you are spared looking for batteries.  And a really nice feature (which at first I didn't notice and thought \"where are the instructions\"), the instructions are stamped onto the back of the trap so you don't have to either keep them somewhere or just try to memorize them, though its pretty simple.Set up was easy, make sure the on/off switch is set to off, install batteries (the battery compartment even had a piece of cloth to make battery removal easy), and you know you're OK if the light blinks as per instructions when turned on.  I put some peanut butter at the far end of the trap chamber, which is optional.And everything worked!  Only issue is I don't really think the trap chamber will hold 3 mice as claimed without them just being wedged in and hard to get out, even two stacked up would be hard to empty.  Note:  Since we get mice 2-3 days a week in the winter I do check my traps everyday so probably would never get more than one.  Can't really comment on durability but seems well made and can't comment on if there would be an issue with the trap if it ever has to be cleaned out if a mouse left in too long and, for example, sticks to trap itself.Summary:  while expensive I think this is worth it since many traps do seem to break after a few uses and this one really does seem like it will hold up well since it doesn't have springs, etc.  Plus you don't have to worry about getting your fingers caught, there is nothing worse then setting a loaded trap down and having it, for no reason you can figure, snap closed.
B001DKTHNC We got this trap at the end of a long fight with a family of mice. The trap is very easy to set up and looks like it should work but I never go to find out if it worked because our glue traps did the job and finished them off. However, I have left it out, just in case and do check for its light that tells you if it caught one.
B001DKTHNC It works great!  I had a pesky mouse that decided to make my barbeque a home during the winter months leaving all sorts of debris and mouse droppings.  Not a good thing.  I put in the batteries (included) put a little peanut butter inside and the next morning I had the little bugger!No danger of getting shocked.  It deactivates when you open it.  Touching the mouse is not a problem, you just open it up and depose of it where ever you dispose of mice bodies.  This is a lot easier to set than a traditional mouse trap and again very efficient.  Highly recommended.
B001DKTHNC I had a problem with a rodent chewing at a birdseed bag I kept on the concrete floor of a storage area in my Florida home.  I tried this mousetrap as well as conventional rat and mousetraps baited with both peanut butter and Slim Jims, but all to no avail.  Something kept nibbling at the bag each day.  So then I put it in a covered plastic bin with this trap and others surrounding it and on top of it.  Little bugger avoided all the traps, chewed through the plastic and got to the bag the next night!  I finally decided I wasn't going to enable birds anymore and got rid of the bag, but I left the traps out.  Never caught a thing. . . .  But, in the trap's defense, maybe the nibbler wasn't a mouse.In the past, I had rats in my attic and \"caught\" those by setting conventional spring snap traps (Victor Rat Trap  M201) along the attic borders.  Used Slim Jims as bait.  Worked fine.  I wouldn't plunk down a lot of dough on electronic gizmos when the old way works . . . well, most of the time.
B001DKTHNC Honestly, I was a bit skeptical, at first.  I have a \"closet\" on the patio of my condo which houses the AC unit and various other things.  I put the trap inside, and after just a few hours. . .  ~Z~A~P~ a mouse was dead.A couple of things. . . . First, it's true that there is very little information / instructions on the package.  That's why I've added the information below, which I think you will find VERY helpful.  Second, it states that this trap can hold up to three mice.  Well, I don't really see how that's possible.  Once one mouse is dead inside, I don't know how other mice are supposed to get in. . . or why they would want to, being that there is a dead mouse there already.  For this reason, I don't know that this trap is any better than the model M2524 which is a couple of $$'s less expensive.  Nonetheless, I've actually ordered a second one of these, because I like it so much.Victor M2524 Electronic Mouse TrapThe below information is from \"CF\" from the black version, model M2524.  I found the information to be VERY helpful.1. First and foremost, people overbait these traps BIGTIME. (See the 2nd photo provided by a customer.) If some of that huge mass of peanut butter falls onto the metal floor-plate, the trap zaps the peanut butter and de-activates! Mice can now come in and dine on the peanut butter. She said to just put a TINY dab of peanut butter on the far wall (opposite the entrance). Use a toothpick. Or spread a very thin smear of it with a knife. Mice have a very acute sense of smell, and that's what draws them in. They don't need any more bait than that.2. The mouse has to contact BOTH metal plates in order to get zapped. And both plates have to be clean of debris. That means after you catch a mouse, take a Q-tip or whatever, and remove any hair, any little spot of urine, whatever, from the metal plates. This is not a squeamish job at all and they don't come anymore squeamish than I am! (I do shuddering freak-outs at the sight of a mouse, dead OR alive.) There was a teensy smear of liquid (I assume urine) and two hairs that had shed off the mouse.3. Be aware that \"On\" means that the LINE icon side of the switch is pressed down. The CIRCLE icon pressed down means \"off.\" People get those confused. Turn it OFF when cleaning or baiting. Turn it ON once the trap is baited, and the top door has been snapped shut.4. The batteries go in with the flat side of the battery against the springs. And I have had battery connections with other things \"not work.\" I had this problem continuously with a radio. Finally, it dawned on me, give a little pull on the springs. One was coiled into itself just slightly. That fixed it. You need the springs to push against the batteries enough to hold the two tight against each end. And they need to be lined up straight, not crooked.5. When you bait the trap, close the door FIRMLY, and turn the unit on. You will see a green light BUT!!! it only stays on for 2 seconds! That green light is SUPPOSED to go off. It only goes on for the 2 seconds so that you can confirm that the unit is on, and it's working. Otherwise, if it stayed on all the time, it would eat battery life. So when it goes off, don't think, like I did, that there's an electronic failure.6. For safety reasons, the unit is designed so that when the door (over the maze and metal plates) is open, the unit will de-activate. I have no idea how the other reviewer shocked himself, but for sure, turn the unit OFF before tinkering around with baiting, cleaning plates, or messing with the batteries. In any event, when you set the trap, bait it, then double check to make sure the door is snapped closed. Then, and only then, turn the unit on. You will see the green light for about 2 seconds, which shows you it's working and ready to go. Then the light goes out. If you open the door again (and she didn't say this but I have a feeling it's the case), turn the unit off and then on again after the door has been shut.7. Once a mouse has been zapped and is inside, the light will flash on and off to let you know. NOTE! The light only flashes about every 7 seconds. A quick glance at it is not enough, there could be a dead mouse inside and you could miss the cycle of light flashing. So look at it for 7 seconds.
B001DKTHNC Sounded great, but did not seem as effective as those old fashioned spring traps I was hoping for better results. It did catch a few mice
B001DKTHNC Great mouse traps. an upgrade to the wooden ones. My mice were licking the peanut butter off the wooden ones so i got these to try. the same night i caught one. These things will get them becaue they have to get in there to get to the bait. They arnt used to electric traps yet!!!
B001DKTHNC It took awhile for a mouse to come along and we had to finally put it in the shed to catch one, but it works great. I hate the idea but then breaking their necks sounds awful too. At least this way it is quick. The light flashes when one is caught although since part of its tail was sticking out, I guess we didn't need the light.  My husband swears that you can only use regular mouse traps once, that the smell of death on them causes no other mice to come near them. They can get expensive if you had a lot. Since this is so quick, I doubt there's a smell to alert them and can be used over and over.  We have a problem with mice getting up under the truck and chewing the wires. You would not believe how much damage they have done over the years and the cost is adding up. Perhaps my husband can rig this up under there somehow.
B001DKTHNC Okay, so I was excited to get this.  No more Decon or other poison in the house - good thing, right?  Wrong.Placed this in the bathroom (mice seem to come in around the water heater pipes).  First baited it with peanut butter.  One week later, no dead mice, but lots of droppings.  So tried small grains (as recommended by the mfg), still droppings - no mice.  Tried bits of cotton, oatmeal and finally even cheese.  After a month of this, I was still cleaning up droppings around the trap, but still no dead mice.As an experiment, took the last pack of mouse poison and placed it against the wall.  Re-baited the trap with fresh peanut butter and positioned the trap in front of the poison pack.  Within 3 hours, the trap had been pushed out of the way and the poison was gone.Guess what I'm using in the future?  No, I would not recommend this trap at all.
B001DKTHNC The instructions are simple enough.  Install four AA cells in the battery compartment, bait the trap and turn it on.  I followed those instructions but all I accomplished was feeding the bait to a mouse or mice.The trap came packaged with four new AA cells.  I installed them in the trap, baited the trap, turned on the power, observed a green \"ready\" light and placed the trap where I knew mice had been.  The next morning the green light was off and the bait was gone, but there were no dead mice.  When I installed fresh AA cells, put fresh bait in the trap and turned it on for another try, the green light glowed briefly, the trap made a quiet buzzing sound and then the light went off indicating that the trap was ready.  The next morning a conventional spring trap next to this trap had caught a mouse but no mice were electrocuted and the bait was still in the electronic mouse trap.Instructions packaged with the trap say that four AA cells will electrocute 100 mice before they need to be replaced.  I enjoy and appreciate the benefits of modern technology, but my Victor M250Pro Professional Electronic Mouse Trap appears to be ineffective, or at the very least, not as effective as old-fashioned spring traps.Although Victor seems to always be trying to make the \"better mousetrap\", theirVictor Easy Set Mouse Trap  4 Pack  M038remain most effective for me.  If cost is an issue, this electric mousetrap is more than twenty times as expensive as their spring traps.  If it had worked for me as advertised, it might be worth the extra expense for the convenience, but for me it has not worked at all.  When or if it does, I'll be thrilled to come back to this review and report it.
B001DKTHNC I am still looking for the ultimate verminator.  My neighborhood is adjacent to an open field,which is infested with thousands of field mice.  Under normal circumstances, the mice stay in theirown environment.  However, from time to time, we get overrun with the filthy critters.  This winterwas especially bad.There are locations where the traditional Victor neck-breaker cannot be used; small kids and dogsmight blunder into them.  I first evaluated the Victor M265 Kill & Seal Mouse Trap and found itwoefully inadequate.  The mice could not get to the bait easily; they seemed to be confounded bythe plastic \"house\" enclosure.This electrocution device appeared to be an economical solution.  In actual use, though, the oldVictor snap-trap could not be beaten.  The first week's body count was 7 on neck breakers, oneelectrocuted.  The next week saw 3 killed by traditional traps with none electrocuted.  The invasionhas finally dissipated, and Victors' traditional traps saved the day.This electronic trap is not at all intuitive.  Baiting it can be confusing and could cause anelectrical short.  Then, there is a single entry point for the vermin.  I have sketched in threesuggested entry sites for Victor engineers to consider.  Additionally, I bend fuzzy pipe cleanersand suspend them from the perforated end piece of the trap.  The fuzzy wire enables me to slatherpeanut butter bait on the suspended wire.The mice have to see or smell the bait first, and they require easy access to the electrocutionplates.  The old-fashioned trap had walk-right-in visibility and direct access to mouse heaven.The bait was never hidden by an unnecessary \"house\" of plastic.I think the only good mouse is a dead one.  They are filthy vermin and not at all cute.  Sorry,Mickey, but I am a Donald Duck fan.  Someone should tell Victor to stop hiding the bait and useall that plastic to entice vermin into the electrocution zones.I am really disappointed in this unit.  Yes, it works.  The old-fashioned stuff works BETTER!Another bit of heresy:  I stumbled across an interesting bait:  WD-40(!?!?)  I saw two mice eagerlysniffing about a can of the stuff in my patio.  I decided to saturate a piece of cardboard with WD-40and inserted it into a Victor neck-breaker.  The next morning resulted in a dead mouse.  WD-40 works!Few people realize that WD-40 is little more than perfumed FISH OIL.If you are stuck with using the electrocution method, spray WD-40 at the single entry port andsaturate a pipe cleaner (with peanut butter or more WD-40) suspended from the perforated end of thetrap.  If pipe cleaners are difficult to find, use a bent paper clip and secure a bit of cardboardto it.  Otherwise, WD-40 would surely cause an electrical short if it reaches the floor electrocutionplates.  Some people can't stand its odor, while others aren't fazed. Mice love it - isn't that thepoint?The world will not be beating a path to Victor's door; they have not perfected the mouse trap; Victorhas confounded mice with a trap that doesn't look like a trap, has no easy access to bait, much lessadequate instructions to attract mice.  There is no such thing as Einstein Mickey Mouse or Frank LloydWright Mickey Mouse, which this trap supposedly attracts.  Be patient - a suicidal mouse will eventuallyblunder onto the electrocution surface and get its nuts fried.
B001DKTHNC I tried peanut butter, and cat food. But neither attracted any mice.I keep checking and there new mice poops, but the light is still off and no critters are inside.the light does go on when I turn it on, so I know the batteries are good.
B001DKTHNC Fortunately, I was not in the market for a mouse trap, but a friend of mine was, so I thought I'd help her out by snagging this from the Amazon Vine Program.  I'm afraid the product has been a bit of disappointment to her.  The mice aren't very attracted to it as a bait, but it's gathered a lot of ants, one small lizard, and several palmetto bugs.  It may have something to do with the Florida heat, but the product wasn't as impressive as we'd hoped it to be.  She's leaving it out and continuing to give it a chance.  If she nabs the pesky little rodents that have been tap-dancing across her kitchen tile, I'll update the review.  But at this point, a family cat or a standard mouse trap might work better.
B001DKTHNC There is nothing worse than using those traps that crack your fingers, or the glue strips stuck to your sock, or feeding peanut butter to a family of rodents because the trap did not do anything.  Well, this unit is quite impressive, clean and useful.I have this in the basement, and only caught one mouse so far, but I know it's working.  You lift the lid and put in \"bait\", which for me is peanut butter.  You will see where to put it when lifted.  You snap the lid shut, place on floor, turn unit on and you get the confirmation beeps and flashes that it is set.  Easy.So, the fact that I only caught one mouse is not a bad thing.  I saw one mouse, and now I don't  So maybe I was lucky. But for it's convenience and clean appeal, I might just get another for the Summer.  So far so good, and no much better than pain and glue.
B001DKTHNC Gone are the days of almost snapping my fingers off when putting up mouse traps and having to actually look at dead mice once they are caught!We live near woods, so it is inevitable we always get some critters in our attic every winter.  This trap came with the necessary batteries (they were just taped onto the package for me) so all I needed to do was put the bait on the inside, (I used peanut butter) and put the batteries in and turn it on.  We did catch a couple mice in it and it was easy to open and just toss them into the garbage.I would recommend this product to a friend (and did!)
B001DKTHNC We have little mice who like to take up residence in the cupboard under our master bathroom tub (I think they come up from the crawlspace).  I prefer these zapper mousetraps to the other methods because it's the only method I'm not squeamish about handling all by myself.  I previously had a Rat Zapper Ultra but I didn't clean it out often enough and mouse pee messed up the electric plate, so it started giving me false trips.  I thought this Victor mouse trap would take its place quite nicely, but so far, no mice.  I know the mice are there in the cupboard, I see the mouse droppings, but I think the entrance to this Victor trap is just a little too small to be inviting.  Claustrophobic mice, you know how they are.  The Rat Zapper is like a giant welcoming cave by comparison, and I think I'll end up getting another Rat Zapper if this Victor trap doesn't produce any results in the next month or so.  I'll update this review if I do catch any mice with this trap.
B001DKTHNC I know the mice are there.  I can hear them in the walls, late at night when it's absolutely quiet, I can hear the scampering, the dastardly scuttling of their dirty little clawed feet, sneaking their way up from the crawlspace and into my house, up in the attic.  I know they're there.  And their little dead bodies keep showing up in the glue traps that we keep around the house.So, I keep ordering different mousetraps, and waiting for one of them to actually work.  The green stretchy-O-ring thing while very cool in concept didn't work, and so far this one doesn't either.  I've had it in place and activated since the day it arrived, two-odd months now.  I've checked the battery and function, and re-baited it with fresh delicious peanut butter every two weeks on the occasion of moving this trap to a new location, and yet I've gotten no electro-fried mice.  Very disappointing.Yet in this time the glue traps have yielded three.So what is it?  What's the point of failure here?  Well, the glue traps are passive.  They just sit there and the critter runs into it, and that's that, agonizing death by dehydration, the struggle making everything worse and worse and worse.  Man, the imagined agony of such an end, fruitless struggle yielding nothing more than increased immobility, alone, weaker and weaker...but I digress.  This product, while looking and seeming cool, is a closed tunnel the critter has to enter, in a clean plastic case, with wires and electronics and voltage.  I'm no mouse, but this thing is very much out of place in my normal rodentified environment scuttling along the floorboards, so even though I can smell yummy, yummy peanut butter somewhere inside it, I also sense and smell plastic and metal, and my little mouse sense may very well detect some kind of electromagnetic field anomaly in and around this thing.  If I, a normal human animal, were to run into something like this as I walked around the block, up-sized for a human, say a gigantic plastic house, out of the blue, not there previously, right in my path and smelling of delicious barbeque or spicy clam dip, yet subtly humming, I don't think I'd go in to investigate.  I know I'm anthropomorphizing beyond all reason, but I just can't otherwise figure out why in my experience with getting rid of household vermin, the simple works and the complex fails.Bottom line: this looks cool and the concept is awesome: send Mickey to the chair!  But in practice, this device has failed to deliver on its fundamental purpose, and this in a target-rich environment.
B001DKTHNC We received this item through Vine for review.  We have been dealing with mice in our motor home ever since we got it almost 7 years ago.  We live in an oak forest and park the motor home next to the house.  We've tried all sorts of mouse deterrents but have come to realize the only thing that really works is to trap or poison the rodents.  If you trap you need to make sure to check the traps regularly.  I do this at least weekly and in addition I monitor part of the motor home with an infrared video camera.  I have video of mice walking over and through sticky pads and spring traps!  The Victor M250Pro was easy to get into operation and I like that there is an indicator light that I can monitor with the video system to see if it has captured any critters.  We had the Victor running continuous for a few months now and so far have not seen any mice, so no opportunity to see the Victor in action.  If the mice start to come in again this spring and the Victor has a chance I'll update the review.
B001DKTHNC These caught those pesky mice! They've been sneaking into our garage and nibbling our boxes. I put some peanut butter in these and they worked great! Great product!
B001DKTHNC I deployed the M250Pro along withVictor Easy Set Mouse Trap  4 Pack  M038. After several weeks, not a single mouse entered the M250Pro. All 4 of the Easy Set traps I placed, however, caught mice.  I baited the electronic trap with peanut butter; same as the Easy Set trap. I'm giving it two stars, rather than 1, because I have no reason to doubt the device will shock any mouse silly enough to enter it. I'm sticking with the Easy Sets.
B001DKTHNC I was recently commenting to my wife that a mouse trap should send out an electric voltage to kill a mouse instantly (but be safe to a human), and woo-hoo, it's as if Amazon heard us and pulled out Victor's electronic mouse trap!We tried using several methods to kill some mice in our house an found that they don't really work as :(1) Mice baits kill the mice sometime later and you may not be able to find the dead & rotting mouse.(2) Mice traps doesn't work as the mouse tend not to venture to unfamiliar items - trick is to place food w/o activating the trap then activate the trap several weeks later.(3) Mice glue trap doesn't work as the glue is not sticky enough especially if you just place in on the ground - trick is to place them on the wall as mice body brushes along the walls to move about.Watch out mice, it's zapping time!Sorry to the folks who love their mickey mouses :p
B001DKTHNC Victor M250Pro Professional Electronic Mouse TrapParaphrasing the old adage of \"build a better mouse trap and the world will beat a path to your door\", this does seem like a better mouse trap.  I am pretty much addicted to gadgets.  This mouse trap is a gadget.  Since I haven't gotten any mice yet, I can't comment on its effectiveness.I like the fact that it included batteries.  I think the instructions with the trap should be clearer as to baiting.  It needs to have bait to work and the instructions on the packaging do not make that glaringly apparent.  I am surprised they haven't come up with an electronic air freshener type of bait to go with this electronic trap.  I am using peanut butter but so far no mice.  Of course I haven't seen any mice in my other traps so I have to reserve judgment.  I will report back if any fried mice appear.  I have to go with four stars based on price.  If it starts filling up with mice, I may have to come back and revise my stars.
B001DRJE1K It reads on the back, \"Not for children under 6 or to be used around pets\". \"Wash off skin while inside\".So, this is pretty much useless if you have an indoor mosquito and tick problem like I do. I travel and work on a freight boat where mosquito and tick are common amongst the dirty, smelly crew. I sleep in a hammock.The active ingredients cause skin burn, nose rash and general discharge of the eye Mucous membrane. So if you need it to sit on a sofa or bed, you'll get the active ingredients all over the place.

B001DRJE1K Most of the insect repellent products on the market today are based on DEET, which was originally developed by the U.S. Army during WWII to protect the troops from bugs in jungle warfare.  The EPA states that DEET is generally safe for consumer use, although a Cornell University study showed that some employees of the Everglades National Park who used DEET extensively at work seemed to exhibit ill effects such as insomnia, mood swings, or other cognitive impairments.  Furthermore, DEET may damage synthetic fabrics, leather, and plastics.  (A newer insect repellent Picaridin, which is as effective as DEET, is safe on plastics.)In light of what I learned, I decided to try this lemon eucalyptus oil based spray for a change, after using a DEET aerosol for years.  Compared to the DEET aerosol, this lemon eucalyptus oil was more viscous and sticky and burned slightly when applied to the skin.  The pump gave out after only a couple of sprays, but the product worked as expected: it warded off the bugs for the couple of hours I spent working in my backyard.  After I washed the product off my skin with a water hose, there was still a burning sensation on delicate tissues such as the corners of my eyes and mouth, and bugs started to hover around me.  This was not so when I used DEET.In conclusion, this lemon eucalyptus oil is a viable alternative to DEET, if you don't mind the slight burning sensation.  See my comment below for purchase information.
B001DRJE1K I'm one of the unfortunate people that mosquitoes love. No matter where I go, I am always the first to get bitten. My bites can swell up to the size of a quarter, and particularly bad ones can itch for a week, so it is with great relief that I discovered Repel last summer.I am happy to report that this is very effective for a mosquito lightning rod like me and against such a vicious enemy as the Asian tiger mosquitoes in my area. They've out-competed the brown mosquitoes we used to have, which only bite during the morning and dusk/evening and are quite docile by comparison. Asian tigers are active all day and night and very efficient at finding their prey. They're quicker, meaner, and more prolific. Stepping into the garden without my Repel means 6-8 bites within minutes. Unlike browns, the bites of Asian tigers also hurt.Ease of use:------------The pump is very easy to use. It creates a fine mist that can be rubbed in to distribute. The mist gives your skin a bit of a sheen, since it contains oils. The smell is pleasant, though you may wish to hold your breath while spraying, in order to prevent accidental inhalation. You may need to apply generously, depending on your level of mosquito attraction.Environmental and Safety Considerations:----------------------------------------The active ingredient p-Menthane-3,8-diol is made from eucalyptus leaves, so you can feel easier about using it. I also bought OFF! Deep Woods Long Lasting Insect Repellents along with this product, but was concerned about DEET getting absorbed into my skin. Repel, on the other hand, is plant-based and much safer to use as well as environmentally more responsible. p-Menthane-3,8-diol poses no risk to humans or animals, according to the EPA, so you don't have to worry about poisoning if you have children or pets.
B001DRJE1K We first used this on a camping trip two years ago, and have been sold on it ever since - it's hard to find in stores so I'm glad I can get it from Amazon.  It works every bit as well as, if not better than, the common deet-containing sprays, but it smells a LOT better, plus you don't have to worry about inhaling the overspray, or getting it onto your hands and therefore inevitably into your mouth, etc.  (I mean sure, deet is probably still safer than west nile virus, but you never know what it will do to you years down the road.)  We had given up hope that a deet-free repellent could actually work (most of them don't, and are greasy to boot!) but this one truly does - it kept us bite-free camping in the Caribbean, and if that's not a real test of a bug repellent, I don't know what is!Be careful though and look closely at the label when you buy it - the makers of Repel have recently broken down and started making a version of their product that does contain some deet, in order to try and woo the \"it can't possibly work without deet\" market, but that version sort of defeats the entire purpose of using an organic product, you know?  If you are concerned about deet, the regular version of Repel is the way to go.
B001DRJE1K My family and I used this during a week-long camping trip to Lassen National Park in early spring.  Here is our experience in brief:Pros*  Pleasing scent - We found the scent to be pleasing, if a bit strong at first.  It does smell of eucalyptus and lemon and not of chemicals, which is nice.  Though strong at first, it quickly dissipates to a more mellow background aroma*  Effective - The mosquitoes against which we used this product were extremely aggressive and voracious, drilling through layers of clothing that I had thought would stop them.  They didn't.  When giving our exposed skin and clothing heavy doses of this, we noticed an immediate effect:  The skeeters would hover around, but not come near, and certainly would not land on us.Cons*  Awkward and ineffective pump - The spray pump worked well enough when it worked, but was stiff to operate.  Besides that, it would frequently experience some kind of vapor lock and would cease to function, requiring us to take it off and apply the product by hand.  It may be that we got a bad bottle, and I'll allow for that as the rating I give is only for the product, not the packaging.  Still, I think it's important to report on our experience, especially as the package affected our use of the product.*  Short Term Effectiveness - Mind you, I've read the studies and reviews of this product and also the many glowing reviews and all I can do with this review is report on our direct experience of this repellent.  While noticeably very effective at first, we experienced a sharp drop off of performance well before six hours.  I would expect a gradual tapering off of performance of any similar product, either of manufactured or natural derivation.  But we experienced significant intrusion of mosquitoes after two hours' time.  (that is to say, they were landing on us and sucking our blood)  Others' experiences can - and obviously do - vary; to what extent the variety of mosquitoes, climate, and personal chemistry play into 
B001E6QVM0 This brush and the other brush I bought are just a good or better than the brushes I bought from my pool store and paid a lot more for.I will be using these from now on... Thanks
B001E6QVM0 It's a pool brush works very good to scrub the bottom of your pool just like it's supposed to do will fill your standard pole.
B001E6QVM0 Good quality & Price. Very happy and I think I will have it for years to come. Store indoors when not in use...
B001E6QVM0 This brush and the other brush I bought are just a good or better than the brushes I bought from my pool store and paid a lot more for.I will be using these from now on...
B001E6QVM0 This pool brush is the only one that I've found works on our pool. Our pool is a custom curved kidney-like design with curved corners and a connecting, in-ground circular spa. The curved outer parts of this brush work great for all of those otherwise frustrating rounded nooks. The brush head is nice and long too, so it's great for brushing the bottom of the pool in long swoops.The one negative thing that I can say about this item is that it started shedding. Now, I find this understandable due to the fact that we do live in Florida, and this plastic-bristled brush was regularly used in chlorinated water, which will eventually eat away at any plastic. There were also times that we forgot to put it away in the garage, so it would sit in the sun outside. However I would like to point out that it was a good two years of this kind of neglect before it started shedding, but when it did, it did so with gusto. I do still recommend this brush though, and I am sure that this new one I just purchased will last longer as long as I remember to be nicer to it!
B001E6QVM0 The bristles on this brush will eventually snap off an liter the pool.  this is the fourth time I had to buy one.
B001E6QVM0 This brush gets around the curved corners in my in-ground pool much better than the straight-line brush I have been using.  It seems to be of a quality that will last.
B001F0K14Y This snippers are really sharp, I use them for just about everything. I'm able to cut through just about anything using these, including that stubborn plastic packaging you get every once in a while.These also work well on plants, it makes nice clean cuts.
B001F0K14Y If you know the name Fiskars, then you know their products are quality made and worth the price asked.  This Fiskers 9920 Garden Multi-Snip with Fiskars Sheath, is just that, Quality, versatility and a bargain at $12.47 and free delivery with a Prime membership.  I usually recover the price of my Prime membership several times over in a year.  These scissors cut clean and the knife is also sharpe.  The serrated knife edge handles poly and other ropes without much effort.  The little notch in the cutter is for cutting twist wire and light wire.  This is a great tool to have on your belt.  I love it.
B001F0K14Y I have a confession to make. I bought these for someone for a gift for Christmas but when they came, I kept them for myself.I love them!They come with their own sheath. I don't wear mine on a belt but it's nice for safety because this is sharp. They are snips and a knife in one. I just love them because they work perfectly and are extremely sharp.I may have to pick up another pair to actually give away this time.
B001F0K14Y This is a very handy tool to have for lawn and garden work.  It can cut and snip almost anything.  The belt holder makes it convenient to take with you as you work.  I highly recommend this item.
B001F0K14Y This tool is the  epitome of convenience. I use it primarily in my raised garden bed to trim the tomato plants and other functions. The scissors are very sharp and provide nice clean cuts. The wire cutter comes in handy as well when I use wire to provide support to my lightweight tomato cages by fastening them to bamboo poles. One outer edge of the scissors is also very sharp and comes in handy when a slice is needed in lieu of a cut. The other outer edge of the scissors is serrated. The case that is provided is the best way to carry this tool  because its sharpness has the potential to perform unwanted incisions to certain mid-body parts if carried in a pocket. This is an excellent tool.
B001F0K14Y These are great and versatile clippers.  They have a saw blade on one side of the shears, and are very sharp. They are light and easy to hold.  They come with a holster you can clip to your belt. I got them for my man for his birthday, and he loves them. Uses them all the time. He's a grower, builder and jack of all trades who appreciates a good tool. I am also a gardener, and have never been disappointed by Fiskars.
B001F0K14Y Not sure how good the sheath is - it has a belt hook - but how wears a belt gardening? Sheath is great for keeping them in when I put them back in the garage.
B001F0K14Y These are good snips at a good price and include a decent sheath.  They are very sharp.  be careful as the blad on the outside edge can be very dangerous 
B001F0K14Y Fiskars products are awesome. This tool seems very innovative and useful. Paired with pruners, you'll be all set for gardening and maintenance in your backyard.
B001F0K14Y Love these babys....always trimming and these work awesome...A must for the gardner!I like and enjoy working in my garden and these are very easy to use,easy unlock switch and seem to be very good quality...always with me when in my garden
B001F0K14Y Fiskars 9920 Multi-Snip cutter, does a good job of handling the kind of tasks it is intended for.  The blades are sharp, but rather short, and the cutter doesn&#8217;t develop a great amount of pressure, so it is best suited to cutting smaller diameter stalks, twigs, and branches.  The straight handles are rubber coated, and fit nicely in the hand.  The short pointed blades are easy to work with, as the cutter can be used with precision, cutting where you intend, and making this an excellent tool for fine pruning of smaller plants, flowers, vegetables, orchids, and bonsai.The cutter has a locking mechanism that is easy to operate even when wearing gloves.  In a questionable move, the spring that provides tension on the handle is exposed, which probably means that over time, it will either corrode, or get covered with dirt.The tool has added utility, with additional cutting edges on each of the blades.  On has a straight sharpened edge, while the other has a serrated edge.  Neither one of these blades is a suitable replacement for a knife, but in a pinch, they can be useful for cutting something small.The cutter comes with a nice nylon sheath for protection, which is a good idea, however when drawing the tool from the sheath, treat it like a knife, as the sharp cutting edges are dangerous, and the locking button sometimes becomes disengaged, causing the blades to spring open.  The sharpened tip and cutting edges, makes this a hazard if you happen to drop it.Overall, this is good product, but one that probably requires that you be more safety conscious than normal.  If you&#8217;re prepared for that, then it&#8217;s a very solid buy at $9.99, which is what I paid for it.
B001F5UY3M I have a 16 inch square pot that has a huge gardenia in it.  I was tired of toting and bending and trying to lift the thing as I moved it around on the patio.  Enter the plant caddy!  I love that this one has no edges so any size or configuration of pot should work.  It's very sturdy and easily rolls across my flagstone patio without getting stuck.  I also appreciate that it has a built in brake on the wheels so you can lock it if need be.  Overall it was perfect for me.
B001F5UY3M Expensive, but those plant carts in Walmart fall apart if you happen to want to move a plant. These are strong and have caster wheels on them.
B001F5UY3M After trying one of these from the local nursery (at a much higher cost), I was so pleased to find I could get more here for my other pots.  I find several benefits over other plant caddies.  My pots aren't anywhere near 500 lbs so I can't report on reliability when holding that much weight, but I do have two pots that probably weigh well over 100 when freshly watered.  I have these caddies under all the large pots on my deck now.I had been using a variety of less expensive caddies but most developed problems after a couple of years.  The wooden ones started breaking in different ways and on others the wheels tipped, broke off or rusted and would no longer turn.  I'd finally had it when I was moving all the pots for deck refinishing and noticed  two caddies holding heavy pots scratched the deck when I moved them.I bought more of this type to replace all the others before I moved the pots back into place to avoid scratching the new finish.  These roll easily and smoothly.  They are very sturdy and won't rot when wet.  I also like that they allow for pot drainage better than others that have a solid base.  They aren't decorative, but mostly you don't see them at all or just the wheels.As anyone with a wooden deck knows, setting a pot directly on the wood rots the deck floor over time so even if you don't need to move a pot often, or it's easy to lift, putting a caddy under it is a must and I've found this type has the most advantages.
B001F5UY3M This is very sturdy, very heavy duty, and very well made.  I have 2 very large ceramic planters that I bought these for.  They are not very pretty though.  They are not meant to be decorative.  I wish they were prettier, but they work so well I am giving them 5 stars.What I mean by not very pretty:I did measure then saucer my planter sits on, and ordered the correct size, as I did not want the edges sticking out.  However, even the small amount that shows is very industrial looking.  If you like an industrial look, you will like these.  It is just a personal style issue.
B001F5UY3M It's very sturdy and does a good job of holding my 15 gallon tree. Goes over bumpy concrete easily and the locking wheel is a plus. The only thing is that maybe I wish the 'arms' were an inch longer, but other than that, a good product that I think will last a long time in the weather.
B001FK81PU although this is the mini, i still get a lot of birds of various sizes. Cardinals, sparrows, titmice, chickadees, finches, nuthatches, even sometimes a blue bird (which if you know birds this is rare) etc.no squirrels on this one. Sometimes the seed I buy gets a little stuck in there bc it has peanuts in the mix, i just lightly tap the top and it all falls through. no big deal.its my favorite feeder I have so far. havent really noticed any water collection when it rains, thats a positive.
B001FK81PU no one goes near this. Birds or squirrels.tried 2 different kinds of bird food. They are eating from other feeders.I don't know why they won't eat from this one.If anyone knows please tell me?it looks nice, and is well made.
B001FK81PU Keeping my fingers crossed, but so far the squirrels have not been into this feeder.  I bought it to keep them out and it worked.  My only complaint is that the &#34;perches&#34; are rather small and very close to the feeder.  The cardinals haven't been successful in using it, although they've tried valiantly.  The smaller birds, however, are having a feast!  I realize this is the mini and perhaps a larger one would be better for the cardinals, although in looking at the pix on Amazon the perches still look small.
B001FK81PU This is one of two squirrel feeders I purchased during the summer. It has worked just as I hoped it would.
B001FK81PU Worth the extra money...Brome 1055 Squirrel Buster Mini 23.95 you can buy plastic ones for half the money...but I think it's worth it this will last longer.
B001FK81PU This feeder looks great and is a Christmas present for a friend so I can't speak to whether it will foil squirrels but we will find out!  I think my friend will like it!
B001FK81PU This turned out to be too small to meet the demands of my local finch population and I had to refill almost daily.  I ended up getting the larger buster feeder which holds much more feed.
B001FK81PU I put this out and the birds love it. All types of the smaller birds are attracted to it. I haven't seen a cardinal eat from it yet, but I have another feeder for them. I'm using black oil sunflower seeds right now in this feeder and it's like Grand Central Station...so many birds eating and many waiting their turn. I saw one starling *try* to eat at it, but he was too large to perch and bend down to get the food. The BOSS may have helped deter him as well. The squirrels try very hard to get at those seeds, but can't and just eat the ones that have fallen to the ground. I highly recommend.
B001FK81PU Everything said about this product is true and the birds do love it; squirrels cannot access it............BUT the &#34;clinging birds&#34; mentioned that love it include crows and grackles that clean it out in one day.  It is a &#34;mini&#34; ant those birds are &#34;maxi&#34;............this feeder is great for the sparrows, finches and chicadees............but they rarely get to use it because the designers FORGOT the larger birds who clean it out before they can get to it .Only 3 stars for quality but the designers need to watch more what the bird REALLY do and think about an external cage for the bigger birds that still lets in the smaller ones.....................I claim copyright on that one!!!
B001FK81PU The birds like the feeder and the squirrels can't get to it for me to test out the ability to repel them. The hanger is on the longer side so if space is an issue you may want to look at a different type. Filling it is very easy; unhook the hanger, life the cage and fill.UPDATE: This is the only feeder out of the five I have put on the feeding station that has NEVER been overtaken by squirrels. They do cost more than some of the others but are well worth the extra cost just in seed savings alone.
B001FK81PU So far it really works the squirrels have not gotten into it even though they have hung on it and tried hard.  Just don't forget to grease the  pole you hang it on.I plan to get another one....maybe a little bigger
B001FK81PU Several months ago I bought this feeder and it took the birds about 2 weeks to find it and begin to feed.  But once they did, I'm up to refilling it twice a day now. So today I got a second one and hung it on the other side of the yard.I've actually witnessed a squirrel failing to obtain seeds from it.  It was quite an entertaining display. Also, the large Grackles can't eat from it, but they will sit below it waiting for any seeds the little birds drop.
B001GJ3FIS Nozzle works well but doesn't have some of the spray patterns I like to use.  Will by buying Dramm in the future.
B001GJ3FIS My search for a replacement hose nozzle found this.The pros:+ Low cost, $6.24 + free shipping when I bought mine.+ Good product reviews.+ 8-way spray head.+ Sturdy metal base.+ Soft cushioned grip.+ Small size for easy gripping.The cons:- VERY difficult to reduce... control the water flow.  It's pretty much full on, or off! :(
B001GJ3FIS IF there were 'negative stars', this would earn some! Just one more of a product which obviously is foreign made with no &#34;quality control&#34;. This is just the latest in a series of purchases which only 'work' a couple months, before they crap out and become worthless
B001GJ3FIS I think this is a good product and I doubt if anyone would be disappointed with it.  I was hoping the jet spray setting might be a bit more powerful and I have seen similar products where that setting is more powerful.  Still, it's a solid product that should suit the needs of most folks.
B001GJ3FIS I dont know if its powerful grip on my hose is its fault, or the hoses, and it doesn't leak at all, but it's on there for good until someone with stronger hands than mine show up.
B001GJ3FIS This is not a heavy duty nozzle but it works fine.  It's fairly comfortable and it was not expensive.  I've been using it for a few months now with no issues and no leaks.  There is a triangle clip at the back that you can pull out to keep it running without holding the handle down.  This is a nice feature for my kids who's hands get tired of holding the handle.
B001GJ3FIS Does the job.
B001GJ3FIS We have spent two or three times more for other spray nozzles and they, of course, work well, but after a year or two, they are always broken.  Some have lifetime guarantees, so they are replaced free of charge, but spending $20 for a nozzle always seems to be extravagant.These seem to be well made, and, truly, the spray patterns work much better than our much more expensive nozzles.  No leaks at all and easily adjusted to change the setting.I do love these!
B001GJ3FIS Exactly what I needed to replace a few broken nozzles around the garden. This is well built and will last much longer than then cheaper made all plastic ones I replaced. Every spray pattern I need for gardening and using to clean off pavement, wash cars, etc.  I do agree with other reviews...&#34;jet&#34; setting is a bit weak. So knock off a star for that. Overall, very good product though. Save your money and pick this up.
B001GJ3FIS I couldn't be bothered to go to a DIY store just for a nozzle, so I ordered this one !  It works very well, so I am happy Id so :-)
B001GJ3FIS Works just fine.  It's much heftier than the last one that cracked from living in the garage- I anticipate this one will hold together better.
B001GJ3FIS I love this nozzle. it is great! there are multiple functions it can be used. Very handy to use when it comes to cleaning a car or spray water to ur garden!
B001GJ3FIS They seem to have quite a few metal parts and definitely feel more solid than plastic sprayers I have bought in the past.  I bought two and have yet to have one break on me in the past six months.  I've dropped them on the ground, on both on dirt and concrete, multiple times.
B001GJ3FIS Had this for 2 seasons so far & everything works as described by seller. Pretty durable at a decent price... so I would recommend.
B001GJ3FIS This was bought to use with the Expandable hose that I purchased. It has a variety of settings, making it easy to sprinkle delicate plants or wash off the bird seed from the deck. I recommend it to go with any hose, but it's especially great to use with the light weight Expandable hoses.
B001GJ3FIS This Viking 912600 8-Way Heavy Duty Spray Nozzle works really well and I can move around the yard and soak flower beds or clean off the walk, as well a other things.
B001GJ3FIS Ok product.  Not the best item at a great price.  It is already leaking within a few uses.  Try something else.
B001GJ3FIS Never expected it to work so well for the price.  I purchased a light thinner hose because those that &#34;grow&#34; when you turn on the water have horrible feedbacks.  Mine is white with a blue line, so I purchased this blue nozzle and it works great.  Water all my plants every day with it and it never gives me any trouble.
B001H1EPHK The jury's still out on these mouse traps.I was unable to catch any mice with them, but the mice disappeared from the house. There was no additional intervention, thus I'm going to assume that placing two glue traps worked. (Maybe scared the mice away?)Generally speaking, I am opposed to the glue traps because of the violent death that befalls the mice that get trapped (the mice starve to death), but I am also opposed to an infestation of mice, especially where children and other pets are concerned.
B001H1EPHK The mice and I have been having a tough ground war ever since the neighbors decided to re-do their mini-barn and several families of mice turned our house into their own personal refugee camp.Anyway, we've used traditional traps, regular glue traps and these covered glue traps. We've killed lots and lots of mice but it took a LOOOOOOONG time for this covered trap to actually catch anything. It looks like it would work great (mice like tunnels) but it did not.
B001H1EPHK I live in the country and mice getting into the house is a fact of life. I have no qualms about killing them - they are disease carrying rodents with no business being in my house. On the other hand, I hate the job of setting a trap and later discarding the carcass. I am always on the lookout for that perfect trap for my use.Pros: these worked. I had two traps to try & each caught a mouse. And they are simple to use.Cons: both mice were still alive when I removed the traps. I know this can happen with the old-fashioned bait and snap-to-trap types, too, but it is rare. Usually with those the neck is broken and the mouse dies quickly. Not all the time, I know, but mostly. Plus these ortho glue traps are too expensive for one-use traps, at least on amazon, at $3 per trap even with free shipping.So for me, this trap is neither as effective as the old-style nor more suitable for my use.
B001H1EPHK I live in an apartment complex, and if you ever have, you know there's always some kind of creepy-crawly lying around.  Gives me the heebie jeebies!  BUT - glue traps are most useful.  I have never had a problem with mice, and so I don't use these for that, but I do cut out the bottom sticky portion and set them in the corners of my place.  I am always finding a gross millipede or spider stuck to them.  I know, disgusting right?  Well, better stuck to this than in my bed!  I do wish the glue area was bigger, but I'm sure for catching mice, it is the standard size.  I don't think these have any \"attractant\" smell to them: some of these things usually smell like food to mice.  But - I do like them and find them useful.  I also noticed the paper backing on these is quite heavy duty, and has a waxy coating to it.  I've never seen that before - but - since I cut them up and lay them flat, it makes no difference to me.
B001H1EPHK This is a very simple and effective (albeit not particularly humane) method of pest control.  The simple glue pads are easy to stick out of the way - and effectively catch mice, and even big bugs.
B001H1EPHK Call me old-fashioned, but give me swift, snapping death over the effect of these traps. The mouse gets stuck, then gets more and more stuck the more it struggles to get free. Certainly this works, but it is a little horrific, isn't it, to see the wild-eyed little bugger freaking out on there, squealing for help and mercy... Maybe this does a better job with very small mice that might not spring a traditional trap... But I'll be \"sticking\" (get it?) with traditional traps.
B001H1EPHK I apologize in advance for being negative on this product.  As well for inserting my own value judgement into discussion of the efficacy of this consumer product, but it's germaine in this case, I think.Typical of Ortho products, this Home Defense Max Covered Glue Trap is high quality and works as designed. My problem is with what this is designed to do . . . .Continuing, I am ok with exterminating (killing) pests.  Including mammals.  It's part of life and the food chain, with presumably humans at the top.  And I am not a vegetarian or environmental activist. But in my estimation, where possible the extermination must be humane and instantaneous - I apply this to all mammals, reptiles, and birds (I'm on the fence on fish).  The concept is the same whether for a mouse or a coyote.These traps function by gluing the mouse to the floor of the paperboard container where, terrified, it struggles to exhaustion and eventually starves/thirsts to death (either in place or after a person has deposited it in the trash using the handy carrying tab).  Unacceptable.These traps are useful, however, for trapping crawling insects.  I place one near the corner of my sliding patio door to capture insect that manage to sneak in through small openings.  In the event of a mouse problem, I will resort to the old instant-kill spring-loaded trap.
B001H1EPHK If you've dealt much with mice, then you're familiar with the basic traps. You've got everything from the overly elaborate humane traps which often fail in my experience, to the cheap little $.50 traps which tend to smack your finger more often than the mouse. Personally, I prefer a well built classic trap where the metal bar comes down on the mouse's neck. Yes I know it sounds brutal, but with those traps the mouse is usually killed instantly...though when he isn't it's truly not a pretty sight.If you're going to be putting down mouse traps on carpeting, you almost have to try glue traps like these. I don't think I need to explain why you might not want use classic traps on carpeting. We're adults here.  I should mention that these traps aren't for all locations.  You don't bait these traps, so they only work if you put it in an area where the mouse will walk through it.While they are effective, if you're at all squeamish, then you'll want to avoid these traps. They're essentially just a folded sheet of paper with some very powerful glue on it. If the mouse is captured you're going to see it and you're going to see it struggle and make noise. In my experience you don't have to worry about the mouse escaping, but depending on your personality it may upset you more seeing it suffer that way. If you don't want to deal with that, then I'd suggest getting glue traps that are covered so you don't see the mouse struggle or just covered regular traps so the mouse dies but you don't have to look at it and there's no mess.Now its time to say goodbyeto all our company.M-I-CSee you in HellK-E-YWhy?

B001H1GRPI I put this out this spring when the wasps began visiting our garden. They flew around and totally ignored it!Not recommended.
B001H1GRPI I have mainly used Rescue traps with the fishy smell and they work very well. This is worthless and OK for a few really dumb flies as everything rots inside. Attracts no hornets and very few yellow jackets. Waste of money and I have seen flies and YJ's walk in and walk out.
B001H1GRPI We live in a densely populated suburb and have a small backyard.  Recently, my kids came in screaming because there were paper wasps swarming all around their swingset.  I looked under the slide and found a nest the size of a softball had been created.  I waited until dusk, sprayed the thing with wasp killer, and 24 hours later, removed the huge nest.  5 days later, a new nest had formed about 3 feet away.  I sprayed that, and then 5 days later, another nest.I needed to do something---I have purchased traps at gardening centers before that required me to add fruit juice and some source of fat like tuna or meat.  They typically never worked for me.  Most of them seem cheaply built and the homegrown attractant seemed to attract ants (who somehow crawled into the traps), but no wasps.I bought the WHY Trap at Lowes, intrigued by both the shape and the fact that it included some sort of attractact.  I hung it on my back fence and waited.  About 24 hours later, I was a little upset to find it was filled with gnats, but no wasps.  48 hours later, 1 wasp.  5 days later, about 6 wasps.  Every day now, I find a few more wasps in it.  I do not know how many wasps it takes to establish a new nest, but it has been 4 weeks and I have not seen a new nest established on my property (after removing 3 nests in the course of a little more than a week before).  I am almost nervous that the site of dead wasps would keep new ones away, but it doesn't.  They want to get in so badly, but they can't figure out how to leave!The whole attractant system seemed complex (there are 3 different pieces), but for whatever reason, it worked great for me.  The bottom chamber seems to work better than the top one.  I also hung the trap against our sunny fence -- it gets very warm there and I figured the wasps would like it.  I can't speak for everybody else's experiences, but spending less than 1 Andrew Jackson to keep my kids safe from these wasps (and saving me from buying more wasp/hornet spray) is well worth it.  5 stars.
B001H1GRPI I like to sit on my deck and read and I was tired of swatting the yellowjackets away with my trust fly swatter, and so I browsed Amazon for wasp and yellowjacket traps. I found that they were all so poorly rated that I did not buy any of them. I had tried the large glass style trap that uses a sugar solution in the past, and it did nothing. I was left thinking that there was nothing to do but wait, for a freeze.The other day when I was in my local hardware store I noticed the WHY trap. I bought it in frustration and with little hope of it being effective. I should perhaps mention that the hardware store price was much higher.In the future I will come to Amazon, and I am on Amazon today to buy refills for the attractant.Within an hour of putting the trap up it was filled with yellow jackets. Maybe they are wasps. I was really very surprised!The enclosed brochure includes a lot of information about the differences, but I was too anxious to try the trap to pay much attention! The information provided is actually quite interesting and explains a lot about the behavior of these pests and when and why you should use the traps to be the most effective.I am, therefore,  perplexed at the low ratings this brand garnered here on Amazon.In my estimation, this trap works very well indeed ! I no longer have any issues when I sit on the deck - there are, perhaps one or two that will cruise on by, but nothing like it was before I hung the trap up! The instructions state that the attractant needs to be replenished every two weeks. That's why I gave this only 4 stars rather than 5, but, on the other hand, I really do understand the need for replenishment. It makes the trap more effective - so why not use it as it is supposed to be used?!The instructions also state that you need to \"... use 2-4 traps for a 10,000 square foot area or 8-16 traps per acre and, for heavy infestations, use a maximum of 48 traps per acre...\".I think that this is an excellent product and I am buying more attractant refills today. I am only using one trap for the deck area and I have had excellent results!
B001H1GRPI Like others, followed the instructions to the letter.  Yellow jackets completely ignored the trap, no interest in even investigating the neighborhood.  10 days, not a single bee or bug of any kind.  Going to try the shop vac next.
B001H1GRPI For years my parents have had wasp problem in the garage and backyard.  I bought this WHY TRAP earlier this spring in hopes that it would help eliminate part of the problem.  Initially I didn't catch any wasps with it.  However, I moved the trap to a different location in the yard and several days later had caught two wasps, a bee, some flies, and lots of Japanese lady bugs.  After empting the trap and refilling it with orange juice instead of water, we caught over twenty wasps.  I know there are websites that one can go to and see how to make a wasp trap using a two-liter bottle and a few other supplies, but I'm not a very good with crafts.  I bought this trap for a discount and using apple or orange juice instead of water seems to really help in catching wasps.  I like the design of the trap and for around $10, it's really not that bad of a deal.  It does work, but it's just a matter of placing it in a good location.
B001H1GRPI I wish I hand read the reviews here before I sunk my hard earned cash into this product.  To be quite frank it is absolutely worthless.  I actually have absolutely nothing against wasps, hornets and yellow jackets but they freak my nieces and newphews out when they visit.After placeing these around the outside of the house the stinging insects seemed to completely ignore them and went upon doing what every these critters do...eating and mating I suppose.Anyway, I will not be buying these again.
B001H1HHYS The mice at my house are completely ignoring these traps. The trap is very easy to bait and set  and the traps  are safe for pets and children.  Unfortunately our  mice ignore these traps so they have not helped with our mouse infestation. We have also put out some poison packs.  Water traps and a rent a cat are next.
B001H1HHYS We have an old house which is difficult to keep warm in the winter. It's warm enough for mice, though, and they get in the same way the wind does, I suppose. We have an electronic trap that electrocutes mice that walk inside looking for the peanut butter we leave for them. If the battery dies before a mouse comes in, however, the trap doesn't work. The Ortho Home Defense Max provides a non-battery-powered alternative - the disadvantage being the cost per trap.Put peanut butter in the bait area, set the trap, and place the trap gently in the pantry. Wait. If the trap goes off without trapping a mouse, it will read \"Trap not set.\" Reset the trap and repeat. We didn't have to go through this. We looked at the trap and the lever position indicated that a mouse had been caught. I confirmed this by looking in through the bait tray.The trap can be disposed of, in which case you've spent $4 to kill a mouse, or it could be reset. The latter isn't the most pleasing alternative since the trap now has mouse bits within. I suppose it depends where you want to keep the trap. For the pantry, we'll go with new traps each time. I like the idea that the mouse, if caught around food, is contained within a small plastic tomb rather than just lying there in the midst of your canned goods. And this trap is wonderful for the squeamish among you. If you don't want to see a dead mouse, this is your trap.Our cat, meanwhile, perks up a bit when he hears scampering, but in 13 years he's never caught a single mouse. Pitiful. At least I don't have to review the cat.
B001H1HHYS I was actually excited to try this.I have a house on my property that has not been lived in for over 5 years, sothere are mice in there.I have tried regular mice traps with better success then this one.Put two of these traps in the house. One on the kitchen counter, one on the floor.I used Skippy peanut butter, as themice like that better then the kind I grind at the market.But after a week of leaving this mouse trap in the house for almost two week,Not one mouse bothered with this trap!I can see mouse pooped, but NO Mouse in the trap, or tried to get in!!!Needless to say, I'm disapointed, and now going to try those plug in things,and use the old type of wood mouse traps.Sorry I could not give a more positive review.I'am going to give this another try, and if it works, I will be back to update this review.
B001H1HHYS Beneficial only in that they can be used safely in a room with your pets. They are safe but hardly ever actually trapped a mouse
B001H1HHYS Based on the ratings, this seemed to not have worked for a whole bunch of people but it's worked for me.I baited the trap as per instructions with peanut butter and set the trap. When the mouse was caught we looked at it carefully. The bait door bulged out a little but was not open. The mouse was definitely dead because it was not moving even when we opened the bait door to confirm that the occupant was not alive. It was nice because unlike most other traps you see some of the mouse, but with this one it completely hides it, even the tail. I'd buy this again, and it's cheaper than most other full cover traps.
B001H1HHYS Just a couple of days ago, I was looking through some old boxes in my garage, and noticed something hopped out of one and darted away.\"Great. I've got a mouse to deal with.\" I thought.Without thinking too much about it, I mentioned (read: warned) my wife that there might be a mouse in the garage.\"Don't you remember when I said it looked like mice had eaten all of those peanut butter bird feeders I made, and kept in the garage?\" In truth, I did remember this, but figured the unseasonably warm autumn had melted the peanut butter, or that it had otherwise mysteriously disappeared from my historically mouse-free garage.The next day, a scream filled my living room. My idiot dog brought in a freshly killed mouse for us all to enjoy.\"Great. Now I've got many mice to deal with.\"I went straight to the home improvement store. Not even Amazon Prime could bring justice fast enough. If there was a mouse-catching robot, I probably would have bought it. My objectives were:1) Must be safe enough to not snap my toddler or idiot dogs.2) Must not be a poison that would potentially leave mouse carcasses in old boxes.3) Must not terrify my wife and / or daughter upon \"use\".But apparently, these traps are the most advanced ones the store carried, next to some dopey ultrasonic thing that would most likely send the mice in to my house or shed if it worked well enough to annoy them out of my garage.Since peanut butter brought 'em, I figured peanut butter would bait 'em. And just hours later, my theory was proven correct. I was a bit concerned about the traps being potentially inhumane after reading many of the reviews, but to date, the mice have not complained.
B001H1HHYS The Ortho 0320110 Home Defense Max Kill & Contain Mouse Trap works really works great. These are really easy to use. Just put some Peanut butter in the base and set the trap and before long the mouse is caught. The disposal is very clean and easy as opposed to the old wooden traps. Once the mouse is caught, the door closes. Just drop the whole thing in trash and you are done. This could not be easier.
B001H1HHYS I've been using the &#34;humane&#34; traps for a while now, but recently the mice have somehow found a way to claw out of the lid.  Finally got fed up and got these instead.  Worked overnight, quick, easy, and painless.  You don't see the gory mess afterwards because the lid automatically pops up after a catch, at most you'll see a tail.
B001H1HHYS wow! At first I put this sideways so the indicator was up. I didn't read the instructions. The mice got in and took the bait and left, without triggering the trap. I was about to throw them out and try something else when, behold, I looked at the package and saw it was meant to stand upright. I re-set a new trap in that orientation and within 2 hours had caught my first mouse. Since this is a 2 pack, I fired up another one and got another mouse overnight. Now I wonder how many there are. I'm going to order 2 more and see. Good thing these come in a 2 pack. These mice had grown smart enough to avoid the old-fashioned wooden spring trap. But not this.
B001H1HHYS I live in a rural area near farmland and we usually have an annual mice problem once the harvest season has concluded.  For years we used the traditional wooden mouse traps to catch mice.  However, they don't seem to make those traps like they used to because they don't seem as sensitive.  For instance in the past few years we frequently have found these traps still set, but with all the bait licked clean.We decided to try something different and I came across these kill and contain mouse traps from Ortho.  After using them for nearly a year now, I can say that I love them.  The traps are very easy to bait and set.  There's a little flag/lever on the side that lets you know if the trap has caught a mouse or if it has just been released without a capture.  The trap is quite powerful as it has snapped the backs of all the mice we have caught with them.  We have had no issues with any mice eating through the trapdoor where the food is placed nor have any of the traps failed to kill the mice they capture.  The traps are designed so that once a mouse is caught, you can throw the entire trap away.  However, though I've not done it myself, a person could empty the trap of a mouse and reuse the trap. Part of the appeal of this trap is that they are designed to be thrown away and a person doesn't have to see the dead mouse.  I think that if one were to reuse the trap, it destroys this appeal, but it can be done.The traps are reasonable priced as you can buy a package of two for just about $2 more than a package of 2 wooden traps.  I've tried several different mouse traps the past year and the ORTHO HOME DEFENSE MAX KILL AND CONTAIN MOUSE TRAP is one of the best ones out there.
B001H1JKN4 This feed is designed to attract smaller songbirds, mainly finches, siskins and chickadees.  It contains nyger seed, red millet and sunflower chips.  The seeds are tiny so be sure to use either a tube feeder or one of those thistle socks.I have a number of different feeders for different birds.  Since using this blend,I have significantly more activity at my small bird tube feeder.  I appreciated the fact that there was no filler in this product which minimizes waste and insures that the right birds will feed.I especially liked the thoughtful design of the bag. The bag itself is angled with an easy on, easy off screw  cap which makes it a snap to fill the tube feeder.  No juggling and struggling with funnels, scissors, pests and spillage.  I note that this product also comes in eight and twelve pound bags.It is fun to feed the birds.  Previously my finch feeder had only nyger seed.  Birds came but not in the numbers they do now.  I guess variety is the spice of life even for the little birds.
B001H1JKN4 Birds will eat it with no complaints.  But I can't tell if more songbirds appear than usual.  Squirrels really like this stuff and will tear up a feeder to get it.  But they're always after the birdseed no matter what brand I put in the feeder.  The nozzle on the bag makes it very easy to pour.  I can't really tell if this birdseed is any better than any other quality brand of birdseed.
B001H1JKN4 When I used to work at a hardware store and my boss found out I like feeding birds, I was put in charge of the bird seed. But all we had then was just the basics; Wild bird seed and sunflower seed. The first thing I did was order in small bags of specialty seed like this. I knew that certain birds prefer certain seed and the filler seed that goes into cheap bird seed is just wasted by the birds.Scotts seed is one of the best on the market. It has the seeds the birds want and they have mixes for specific types of birds. This one is for smaller birds like Finches, Chickadees and my personal favorite, the Titmouse.Go ahead, get all the giggling out of your system, I'll wait.You good? Ok for those who don't know, the Titmouse is shaped like a bluejay, but is about a quarter the size and gray colored. But for a small bird, it can really sing. You know how they tell singers to project their voice? If you could project like a Titmouse, you wouldn't need a microphone or speakers.Another great thing about Scotts birdseed is the package. It has a spout with a screw on cap. No cutting, spilling as you pour and best of all, the seed is kept fresh when you seal it back up.Over all a great seed and package and it is available in multiple size to suit your feeding stations.
B001H1JKN4 We live in the Mid-Atlantic and I guess we're bird-people because even our squirrels are glossy and fat, and we've got birds that come back year after year, bringing their babies.I usually buy just straight Thistle seed for the Siskins and Gold Finches.  This year I'm trying two sock feeders along with our usual 4-perch 'house' feeder because there has been such a traffic jam.  And as an experiment, I  bought the Scott's \"Wild Finch & Small Songbird Blend\".  It was a whim, but I was interested in the 2X claim, as well as whether our birds would like the red millet.Well, the short of it is that they don't particularly care for it.  Certainly we haven't seen any increase in Finch traffic, in fact it's died off a bit... but I'm not going to lay the blame for that at Scott's feet.  With birds you just never know.  But in the socks all of the thistle is gone and what remains is red.THE SKINNY:::I was concerned that the red millet might not fit through the slim feeder-slots on our house-style thistle feeder, but apparently it does.The Pine Siskins seem to like the millet better than the Gold Finches.As for the Red Millet, I did a bit of research and found out that it is frequently used as 'filler' and doesn't have a magic effect as one might conclude from the claims on the package.I'm not planning on buying more except for the sock-feeders.  It is just so convenient to have the spout on the Scott bag that I think it's worth the price.Note:  if you haven't been feeding birds for a long time, you might not know that local populations can have their own preferences.  So it makes sense to experiment and try a bag of this-or-that to see what your local birds prefer.Pam T~mom/blogger/birder
B001H1JKN4 Don't try to use this bird feed in your usual wire cage type feeder because it will just pour right out.  These are very tiny little seedlings so you really need to use a finch sock style feeder for it.  The birds do eat this although they seem to go through the regular feed out of the big feeder quicker.
B001H1JQB0 I use it everytime after and before grilling. The metal is soft enough it wont scratch the grill but rough enough to clean. I use it for my Weber Q320 Grill. The quality of the hand and brush is excellent. The brush can be removed when it is worn out or switched to a different type of brush.
B001H1JQB0 Like others have said, this thing is a tank!!  It's heavy and very durable and I love the fact that you can switch or replace the brush/pad head so easily.  That's what wears out.If there's any con, it's that it's big and heavy and takes getting used to handling, compared to any other brush I've had or used but those others don't last 1 season before something breaks or the brush wears out or gets clogged beyond cleaning. But it has a soft grip halfway up the handle to hold is shorter if need be.  It's solid as can be and should last many years.
B001H1JQB0 I received this as a gift after I got myWeber Genesis S-320, and couldn't be happier with a brush.This thing is solid, heavy, and has an excellent ergonomic design. Cleaning up the back of your grill while it's still burning is no problem. It's long enough to get there easily, and the curved handle keeps your hand far enough away from the flames to keep your hair from burning off.I've been especially happy with the bristles. Most of the brushes I've owned will start to bend out or flatten after just a few uses, but these bristles mostly stay put. The double-sided scraper blade fits Weber's stainless steel grates like a glove, too.Overkill? Sure. But when you add up the number of cheap-o no-name brushes you'll go through, this is actually reasonably priced (and much nicer).
B001H1JQB0 This brush is a little pricey but worth it.  We bought two other brushes that were  too short, shed bristles, or had plastic handles that melted before we decided to spend the money and get this one.  It is heavy, has a long handle that has the correct angle for cleaning the grill.  We like the two heads and the fact that we can replace them when needed.
B001H1JQB0 Very nice, a little overkill for my Weber Q220 grill. It cleans off the grill nicely and would work great on a full sized bbq.
B001H1JQB0 I love this tool. It is really robust.  It comes with a brush that you can change out with the bristles. Stainless steel. Long tool for bigger grills and you can get great leverage with it. Rubber handle pads allow you to grab it with both hands easily. My only problem with it is that the grooves to clean the grates are a bit off kilter and so you can't get the same leverage when you use this part. Also, the ergonomics of the tool make it easier to use the one side than the other.
B001H1JQB0 I love the fact that this has an angled long handle which allows you to clean your grill after it's lit (which is when I usually do it) Also the bristles are reversable/replaceable which makes it great. Most of these styled weber grill tools are great quality and this one is the same.
B001H1LSKM In terms of the price, this might be the best deal on Tomcat's mice traps if the product works. However, the jury's still out after about two weeks of use if the product still works -- I have yet to see any mouse activity on these traps.
B001H1LSKM We live somewhat rural, so when the snows melt, we head for the store to buy mouse traps. Since my husband gets sore fingers with the traditional traps, I thought he would like these.He did, but the mice didn't. We placed these next to traditional traps. Time after time, we caught mice in the traditional ones, while these remained empty.So, while they might work for others, we need efficient traps, traps that lure in our mice. These didn't do the job of luring, although they did (when I tested them) do a very good job of being set off.
B001H1LSKM Each spring, the unfortunate combination of hungry mice and children who leave doors open, means that we are subjected to what seems like an invasion of rodents, leaving me scurrying for traps and peanut butter.Our last successful catch was a sticky strip that unfortunately left me having to deal with a scared, stuck mouse. After having had to physically put it out of its misery, I decided to explore additional options. (I am not particularly sentimental about mice, but it's still not something that I look forward to doing.)This one-time use, spin-based trap seemed like a great idea.I loved the ease of its setup (fill with bait, pull to prime, and place), and I liked the construction of this unit (easy to unset and reset).Unfortunately, in the weeks since I placed this trap, it has sat silent and lonely.It's hard to rate a mouse trap without a trapped mouse as proof. For now, I rated it at 3-stars (Its Okay) to reflect its ease of use, and to avoid skewing its product score. I'll update this review if the hit rate with this trap improves in the future.~A_E~
B001H1LSKM It is hard to beat this trap for ease of setting.  One simple pull arms the spring and by twisting and removing the little bait door, you can easily baite the trap.  I have set up two and I am still waiting to see if they catch any mice.  But for now, I can vouch that they are easy to set up and the price seems ok, but not great for one time use traps.
B001H1LSKM I used this with Motomco Gel Attractant, which I received at the same time.  I'm not sure whether to blame the traps or the Motomco Gel Attractant.  There are mouse droppings in the areas where I placed the trap and I'm certain we have mice, but after almost two weeks I have yet to catch a mouse.
B001H1LSKM These Tomcat 33545 Spin Traps for Mice do work and a good choice if you absolutely have to set a trap in area that is open to the public. We have a very large older building where we provide training for our customers. We saw evidence of a mouse and there really wasn't anyway to set a standard &#34;snap&#34; type trap that would not be seen (and accessible). One of these traps caught a mouse on the second day of use and it was a simple matter to dispose of the whole trap (these are single use).Recommended.CFH
B001H1LSKM I set two of these almost a month ago and have not caught anything. They are in the pantry where I caught a mouse in a live trap the day before setting these.I'm not going to say they don't work because it's always possible that the local mice have decided to avoid our pantry for some reason. I see some potential advantages to these devices.1. They seem safer than the old-fashioned snap traps. Those can easily snap on the dog's paw or even on your fingers! I hate setting those traps because the prospect of getting snapped is frightening.2. They kill the mouse quickly (supposedly). I don't want mice to suffer as they would in a sticky trap, or even as they sometimes do in a live trap. Now I happen to use live traps but on two occasions I forgot where I placed them after several months of not catching anything. (Mice can be seasonal; they sneak in from outside in bad weather.)  It wasn't until the awful odor of decaying mouse wafted up that I searched out the forgotten traps. Poor creatures had died in the plastic boxes.  Sorry! And there's another problem with live traps: you have to carry them outside and far away from the house before releasing the mouse. Since mice tend to get caught at night, I've found myself walking around in the dark looking for for a suitable place that's far from my house and not close to a neighbor's house ... pretty creepy! And I won't even start with the time this happened during a snow storm!3. These traps are intended to be thrown away along with the dead mouse -- easy and sanitary.Admittedly, these seem somewhat costly for a disposable item. And while they are environmentally better than mouse poison (which can poison other animals), they do contain a bit of plastic which ends up in a landfill after only one use.
B001H1LSKM The Tomcat Spin Trap for mice is easy to set and bait. It's recommended to use peanut butter or a mouse attractant. They are designed to be set up against a wall or corner. If you have a need for that application then these could be a good trap. The traps are one time use so while they are convenient, they aren't cheap. It's nice that you don't have to come into contact with the dead mouse since it remains inside the trap. These are designed for small mice, only mice that can fit into the trap are going to get caught unlike baits.
B001H1LSKM I got the two pack and set them up with some peanut butter in our community garden.  We don't get a lot of mice there (the garden is surrounded by parking lots and set way back from fields and other buildings) but I usualy see a few a year.  Setting it was easy.  I've had them out for about two weeks and I caught one mouse.  It was dead when I checked the trap.  I'm not sure how quick it was.  So far the other trap hasn't caught anything.  I've added a little peanut butter to the entrace so we'll see.  It could just be we've only got the once mouse so far - as I mentioned we don't have a big problem.Compared to other traps I've used this was less messy.  Setup was about par for the course.  If you are looking for something low on mess this is as good a choice as any I've tried.
B001H1LSKM This mousetrap is very easy and intuitive to use with barely a glance at the instructions.  Similarly it  easy to monitor whether  it is set or has been triggered with just a glance. Reasonably well made and easy to use in my continuing battle against mouse intruders. .
B001H1LSKM I&#8217;m not having any kind of luck with these whereas the &#8220;regular&#8221; Tomcat traps are actually doing the trick.  That&#8217;s not to say they won&#8217;t work for some people because I have a friend who is rather squeamish and uses this type all the time.She is using them on counters for the little city mice, but we have field mice that simply seem to bypass these.  Perhaps it&#8217;s because the baited traps are open, but I&#8217;m not sure.  They are easy to set up and are no hassle, but perhaps not worth the expense.There&#8217;s a small &#8220;door,&#8221; if that&#8217;s what you call it, on the bottom of the trap that can be removed and baited.  The directions on the back of the box, which include visuals, are quite clear and easy to follow.I&#8217;ve never had any luck with this type of trap before and it looks like they aren&#8217;t going to work for me again.  For what you get, these are way too expensive and I&#8217;m not enamored with throwing out such a large piece of plastic for one mouse.  Not for me, but maybe for the ultra-squeamish who can&#8217;t approach it any other way.
B001H1LSKM My husband has been using these in our shed where the mice have been nesting in my patio furniture and it is working great. So far in only a week we have killed at least two mice.
B001H1LSKM We live in a nearly 100-year-old farmhouse so getting mice in the house is just part of the deal. I have used glue traps and snap traps and others with good success - we even had a cat that was very good at catching mice.However, since getting these traps we have not gotten any mice with them -- but neither have the cats. I guess it just not the right season for the mice to be trying to raid our house.If you do not want to use snap traps or glue traps this might appeal to you - the important thing is to use a little bit of peanut butter.
B001H1LSKM I likedecades round mouse traps. You can see when they are set, or not set or  have a mouse. I like the line round design that allows for capture of the mouth and you don't have to see the dead mouse. You just throw it away
B001H1LSKM These traps are SO easy to use.  They are super easy to set and all you have to do is wait and toss the entire thing.  I hated removing dead mice from a trap, but these are so reasonably priced you can afford to do the dasterdly duty and toss it.  I recommend it.
B001H1LSKM Mice are a fact of life on a farm. I hate them and spend a great deal of time trying to kill them.The Tomcat spin trap did not help me towards that goal at all. I can set them somewhere with lots of mouse signs and not catch any thing. They just run right by. I am catching lots of mice on glue traps and bait stations but I have not gotten one mouse with a spin trap. In addition to not being appealing to mice, these things trip very easily.
B001H1LSKM The Tomcat spin trap design is meant to be a quick clean way to kill and dispose of mice. You set the trap with bait and wait for a mouse to crawl in the somewhat small opening and get killed when it goes for the bait. These traps will only work with small mice, and the kill mechanism is unreliable as some users have noted - sometimes mice will escape without triggering the trap and sometimes when it does strike them they don't die right away. The one main plus with these for squeamish folks is that when a mouse is caught you just throw the trap away with the mouse inside. Of course that means that you can only catch one mouse per trap and then you would need to buy new traps for the future, similar to the glue traps that are commonly sold. These are safer than other traps if you have kids around, but if you really want a reliable way of catching mice these are likely to disappoint. I have found in my experience with multiple types of rat/mouse traps that I like the electric traps the best for indoor use, and if you have a recurring issue those will end up being more economical in the long run since a single trap could be used for many years.
B001H1LSKM I am very impressed! The trap is easy to set,  just pull out the plastic entrance door,  it slides out,  clicking into place revealing 2 side facing mouse sized entrance holes. Easy to see if anything was caught,  the entrance will close up again! If the trap is accidentally set,  just push the tab underneath,  the trap will rapidly close.  Hold onto the entrance to gently guide it closed when releasing the pin. Next to the pin underneath is a convenient access door,  just twist out the know,  fill with peanut butter and a bit of granola bar. You'll catch that pesky critter in no time.  The spin trap is humane,  you can catch and release the non-injured mouse miles away if that's your preference. Highly recommend!
B001H1LSKM I don't really understand the purpose of this trap. I guess it's for those too squeamish to see or deal with a dead rodent. With this trap, you're paying quite a bit extra for that 'convenience'. It's a kill trap, it takes up more room than most, it's not always possible to place it in tight areas, and it's disposable by design. Once it's caught something, you throw it away, and have to purchase more. That makes it very expensive if you have multiple mice around (and when you have mice, you do).While perhaps slightly more pet-safe than snap traps, I wouldn't call it child safe... there's still ways a child could injure themselves playing with the thing.So, my suggestion? Snap traps, like theWooden Mouse Trap (Set of 2)(though such traps are much cheaper when obtained at a local hardware store, etc). Snap traps are just as effective, and reusable, so you don't need to keep buying them.
B001H1LSKM I had the chance to try these traps out and I'll say they seem to work well. But they are really single use traps and for that they are fairly expensive. The trap is easy to set, the mouse goes in, trap spins and the end happens quickly. While it is a nicer way for a homeowner to kill mice, these are not that practical since they are one use only.
B001H1LSKM We have a pet squirrel that we hand feed peanuts to and leave a few extra out there on the deck for him to eat. Of course you can attract other critters. A mouse likes to sneak up on the back porch and get the peanuts. We set this trap out there thinking we would catch the mouse and not hurt the squirrel. So far the mouse walks right by it as if it is invisible. The squirrel thinks it is a peanut butter filled toy and plays with it every day.I am going to keep trying but so far I am not impressed. It cost a lot more than the old fashion traps and so far it has no results. I guess at least I have not trapped the pet squirrel in an old fashion snap trap. Maybe the mouse is smarter than the squirrel! And me!
B001H1LSKM Of all the Tomcat products I've tried since the house was invaded by mice due to the heavy rains, this is the only one that hasn't attracted the little critters.  Maybe because I have them in the greenhouse and summer kitchen, but so far they haven't been touched.  But based on the effectiveness of the other Tomcat mouse poisons - I have no doubt they will work eventually and work well.  This is another product that I don't have to worry about with the grandkids or the dogs - the bait is far from their reach within the trap.
B001H1LSKM This product from Tomcat works well. It helped us get rid of our little problem and get back to normla.
B001H1LSKM I was hoping to have a more thorough review and be able to show some actual results. However, despite placing this in a couple of obvious locations, including one out in our storage shed that's far from being as &#34;sealed&#34; as the house I've not yet trapped anything. The good news is that this appears to be a really nice design and it certainly couldn't be easier to bait and set. If I ever find that it's actually caught a rodent I'll be sure to update my review.
B001H1LSKM This is a cool trap that is easy to bait and set.  It has two points of entry, giving more options for placement.  When the mouse is caught, the whole thing can be thrown away.  That is both a benefit and a fault.  It hides the gore and mess, but is also a lot of plastic to be disposing for only one mouse.  Otherwise, I like using them.
B001H1LSKM I'll cut to the chase:  I won't purchase these spin traps again.  I'll tell you why:Of the 4 traps (2 sets of 2) I purchased, ONE actually caught a mouse.  (Then, since it's a single-use unit, you have to chuck it in the garbage.  I will add the unit is not liquid-tight.  There were some mousey secretions oozing out of the cracks that stank to high Heaven.)  TWO of the four traps would not stay set properly (one wouldn't click into position at all and the other would misfire at random intervals), and ONE was a mousey feeding station (had to repeatedly refill the peanut butter bait).TOMCAT has NOT built a better mousetrap.One nice thing: It's a much safer option than traditional wire snap traps when it comes to kids and pets.
B001H1LSKM I live near a river and some woods as a result mice and other wildlife are abundant. Mice will often make it to my outdoor shed, my garage and my basement.  My shed has also been home to larger rodents.The Tomcat Spin Trap is nice because it kills a mouse but you don&#8217;t see the mouse. You put bait in the trap. You then pull out an entryway that has two openings in which a mouse can enter. Once the mouse is caught the entryway returns to its original position.This is the perfect indoor trap for me. No mouse poison is used.  It is easy to set so I don&#8217;t have to worry about a trap coming down on my finger. Finally, there is no dead mouse to see.This comes with two traps. I caught a mouse with one.
B001H1LSKM We set these along with several others. After 2 weeks they are still mouseless (but there is fresh mouse pooh on top of one).Pros:Very easy to setwouldn't have to touch anything icky to throw awayCons:Holy cow these are big hunks of plastic for one use-- very, very wasteful and I wouldn't buy others even if they did work, just because of the way it makes me feel to throw away so much plastic.this just doesn't work-- and we've set two and there has been obvious mouse activity.I'd give these a miss and just buy some of the Tomcat wooden traps (which are easier to set and more effective than the standard victors). The wooden Tomcats caught mice even after a mouse has licked the peanut butter off the trap.
B001H1LSKM With a three car garage being used as an office/craft room/storage area in my semi-rural area, you can imagine how field mice are overjoyed when they discover it. They have practically built condos in the boxes stored in the rafters.While I'm not crazy about killing them, they are a nuisance and health hazard to my beloved pups.I had purchased Tomcat Spin Traps in the past, and they were not always effective. They would indicate an occupancy when in fact they were empty, leaving you with a sense of being protected when in reality the critters were probably snickering behind your back.These seem to built a bit differently than the previously purchased ones, and don't have as many 'false positives'.Not sure they are as humane as other traps, however.
B001H1LSKM They really did build a better mouse trap with this one.  It is an innovative design, easy to use, and most importantly effective.
B001H1LUVE Fits out new Weber Spirit E-320 like a glove. Has velcro adjustments on the bottom for a tighter fit. But we don't plan on using it until the close of the season (late fall). Overall, looks and feels like a top-notch material (For our old charcoal Kingsford grill, we have used the Kingsford cover that came with the grill. It deteriorated after the first season!)
B001H1LUVE I bought this to replace an old Weber cover that seemed to have shrunk to the point that it was difficult to put on.  It isn't quite as nice as the older one (no net part to allow any trapped moisture to easily escape, or get in if it rains !), but I expect it will do the job just fine for at least a few years as it is a loose fit.
B001H1LUVE I got about 6 years out of the last grill cover I bought for my Weber Genesis Silver B grill (see my review for this grill here on Amazon).  The sun had faded it and shrunk it to the point where it was hard to fit it over my grill.  Finally, a couple of seams had small tears, and water was getting through and pooling up on the top of the grill.  It was still keeping the grill clean, but I want a grill cover to keep the grill clean & dry.This cover is a perfect fit, and it does not have the mesh opening in it like the previous model had.  I actually prefer this, since rain very rarely comes straight down in Georgia, and so sometimes the grill would get wet.Can't go wrong with this cover if you want to keep your grill in the best condition possible.
B001H1LUVE We like to keep our Weber Grills for many years so we keep them clean and in good repair. A good cover is essential to maintaining the grill in good condition. The cover fits well, is heavy duty, but still easy to put on and remove and is sturdy enough to protect the grill from rain and windstorms. Since we keep the grill covered when not in use, it still looks like new after 4 years of use. (Our previous grill lasted nearly 15 years.)
B001H1LUVE Fits a 2003 Genesis Silver B perfectly. No complaints. The new velcro system for keeping it tight around the grill are clever. I hadn't seen this before. Happy Customer +1
B001H1LUVE I was concerned after seeing some of the pictures sent in by purchasers. In one  picture the cover is dragging on the ground. But I thought I would try it and hope that it fit. Delighted to find that it does not drag on the ground. It may be used to just cover the grill with the sides hanging straight down, or if you are expecting winds (or for longer periods of storage) you can use the velcro straps on each end of the cover to secure it even better. I am very pleased with it.
B001H9RPNI We live in north florida (read humid all the time).  We grill year 'round 2-3times a week.  The grill is kept under a porch.Many, many years ago we came to the conclusion that grills were disposable. We've tried expensive ones and cheap ones, they all last 2-3 years before rusting away to dust.  Just look at the reviews of the more expensive grills...they rust too, even the stainless ones!  So why buy a grill for $1000 and have it rust away when you can buy one for less than $200 and have it rust away.  And the parts cost over half what a new grill would, so what's the point?We bought this grill 2.5 years ago and my husband loves it.  He insisted on getting one with the side burner, but has never used it.  We just grill.  Nice sized cooking area (we are a family of 5), no hot spots, and chimneys to take any smoke away.  The only thing that is rusting on this are the diffusers above the burners.  My husband thinks he can make these.  If not we will buy this grill again.  We have gotten nearly 3 years of use, which may be a record.As long as we (as a country/society) are going to allow companies to make/import cheap, crappy merchandise, we will have to put up with stuff like this.  Even the expensive stuff is crap.  When we start holding the companies accountable and realizing that we will have to pay to get good quality (which is actually cheaper in the long run), we may get some good stuff.  Sorry to be so cynical, but I've tried to buy the quality stuff and it is not.Buy this grill...happy grilling!
B001H9RPNI This is the one you want! The key to a really good grill is to make sure that all the surface will heat equally and evenly, some grills do not have the flames arranged for this to occur. And some grills simply do not have enough places with flames for the grill to ever be able to have an all over surface temp, in other words you will get hot and cold spots. It is easy to determine if a grill meets the criteria. Simply remove the grill plates ( or in this case, review pictures carefully) and examine how many flame jets there are, if the jets extend close enough to the other jets and outward enough to provide that even, equal heat over the whole surface area. This grill meets the criteria perfectly. This grill is dependable and provides the perfect cooking results time after time. Assembly was no problem, I did have to use the instructions in a couple of places though.
B001H9RPNI This is a nice looking grill with easy to replace grill parts, but it did not last very long. The side burner went from working normally to becoming a big ball of red flame after only a dozen uses. It rusts easily and the ignite button quit working after about 2 years. I would only recommend this grill if you only grill sparingly and have a safe place to put it up when it is not being used.
B001H9RPNI I bought this grill a month ago and it heats up super fast and it doesn't seem to have any hot spots.The porcelain cast iron grates heat and hold the heat very well,over all the grill is heavy and seems to be made of quality materials.The grill was put together at Lowe's poorly and some parts were missing but i called Char-Griller and they sent a new hardware kit in a week.Also Lowe's doesn't sell the cover but Amazon does at a great price and perfect fit for $30 bucks.The only thing i don't like is the location of the propane tank because you can't get at the valve to turn it on and off because of a brace that's in the way,but this is a small problem.
B001H9RPNI Big grill, high btu's, took me ~2 hours to assemble with 3 elementary school age helpers and the neighbors cat getting in the middle of it.  Could probably put it together in 30-40 minutes but the directions are a bit vague at times.  For example, some parts are helpfully labeled &#34;this side inward&#34;, but &#34;inward&#34; is sort of up for interpretation.  Some bolts are different size in what you get vs the directions.  I have one long bolt with a wingnut on it leftover but nothing in the instructions seems to call for that.As others have mentioned, you'll have a hard time turning the gas bottle off until the grill cools.  The knob is about 1.5&#34; below the drip pan, which gets hot along with the grill.  No idea why people are reporting problems getting the gas bottle to fit, mine drops right in.  One igniter had no spark until I tweaked the distance between the tip and the burner, then all 3 worked fine.Haven't cooked in it yet.  I'll report back if its good or not and if I have any problems with it at all.  If you see no reports of problems, I didn't have any!  Heated up to &#62;600 in a few minutes, runs around 450 with all 3 burners on low.  I like the 'stacks' because you could cover one with an empty can or piece of foil to increase the heat retention inside (meaning one burner on low would give you some decent low and slow) and it looks like you could remove a portion of the right side of the lower casement and probably add on an indirect or smoker box to the side.It does have a lot of gummy machine oil all over it.  I let it run to max temp for about 15 minutes, then low for 15 minutes, then shut it off.  I'll check tomorrow when its cool but that should have burned it off and helped 'set' the paint on it.  A high heat/off cycle like that heats the paint and then lets it 'stick' better, so there is less flaking or discoloration down the line.  Whole thing is matte black, so any black grill paint will dress up rust or scrapes.  Had a bunch of very minor scrapes and dings from the shipping process, its not really packed very well and lots of the parts are VERY close to the sides of the boxes, so if your box is bashed badly you might consider returning it instead of unpacking it, because you have about zero chance of getting all this back in the box once its unpacked.  Paid about $160 for it, can't really get anything this nice at that price point unless you're lucky enough to grab a clearance item at a B&M; store.  Good luck with that.
B001HBH1BM This item was way beyond the quality I expected.....very solidly built and so easy to operate.....Got tired of lifting 75 lb dollies to move 50 lb items...The day after it arrive my daughter took it to move a hutch type cabinet(probably at the carts limit)..handled it so easy.......when done with it it folds up and goes in the trunk of my Miata with lots of room to spare.....One handy item......
B001HBH1BM The Magna Cart is perfect for anyone needing a hand truck. It is small enough to fold up and leave by the back door and hefty enough to hold two 40 pound cartons of liter. I have six cats and usually get 2 of the 40 pound cartons of litter when they are on sale. These are very heavy and the Magna Cart is perfect for carrying the litter from the car to the litter box.I also use the Magna Cart for carrying cartons of drinks and groceries into the house.  The handle is adjustable and easy to slide into place. It is very strong. I am very pleased with my purchased. I highly recommend this cart.
B001HBH1BM Can't say enough about this little truck. It's compact, sturdy, and handles loads with ease. If your house is tight for space it's much better than a standard, non-collapsible truck which eats up a lot of storage space for something that is rarely used. On the other hand, if you have something really heavy like a dresser, this is not your solution but for standard household tasks, this little unit makes the job much easier and reduces the risk of back injury.
B001HBH1BM For the price, this is a really great little dolly. I bought it for our recent move, for the boxes (luckily, we hired movers to move the big stuff and appliances). This isn't super sturdy, but it didn't claim to be. 150 lbs is a ton of weight and I've moved quite a few heavy boxes with no bending or snapping. It's a great price for something to move boxes around - even in the house, I've used it to distribute boxes to different rooms. Tomorrow, I'm using to bring out a little chest of drawers I'm selling on Craigslist! It's very versatile.I also got the Magna Cart \"regular\" (the red one) and this is much sleeker. I think it's also a little taller. Which brings me to my only complaint - I wish it went up just a bit higher. It's fine for me but it was a bit of a stretch for my 6-foot husband to use. Otherwise, great little tool at a great price.
B001HBH1BM Arrived on time. I have a magna hand truck I bought from a store about 2 years ago. I am not sure if that was the original hand truck another reviewer was referring to. This hand truck that I recently bought is a bit different but I think is just as good as the original. The difference is the the button that one pushes to lenghten the handle. This button is on top. The original was not a button but an orange or reddish handle below the top handle that you have to pull up. Somtimes when I just want to move the hand truck I inadvertently lift the colored handle and the hand truck lenghtens downwards sometimes hitting my feet. So the orange button in the newer magna hand truck is in my view an improvement. The other difference in the new magna hand truck is the color and maybe the material of the part that supports the load one is carrying on the cart. In the original it looks like it is part alumminum and shinny, in the newer magna hand truck it looks like it also part alumminum and some other material, perhaps ceramic, the color is grayish green.  The same load capacity.
B001I8ZTJ0 For several years I've been trying to justify getting a smoker. I knew if I wanted one that it would have to be a good one, but spending the money for a smoker that I wasn't sure how much I'd use seemed almost frivolous.Finally we broke down and bought the WSM cooker. Living in New Orleans we can use it almost year round. The cooker is very simple to put together and is well constructed. The door seems a little flimsy but it works fine. The water smoker keeps the food moist. It's easy to adjust the heat up or down with adjusting the opening size of the vents around the bottom and on top of the smoker.Our first experiment was brisket. 14 hours of smoking a huge brisket, with only me having to go out a few times and adding some charcoal and wood chips, and we had tender, melting brisket, it was so good.Ducks, chicken, turkey breast, all have come out wonderful. I love seasoning and smoking turkey breasts and ham, then slicing them for lunch meat. I control the chemicals and we get wonderful smoked meat.I was concerned about this being a one hit wonder, we'd use it once or twice then put it away and forget it, I'm surprised at how versatile it is with being able to smoke different meats. I am going to try my own bacon soon, but it makes great smoked sausage.With some smokers you get an option to attach a cold smoke adapter, I do wish the weber had that option, but this is a great smoker that gets used at least once a week by us. I get up in the morning, start the coal in the chimney, put it in the smoker with some wood, put the meat on, and except for the occasional checking of the temp and maybe adding a little more charcoal or wood, I'm set. The water pan is large enough it's never needed more water added, even after a 14 hour brisket.
B001I8ZTJ0 this thing is awesome!  It makes an amateur BBQ guy like me seem like a pro.  if you follow the instructions, you can't go wrong.  this is SO much easier than trying to smoke something on a manual weber charcoal grill.  assembly is very easy, and just remember, if you are having a tough time keeping the temp in the range you want, use the water bowl level to help keep it steady.  for example, the more water you have in the bowl, the lower and more stable you can keep the temp.  I use big chunks of wood rather than the little chips, and it works great.  just remember, every time you remove the lid, you will add a little to your cook time, but that thermometer on the lid works great and makes it so you don't ever have to remove the lid until the very end.don't waste your time or money on other products, if you can afford it, get this smoker.  you won't regret it, well, that is, unless you get really fat from eating BBQ, then you might regret it, but still...
B001I8ZTJ0 First let me make it VERY clear that Amazon.com is ALWAYS the best.  Top notch shipping, friendly/professional customer service, timely delivery.  I absolutely love Amazon.com - NEVER have had a single problem.Weber makes incredible products, I personally own three Weber Grills and every family member and most of my friends have since purchased at least one because they admire mine so much.  Now comes in to play Weber Customer Service.....I purchased this smoker Thursday 9/3/09 and had it shipped over night, which of course Amazon.com did perfectly.  Since I knew the smoker was at the house so I stopped at my favorite butcher on the way home from my office, purchasing roughly $200 in meat.  It was to be a great Labor Day Celebration with fine cuts of smoked meat at our annual End of Summer Bash.  I came home and excitedly started putting together the smoker.  However, the charcoal grate simply would not fit, something was amiss.... I called Weber customer service and was notified that I was the 3rd person to call that day with the exact same problem.  In the factory, someone was putting the charcoal grates for the larger Weber smoker in this package which need the smaller.  The customer service representative was incredibly kind and apologetic.  They said they would over night the charcoal great and refund what I had purchased in meat.  I was saddened that my guests would not enjoy what I had so anxiously hoped to serve, but understood that mistakes do indeed happen, and that Weber was doing all it could to make things right.  The party must go on.After the long holiday weekend, Tuesday comes and I expect to come home to a nice fedex package on my front porch containing said charcoal grill.  As I pulled in the drive and to my dismay, no fedex package existed.  Thus, I call Weber customer service.  The first rep. said there was nothing in my \"file\" and that they would never agree to reimburse for the meat - unbelievably rude.  I asked for a supervisor, and was of course, somehow was disconnected.  I called back, and after three attempts finally a supervisor came to the phone.  They said they would be sure to over night the correct grate to me, and they would have to check on the meat reimbursement.  At this point, I didn't care as long as what I already had purchased would finally be complete.Wednesday comes, no grate....I give it another day.....Thursday, no grate.  Four more calls to Weber, two different rude, unprofessional supervisors and assurance the grate would come over night.  Friday....no grate.  Yet another call to Weber, more rude customer service reps and supervisors then a notification that the grate wouldn't ship until October 8th, this would not do at all.  Finally get the VP of Customer Service for Weber, a fellow named Mark.  I understand how he came to his position, you clearly need to be the best at being rude and unprofessional to hold such a prestigious position at Weber.  He of course assured me that they would ship a grate over night and I will receive the grate Tuesday.I for one feel that it was completely ridiculous what I had to go through just to get the product I had already purchased.  This was by far the WORST customer service I've ever received from any company.  I will no longer purchase another Weber product regardless of the quality.  I would rather buy a new grill every year for the rest of my life rather than cook on another Weber.Weber, you have lost a life long customer and several thousands of dollars because of something so ridiculous.  I will never recommend a Weber product again, nor will anyone I know purchase another Weber product.  I will personally purchase from another company and give it to them just to avoid another dollar going into a company that condones such poor customer service......Good Bye Weber!
B001I8ZTJ0 Bought this as a gift for hubby and he absolutely loves it.  Made great points with this purchase.  It was easy to put together and the first time out he smoked a turkey.  All I can say in YUMMY!  What a different between a smoked turkey and a baked one.  We will never go back.  Since we live in California, we can use our smoker all the time.
B001I8ZTJ0 So I already had a Bradley electric smoker which is great for certain things, but I just couldn't hit the higher temps that I wanted, so I bought this to give myself some variety.  Broke it out and made both a Bacon Explosion and Brisket with some aged oak, and it worked flawlessly.  I quickly learned how to adjust the vents to get the temps I was looking for and the finished product was fantastic, a must have for anyone that wants to cook meat right.
B001I8ZTJ0 Just to throw my two wood chips worth in, this is one nice unit! Following advice of others, tempered it first, then got some 80/20 hamburger and a pkg. of bacon for the seasoning phase. Cut about 4 strips of bacon in half, length wise then sliced up into small bits and mixed up well with ground beef. Made up 4 patties, placed on grill then layed out the rest of the bacon on grill in layers of two. Covered and let er go with a couple chunks of hickory in the coals. Plenty of smoke and grease to go around. It was during this time I learned to work the vents for smoke and heat before I move on to more pricey cuts of meat in the future.Kingsford charcoal is a good choice, but I still like Royal Oak and WALLY worlds Backyard Griller charcoal are still my favorites. Backyard is a larger briquette for longer burn times and has produced a very nice flavor and cook.You certainly want to cover the water dish in foil, keeps messes to a minimum and easy to change out and worth the time. Get a pair of pit gloves, you will need them when working with this smoker, nothing worth getting burnt for! Also....get yourself a good accurate digital thermometer, you don't need to spend a wad of cash to find a good one, the dome thermometer tends to be a little off. There is a rubberized/silicone slot on the side where you can insert the thermometer probe. Time & temp are important factors when smoking!No matter how you make your approach to smoking, this is a wonderful smoker to work with and you will be able to put out some really great chow for family & friends
B001I8ZTJ0 Let me start by saying there are reviews on Weber having the wrong size grates in the box, I just ordered this about 2 weeks ago, recieved it and found everything to be exactly as it was supposed to be, no wrong size grates, missing parts, etc. Everything was perfect.Now, I initially bought an electric smoker from Amazon about a year ago, I bought the Masterbuilt Electric smokerMasterbuilt 20070106 30-Inch Electric Smokehouse Smoker, Blackafter deciding to get into smoking meats. I choose electric because of the convience of being able to set the temp and let it run without having to touch it until the meat was done. Well, it worked fairly well....for a year... Then the smoker died and I found heating elements were not availalbe for the unit and the main control unit was not working. Technology and grills/smokers don't seem to mix very well...So, I needed a new smoker and after contemplating on getting a $75 brinkmann smoker from the local hardware store I decided to pay the premium for the Weber Smokey Mountain Cooker and let me tell you this thing makes perfect smoked foood! My first attempt at smoking with this smoker was pork butt. My wife wanted to take the pulled pork to work with her the next day so my first smoke experience was an overnight. I was worried about temp fluctuations so I set my alarm to wake me up every 90 minutes to check on the temp and make adjustments as needed. I never had to make one adjustment! I started the charcoal using the minion method (fill charcoal ring with unlit coals, then take a chimney of about 10 coals and put them on top, mix in a few pieces of apple wood and set vents about 1/4 open on bottom and leave top vent on top open) The cooker got to about 225 degrees and stayed at that mark for 12+ hours without me having to add more coal, open or close the vents or any other maintenance. I was upset after waking up every 90 minutes I actually didn't do anything, but at the same time I was so impressed this thing worked so well out of the box without any tweaking like is needed on cheaper units. Fyi, I smoked the butt at 225 degrees for about 13 hours with 2 foil packs filled with apple wood chips, I was going to use apple wood chunks but couldn't find any and I found the foil packs of apple wood chips work perfectly!My second smoke was a turkey as the plan is to use the smoker for our thanksgiving turkey this year and rather then try my first turkey on thanksgiving I figured we'd do a practice turkey. I got the smoker up to approx 225 degrees again using the minon method listed above and put the turkey on the smoker, it sat for about 10 hours (12lb bird) and when the internal temp reached 165 degrees I took it off and let it rest. The bird was juicy and so good. Once again used apple wood chip foil packets.This smoker is fantastic. Is it more difficult then electric? No, both require cleanup but the scientific properties of smoke from charcoal are definitly different then smoke from electric smokers, somehow it infuses into the food much more efficiently and you can tell by the visible smoke rings on the meat. The weber smokey mountain cooker really is as easy as it gets and the reason is the design and construction. You could get cheaper units but the modifications you would need for proper air-flow, plus the thickness of the smoker is important and Weber uses high grade steel. You really get a premium product when you choose the smokey mountain. The only gripe I have is the door on the side to add more coals or wood chips or refill the water pan. The door is sort of flimsy however there are sites where you can find replacement after market doors for approx $20 that are very strong. Maybe one day I'll upgrade but for now the included door works well, just a little thin.If you want a smoker I highly recommend this unit. It will easily cook a turkey and a ham or pork butt at the same time. I've seen pictures of people cooking a total of 50lbs of pork shoulder perfectly. This smoker rocks and will last a long time, after all it's metal and comes with a 10 year limited warranty. My old electric smoker that lasted approx a year before it died had a 90 day warranty and was poor quality at nearly the same cost! Stick with American made, high quality and get yourself the Weber Smokey Mountain Cooker, you won't regret it!! Well...maybe you'll regret not getting it sooner! :)
B001I8ZTJ0 I'll be brief as most everything has already been said.I'm surprised at how well it's made.  While the perfectionist may find improvements, and will make modifications such as adding thermometer probe ports, it's a great cooker.I originally ordered a 22 but because of the reviews citing how huge it is, I changed my order to the 18.  While it's perfect for what I need, I wish I would have stuck with the monster 22.  I've learned that fuel usage varys greatly from person to person.  A friend goes through a lot more fuel than I do with the same 18, but our technique's are different, and he's changing to what I do now for better results.But on the plus side, the 18 is also more portable if you have a need to take it with you, or even just move it in the yard as I've had to do a time or 2.  I could not pick up the 22, assembled, especially hot, and move it.If I were to find 1 negative, the only thing I'd like to see changed is the shape of the water pan.  It's big which was an improvement over the older models, but it's big enough to make it more difficult yo manage the coal/wood when and if you need too.  It can be done, but it could be easier if the pan was not so deep.Free tip, for ribs, which can be a challenge because the space they take up when laying flat, buy a 2nd top grate (easy to find for about $15 at any Home Depot, Lowes etc.)and flip it upside down and set it on the top grate.  You'll have a double decker rib rack without using a rack to stand them in.  Cutting the racks in half makes it much easier to handle, plus configure on the grate.Bonus tip, find a good meat market!!
B001I8ZTJ0 Have to say this thing is a simple to use and works great. My pork shoulder came out excellent... Maintains heat very consistently once you get the vents right which does take some work. So I would document your vents and exact amount of coals so you can have a consistent temperature.
B001I8ZTJ0 This is a great smoker - I purchased it from the Amazon Warehouse deals and paid 266.xx for it.  It showed up the next day as described.  (With damaged packaging, but the item itself was intact, and saved $33 as a result of a box that was thrown out.)Assembly was easy and took about 15-20 min.  I followed &#34;slapyourdaddy's&#34; recomendation for the seasoning process, skipping the third &#34;cooking&#34; of fatty foods and just went for it.  Well after 12 hours I had two 10lb smoked pork butts that were amazing.  Maintaining temp is fairly easy (it's charcoal, not electric) but does require effort.  The water pan does get filthy.  I also purchased a Maverick remote temp monitoring device.  That is fantastic as well!  In all I can highly recommend this product!
B001I8ZTJ0 We're newbies to smoking and decided to purchase the Weber 721001.  It has worked out well for us.  Easy to use, clean, move around, everything!  The thermometer and side opening coat flap is a great feature.  We're able to fit a lot of items in the smoker at once (ex: a brisket on the bottom rack, and nuts and salt on the top rack).  So far we've smoked cornish hens, chicken, brisket, salt, and almonds.  All have turned out great.  Have not attempted to use this to \"cold smoke\" yet but would like to in the future to try cheeses.
B001I8ZTJ0 I've had a Weber grill for ages and love it, so when it came time to research smokers, it was no surprise that I decided on a Weber Smokey Mountain (WSM).  I bought the 18.5 inch smoker a few weeks ago and absolutely love it.  I found a site of WSM enthusiasts at virtualweberbullet.com and have learned a LOT about using this smoker, and about smoking in general, in a short amount of time.  So far I've done ribs, pulled pork, brisket, chicken, hot wings, and stuffed jalapenos. Most were the best I've ever cooked - even on my first try with the new smoker.  The WSM is easy to use and comes closer to \"set it and forget it\" than I thought was possible in a charcoal-based smoker.  I did my first overnight smoke with it last weekend, and it held a nice, consistent, steady temperature range of around 225-230 for 17.5 hours without having to add or even tinker with the charcoal (Stubb's Charcoal probably gets part of the credit for that as well).  If I had it to do over again, about the only thing that I might do differently is to go ahead and spend the extra money to get the 22.5 inch version.  I've had enough room for every cook so far, but you never know when that extra room might come in handy.  This is a competition quality smoker at a price that is much lower than most competition quality smokers.
B001I8ZTJ0 I did not want to spend this much but this is hands down the best smoker. I did a lot of research and most smokers below 200 don't have great reviews. Not saying thing is wrong with them but this smoker all I have to do is put coal in, it runs all day. Easy to control temp, easy to build, easy all around.Also if you plan to buy don't buy a cover, it comes with one.
B001I8ZTJ0 I debated on getting this or an electric smoker. I am really glad I got the Weber. You have to be an idiot not to figure out how to use this. It works great and requires very little attention while smoking. I used this for the first time this past Saturday. Smoked a boston butt for 13 hours and never had to add more charcoal. Used the Minion Method for starting the coals. Did not season the smoker as some suggested and it turned out freakin awesome. It held a steady temperature between 225 and 239 degrees with very little to do on my part. Get one...you will be glad you did.
B001I8ZTJ0 My first cook was an overnighter.  It couldn't have been easier. Once it was stabilized (about an hour) it held temp for several hours.  I woke up once and checked the temp ,250 after 4 hours, then at 7 hours it was still at 223. I got up, started another chimney of charcoal, put it in, went back to bed, and two hours later it was 225 with an internal temp of 196 on the pork butt.  It was great to be able to sleep thru the plateau. In addition to that it was the first time I have been able to cook a pork butt completely without using the oven--a longtime problem on the ECB I had been using for years. The only problem I have with it is that I didn't get one years ago.
B001I8ZTJ0 I've had this for little over a year now, and here's a breakdown of everything I've successfully smoked.Ribs (baby back and spare)Chicken (whole, breasts, wings)BrisketMeatloaf (that's right)Etc....Folks, this is the must have for your backyard.  I'm admittedly a Weber fan boy, but how can you not be.  Well constructed, great warranty, and awesome customer service.  This smoker will take some time to get used to, but once you've got the hang of it, you'll be looking to fire it up every weekend.  Smoke is well distributed, temperature balance is challenging but something you need to learn regardless of what grill you use, and setup is nice and doesn't take a lot of space.Great product for the first time smoker, or the guy that just wants another piece in the yard to add to his grilling arsenal.  Remember though, this isn't a 20 minute grill and done.  You're going low and slow, so make sure you're planning on spending time at home when you get it started.
B001I8ZTJA After watching many episodes of BBQ pitmaster and Man vs Food, I went on ahead and made the purchase and must safe it was the best investment I have made!!  I enjoy grilling but when it comes to stepping up to the next level, this is it.  I have used this about 3 times and so far the only thing I have smoked are ribs but they come out excellent and tender each time.  I see why people rave about this.  For the $$ it is the best.  Granted, if I had the coin I would get a green egg but I am not going to drop $1500 right now when all I had to pay was $400 and this works like a charm!  Controlling the temps are very easy but I highly recommend if you get this, use this website as a guide because it is a wealth of knowledge. ([...]  I truly recommend this item and if your interested in smoking, you will not go wrong!
B001I8ZTJA I purchased this smoker about 6 months ago after doing alot of research.  I never owned a smoker or cooked with charcoal before.  The smokey mountain smokers are the best bang for your buck. I own the 22\" and the 18\" smokers.  I purchased the \"el cheapo brinkman\" smoker about 2 weeks before i bought this smoker, the brinkman was TOTAL GARBAGE.From doing all the research i came to the conclusion to buy the 22\" smoker first.  The grate size is WAY bigger then the 18\".  You can easily fit 3 untrimmed racks of spare ribs on each grate.  On the 18\" youd have to trim a few inches off the racks and bend them in to try to avoid the meat hitting the lid. After using the smoker every weekend for 6 months, i have no signs of deteriorating metal or rusting anywhere.Pros and Cons of 18 vs 22 from my experience22 pros:plenty of spacelarge water pancan get cool attachments like the ribolator and other rotisserie rods22 cons:takes longer to heat up then the 18way too much wasted space if you are only cooking two racks of ribsuses more fuel then the 1818 pros:great for doing single family cooksuses less fuelalmost half the physical size of the 2218 cons:good luck trying to cook a full brisket or large turkey in thisnot many attachments to play around with to bulk up the smoker, cant get a ribolator for this size smoker or rotisserie ringAs for the attachments, If you want the rotisserie ring attachment for your smoker, id suggest getting the cajun bandit smoker ring and not the weber one.  The cajun bandit ring can go onto a weber 22 kettle grill and the wsm 22 incase you want to use the ring on either, which i do use it on both!The ribolator is a pretty cool attachment.  I tried cooking ribs on it one time using my smoker, didnt seem like it was worth the hassle to do.  Now if you have the kettle grill and set it up for smoking ribs, the ribolator would probably be worth it to use in that sense.  One thing that is great for the ribolator that i found out is cooking burgers, chicken, potatoes..  Since the ribolator rotates like a carousel, if the meat or vegetables manage to flame up, by the time the carousel comes back around back down to the coal, your food doesnt stay on fire and burn.  I can put burgers and chicken on the ribolator, close the lid and come back in 15 minutes and not have to worry about flair ups, flip meat over, in 10 minutes you have perfectly cooked food.Some other useful mods you can do for the smoker, whether the 22 or the 18 is get a temp controller, i have the bbq guru cyberq wifi, pretty much makes this smoker set and forget.  The eyelet grommets from bbq guru are also good to have so you can have your thermometer sensors go through the eyelets instead of getting smashed from your lid.  I would also suggest getting the gasket kits that they sell on ebay or wherever else to help insulate the gaps where the lid and body sit together.
B001I8ZTJA i bought this smoker without knowing anything about smoking.  I read and researched methods and recipes and what type of woods to use with which meat.  I have smoked ribs, brisket, pork, chicken, tamales (yes i know, just tried it on a whim) all have come out awesome.  I have taken samples to work to get feedback and I have not gotten any bad feedback yet.  Family loves everything I have smoked on this smoker.  Best toy I have so far.
B001I8ZTJA I've literally been smoking something every weekend!! I can't get enough of this thing. It's awesome!!! 6 stars!!! The 22.5&#34; is the way to go too. You may think that it's only a little bigger than the smaller 18&#34; one but those 4 inches makes a big difference when you put the two grates side by side. You can fit a ton of meat on here between the two grates. I did two pork butts on the top and 6 racks on ribs on the bottom. Like I said, plenty of room.
B001I8ZTJA Great Smoker/Cooker. It is plenty large enough to cook acouple of briskets or chickens or several racks of ribs. I smoked a Turkey a in it with no problem. Once I got the temperature where I wanted it it stayed very stable for 6 hours. I definitely recommend this smoker
B001I8ZTJA Cant beat this thing for the money when compared to how much it can hold and how well it holds the temps.  I just wish they sold some kind of cheap disposable liner for the drip tray as its nasty to clean after every cook.
B001I8ZTJA We bought the 22.5 WSM in april and tested it. First item we made was Prime rib (2 hours job) then pork ribs (5 hours job). This smoker runs like a machine. We filled the pan with water ignited the charcoals and you forget the smoker. Just wait until ready.Cleaning this week was easy afterwards and the smoker is ready to go again.Consuption of coals is moderade compared to the size. For both jobs we used about 16 pounds of coals only. This is not much compared with the the smoker was running 7 hours in total. We closed all vents after the food was ready and stopped the smoker. Good coals we re-used for the next job.We can warmly recommend this unit for trouble free smoking of food regardless if much or just a little. This smoker is worth every penny.
B001I8ZTJA This unit is amazing. I will review the form and function and add some personal tips.First: The smoker is modular, 3 pieces. The base is where all the heat comes from. The unit comes with a steel grate and a charcoal ring. The ring is enameled. I bought a second grate and placed it perpendicular to the first grate so that you have smaller holes. I use lump charcoal and some of the pieces can get small. The base has 3 dampers at 120 degrees apart. It also comes with a heat shield at the bottom on the outside. (Personal note: Put the heat shield on the legs BEFORE you attach the base. Better with 2 people. If not you will know what I am talking about, unless you like taking it back apart.) Lets move to the middle section. This is where all the magic happens. The middle section consists of a water pan (heatsink) and 2 cooking grates. One directly on top of the pan and on at the top of the section. They are the same size as a Weber kettle grill. I can smoke 3 full slabs of babybacks on each grate. It has an aluminum access door so that you can get to the fire section and the water pan. Speaking of the water pan or heatsink, this is what gives you your indirect heat in a vertical smoker. I personally do not use water in the pan. I use ceramic briquettes and 2 layers of heavy duty aluminum foil to catch the drippings. The reason: Evey time you open the lid, it adds to your cook time. Every time you open the access door it causes a heat spike. So I have less hassle and more steady and consistent smokes. Now for the lid. It has 2 handles for easy on and off, and a thermometer( which you shouldn't trust) and a top damper(which should never be closed period). Note: Do not put lid or mid section on concrete, it will chip the enamel. Use wood or bamboo rods, it will save you heartache in the future.Second: fuel efficiencyMy setup and the nature of the design will yield 12 to 14 hours of smoke time on one 8.8 lb bag of lump charcoal.Personal Mods:I made a cart to make it somewhat portable. Raised it 4 inches off the deck of the cart and placed an inverted deep dish pizza pan under the bottom for added heat dispersion. Made handle for cart with dowels to hang the wireless meat/pit probes. Drilled 3 holes large enough for the probes to go through at the top of the middle section( it doesn't affect the thermodynamics and the smoke will coat and it will not rust). I also installed a digiQ unit to my smoker for better and more consistent temps.There are plenty of resources on the internet about setups, charcoal techniques and modifications and ultimately it is up yo you to set your unit up the way it works best for you. My personal notes and setups may not work for your preferences. After all, this smoker is a tool, and nobody uses a tool in exactly the same way. I just hope my review related that this was an excellent product and that there were options on how you can utilize it.Good luck in your smoking adventures.
B001I8ZTJA I got the 18.5 inch version of the Weber Smokey Mountain smoker (WSM) a couple of years ago and love it.  For a recent birthday, my original plan was to give myself one of those high end ceramic grills.  Unfortunately, some home remodeling projects were higher up on the priority list, so I came to my senses and got the 22.5 WSM and got a bathroom remodeled for about the cost of a ceramic grill.I'm a pretty big fan of Weber, so I'm not surprised that the 22.5 works great.  I love the extra size you get with the 22.5, the ability it gives you to lay 3 full slabs of ribs flat across the top grate, and the ability to lay a full packer brisket on the top grate without having to try to shoe-horn it between the grate handles.  After cooking on my 18.5 WSM for a couple of years, my only regret was that I didn't get the 22.5 WSM instead.  Now I am happy to have both.
B001I8ZTJA First; let's just say that Amazon is great as a fulfillment company!  This massive cooker was delivered in a few days - free shipping of course just as we have come to expect.Ok; onto the Weber.  I've owned the Weber Kettle Grills since the 70's and my Dad bought his first one from George Stephens back in the 1950's - they are top quality charcoal grills and allow for indirect cooking which is the key to excellent results.For a long time I've thought about getting a smoker cooker and gave thought to an offset smoker, Big Green Egg and other types of cookers, but came back to looking at the WSM and finally purchased it about two months ago.  I came in a very well packed and organized box - clearly the Weber engineering folks spent a lot of time working on this and I was pleasantly surprised at how well all the pieces fit.  All of the packaging materials were recyclable as well; very nice.From start to finish it takes about 30 minutes to put this together and anyone can do it.What I didn't realize is how immobile this thing is once it's assembled.  It's essentially 3 sections; the lid, the center section which holds the two cooking grates and the water bowl, and the bottom charcoal section.  As others have pointed out, the Virtual Weber Bullet website [...] has some great tips and ideas and I built a stand to put this on that is on wheels (see pics at top of page).  That's really helpful for shuttling this thing around the patio or into the garage.So far I've done 4 cooks and each exceeded my expectations!  Last weekend I cooked two pork butts starting at 11P and taking them off the grill the following day at 3P - Best Pulled Pork I've ever had!  We had 12 people over for dinner and all were ecstatic over the taste!  Great smoke ring and bark on the outside and melt in your mouth pork; I made a Carolina based sauce to accompany it and wow was that good!I've also made ribs (5.5 hours), smoked fresh salmon and a smoked chicken.Be prepared to buy charcoal!  I buy 2 20lb bags at Home Depot for $16.  The long cook above - 16 hours - was done with only ONE fill of the charcoal chamber using the minion method!  I did fill the chamber with an entire 20lb bag, but never added charcoal the entire cook!  Wow!  I should also add that the WSM held a temp at 250F the entire time.If you want to entertain friends in a new and fun fashion, this is a great way to go!  I've also posted a couple pics of the cooked pork and pulled pork.  Great stuff.
B001I8ZTJA I just started smoking meat in August 2013 on two OLD Weber Kettles, an 18.5\" and a 22.5\" with a Smokenator.  Ribs, turkeys, fish, pork shoulders, meat loafs, chuck roasts, etc have all been smoked successfully.  I learned all about temperature control, patience, \"thin blue smoke\", and the necessary toys required for great backyard BBQ.  Unfortunately the Kettles require fairly constant attention and I was looking for a smoker that would allow me to set and forget for at least 5-6 hours.  The Kettles rarely went more than 90 minutes before they required attention.  My wife was tired of giving up a Saturday or Sunday while I tended the Kettles so she said for Christmas \"buy any smoker you want.\"  Given my BBQ success with the Kettles it was an easy decision to stay with the Weber brand because the WSM has the reputation of being a \"set and forget\" smoker for at least 5-6 hours, if not more.I knew going in that the door on the WSM was the weakest part of the system.  The smoker arrived with a damaged door due to placement in the box.  One quick e-mail to Weber with pictures and three hours later I received an e-mail saying a replacement door was being shipped to me.  THAT my friends is customer service!I bent the damaged door into a relatively usable shape so I could at least \"season\" the WSM.  Loaded with slightly less than 1/2 load of briquettes I did a dry run (no water) with the temp up to 350F.  The damaged door was leaking like crazy but I wasn't smoking meat, just burning off the shipping oils.  I had Maverick chamber probes on both grates, plus the lid temp gauge, to measure differences between the grates and the lid.  At 350 on the lid the top grate read 365 and the bottom grate read 385.  This was counterintuitive to what I expected but it held true during my entire test run.  I adjusted the vents and held top grate at 350F for two hours with no adjustments.  Then I started cranking it down to 275F.It took a couple hours to drop to 275F (top grate) with the leaky door, but once there I had no problem keeping it at 275F for 6 hours without a single additional adjustment! The bottom grate was running at 290F and the lid at 265F.I then cranked it down to 225F (top grate), stirred the coals once, and proceeded to fall asleep.  Woke up two hours later and it was still at 225F.  In all the meatless smoker held the temps I wanted for 12+ hours on just a little less than a half load of charcoal and once I dialed in the temps I wanted it held steady on a relatively windless day/night with no adjustments.Once I get the new door, pork shoulders and brisket are on the menu.
B001I8ZTJA Very easy to use and great bang for the buck.  Excellent customer service.Easy to setup and there is even a website designed to help WSM users....[...]I used that site and got smoking some great good in no time.I received the smoker and one of the parts was slightly out of shape, causing some smoke to escape and the lid wouldn't fit completely flush.  One call to weber customer service and they shipped out the replacement part without making me jump through hoops.  It's tough to find quality customer service nowadays....  They made a loyal customer out of me.Buy the 22\"....  It's a great size and I personally feel the 18\" is a bit small.It works very efficiently and doesn't waste charcoal.
B001I8ZTWM This is another great product by Weber.  Honestly, everything I have purchased from Weber has been of the utmost quality product you will find on the grilling market.  The only thing I am not crazy about whith this product is the skewers.  they are actually split so that you can spread apart to help keep some foods in place.  I think I would prefer skewers that are not round, but have flats instead.
B001I8ZTWM I try to always purchase Weber for my Weber Genesis E-330 637-Square-Inch 38,000-BTU Natural Gas and the Kabab set fits the bill nicely.  In North Florida we grill almost ever night of the week.  The Kababs we make are always good, nice, and tender even without marinating them.  To keep my wonderful bride of 51 years happy; I plan to start cooking my breakfast on it every morning that I can.
B001I8ZTWM There are lots of decent kebob sets out there, and for the most part, all do their jobs acceptably well. Most are priced well below this set. But if you're as interested in presentation as much as you are taste, the higher price of this set is worth it.The shape and finish are very nice, and unlike a couple other reviewers, I found the quality of both workmanship and materials to be excellent. The double skewers do a great job of preventing skewered items from just rolling loosely when you attempt to turn your kebobs over for even cooking.There's plenty of room for nice big hunks of meats, vegetables, fruits, or whatever else you're skewering, too. Many other sets don't leave quite as much room between skewers on the rack, thereby limiting the size of anything you put on the skewers. The trade-off for being able to use larger pieces is that instead of 6 kebobs at a time, which is common with other sets like this, you can only grill five kebobs at a time with this one. That presents no problem here, as we rarely cook for more than four.The real payoff comes when you lift the rack with your finished kebobs out of your grill and carry it to where your guests will be served. They present so much more nicely on this rack. Of course they won't be on that rack for long, just long enough for your guests to see how nice it all looks before being served, but hey, first impressions mean a lot, right? And your guests are worth it!I hope some of you will find my review helpful in making a more informed decision as you consider your buying choices. Peace :-)
B001I8ZTWM Similar to theWeber 6453 Style Rib Rack, this kabob set is something you'd really only get as a gift for someone, or if you happen to be a fan of the Weber brand and Style series.You're paying a relatively big premium over theWeber 6405 All-Purpose Kabob Set, and losing a kabob slot. But, you also receive one of the nicest looking kabob sets around, and it comes in a very nice full color box that looks nice as a gift and would be easy to wrap.The two-prong design on the skewers is really very good. They do a better than average job of keeping your food from spinning around randomly, when you're turning them. The Weber logo on each skewer is a nice touch, but they'll most likely turn brown by the time your kabobs are ready, and they're kind of a pain to keep clean.The wide handles on either side of the rack make it very easy to take your kabobs from the grill to your table, but like the rib rack, it will be extremely hot (especially if you're cooking with direct heat). You have to be very careful about where you put the rack, because it retains heat quite well.You may notice in one of the pictures, the person holding the rack has twoWeber Barbecue Mitts. Take it from someone who learned the hard way: you should have two of them, too. Depending on your tolerance for heat, you've got about 20 - 30 seconds to get from the grill to your destination with those mitts, before things start getting painful. Don't even try it with regular oven mitts, unless your table is directly next to your grill.Personally, I don't mind paying a little more for the double skewer design and the look of the Style series. The only drawback is that Weber doesn't offer additional skewers in a retail pack. I'd love to have about 10 more, so I could really keep a cookout with kabobs going. More likely than not, I'll give them a call and see if I can buy them from their parts department, and update this if they're willing to sell the skewers separately.
B001I8ZTWM I bought this for our Webber Q220 grill. As another user said, the double prong skewers are worth it alone. I have never seen skewers such high quality. The rack is nice if you don't want it to stick to the grill. I looked at the other ones out there, including the one for $10 less with 1 more skewer by Weber. The double prong makes this set worth buying.
B001I912V8 This hose hanger doesn't cost much, does the job, and is elegant in its simplicity. It's made in the United States. The metal is joined with a nice, cold weld, is well-finished, and looks good. You have to have a sturdy pole to mount it and hold the hose securely. Also, it could be used in the garage or workroom to hold extension cords.
B001I912V8 There is nothing all that fancy here and you pretty much get what you see.  This is a hunk of galvanized metal, cut, bent and welded into a very functional shape to hold your garden hose.  It is sturdier than you might think and it is truly functional; although not the prettiest thing in the world.  Whether it holds 100 feet of hose will depend a lot on what brand of hose you use.This is my second of these holders.  I use one for a hose I have to water the hosta beds in the back and I have another hanging in my shed to store electrical extension cords...both work and function as they are suppose to.  The one out in the elements has not rusted (yet) or bent despite being exposed to the rain and snow and despite the fact that the hose mounted on it is a rather heavy one.A couple of things to note:  First, these do not come with screws - you will have to provide your own.  When you decide on what screw to use I would strongly suggest you use it with a metal washer of some sort.  The weight of a hose, over time, could damage the mounting holes.  DON'T use nails as a friend of mind did with his...nails will not hold well enough.  I personally have used rust proof screws.Nice hold if you are not expecting a high tech product...just functional.Don BlankenshipThe Ozarks
B001I912V8 I was surprised with how much hose this thing holds - it really has quite a lot of space.  I'm not sure you'd want it on the side of your house since it's every bit as ugly as it looks in the picture, but for a garage or a shop or somewhere where aesthetics don't matter it's perfect.  I can't speak to its rust proof-ness, but so far we love it.  Great product!
B001I912V8 Looking at the photos, I expected a fairly compact product made of shiny metal.  One thing I hate about hose reels is that they&#8217;re usually an eyesore, but this one looked nice.  When it arrived, my first thought was that it was HUGE.  Second was that it wasn&#8217;t shiny at all.  It looked like someone had taken a piece of scraped up pipe and shaped it into a hook.  Also, it came with nothing to actually hang it; no screws, brackets, nothing.  It&#8217;s a shaped piece of pipe with some holes drilled in it.
B001I912V8 The Yard Butler hose hanger is substantial, nicer looking than most and rust proof.  It keeps hoses up off the ground, kink and tangle free.  It attaches with 2 screws and is easy to install.I gave it 4 starts because I do not find it as useful as hangers with reels, but if it really resists rust, it will get that star back. (I live in a place with high humidity,  salt in the air, enormous amounts of rain. I have not seen rust-proof yet, but we will see.)  I will update this review if I do see signs of rust.  If I do not I will be very impressed.It is better built and nicer looking than our other hose hangers, but not as easy to use as the reels, particularly with long hoses. It does, however, hold them (even heavy-duty 75 foot hoses).
B001I912V8 The rust proof material is basically galvanized steel. It should last a significantly long time as long as it doesn't see salt water corrosion, and if the inside is properly galvanized. My previous hose hangers have rusted through, mainly due to corrosion from the inside. The Yard Butler has to be bolted/screwed onto a post or wall, and I found a large wooden post that I secured to my chain link fence in order to utilize the Yard Butler. It manages my garden hose quite nicely.Overall: 5/5 stars
B001I912V8 I have to admit I was a bit disappointed with this at first but it&#8217;s one of those products that just grows on you. It&#8217;s made from galvanized steel tube bent into shape and welded with end caps to clean up the holes and mounts with two screws.I was disappointed because the finish was not that great. The photo shows one that is pretty much polished metal while the actual thing does not look polished at all and has some kind of material identification number markings pressed into the metal in a couple of spots.  It also didn&#8217;t come with any hardware. So you have to source your own screws/bolts or whatever you plan to use.That aside, I did hang this up on our redwood fence. We had some suitable screws with largish size heads that fit the two holes. Our fence was screwed rather than nailed so it was no problem to screw this in. It only took a couple of minutes and the long double stem that has been welded provides a lot of support as well as being wide enough that the hanger does not rotate from side to side.The 50 inch hose hung well and the curvy shape of the hanger and the fact that it&#8217;s at an angle means that it&#8217;s easy to take the hose off without the hose getting caught or tangled.ConclusionDespite the finish being a bit industrial looking up close, it is a sturdy piece that matches our galvanized fence posts. So in my case it doesn&#8217;t look at all out of place. Plus you can&#8217;t really see the blemishes unless you&#8217;re looking for them.  And our backyard looks a lot more organized now without the hose lying heaped on the ground next to the patio.All in all, I quite like it.
B001I912V8 I was skeptical when I ordered this, but it is wonderful. So lightweight, but really sturdy.  Holds lots and lots of hose. Easy to install. I recommend using washers between the screws and hanger when installing to prevent the holes from enlarging. Only improvement I would make would be to include the washers and screws with the hanger.
B001IDO78O great buy very strong , when I use it it really works worth the money will buy every year for this price thank you 9/7/13
B001IDO78O I live in the south so roaches are a part of our lives.I went to Home Depot to buy bug killer for the shop kitchen and found a multitude of choices, all with different ingredients.  The guy helping me said he'd tried many of them and found Bayer Advanced the most effective.  I'm familiar with the Bayer brand and use it in the garden.My brother sprayed around the baseboards at the shop kitchen and, as expected, had the floor littered with dead roach carcases the next morning.  Then he sprayed the baseboards in my house.  I hadn't seen any roaches lately so I was amazed to sweep up close to 24 dead roaches 24 hours later, another dozen a week later, and another dozen a week after that.  It's been over three weeks now and we haven't seen a live roach in either the house or the shop.This spray had a slight odor for a short period of time (totally gone by the time I got home from work) and didn't give me a headache as others have reported.  My brother also said it was easier to spray because it came out in a stream rather than a mist so he didn't worry about it drifting to countertops. My brother's a big strong man and he didn't have any problems with the handle breaking.  Possibly Bayer has a quality control issue and we just got a good squirter.Because of the grandchildren, I use the poison-free killers most of the time and only when I see a roach.  I won't use this bug killer inside routinely but I will definitely buy it for the shop and will use it on baseboards a couple of weeks before family visits.
B001IDO78O When I put the spray handle in fine mist mode (which requires more force than stream mode) the spray handle kept cracking open at the seams.  The spray handle will work OK if you use it gently.  When I sprayed this I recognized the smell of methy nonyl ketone, which is a sweet smelling animal deterrent (it is the active ingredient in Boundary brand spray) that keeps the dogs and cats away.  Methy nonyl ketone has an unmistakable smell so I think the Bayer insecticide uses this as a safety measure to keep the pets from licking treated surfaces, which is a nice feature.
B001IDO78O Read the extensive multipage label information on this product and prepare to be scared. You're advised not to breathe the vapors or mist and not to get any on your skin or clothing. Wash thoroughly after using the product, and on and on. I'm not minimizing the danger of this product to humans, but many insecticides contain these warnings and advisements on their containers. Personally I don't like spraying anything toxic enough to  kill insects quickly. However, ants have been a problem and nuisance for us, so I made an exception for the Bayer.Others have complained about the sprayer so I have handled it with great care. Having used almost three quarters of the product, I see that the  sprayer still maintains its integrity and soundness.The sprayer can be used to inject the product into cracks and crevices, a feature that I appreciate. Though the Bayer is said to be safe for indoor use, I choose to use it only for outdoor applications.This product does kill the ants and kills them quickly. They also don't return.We had an ant infestation in an outdoor storage chest. Even after an emptying and thorough hose washing of the chest, the ants returned with gusto. I sprayed the inside and outside of the chest, being sure to get inside all the seams at the corners. A month has passed and not an ant to be seen in it.I also sprayed several any colonies in the yard with good success. We also had problems with ants crawling up a pole into the bird feeder. I sprayed the pole and problem solved.On the front porch,ants kept infesting and building colonies in the mortar cracks. I soaked the cracks with Bayer, and no more ants.Previous treatments with other products only worked for a short time.To wrap things up - I've had good success with this product. It's one that should be used carefully and judiciously. To me, the germ killing claim is a bit silly and of no interest. I would guess than many toxic chemicals will kill insects and germs alike.
B001IDO78O The handle invariably cracks and breaks before you are able to use all of the product. This result in the sprayer either failing to spray at all, or it leaks the insecticide all over your hands. I've used 6 of these in the past and only one handle didn't break.It seems Bayer is jumping on the band wagon of offering to sanitize our homes. I see no benefit in this product 'killing 99.9% of germs that insects leave behind'. Firstly I have never caught flu from a spider; secondly the product is toxic, it is not like I can prepare food where I had previously sprayed. Obviously a marketing blurb dreamt up by some halfwit in an effort to differentiate the product from others.The product is OK, suitable for urban areas with low instances of pests. Out here in the boonies we found we had to resort to a professional product ( Cy-Kick CS ), which incidentally is not only better at controller pests, but yields more product once diluted.
B001IKU3QC I have bought two of these in 2012 and so far they are working great. I connected both of them together to make a 100 Foot loop around my newly planted evergreens. I used it last week and was surprised to see that I am still getting water all the way to the end of second hose. A lot of people have problem with soaker hose where all the water is dispensed in the first few feets and never bleeds that well from the last remaining feet, but this seems to be doing fine. Also, the quality is good. It has been sitting out for over two years in mid-atlantic weather and has had its share of heat and and cold and I have not noticed any degradation in the hose or the connectors.
B001IKU3QC It is light, rolls up nicely for storage and oozes out the water exactly as a soaker hose should.These weigh only a fraction of what most soaker hoses weigh. I used to hate rolling up my old hoses as they were so heavy and bulky. These hoses are the answer to prayer.These seem to be very well made. I've been using mine in the south Texas heat for a month now and they are none the worse for wear.I like this hose. I bought two additional in 25' length and I'm just as happy with those.
B001IKU3QC On the basis of good experience with 4 other of the same hoses (2 - 50ft ordered last year; 2- 25ft ordered this year, I ordered another 50ft. I like the fact that they're relatively unobtrusive compared to the conventional thick round ones, and they take up much less space when removed and packed up for winter storage. Unfortunately the quality of this one was very poor. It leaks severely at the hose connection itself as well as having additional pinhole leaks near that connection.  This was the last element of a complex timer based watering system, and I discovered the problem 3 days before leaving for two months.  Perhaps I'd just been lucky with my other hoses or maybe the 25ft hoses I got this year are from last year's stock, and the quality of those manufactured most recently has gone down.  Home Depot website has what I now think may be same hose with different packaging and reviewers there complain of leaking. Too late to re-order, so I'll try waterproof tape.  My other 75ft setup without leaks works fine all the way to the end of the run.  Hopefully the tape will work well enough to give me enough water pressure so that this will also make it to the end. All in all, a major drag and irritation....(Edit)  Just went to rearrange one of my 25ft sections and discovered another pinhole puncture.  This isn't in a particularly problematic spot, but it does lend support to the idea that there's a difference in quality between last year's and this year's models.  I will not get these again.
B001IKU3QC I've been using this hose, snaked around some bushes.  I can give them a good dousing without having to go out every 15 minutes to move the hose from one bush to the next. All I do now is snap the hose onto theGilmour Brass Male Hose End Connector 09QCMI've added to the end, set the valve to a trickle, and wait a few hours.Another reviewer mentioned putting a 1/8\" hole in a penny and using that as a flow restricter.  That doesn't seem to work with the hose connector attache. I prefer the convenience of being able to snap the hose on and off but do need to keep the water pressure down.Another thing I've found handy is a a set of theseAnchoring Pins.  They keep the hose in place and free of twists.[...]
B001IKU3QC I decided to give a soaker hose a try this year instead of moving my hose/sprinkler all over the yard to water my vegetable and flower gardens.  I'm more used to seeing the ones that release the fine mist into the air, but I was hesitant of those because I didn't want the leaves of my tomatoes getting wet.  I'm super pleased with this hose.  Exactly as it says the water just weeps out onto the ground.  I did have to readjust the hose a few times because if it has a sharp bend (kink if you will) the weep is faster before the kink than it is after (obviously).  I found that the readjustments are easy and the hose is fairly forgiving to being snaked around things without kinking.  I'm so happy I purchased it.  It has really cut down on the amount of effort it takes to water my gardens.
B001IKU3QC The Gilmour 27025 works PERFECTLY with the following addition -- Drill a 1/8\" (one-eighth inch) hole in the center of a PENNY -- and place it in the INLET of the Gilmour Soaker Hose.  This will restrict the flow of water and prevent the hose from blowing out !!Many other reviews cited the 27025G Soaker hose failures due to what they thought was the hot climate. I called the Gilmour factory to ask about the multiple failures, and was told this: MOST of the failures were due to TOO MUCH PRESSURE -- The factory tech told me that the recommended water pressure is 10-15 psi with a wide-open valve, and that the recommended proceedure was to just open the valve \"a little bit\". My Moron Detector kicked in immediately. I thanked her for her help, and hung up.I made a restrictor from a PENNY as outlined above, stuck it in there, and the results are EXCELLENT!!  I'm saving water AND extending the life of my Gilmour 27025. I've tried 'em all, and I will NEVER go back to any other type of Soaker Hose.UPDATE -- February 23,2012 -- After several months of use, including direct exposure to Arizona's blazing sun, I've found the Gilmour 27025 Soaker Hose to be far superior to the other types of Soaker Hoses -- and yes, the hose may spring a \"leak\" -- BUT -- I was able to save my hose by cutting out the part that leaked and replacing the inlet fitting at the new location.I found that \"leaks\" are caused by bending the hose sharply, so keeping the hose as straight as possible at all times will keep your soaker lasting longer and putting the water where you WANT it !!And don't forget to make a restrictor -- My water bill was noticebaly lower after adding the restrictor to my Gilmour 27025 !!
B001IKU3QC I was beyond impressed when I got this product. I had been using the regular round rubber soaker hose that takes tons of landscape pins to hold down and wind around my plants. This hose ships flat, is super light, and most importantly, is very flexible. I was able to use mine without any pins to hold it in place.It curves very easily and distributes water evenly throughout the hose. It does put down a good amount of water, which should cut down watering times (at least for higher water pressures). The material looks to be able to last for a long time as it is flexible and a type of mesh. Also, the product does come with a limited lifetime warranty. Gilmour products have been used in my garden for years with satisfaction, and I am happy to add this to my collection.EDIT - 5/10/12I have had two of my hoses develop leaks right near spigot connection. If you e-mail Gilmour customer service, they will send you an address where you can return the ends of your hose (no need to send the whole thing) and they will replace it for free. I have gotten one back and need to send the other one in. So when they say lifetime warranty..they do hold up their end of the deal. I will try some of the solutions in other reviews in hopes I won't have to replace anymore. (Pulling them up out of an established garden is not good for the plants...or me!)
B001IKU3QC This style garden weeper is a great idea.The only problem is that it had a huge leak on day one.Rather than spending money to return it, we tried tying it off since the leak was about 3 feel from the end.Please, manufacturer, do better quality control in making and checking this product!
B001IKU3QC I got the 25-foot one, and I love it--so much so that I ordered the 50-foot one, too (the reviews on the 75-foot one gave me pause, so I'm sticking with the shorter lengths). I placed my regular garden hose at the start of the flower bed and then attached this to it, and voila! I can now turn the faucet on, set a timer, and come back in 20-40 mins (depending on the recent weather)....and my plants are all watered! I like that this is flat, so it's easy to place it. I ordered the little stakes, too, and think they will come in handy--because sometimes, when you're working in the garden or re-mulching or whatever, the hose can get moved. Might as well secure it.This hose is super easy to weave around plants. I put it pretty close to them so that they get enough water. Experiment with the water pressure--I find that it's best to barely turn it on and let them have a nice long, slow soak.This will definitely make my life easier, save water, and prevent me from doing what I always do--just giving the plants a quick, shallow soak, which is exactly what you're NOT supposed to do!
B001IKU3QC This soaker is great.  I've had other soakers before that felt like a weird cork-like substance and they fall apart.  They also don't really soak anything, just sort of &#34;sweat&#34;.  These ones are totally different.  They actually leak nicely and relatively evenly.  I can turn on the water and ignore them for 10-20 minutes and then turn the water off!  Easy!  Everything is soaked and it doesn't take forever, which is good because I'm not trying to leave them on all day.
B001IKU3QC Some reviewers had trouble with the inner hose breaking over time. I haven&#8217;t had this problem. I use them along fences where water from sprinkler would flow on sidewalk or back into yard. Water stays near hose. With a slow flow, I can leave it on for an hour to soak ground.
B001IKU3QC This is one of those items that either works or doesn't...this one does and very well.  It seems to be a cut above some of the cheaper soaker hoses I've tried most of which barely last a short season.  This one appears to be well made and works just fine.
B001IKU3QC But I was blissfully wrong.  This appears to be a well made, rugged soaker hose and I particularly like the canvas-like casing around the hose which looks like it will stand up longer to sun exposure than the round soakers I've used.  I bought another one immediately!
B001IKU3QC I am unbelievably surprised.  I screwed two Gilmour 75 foot weeper hoses together to cover the front lawn.  I then hooked it up to my sprinkler system, attaching it with a brass connector and teflon to one of the sprayer risers.  Without decreasing too much pressure from the rest of the zone, in 15 minutes, the weeper hose saturated the lawn areas where it was lying.  I imagine it has to be moved around and left on for probably an hour to saturate the entire lawn.  I wanted to install it permanently under the grass, but Gilmour does not recommend leaving it out in freezing winter months.
B001IKU3QC I've got 3 of these connected together and they do a good job of soaking the grass roots on a terrace without wasting water. The soakers are remarkably durable--I got them last year and expected them to fall apart this year but they are good as ever. I may buy a couple more because water's gotten terribly expensive in Colorado.
B001IKU3QC It does indeed droppeth like the gentle rain. Now I have to say upfront, I'm not really a gardener. I just have some planters on my patio with stuff in them that I generally kill just by looking at.  Some nurseries don't even let me walk down the aisles anymore, I'm like Dutch Elm Disease on two legs.  But this has helped make me somewhat less lethal.  At least my tomato plant didn't try crawling over the patio railing to escape this year, which previous tomato plants have been known to try.I don't know how the Glimmer weeper/soaker works in a garden, but for my patio boxes, it's the perfect solution. I'm about as lazy as a creature can be and still have a pulse, so anything that saves me work is a good thing, and this does just that.  There are times when I love puttering around, schlepping with the watering can, picking dead leaves, poking into the soil and generally annoying the plants.  But there are other days when I just don't want to bother.I bought this to replace another soaker system that was too much of a good thing...five minutes and the plants were floating in mud.  This is superior in several ways.First, it's make of fabric, not rubber, so doesn't fight me.  I run it along planter boxes that are on all 3 sides of my patio.  The rubber was forever wanting to straighten out. Even the little hairpin shaped gizmos I used to hold it down wouldn't keep it in place. and when it did straighten out, it mowed down the plants like a little steam roller.  My plants have enough trouble with me looking after them. They didn't need a deranged waterhose going after them too.  The Glimmer Soaker/Weeper is much more biddable.  It stays bent where you want it to bend.Second, the soaking is lighter...I don't know if the holes are smaller or if there are fewer of them, but the water doesn't come pouring out, it just sort of leaks out slowly, so it sinks to the bottom of the planter, instead of floating on top (particularly important if you live in a dry climate and \"forgot\" to water for a week or so).  Some of my herbs prefer not to have their feet very wet, but that's not a problem either.  I moved that planter to the end of the row. When those plants have had enough water, I just pick up the soaker hose from that planter and double it back on itself so the thirstier plants get a double dose.  It's fast, it's easy.The best part is, you just turn on the spigot, pick up your gin and tonic and a book, put up your feet, and watch the soaker hose do all the work.  If they ever add an attachment that does dishes, I'm going to ask it to marry me.
B001IKU3QC I thought that this soaker hose would be a great way to keep my garden watered efficiently.  Actually, I don't find this to be very effective for my needs in south FLorida at all.  Don't use it at all.
B001IKU3QC This is okay.  The quality is good if you like soaker hoses.  I guess I just don't care for them.  This one is well made and is flat.
B001IKU3QC My original review was a five star. I am dropping it to two and I will explain below.The older Gilmour soaker hoses are excellent if you have one that was made before 2012 HANG ON TO IT AND DON'T LET IT GO.THE HOSES THEY SELL NOW ARE NOT THE QUALITY ONES THEY SOLD ONLY A YEAR OR TWO AGO.I own several of the older hoses. I needed two more. I ordered them and the new is not the same quality as the old. The old ones have two seams and are heavy duty. On the older ones if you had a kink in the line all you had to do was turn the water on and the hose would straighten itself out. Not so with the new ones. Once they are kinked they stay kinked. This is an issue with me because I run mine through cattle panels that I tie my tomato plants to. It's harder for me to get the kinks out in a system like this. It was not an issue with the older hoses.The newer hoses do not water as evenly as the old. Oh they are still a good hose but not nearly as good as they were just a few years ago.I am not sure but I think the price of the new hose is higher than the old. So basically they have reduced their costs by making a lower quality hose and increased their profits even more by charging a higher price. I still need more hoses but they will not be the Gilmour brand. Their short term business practices have lost them a long term customer because I now have to assume that they have probably lowered the quality on all their products.I dislike doing reviews like these. I really like my old Gilmour hoses and originally wrote a glowing review on them. I think that is what irritated me the the most. People may have bought the newer hoses based on my review. I'm glad Amazon lets us edit these reviews even after they are a couple of years old.If Gilmour changes back to selling the old high quality hose I will edit this review again.
B001IKU3QC I installed over 350 ft of this hose.  Worked so well I bought more and more.  Within two months, three have failed: a 25', 50' and a 75'.  Gilmor agreed to replace these but why would I?  Lifetime guarantee, yes.  Gilmor also said this hose is for low pressure: 10 to 15 lbs.  Pressure reducers in my stores are 25 lb.  Wish I had saved my receipts so I could get refunds.
B001JF5THE chainsaw cuts awesome..easy to assemble..great price..cuts the big branches with ease..(caution)learn how to use saw before using..lot of how to use saw on you tube..this saw can hurt you..so safety is first..price is awesome..this is a real bargain ..i also have a pole saw for the hard to reach branches..
B001JF5THE We didn't cut down the giant tree in our back yard, we hired professionals. But once it was down, we used this to cut up the sections into firewood pieces. It takes awhile, its a smaller chainsaw, but it works and it the price is fantastic.  :)  It has worked great for us.
B001JF5THE I really like this saw for around my home, it very powerfull and get the job done. Im not cutting large trees are anything larger than 6 inches around. I have used it to remove some old poisonous trees, and some poisonous shrubs around our home. It does a great Job and it easy to remove the chain and bar, My only worry is there is a small flat o-ring that could be easily lost, and The biggest thing about this saw is the handguard is stationary it doesn't lock back when kick back occurs, it uses a metal anti kick back device on the tip of the bar that comes lose even with a lock nut on it.
B001JF5THE Love this thing. It's a beast. We had a high speed but short lived wind storm in the summer of 2012. This thing was a lifesaver and I am still using it to clear out tree debris behind the house, which is a forest. Highly recommend this saw. Love it.
B001JF5THE This is my fifth electric chainsaw in thirty years so i had some idea what to expect. I also own a Stihl gas chainsaw and a little 18 volt battery model.The saw was delivered within a reasonable time period and since it was a Warehouse Deal the price was great. Had I paid full price, I would feel somewhat disappointed. As it is, the saw, though described as used, came in new condition except for some extra tape on the previously opened box.Some thoughts:The Earthwise is lighter than my recently departed Remington electric and doesn't look or feel as rugged. I like the chain tightener mechanism on the Remington much better.Though not as loud as my Stihl, this saw puts out some decibels, and for any sustained sawing I'd recommend some earplugs.Cutting power - The saw cuts well though not nearly as easily as the Stihl. Small branches pose no problem. I also cut some fireplace size logs easily enough also and didn't have bits of wood chips shooting back at me. Just to test it, I cut off a piece of a 14 inch diameter pine stump. I made the cut without too much difficulty but it would have been easier without the safety tip on the end of the bar. The safety tip might make changing bar and chain a little more involved.The plastic bar cover fits so snugly that most of the time I'll probably just leave it off.The small oil tank cover removes easily and with its bright green color should be easy to find when waylaid. It's also convenient to be able to check oil level at a glance through the oil level window.The owner's manual is printed in a ridiculously small font, so small that reading it can be a painful chore. As of this writing Earthwise doesn't have a web page yet, so any information you seek will have to come from the manual or by calling the company's toll free number found on the back of the manual. When I called, a human answered on the first ring and told me that the Earthwise web page is a work in progress.The directions in the manual for tightening the chain are incorrect. From experience with other chainsaws I could figure out how the tool free tightener works. Just loosen the inner wheel and tighten with the outer wheel.The handle is adequate, but I would prefer a wrap around handle like the ones on my Stihl and the Remington. Horizontal cutting is much more secure and comfortable with the wrap around handle.Too many times the saw became unplugged at the saw end. I finally got in the habit of holding the cord and handle at the same time to prevent this.The Earthwise delivers what one would expect from an electric saw. Despite being called \"The Clean Air Choice\", I don't think it's any greener than any other electric saw except for the fluorescent green plastic accents.UPDATE - 10/2010  Used the saw today and the chain came off three times. Very annoying, but I did learn how to put the chain back on.Update 2/25/12  Put on a new chain recently and the chain is still working well. It wasn't difficult to put on the new chain. As I write this the replacement chain is not in stock on Amazon.
B001JF5THE I bought this electric saw a year ago, but did not use it until a week ago when I cut down 3 oak trees between 20 and 30 inches in diameter.  I wanted the firewood and planned on using this saw to form and rip the logs.  The bad news is that the oiling system of the Earthwise saw was defective out of the box.  I called the manufacturer (Rollin) and they sent me a new saw without any argument.  Meanwhile I manually oiled the old saw and was able to cut up 4 face cords of firewood with the same ease as the gas saws I had previously owned.  This saw is able to take a beating.  It cross cuts and rips like a breeze, especially if one sharpens the chain after about 2 hours use (the Oregon replacement chain is S57). I rarely give the superlative grade to a product, but this time it seems appropriate.
B001JJCW0M After initial setup, which was quite easy with the enclosed directions, the Victor Electronic Mouse Trap was placed against a wall where evidence of mice were found.  The next day the indicator was blinking indicating a mouse should be in the trap but the trap was empty.  It hasn't happened again so I'm still not sure why that happened or if the electronic zap just wasn't strong enough to kill the mouse.After almost a month of use we still haven't caught any mice. I'm giving 3 stars because it's easy to set up and if it works clean up will be a breeze compared to sticky traps where a live mouse must be disposed of. But I'm still not sure if the trap is working correctly.  I will update in  the future if we do catch our furry visitor.
B001JJCW0M All I can say is wow. We keep a clean home and suddenly noticed some mouse dropping and could not figure out where they were coming from. We unpacked this compact little case.. followed the instructions and the next day had 5 mice in it. Was easy to clean and certainly lead to us resting more comfortably not wondering if uninvited guests were wandering around our home. Worth every cent.
B001JJCW0M Little field mice are so tiny and cute, but they can do damage and smell really bad.Especially when the make their way in your pantry to stay.When offered this selection from the Vine listing, I wondered if this method of capture would be kinder than most.They have sticky tape  now, this takes time, imagine the painful slow capture and kill...Medieval torture...cruel.Then there  are  poisons, again takes time...poor little creatures  they just wanted to play.Then came along Multi Kill Electronics Mouse Trap. In my eyes, much of the kinder, it's quick and fast, I feel much better than a lingering slow.The unit is small and compact, comes with it's own batteries, easy to arm, and within 12 hours had done it's job.Neat and tidy and not  cruel.  I liked this system and have not one regret.I recommend this box 100 percent.Feel much better about the kill.If, one can feel good about any kill.?Kindness counts ....
B001JJCW0M I can't say anything good or bad about this product because it sits empty with no catch. I like how it's made and the looks of it, but so far no kill, even with differents kinds of bait used.
B001JJCW0M Old house = mouse haven basement.Mouse haven basement = neighbour's Houdini cat likes to \"apparate\" in the basement.Neighbour's cat apparating in the basement = no poison and no snap traps can be used.So we had to settle for this electrocuting mouse trap which is, so far, cat and dog resistant and does its job of killing mice quite nicely.The bait that has worked the best for us is a tiny piece of bacon or bacon fat.  In fact, only a few minutes after the trap was baited, we noticed the light was on and the trap had its first victim.Highly recommended for situations where snap and chemical traps cannot be used. More traps may be needed if there is a large infestation.
B001JJCW0M This is my third electronic mouse trap. I've also used the single-mouse version (excellent) and another brand's rat version (killed well, but still had to be emptied each time, and an even worse battery drain).Here's how this one works: the mouse goes up the little mouse stairs and into a chamber where he smells peanut butter. When he gets to a certain contact point, he's electrocuted, then dropped into the little drawer underneath.This attracted and killed mice fairly well, and I like the convenience of not having to check on it every day, but the batteries ran out so quickly that it kind of became more of a hassle than the single trap (batteries last a long time, but you have to empty after each kill or you get a horrible rotten mouse mess). The single was so efficient I could even use good rechargeable batteries. If you try rechargeables with the big models, you'll be switching them after every kill.At some point the little floor that zaps them and then drops out and dumps them in the drawer got a little loosey-goosey and I can't tell if it's still making contact. I haven't seen any mice this early this winter (it's super mild, so the weather's not driving them in), so I can't be sure. I'm not brave enough to test it myself. :)
B001JJCW0M So happy to have dead mice to dispose of instead of live capture!I have used other multi catch traps, but they always catch live and I end up with stinky mouse dropping in the trap that also corrodes the metal traps.This plastic trap is easy to clean, except for the bait spot, and I can dump to dead mice instead of dealing with live mice that would just return to the house.And instead of poison that leaves dead mice trapped or hidden in corners or attic, I can remove the mice before they start to decay.To use this trap you place against a wall, a staircase in the back leads up from either direction and mice seem unfazed by this detour.As they follow the scent they step across metal plates, receive a fatal shock, and get dumped into a removable drawer as the trap resets.When the mice are first killed they are pretty clean, don't stink, and are easy to dispose of. If you don't check the trap and you get one that decomposes it will smell very bad and you may have trouble getting mice to visit again.The only improvement would be a removable bait tray so I could clean it when the bait gets a bit rancid.Product Update:After successfully zapping many mice over the past 3 years without ever replacing the batteries a mouse apparently survived the shock.The power on process indicates the batteries are still good, I don't know if I had a super mouse or weak batteries. But apparently after getting dumped into the tray the mouse came to and chewed its way back out of the drawer going through the back, into the staircase, and exposing internal wires.
B001JJCW0M I don't know if this means I don't have any more mice or that this trap doesn't work.  I assume the former, because this trap seems very good in theory.I've read other reviews where the batteries died quickly and the indicator light died after a few days.  I've had this trap turned on for almost two weeks and the light still shows that it's working.This trap is easy to set and very simple to check and clean.  I just haven't caught any critters yet.The design is interesting.  You open the top hatch and fill the bait section with peanut butter and then close it back up.  With fresh batteries installed, turn the device on and set it someplace where you expect mice to frequent.  There are two little staircases where the mice can climb up into the device.  Then the mice walk through a little maze that looks like a miniature carnival fun-house.  The floor of this maze has metal plates that zap the mouse on contact.  Then a revolving scooper thing brushes the little corpse into the lower collector tray.  The tray opens easily from the side so you can see if you caught anything.  The tray supposedly holds up to ten victims.In theory the whole thing makes sense.  I'll just keep moving it around and see what happens.
B001JJCW0M I have yet to actually catch a mouse for the last 3 weeks and as small as the opening is it had better be a small mouse. It uses 4 D cell batteries, I am not sure how long they will last if you get mice since the mice around us don't seem to like the big black death box.. LOL .. If it does work it seems that it should be easy to clean and not have to touch the mice themselves.
B001JJCW0M We have a shed in our backyard where we store garden supplies, potting soil, fertilizer and etc.  Have had a problem with field mice always finding a way to set up housekeeping.  The have destroyed a barbeque cover, and have chewed through several bags of potting soil.  Have set out regular mouse traps with cheese with limited success---they have actually eaten the cheese on the trap without setting it off.  There is the problem of remembering to re-bait the traps and removing the dead mice (at my age I forget more than I can remember).  Have never been able to totally rid the shed of these varmints.  Just got this electronic trap a few days ago, set it up in the shed and waited till the next day to check.  It had three of my little friends in the removable drawer.  Set it up again with fresh peanut butter as directed, nailed another two.  I am impressed, it is so easy to empty the thing and have it ready for using again.  It reminds me a Rube Goldberg device, the little stairs the mice climb to the kill zone and then it's floor rotates to dump them into the collection box.  A light comes on to tell you of success.  This thing amazes me, why didn't I get one sooner?  It may be a little much if you don't have a serious mouse problem, but if you do I will say that the thing works.  What will they think of next?
B001JJCW0M I've tried every type of mouse trap out there, including this one. Here's my comparative assessment:- Old fashioned spring traps are still the cheapest, easiest, and most effective solution. Unfortunately, they're also gross, especially if you elect to empty and reset the traps rather than just throwing them away once they've caught a mouse.- Electric traps seem like a clever idea, but I have never actually caught a mouse in one. I've had this Victor M260 set up in the basement for over a year, and it's never caught a single mouse, despite the fact that other types of traps in the vicinity have caught multiple mice.  I've had another Victor electronic trap (the \"single kill\" variety) set up in the attic for several years, and it hasn't caught a single mouse either, even though other traps in the attic have caught dozens over that same time.  I have no explanation for why the electronic traps have had a zero catch rate while the traps around them have been busy catching mice -- I'm just reporting my personal experience.  Also, the electronic trap requires batteries and is very large/tall.- In my experience, the hands down champion is the mechanical Victor \"Tin Cat\" model. It's a \"live catch\" trap with one-way trap doors. The mice seem to find it irresistible. Any time I see signs of mice, I put the Tin Cat in place and it never fails to catch the culprits. I've placed the Tin Cat and electronic traps side by side, and the Tin Cat is always the one with rodents in it in the morning. The only downside of the Tin Cat is that you have to check it every day if you want it to be a live-catch system -- if you only check it once a week, you'll find a bunch of dead mice in it.So, despite the M260 being a very clever bit of engineering, it is routinely outperformed by it's mechanical cousin, which doesn't need batteries. Also, the Tin Cat is much lower profile and is less conspicuous than the M260, which is quite large, tall, and very conspicuous.
B001JJCW0M Ok, I admit I don't have a real mouse problem.  What I have is a cat problem, more specifically, a cat that will bring in a mouse or small bird to show me and often lets it escape in the house.  When I see the cat release a mouse or if I should see droppings of any kind, I grab the Victor M260 and set it up.Using peanut butter for bait, the M260 has caught and humanely killed mice in my house on four seperate occasions.  Are there more of those little critters roaming my house?  I don't think so.  With a total of 3 cats and 4 dogs, with one of the dogs being a pretty good mouser herself, I doubt one of the critters would survive very long here anyway.  But, it's still nice having the Victor M260 for a little extra peace of mind.
B001JJCW0M UPDATE:  VICTOR caught 4 mice in 3 hours on the first day of snow.  The cats have been fired.Original review.We live in a farmhouseSo mice come and mice goSometimes their headsEnd up by my toe.My cats love to play with micebatting them this way and thatThey laughed their heads offWhen they saw the new trapIt's a live and let liveSituation most of the timeI'm prepared to let mice goUntiloneatemyScharffen Berger.so now he's a dead duckAnd I'm going to fry his ____Butnot withthismouse trapThe first trap went backBecause it wouldn't light greenThe second one had a lightThat could barely be seenBut that was all rightI left it on day and nightThree months, four months,Five months, six.I fed it new batteries,new peanut butterpromised it the skyAnd then!

B001JJCW0M I have a empty house on our property in the mountians, which mice seem to love!I put some skippy peanut butter in this , and the mice could care Less!This is easy to work. You put the peanut butter in the far end of the little box.Close it, push the button. It gives one green light to show its working. If it catches a mouse the green light flashes.The mice are suppose to smell the peaunt butter, and come running for it, when they start to walk accross the electric plates going for the peanut butter, it should kill them in 3 seconds, it says!But that didn't happen, as I have not caught anything!This box has been sitting in the old house for a few weeks, and no mice action at all!!Although This idea is great, it has not got any mice to come into the box for us!If it should nab a mouse it drops it into a drawer, that you pull out and throw the mousein the trash.The way the drawer works, you would not be touching the dead mouse.The drawer should hold a few mice at time.( I wish)If I put mice pellets out, it will eat them and die. I now have another type of black boxthat closes so my pets cannot get it. With the mice pellets in there, the mice come to that, eat it and die.Maybe someone here has a better idea of food to put in this to attract the mice..I surewould be interested!If I do catch any mice in this, I will be back to report it.
B001JJCW0M This mouse trap works more humane than others I know of.  Killing the mouse within three seconds.I have caught five mice so far in one week. This is the most I've ever caught in such a short time span, so I consider this model extremely efficient!The mouse is deposited in the same chamber as the bait(I've been using peanut butter and canned meat)Peanut butter can be very messy to clean and you don't want moldy food in the unit.Cleaning the mouse deposit chamber can be more efficient by lining the chamber with tin foil or similar product. Then you can throw away both the food and the rodent. Naturally, you should wear gloves when handling.As I've mentioned, I've gotten more success using this product than any other and if you have a mouse problem, this is definitely a great purchase that I recommend highly, on efficiency alone.
B001JJCW0M But please, remember where you left it.  You don't want to find a little pile of skeletons and fur in the bottom.First I put it under the kitchen sink, but I think the cats have really decimated our domestic mouse population. No takers, no one even tasted the bait.  then I put it in the wool shed where I knew we had an active problem.  The first time I forgot to turn it on, and the peanut butter was licked clean, so I re-baited and turned it on again.  Other than putting wool in and taking wool out, there is no reason to go out there.  When I remembered, it had been out there for over a month in the hottest part of the year, against the west wall of an unshaded shed.I couldn't really count the remains, but there were many.  Next time I will put newspaper in the bottom. It smelled like fly trap attractant which is why I'm going on about checking it frequently.The light was still flashing after four weeks, so it is economical with power.  There was still peanut butter left, so I think I cleared out the neighborhood.This is really a clever machine for those of you who worry about children and pets getting into your snap traps or poisons. It seems to kill very quickly and humanely.If you're just squeamish, and don't have someone to empty this for you, I'd look for something else, But for us it's a winner.
B001JJCW0M As a landlord for the past dozen years, one thing I've had to learn to deal with is pests of all types - the most recent is a tenant that leaves dog food out in the open and has the occassional visit from mice. Now, I'm not typically a 'girlie girl' but there are limits to what I will deal with...sewer/toilet issues and pests totally flip me out. I call the professionals at the first sign of trouble.Unfortunately, hiring a professional to take care of mice gets expensive especially when the tenant goes back to the same old habits of leaving dog food out in the garage as soon as the problem clear up. Apparently, these are some type of \"field mice\" that burrow into the ground out in the field...however, they come in searching for food and water which the tenant supplies via the dog food.After getting sick and tired of spending $200 per call to the pest control company, I thought this might do the trick. The contraption was smaller than I expected but I like the fact that it doesn't use harsh poisons that could harm pets nor mechanical traps that kids could get into....tenants are not always the most reliable about these things so the ability to set it up and revisit from time to time is a big plus.I've had this over a month and to date, we've not caught any mice but the problem is a sporadic one. The tenants also haven't seen any mice recently. However, I still give this a four star because it seems to be well built, does NOT use toxic chemicals and has safety features that make it very useful for use in a rental. I also like the fact that it is more humane than other options - the tenants appreciate that as well. In fact, just placing this in the garage seems to have helped remind the tenants to clear away the dry dog food and help the problem...making this worth it's weight to just sit there! Seriously though, well worth the effort given the benefits for off-site locations.
B001JJCW0M seems
B001JJCW0M The biggest positive going for this trap is that it really works. Other great features include easy set up and a not too gnarly mouse disposal process.After placing the trap in our basement utility room one evening I checked it the next morning and found the \"Mouse Kill\" (green) Indicator Light blinking. At least one rodent had met its demise. I could have left it until the light changed to indicate the trap was full, but I did not like the idea of leaving a little dead mouse body to further decompose.I removed and emptied the \"rodent receptacle\" (really, that's what it's called in the instructions). The trap had bagged one little mouse. Setting it back up was especially easy since the peanut butter was still completely intact.That was yesterday. This morning I found the trap's indicator light slowly blinking red which the instructions say means it is time to replace the batteries. That one little mouse must have been quite the fighter! Or, this thing burns through batteries way too quickly...I am giving it a 5 Star rating in the area of effectiveness. It worked as promised, like a champ. In the area of efficiency, I have to give it the lowest rating possible, 1 Star, for needing new batteries so quickly.Overall, my rating comes in at 3 Stars. Once I get new batteries in it, I will follow up and adjust the rating if it turns out that it is not necessary to replace the batteries after every kill.
B001JJCW0M With all due respect to the critters in the neighborhood I wish you well.  The Gotcha (a bit shorter than Victor Multi-Kill Electronic Mouse Trap) is on duty 24/7 so all you sneaky little pesky critters be warned.  Two have already crossed the bar and properly canned.  I set the trap which was quite easy to set up and placed it in a normal rodent type run outside on the back porch.  The next morning I saw the light flashing to tell me that Gotcha had company inside and low and behold there was a mouse dead as a door nail (an expression I never understood) and a lizard.  Neither showed any sign of life and each was disposed.  I reset the trap and so far those are the only two which is O.K. with me.  The construction of this almost 100% plastic trap is excellent and the metal plates that do the final deed are easy to clean with a small damp rag or paper towel.  I do not now how it might stand up to rain or snow; however, its location now is such that it will not get wet.  If rain or snow were a factor I would consider placing a 45 degree tent type metal roof over the unit so that the critters will have free run and the rain will not be a factor.  Now if they only made one for copperhead snakes I would really be happy.  This trap is a quality product worthy of use year round.
B001JJCW0M I have had a problem with mice in my shed for some time now. I keep a lot of bird seed and suet in there that they find very inviting.  Old fashioned traps and poison blocks etc. do the job, but traps miss as often as they hit, and poisons don't seem to keep them away for long as they promise.  I also own another Victor electronic trap that kills by shock, but it only handles one mouse at a time.  This Multi-kill unit is designed for those that want to kill mice on the family plan... This unit is very easy to set up, load with batteries, bait, (with peanut butter), and empty out.  Unlike my other battery operated unit where the mouse enters the chamber from ground level, this model incorporates a second story tenement system whereby the mouse climbs a set of stairs on the side and enters a baited chamber where hopefully it will be all she wrote for them.  A sensor senses the mouse, electrocutes it, and then  conveniently tips the floor and evicts the former tenant to a draw below.  (Where the instructions claim it can hold about 10, but I would say around half that is more like it).  My only real problem with this model is the mice eventually coming to recognize it as a place that offers a possible dining experience.  It sat loaded and armed in my shed for almost a week before I finally found a single dead mouse in it. A week where the mice were active by evidence of droppings and their usual getting into my seed and such.  This thing doesn't present any bait on the outside anywhere.  The mouse has to feel adventurous and get curious enough to try the stairs and then he will be \"rewarded\" for his efforts.  (Or at least we will be).  There is no doubt in my mind that this thing is very effective once a mouse decides to try it out.  The original small dab of peanut butter bait I put in it lasted through about four or five mice.  But I really think that some of the other reviewers here that have had dismal results with this thing have just been unfortunate enough to have lazy mice that just don't bother to try the stairs and see whats inside.  With no exposure of any bait on the outside, its up to either the curiosity of the mouse, or his smelling something inside to get it to work.  It seems that a lot of people have either had a hot and cold experience with this thing.  Either the mice in some homes just seem to take to it, or they ignore it altogether.  My experience with them seeming to wait a week seems to be a combination of both.  IF you are lucky enough to be one of the ones where the mice actually enter this thing, it can be very effective and clean. Unfortunately there is no real way to tell if you will be one of the fortunate ones that gets this thing to work unless you buy it and try it.  In some ways its about as hit and miss as the old fashioned traps.  It also would be nice if this things had the option of being plugged in.  The batteries don't last that long once its open for business for sure.  If its working for you, it would be really nice to just plug it in and forget it.  In conclusion, this thing isn't cheap, and there is the given chance it may not work for you, perhaps at all, as other reviewers have attested too.  My experience with is that it worked, but only after a week of sitting there, (and still some mice seem to be ignoring it all over again).  Personally I think its a very clean efficient system if it works, but its a crap shoot to be sure.  Try it as your own risk only if money is no object, and if you're the gambling type...
B001JJCW0M This is quite an interesting contraption. It's stated that batteries should last up to 120 kills, and the storage tray holds up to ten mice at a time. It should still be checked each day unless you want to run the risk of pulling out a tray full of maggots. The trap is fairly compact in a smart design.Though targeted for indoor use only, I think that's just Victor's way of making sure people don't set it out to get rained on or to be blasted by the sprinklers. It's also to be kept out of barns so as not to raze it by flame and not used anywhere that flammable gasses may linger - good advice to follow. I might cheat and use it outside, though.There are placement considerations to account for when using the Victor Multi-kill. Because the stairways are open like a cutaway section similar to the tunnels of an ant farm, I believe it's important to get the backside flush against a wall so rodents aren't tempted to squeeze through the backside as a shortcut. This isn't easy to do with moldings keeping the trap away from the wall and with cabinets and counters leaving a cavernous recess. Either situation can be countered, such as by using a cardboard wedge for the moldings situation or by using a board to fill in the recess underneath counters, but it's something one does have to improvise, nonetheless.I feel a better design for the battery compartment would have been to have arranged the batteries to put the negative contact springs on the latch side of the door as opposed to the hinge side, because when the door gets closed the springs tend toward wanting to fold over sideways.As far as usability goes, it's as simple as it can be. It's easy to bait and easy to clear out with everything as accessible as it is. If you're a gadget lover, this mousetrap is sure to please. When I hear this thing prepare the charge, it arouses a bit of excitement, akin to that a fisherman gets after casting a lure into the water.Within the first week, I caught three mice in traditional snap traps and only one in the Multi-Kill. I would imagine it depends on where the mice want to go. The green light was flashing and sure enough there was a hit.  I am certainly glad to see that mice do find their way into the Multi-Kill trap. I didn't get to hear the zap, so I'm not sure if it's silent or if I was away at the time.This mousetrap is neat. Although the cost is a factor, it might be justified by the problem you're experiencing with mice (especially if they're never-ending, as might be the case in rural settings), your desire not to mess with setting up traditional traps and your concern for pets' safety - all valid reasons to give the electronic mousetrap a go. I still use the wooden traps because they fit into places this one does not, but I am still quite impressed by the Victor Multi-Kill Electronic Mousetrap.
B001JJCW0M Not sure how humane it is to electrocute a mouse, but this thing reminds me of a terminator that came back in time to kill Sarah Connor -- it won't stop until it's target is dead. Well, or at least until the batteries run out.I truly had to chuckle at this thing -- it literally turns mouse catching into an automated process -- mouse steps in -- ZAP! -- then the electrocution chamber rotates, drops the mouse in a compartment, and rotates back into position, ready for its next victim.  A light even turns on when the \"drawer\" is full -- just pull it out, dispose of the rodents and slide the drawer back in for the next pile of vermin.  I'm not sure who needs a mouse trap that's this efficient and has such a large capacity.  If you have that many mice, it may be time to move!  For my purposes, I put it in the garage, and it did catch the one mouse we had. (Hopefully the only one.)Overall, I think it's pretty good at what it does and is about as \"humane\" as any other trap.  It's not like any of them safely capture mice so they can be set free in the wild.  Like all mouse traps, it's basically a killing machine.  But at least this one can be reused again and again, and emptied with little fuss or creepy-crawly feelings!  I agree, however, that this may cost a lot in batteries.  But I actually prefer battery operated, over plugging it into a wall outlet.  If you have mice, the trap needs to go where the mice are, not where the nearest outlet happens to be.  It certainly beats those old style traps that always snap my fingers!UPDATE 7/18/11 - Good News/Bad News --- this thing just caught another mouse; which means we have more mice than i thought. Eeeeeeew!
B001JJCW0M I was skeptical that this would be a \"better mousetrap\" but it actually works!  I have a little mouse problem in my garage so I had poison & this trap near each other.  Well, they both worked.  I found a dead mouse near the poison & a couple days later, there was a mouse dead in this trap.  I must say, I prefer to find the mouse in this trap because it gets zapped & falls into a drawer which makes it really easy to dispose of the mouse.  With poison, you are never sure where the mouse went to die; I was lucky this time.I put a little dab of peanut butter on the back of the electric chamber as described in the instructions, set the trap stairs against the wall & turned it on.  It blinks green & makes a buzzing noise to let you know it is engaged.  Then it's just a matter of waiting for a mouse to check in.  Once the mouse is electrocuted, the light flashes green so you know something is in the chamber.-The instructions are very clear and include color pictures.-Batteries are included.-I wore gloves when handling the unit so that I would not leave any human scent on the trap.Update 2/8/2012:  I'm still on the first set of batteries so it doesn't seem to go through them like crazy.  I'm using this in an unheated garage - it's cold out there in the winter.  Yesterday I had a blinking light which means I caught another mouse....
B001JJCW0M Although I've been a homeowner for nearly eight years, I've never had a mouse problem... until now.This winter, mice decided to take up residence in my garage. And while theVictor M265 Kill & Seal Mouse Trapsdid a commendable job, I decided I wasn't going to mess around anymore.After reading the reviews here, I decided to skip the bundled no-name batteries and go with some decent alkalines, and since my mice seem to enjoy peanut butter, I put tiny little bits on the steps. Another dab of peanut butter inside (JIF creamy seems to be irresistible) was all I needed before flipping the switch.Because I didn't really know the scope of my mouse problem, I opted to put the Multi-Kill in a relatively open space near one of the corners in the garage. It was good enough to lure two in to the Kill & Seal traps, so I thought I'd give it a try before moving boxes that mice may have turned in to condos.The next morning, my trap was blinking like a Ghostbusters trap. The zapping area? Clean as a whistle... except for that peanut butter. The mouse's last meal is definitely not a filling one. In the bucket, it looked like two fluffy mice decided to take a nap. Even the bucket was free of droppings or liquid. In fact, it was almost unnerving how peaceful it seemed. This probably won't satiate you, if you want some sort of mouse vengeance kill-dozer.The only thing I really have on my wishlist for this item, is for the bucket to pop out with a bit less force. It takes a fair amount of effort, and I have a feeling that when it's closer to the capacity of 10 mice, their fluffy little corpses could go flying if you're not careful. Other than that, though, I think this trap is pretty awesome, and don't mind a bit that it cost this much.
B001JJCW0M I really tried to give this a shot at working.  I had a mouse in my kitchen that I just couldn't catch - I'd put out poison and conventional spring traps and then this.  We used peanut butter and cheese to bait it but we never could catch him.After 3 weeks, we moved this to an outside area where mice kept stealing the chicken's bread.  We still could not catch a mouse but every morning we'd have HUGE wood cockroaches in the base, trapped, but not dead.  I couldn't even catch a mouse outside.  Since the roaches were causing the light to trip, I added new strong batteries but had the same result. We put a bit of roach powder in the collection cup so the roaches would die the next time they cleaned themselves.Meanwhile, we'd added 3 more spring traps and a sticky trap inside to try to catch the little booger that was so elusive.  A spring trap caught him.  Boy was he fat.I'm just not convinced.  I'm going to keep trying but after weeks of knowing there are mice in the areas I'm placing the trap but still failing to catch anything, I'm rather bummed.It would really help if this was rechargeable too.  The light definitely works if there is something in the collection cup, but around here it's only been roaches and they are eating batteries up.
B001JJCW0M This thing is almost too fun.  I had a problem with the little critters running up into my attic.  It was a major aggravation to constantly go up there and set the traditional type traps.  The bait rotted.  I would forget where some were, etc.  This is a set it and forget it product, at least for a while.You can save some grief baiting and cleaning it by covering the stairs.  Putting something over them rather than slathering them with peanut butter is better because the peanut butter rots after a while.  Even mice don't like mold.What I do love is that you can over bait it, making it have a stronger smell.  And you don't touch the mice if that kind of thing bothers you.And the bait never actually gets touched by the mice.  They get zapped on the way to it.Catch, kill, empty, repeat.Love it.
B001JJCW0M It's been in the garage for 2 weeks, I can hear things scampering around, but so far, no kills.It looks like a good concept. There's a kill chamber, and the dead mouse drops into a bin. The bin holds a number of kills. If you have a mice problem that requires the assistance of a Pied Piper, this could be the solution.The trouble I have could be that this time around, it is rats, not mice. There's no way a mouse can squeeze into the chamber. I've always used spring traps so far, and the problem with the traps is that they're a hazard to leave lying around when engaged, and once I caught a mouse in a rat trap. It didn't kill it outright. I don't like mice and rats in my garage, but I don't want them to suffer either.I believe the electronic rat trap (M240) would work better for me. It kills both mice and rats, and being able to kill only one at a time is not a problem for me.Other than not suitable for my needs, the product itself is well constructed. It even comes with batteries (heavy duty, not alkaline, though). When you open up the kill chamber, it turns itself off so that you don't shock yourself. There's also a separate switch. One improvement I can think of is to make this mains powered, but perhaps this is a safety vs. cost of operation tradeoff.
B001JJCW0M Don't waste your money - this trap is completely useless.  A traditonal trap (wooden spring action) was placed about a foot away from the Victor trap and continues to catch a few mice every week.  The Victor Electronic Mouse Trap, on the other hand, hasn't caught ANY mice despite being properly bated and switched on.  This trap has even been moved to different locations in the house with the same result - absolutely no mice caught.  I've never seen such a useless product and would never recommend this product.
B001JJCW0M I have a mouse problem, and this trap didn't help. Although I followed the instructions, tried several baiting techniques, and I caught only one mouse in several weeks. I wasn't checking that often, and the mouse began to mummify and rot, and smelled nasty. I couldn't clean it all out.Meanwhile, I bought a dozen traditional (spring) wooden traps, and they are blasting through the mouse population.There may be situations where this electronic trap will be useful; but not with my mice.Also, it's quite small. Smaller than it seems from the packaging.
B001JJCW0M I noticed some mouse droppings in my basement a few weeks ago and decided to give the Victor Multi-Kill a shot. My family recently moved to a rural area and I know mice come with the territory -- but that doesn't mean I'll let them come in without a fight.I used peanut butter as bait, not really expecting to catch one of mice with it. But this evening when I was putting something away in the storage area I noticed that the green light was flashing. I got closer and, yuck, I could smell that something was defiantly dead inside (I will be checking more frequently from now on).I took the entire unit outside to our garbage can (tomorrow is thankfully garbage pickup day) and, with some trepidation, opened the door -- didn't look inside but just emptied the contents into the garbage can. then I looked down and saw not one but THREE dead little mice. They were sort of cute and I felt kind of bad about the situation, but there it is.I'll be resetting the trap again tomorrow (letting it air out in the garage overnight). Looks like Victor really did build a better mouse trap.
B001JJCW0M I had this Victor mouse trap in a cupboard under our master bathroom bathtub for over a month with no results.  In comparison, I've had a Rat Zapper for a few years now that's killed a few dozen mice in that same cupboard.  Curious to see if the Victor mouse trap wasn't getting anything because of its more complicated entry point for the mice, I put both traps in the cupboard, side by side.  I used peanut butter in both the Rat Zapper (I put a dab of it in a bottle cap and slid it to the back of the trap) and this Victor mouse trap.  Over the next 6-7 weeks, 2 mice went into the Rat Zapper and were killed by it, and Victor mouse trap got nothing.It's a bit hard to review this Victor trap because the mice are an unpredictable variable.  I guess the best I can say is this Victor trap didn't have any false positive readings, indicating a dead mouse that really wasn't there, and the peanut butter didn't get stolen by the mice.  However, mice simply didn't enter the trap.  The Rat Zapper is a straight roomy tunnel for the mice to enter, while mice in the Victor trap have to go up narrow stairs to enter the trap.  Perhaps they find the Victor trap a bit more intimidating?  (Claustrophobic mice?)  It's hard to say.  If I ever get any mice in this Victor trap, I'll be sure to update this review.
B001JJCW0M This is the luxury version of a mouse trap. It uses 4 C size battery to electrocute the mice to death. These batteries are included.The prey enters through a set of stairs in the back. The kill chamber occupies the top 1/3 of the box and consists of a small maze. At the end of the maze is the lure, which is the only thing not included in the box. I use the peanut butter recommended by the manual.When the mouse steps near the lure, the electric shock fires and a trap door opens to drop the carcass down to the big tray in the bottom 2/3 of the assembly. The whole thing is then ready for the next customer.The trap is solidly constructed and the mechanism is quite elegant. If money is not an issue, this trap is the best solution to mice infestation anywhere.
B001JJCW0M We live out in the country, so it is no surprise that we have mice - and at certain times of the year, LOTS of them. You can always tell when the population is high, because there will be increased amounts of droppings and bits of insulation etc just strewn about in odd places. The mice harbor in our attached garage and rummage up through the insulation and ultimately come into our kitchen cabinets and closets. Ugh, it is just GROSS.We have used countless glue traps, which we have to then go and round up and dispose of, a few different types of poison - pellets and blocks (which turn the mice feces blue btw) and when you use the poison you just don't know where and when the mice will die. So they are just rotting off somewhere - GROSS! If you do find them, then you have to scoop them up and dispose of them.There have been plenty of days through all these years of living here, that we would put out 10-15 of the glue traps.. We put them in closets, cupboards, drawers, and down in the closets in the garage... and the next day ALL the traps had mice stuck to them. Some of them would have 2 mice stuck since it seemed that sometimes another thoughtful little guy would come along to help the first one and end up stuck himself. The glue traps and poison aren't too expensive unless as in our case you have to buy them constantly. So, then buying something more like this Victor Multi Kill seems alot more economical, even though the price tag seems steep compared to a pack of glue traps.The Victor Multi Kill is SUCH a relief. It makes disposing of the mice so much easier.. no running around trying to remember where all the glue traps are and then seeing the little guys STILL ALIVE squeaking their heads off. No coming across random dead mice due to eating poison and dying in a hidden spot in the house. I have come across mouse bones and fur obviously months and months after they have died and it is not fun. The multi Kill is so nice to have. You just set it up, let it do it's thing and then empty after a few days or so. If you have a larger house and or multiple areas of infestation, it is definitely worth it to have more than 1 Multi Kill. In our case, one in our garage closets and one in the main house area would be ideal with possibly a 3rd unit under our kitchen cabinets where the cat food is stored. At this point though, we have only tried out this one unit so far, but will pick up at least 1 more unit when we have some extra money.It is obvious that the device works since we can see the dead mice when we empty it. I feel it is definitely worth the money in the long run if you have an on going problem or if you have a sudden outbreak of mice. For the most part, if you have them once, you will have them again when the weather changes. It just makes more sense for us to spend the money in a lump sum and use the device repeatedly, for years to come, without any headaches, than to spend a few dollars repeatedly (adding up to more than the lump sum over time) and have all the extra work to do with disposal, round up, etc.We have had no problems with the device. It seems solid enough and it definitely gets the job done. Once we get a second unit, I will be even more relieved. So far we have been alternating the location of the 1 unit between the garage closets, under the kitchen cabinet, and in a closet in our closet hall (a hall full of nothing but huge walk in closets). I would love to have enough units to just let them all sit and do their job, as opposed to moving it around every week or so.The Multi Kill is definitely worth it's price and I do recommend it if you have a mouse problem.
B001JJCW0M The Victor M260 Multi-Kill electronic mouse trap sounded like a good idea and many other reviews indicated it would eliminate mice infestations quickly, easily, and fairly humanely.  I set this unit up in an area that has a known mouse infestation and checked  daily for one week, with no results.  The bait is intact and all systems are go, but the mice apparently aren't interested in entering the chamber to begin with.  Not sure where the glitch lies as everything appears to be in order.  Something isn't working, apparently.  It's hard to recommend a $90 mouse killing device that hasn't killed a mouse in a weeks time, so I can't recommend it.  My advice?  Go to the Humane Society and get a cat.
B001JJCW0M This is a very well made device and it looks like it would work very well for mice. I didn't realize it was just for mice though I assumed multi kill meant multi as in different rodents not quantity of just mice. So know that this will only kill mice NOT RATS. We don't have mice here so I was unable to tell if it works or not but it is sturdy well made and very easy to bait. It has a very tiny chamber the mouse must go through so a rat will not fit. Too bad they didn't make this with a larger chamber for both rats and mice.
B001JJCW0M My sister's pole barn was being invaded by rodents.  It didn't seem to matter what she stored her bird feed in, the rodents found a way to get to it & chew through the container.  She thinks this mouse trap is the best invention ever and, for now, I'm the favorite sister!
B001JJCW0M Why do people keep trying to build better mousetraps?For all of the reasons so many other reviewers have already stated ... tiny entrance hole won't catch larger mice, if batteries are not absolutely fresh you just end up with a confused looking mouse in the electrocution chamber (it actually never did kill one), and the babble about it being \"humane\" (you're killing mice, frying them with electricity is humane?)There is really nothing more to add ... this product is just plain silly.Better mousetrap = a cat
B001JJCW0M This definitely a better mousetrap than the old \"watch your fingers\" cheap trap. I had mice in my basement in the spring after having some house remodeling. Evidently they wer iradicated  before I set this one up. It will stay in my basement until more come. It is easy to set up and takes up little room and is not scary looking. More later.
B001JJCW0M I happened to order this in time to try to trap some mice and small rats that were running around at my church. As it turned out, it didn't work any better at catching rodents than a traditional trap and was a bit cumbersome to use. After trying it out and seeing the results, my minister said that he would stick to traditional traps.
B001JJCW0M This is very easy to set up and (thankfully) very easy clean once a mouse gets in.  It's smaller than a loaf of bread and fits nicely against the wall. The indicator light which lets you know if it's caught something, can be viewed from across the room; no need to bend down to see if there's something inside.I've been using it for several weeks and the batteries are still good.There are some great instructional videos, both on Amazon and the victorpest.com website.  From reading their website and watching the videos, these guys really want their products to work.  They have a great Tips and Strategies page and also a Help and Advice section on their website which I found very helpful.  I would recommend this product to anyone who has a mouse problem.
B001JJCW0M I got this device a few weeks ago and duly put the peanut butter at the end of the electric shock chamber and set it in the attic beside a hole in the asbestos (where the mice burrow). So far, not one mouse has entered the trap. I'd know, because once they get into it there is no way out, and yes, I turned it on.I love the design of the trap--the stairs up both sides, the double doors closing the vermin into the top room, the instant shock, the dropping of the body into the box beneath--but it's all for naught if the mice don't seem to want to climb into the darn thing to begin with.I'm going to try again, this time putting the trap along the wall, even though there isn't as much evidence of activity there. Fingers crossed . . .
B001JJCW0M I have used the single kill Victor electronic trap in the past. This units kill zone looks just like that one to me only now the mice have to run up the stairs to the entry in order to accommodate the catch bin at the bottom of this unit. Once they get zapped they are dumped into the bin and the trap is ready for the next customer. That is the draw of this unit, you can get rid of multiple mice in one shot and it works.My only advice is that killing is nasty business. Make sure you don't forget about the trap, you need to empty it every day. I forgot about my single kill trap once and it wasn't pretty so I can't imagine what this one would be like with several bodies stewing in it, nope not good.My unit came with 4 C batteries. I wish they had stuck with AA batteries or D cells but they probably thought C cells were the best compromise in the design.If you have multiple mice that need taken out ASAP this is a convenient solution. It may not work for every mouse but it can be the Big Bertha in your arsenal to get most of them.
B001JJCW0M If you have a large number of mice, this solution may the one for you, as it's rather potent in that scenario.  If you only have a small issue, then perhaps it can be bettered by simpler solutions, as the overhead (in terms of up front costs and batteries) doesn't lend itself to smaller issues.I have a problem that falls more into the former than the latter, and the price couldn't be beat, so I took the plunge.  Within a couple days mice started to disappear, and it's all so bizarrely efficient compared to mechanical or chemical solutions.  I almost felt evil even using this thing, but the results and simplicity (the included instructions and batteries helped that) swayed me.  Now that things have waned, it's become a bit less attractive compared to other options, but it's already paid for itself.
B001JJCW0M I have the Victor M240 Electronic Rat Trap. It worked GREAT, (I even posted pics of the victim, eek!) but the batterries were a pain to get in, no manual, and it pooped out quickly. I am going to try to clean the plates with alcohol and see if that works. As far as the M260, I can say right off the bat that the batteries on THIS model are a breeze, and not only does it have a manual that explains every blinking light meaning, it even lists the 800 number right there where it should be!I'm putting it out today, 6/22/11, and will update when the critters start getting caught.8/18/11 the light went out, trap empty. When I have time I'll contact customer service as I LOVE the cruelty free aspect (It kills instantly, and sadly since the rodents are in an area where other animals can be badly harmed by them, it is a tough choice but the rodents have to go. It is a better option than the pain of poison or traps....complain about my 'cruelty' only if you spend part of your money to spay and neuter rats) but right now I'm a bit disappointed.EDIT: took the batteries out, and within days my dog was sniffing around the trap. Sure enough, one little varmint was in it! YAY!
B001JJCW0M We live out in the country, and one thing that is a surety out in the woods - nature will beat a path to your door. I quickly selected this product when it became available - a week after discovering a mouse standing in our bedroom doorway. We have not seen another one - but we had a good idea where it had entered the house - in a small gap under our sink where the hose to the dishwasher goes. There were some little mouse poops in there and we put the trap under the sink to catch any future invaders. I really like the idea of this being a humane trap. I don't want any mammal to suffer, but you simply cannot allow rodents to multiply or even exist as bachelors in your home. A small mouse can destroy thousands of dollars in wiring in a short amount of time - not to mention the potential of spreading Hunta virus, etc.The trap has 2 little stairways to the place a curious mouse will enter and get humanely zapped into eternity. The trap will light up when full. Thankfully, we've had no more intruders into our home, but we know this Victor trap is waiting for when they do. This is a really well-thought-out product. It's solidly made.
B001JJCW0M I have been patient - I set the Victor M260 in a crawlspace where there are many signs of active mice and checked it every few days for several months.  Not a single mouse was caught, but I had to change the batteries twice.  The peanut butter bait was untouched.  I followed the directions to place it along a wall and used gloves so there would not be a scent transfer, but no mice in the box.Seems like a good idea - if it worked.
B001JJCW0M The Victor Electronic Mouse Trap is the ultimate in eliminating mice.  No longer will you have to empty the old fashion mouse trap!  Empting this trap consists of removing a drawer and disposing of the dead mice.  A small dab of peanut butter is all that is required for bait.  The unit can be placed against any wall where mice may be attracted.  A stairway leads the mouse to the bait and consequently it's demise.  This is the high tech answer to trapping mice.
B001JJCW0M We put this in the cabin where it's been catching mice. It's nice to have them in a nice clean tray instead of guts hanging out on a wooden trap for weeks before we get back up there. Tus far we've not had to change the batteries and we've caught about 10 mice. It's a great product. Love it!
B001JJCW0M After setting up the Victor Multi-Kill in our mice occupied basement, I waited a few weeks to actually catch something before writing this review. In the meantime I caught a mouse in one of those horrific snap-death traps, a lucky little mouse in a plastic live trap, and some kind of black bug in the Victor Multi-Kill Electronic Mouse Trap.The Multi-Kill electronic device gives one engaged in mouse wars another option in addition to snap traps, sticky traps (No Way!), live traps, and poison. I like the live traps best, but they are hit or miss and half the time, often closing shut before catching anything.The Multi-Kill is easy to set up: add batteries, bait with peanut butter, find a suitable location, and turn it on. I tried the trap first on a shelf where we'd found mouse droppings, then moved it to another shelf, and finally to the floor in a spot where I'd already caught several mice. Finally, after adding some fresh peanut butter, I placed the Victor Multi-Kill back on the original shelf. This morning the green light was blinking and a dead mouse was in the pull out tray. I disposed of the rodent corpse and set the trap back up.Supposedly the trap will kill and hold ten mice per setting. With my experience, waiting for ten kills is not a good option unless one likes the aroma of decomposing mice.It took a while to achieve victory in our little war against the mice, but now that I've caught one I think I much prefer this electronic method to the snap traps. If one doesn't mind paying the steep price for this different kind of trap, it may be a viable option for one plagued by mice in the home.
B001JJCW0M The Victor is easy to set up and easy to operate.  However, no matter where I placed it, no mouse would try the peanut butter inside.I'd try to keep it away from pets and kids, but as long as the top lid stays closed, it does seem to be safe for them.  It is not for outdoor use, but after the earlier attempts, I decided I had nothing to lose and gave it a try.  It continued to be operable after a few nights outside, though still didn't attract any mice.If someone has a lot of mice and a lot of money, give it a shot.  Overall, I would not recommend spending the money and hoping it works.
B001JJCW0M I submitted a review for this item months ago, but it never appeared, nor did it let me write another one, until now.  We have had the trap \"in service\" for months, and the only problem is finding the right location to place it, to entice the critters.  After moving the trap from spot ot spot for months, BINGO, we hit the mother lode.  In 2 days we scored 4 mice.  Worked as promised.  I give it 4 stars because of price, and the difficulty of finding the Sweet Spot.  But it' does work.  :-)
B001JJCW0M We use this in the garage, where we have had problems with rodents finding their way in. So far, so good. However, for the price, I am not sure that this item is as good of a value as rodent bait in enclosed boxes, which costs so much more less and does not require batteries. However, I would say that this product is a more humane choice than poisons (which kill slowly) and traps (which may not kill at all but maim instead). It is also safer to use around children and other animals (dogs, birds). Also, this item sure does appeal to my inner mechanical geek. ;)
B001JJCW0M I put this mouse trap in my garage after finding evidence of mice.  I've used traditional traps in the past and they work well of course, but are messy.  It's also very sad if a mouse does not die instantly or traps a leg, etc.  The Victor electronic mouse trap sounded more humane since it kills so quickly.I used peanut butter bait and it did indeed attract a couple of mice.  I checked it the next morning and found two dead mice inside which were easy to dispose of.  I caught several more mice over the next week.  I'm guessing I don't have a large mouse problem since I didn't catch as many as other reviewers, but I have no doubt that it's working properly.The directions state it will let you know when the container is full, but you should clean it out daily even if it's not full because it will get nasty.  It's not a problem to check daily because you would do the same if you set out regular mouse traps anyway.The unit uses 4 C batteries.  I highly recommend rechargeable batteries for this mousetrap because you will run through them.  I'm surprised the manufacturer didn't design this with a plug or even a rechargeable battery pack.It's a great unit that works exactly as described.  I counted off stars due to the battery consumption and lack of power options.
B001JJCW0M The Victor Multi-kill electronic mousetrap is a touch-free, mouse electrocution device. The trap is 9 1/4\" long x 5 1/4\" tall x 4 1/2\" deep, and resembles a black, dome-top lunch box.The way it works is that you install 4 \"C\" batteries (included), bait it by putting a pea-size blob of peanut butter on a certain spot inside the trap, and then place it against a wall that mice are known to run along. The back of the trap features two, tiny mouse stairways where the mice enter the trap. They must walk across electrified metal plates to reach the peanut butter, and they are electrocuted before they reach it. Then, the little mouse corpses drop down through the floor into a receptacle drawer, which you pull out from the front to empty. NOTE: this is only for mice. It will not accommodate rats and I doubt the electrical charge would be strong enough to kill a rat.There is an on/off switch on the front of the trap. An indicator light above the switch tells you when the device is on, if the device has killed a mouse, if the rodent receptacle is full, if the batteries are low, or if there is a problem with the device. The owners manual explains the different blinking patterns of the indicator light.The manual states the rodent receptacle will hold up to 10 dead mice, but I think 5 or 6 is more accurate unless they are tiny, tiny mice. The drawer comes out easily and you never have to touch the mice. The manual also suggests that you turn the trap off and wipe down the electrocution plates after every 10 kills with a damp cloth - no soaps or cleansers. Soaps and cleansers are often scented, which mice will generally avoid.I placed this trap in my tool shed, which I know to be frequented by mice occasionally. Sure enough, within a couple of days, the indicator light told me a mouse had been dispatched! I pulled out the drawer and found a dead mouse. (I was glad to note there was no blood or mangling of the corpse like there is with snap-style mouse traps.)I am pleased with this trap. I have children and pets so I don't want to use snap-traps or mouse poison. The glue traps seem too cruel if you let the mouse remain stuck til he starves or dies of dehydration. This trap is quick and seems to be as humane as possible. I dislike killing little creatures and try hard to make my home and outbuildings rodent-proof, but if they manage to get in, I want them gone for fear of diseases they spread. The only way this device could be better is if it just made the mice leave. Recommended.
B001JJCW0M I've been using this trap for a little over a month now, and I am completely sold. Not only is it very easy to set up and monitor, the results are pretty amazing. Mice seem unable to resist the lure, and the brilliant trap design ensures that once they come in they don't come out. The little pests are disposed of in a quick, painless, and humane manner. No mess, no fuss.In my opinion, the folks at Victor have designed a MUCH better mousetrap!
B001JJCW0M Despite my best efforts to seal the place up, every fall the mice decide my attic would be a good place to set up shop for the upcoming winter.  This trap seemed like a good solution, because for the first couple weeks after a frost, I trap 2-6 mice per week.  So far this year, I've gotten about 8 in my mini-Rex traps, and none in this.  I've checked the battery, refreshed the bait (crunchy peanut butter, a mouse fave), but although there are obviously potential customers up there, and the other traps are full, this has yet to claim the first victim.  I'm giving it 3-stars because while I can't say for sure it won't work, it hasn't done a thing for me so far.
B001JJCW0M Placement is absolutely crucial for this trap to work.  It needs to be along the paths that the mice take in the room.  Usually this seems to be along the walls, but not always.  I had the trap out for a month without catching any mice along where I thought the mice would walk in our garage.  Obviously I do not think like a mouse.  I then set out Victor snap traps in various areas in the garage and promptly caught two in nearly the same area, which was not where I thought the mice would be as it was near where we enter and exit the garage.  I then moved the electronic trap to that area and the electronic trap started catching mice.  This area was closer to the door of the garage.  I used peanut butter on the back wall as well as a little smeared along the stairs.  I knew peanut butter worked because we use it in all our snap traps.The good thing about this trap is that you can catch several mice in a row. However, for the cost you can also buy a lot of snap traps.  Disposing of the mice in the electronic trap is less \"icky\" though and there is less risk to small kids or pets from the electronic trap.  If you are willing to put some effort into finding where the mice travel it is useful.I wish it had the option for a AC adapter, although that would limit placement somewhat.
B001JJCW0M Well, the temperatures are finally dropping an the vermin are looking for warmer places to sleep.  Not a huge problem for me as the dog and local cats seem to keep things under control.  My friend's lake house, however.  Different story.  When it gets cold out the house gets shuttered for weeks at a time.  One effective way to keep the critters at bay is moth balls.  It is truely amazing how well they work.  The problem is that moth balls keep people at bay too.  Smelly things.  So, mouse traps become important.This electronic zapper is really good for the shuttered house.  It zaps one after another and keeps the messiness contained and out of sight.  Eventually, you get to haul the thing outside and get rid of the corpses.  The biggest problems are in the early fall - right about when I'm writing this.  I had no idea how many mice were coming into the house to check things out.  I don't know if they've been leaving when people return or what, but that collection drawer stacks them in.  The biggest load was 6 in four days (tues-friday after labor day weekend).  Just about any bait seems to work because the food is either binned or hauled away.Placement is easy because after a spring cleaning or two you know exactly where the mice are hanging out and scurrying .  They do make a horrid mess of things if left alone.  Sticky little trails.  Yuck.Anyways, spring cleanup will hopefully be a little easier with less mouse mess.  Interesting, I got this thing because the concept of \"electronic multi-kill mouse trap\" kinda tickled the morbid end of my funny bone.  I took it to the lake as a conversation piece and for people to mess with it.  Now, I'm looking to it as a labor saving device.
B001K2YBA2 If you have the Black and Decker 18 volt family of battery powered products, then this is a fine addition.  As a hedge trimmer, they are as powerful or more than most competitors.  This unit is tough, light weight, and well balanced, with ergonomic attention to detail.  I have had no problems with this or any other part of my family of B&D 18 volt rechargeables.
B001K2YBA2 This is a great hedge trimmer made by Black and Decker.  The trimmer is quiet and because it is electric, it starts and stops instantly.  The handle is sort of thick so squeezing the trigger and cutting for more than 5 minutes at a time might make your hand cramp (that's what happens to me and I am 200 pounds).  It states it can cut branches 3/4 inch, and it is true.  With enough tenacity, you can cut up to 1 inch branches.  When branches are too thick and get cut in the trimmer, it automatically shuts off.  You then have to unjam it to restart it.Battery life is somewhat decent.  I got about 30 minutes of use out of one battery with a few minutes break in-between.  Highly suggested to have a spare battery charged and ready to go while you are using this.  There is no option to connect a cord to it, only battery.The batteries are interchangeable with other 18 volt B&D; tools, which is a huge plus.  I have the complete set of blower, weed whacker and this trimmer.  If you need a complete set, check out the Lawn Care set.  That comes with a 3 battery charger (3 batteries) and hanging kit to organize the tools.The charger that is supplied with it is a \"dummy\" charger.  It does not know when the battery is full and you have to keep an eye on how long you have had it plugged in.  Recommendations are to not have it charged for more than 8 hours.  I normally charge my battery in the morning and then use it in the afternoon.All in all, this is a great trimmer.  It is silent and powerful.  You can get a lot of work done without worrying about disturbing your neighbors because it makes very little sound.I highly recommend this tool.
B001K2YBA2 I have most of B and D's 18V line of tools....meaning I also have a garage full of batteries on their chargers...and I am delighted with all of them.  I am getting too old to pull the rope on my gas model trimmer without a sore shoulder for a couple days.  Now I click the battery on this trimmer and I go to work.  Maybe not quite as powerful as my Stihl but I really can't tell the difference and it does all my hedges and other trimming on one charge with no sign of the battery running down.  I notice some others haven't had good luck with the batteries but I have not had one fail in the year and half I've been using these tools.
B001K2YBA2 This is the third Black and Decker cordless product that I have purchased.  I have the B&D pole trimmer and the weed trimmer.  All three products were purchased in mid to late 2008.  I have alread reviewed the pole trimmer and the weed trimmer.  I finally have time to review the Hedge Trimmer.  I like it the most of all the cordless products, because it performs as well as a corded hedge trimmer.  The hedge trimmer gets the most use as the foundation bushes are trimmed at least once every other month.  We can go around our house on one battery and still have juice left over.  The trimmer is light enough that my wife can use it without my help (YEA).  That was not true of our corded trimmer.  The bar length is great and I have never had a problem with the trimmer's power.  The trimmer only comes with one battery, but my experience says that would not be a problem.  I have four batteries, because of the other trimmers.  I rotate them and keep them inside.  I generally charge them after each use, but sometimes I run a battery down before recharging it.  I have not had any problem with the batteries dying or taking a set.
B001K2YBA2 My husband searched high and low for a cordless electric hedger and he's delighted with this product (he's always been pleased with Black & Decker products).  After it arrived, he charged it overnight and put it to good use the very next day.  We have a yard surrounded by hedges and my husband did a great job using this hedger; the battery remained charged the entire time he was using it.  He thinks it's a great product and he'd recommend it!
B001K2YBA2 I love the 18 v tools.  I'm amazed how powerful they are.  I've gotten a collection of the yard tools as they work so well.  I also have the hedge trimmer on the pole.  Great.
B001K2YBA2 So why would someone who already owns a Black and Decker corded hedge trimmer buy this 18V cordless model? My problem is the two acre size of our property. Sometimes I just have a small trimming job to do that just doesn't seem to warrant running over a hundred feet of cord to the site. Most of the time in situations like this, I don't bother with the electric cord and opt for the manual hedge trimmer or a pair of hand clippers.With the cordless model there is no more cord dilemma. I've cleared several areas on the property this week that I've been meaning to trim for months and completed the chores quickly and neatly. The battery powered Black and Decker seems to have a little less oomph than the corded model, but for my purposes the convenience is worth the slight trade off in power. With a fresh battery this tool can handle most trimming jobs nicely. This trimmer is light and easy to handle, making it perfect for shaping shrubs.Since I already have the Black and Decker cordless saw, line trimmer, and air rake, there's always a fresh battery ready for action in one of the chargers. The batteries that I've used the past three years are getting a bit long in the tooth and showing their age, but they still can run all of the tools, just not as long. For information about maintaining and using the 18V battery and even reviving those sluggish old batteries, visit the Black and Decker web page for extensive information.My only quibble is that the newer lithium and 24 volt Black and Decker batteries don't retro fit these older model yard tools. The deal on this tool from Amazon was terrific, 80 dollars and an extra battery thrown in. Nice!
B001K2YBA2 I bought this lightweight trimmer purely as a trimmer for lightweight trimming chores. I already had a gas trimmer, an extended reach trimmer on a telescoping pole, a hand-held trimmer for fine work.
B001KOUDH0 The \"Strathwood Coco Fiber Closed Boxes\" Doormat is well made and fairly attractive for what it is. We live in the county and need a good doormat to prevent dirt and mud from being tracked into the house, this mat should work nicely. Here are my observations:* It is a good size (18\" x 30\"), but is a little bit on the light side for it's size.* Made from recycled rubber and coco fibers, it has sturdy stitching and should hold up for a few years.* The coco fibers are fairly high, with a good bit of channeling between them to provide a lot room for dirt, mud, and water to fall away from cleaning surface.This doormat looks great on my porch and does a good job with cleaning thick dirt and mud off shoes and boots.*** UPDATE 02/02/2011: Going on two years of daily use and this mat still looks and works great! Upgrading my review from 4 to 5 stars.Recommended!CFH
B001KOUDH0 This is a very nice doormat (well, as far as a doormat can be attractive). The coco fibers are embedded into a rubber base with plenty of drainage space for water to pass through. Construction seems very good - gave it a good workout when it arrived, and the fibers stayed put. Also, like the fact that the rubber is recycled. The product is made in India.I've used coco fiber mats before as outdoor mats and, while they did a great job in getting the muck off your shoes before entry, they tended to disintegrate due to rain/snow/sun. I had switched to an all-rubber mat which has held up well, but it doesn't do a good job of cleaning shoes. This mat seems to blend the best of both worlds - coco fibers to clean, and a rubber base that will hold up to the weather.My only quibble is that it's rather lightweight - a stiff wind would probably move it about. It would be better if it had a thicker base to add more weight and resistance to the wind.But, I think the price charged makes this a good value compared with the mats I've seen at home improvement stores. Definitely a good buy!
B001KOUDH0 Living in Florida means putting up with almost daily rain every summer afternoon but it also means a lot of sand. Trying to find a good floor mat has been an ongoing challenge...rubber ones look great and last a long time but fail to remove the mud and other yuck especially from tennis shoes or work boots. On the other hand, regular coco fiber mats turn into an ugly, stained soggy mess within days. This mat finally seems to be the perfect solution...especially to the side garage door entrance!!!!Seriously, it might not sound like a big deal but few things are more annoying than seeing clouds of dirt across the garage, into the laundry room and through the kitchen...sigh. We've tried them all and none held up or they simply didn't get the job done right. So, when this came up I jumped at the opportunity to try it out.The coco is in small boxes each consisting of four lines of fiber - providing very good dirt removal from even deeply ridged athletic shoes or work boots. The rubber provides plenty of protection against water especially at the bottom (yuck) which typically turns in a nasty mess. Instead, this remains dry and is easy to clean while still allowing water to drain from the fibers.I was a little concerned how the rubber backing would do since it seemed a bit flat but I'm happy to say it grips and remains in place easily. Unsure how it will hold up over time but thrilled to put this outside the garage door and will try to let you know later in the summer how it's working out.
B001KOUDH0 This is about what you'd expect from a doormat.  It seems solid, and should hold up for awhile but it was much smaller than my last doormat.  Pay attention to the size stated, I assumed all doormats were standard, but this one was much smaller than my last one.  The product is made in India, and got shipped in a gigantic box that was large enough to ship 10 doormats.  I've seen similar, but larger doormats at Target for around the same money so shop around.
B001KOUDH0 I just returned from our neighborhood's big blue box store and low and behold there was the mat.  It was packaged well and opened without incidence.  Out onto the deck for a little rough and tumble to test the durability.  Not a scientific test grant it but one that said this mat will hold up all summer and probably deep into the winter.  Some households will find a longer lasting period if traffic is less than ours but for us one year is about it.Made from recycled rubber makes sense and the cocoa brushes makes for a fine contrast in colors.  The cross weaves will make really dirty soles clean fast.  The depth of the weaves will permit easy water runoff especially if you provide a small 5 to 10 degree angle for drainage.If any of the above changes before the end of a year, I will update good or bad.  Enjoy!  We will.  (If one can enjoy a door mat.)
B001KOUDH0 This is a nice looking doormat, and the fibers are very strong and should hold up quite well to the upcoming \"mud season\" we experience after all our snow melts.  If I experience any problems, I'll update this review.The only thing I wish this doormat had was some more weight to it.  I'm using this by my front door, which is on a second floor deck.  I'm afraid it may blow off with our winds.UPDATE, June 18, 2009:  It's only been two months, and the rubber on the edges are breaking apart and falling off.  Also, the coco fibers have been compacted significantly, although they are still usable for scraping off dirt.
B001KOUDH0 I've owned many coco fiber mats in the past, but hated that they always stayed drench after a rainstorm.  We had a gullywasher last night and I am already impressed that this drained so well.  It is still a little wet, but this has performed so much better than any I've owned before!  I'm sure this one will last a couple years and the rubber seems quite durable.
B001KOUDH0 I agree with some of the other reviewers out here. I have the 'Closed Boxes' pattern on the floor mat. The staggered layering of the boxes pattern prohibits the tracking of most dirt into the house. However, I did find the mat to be pretty lightweight. Both of my children are now grown and out of the household, so I believe for my purposes this mat definitely does the trick. I am not sure if, given the weight, it would work as well for a larger family. I loved the 'Closed Boxes' patern and find it to be a great alternative of the traditional, old-fashioned Welcome pattern. The Coco Fiber is strong and makes a wonderful material of almost a 'hemp/rope' feel. I would highly recommend this floormat for most people.
B001KOUDJ8 These planters are just as pictured:  Sheet metal in a matte, zinc-like, slate-gray finish, one pot slightly smaller than the other.  The color is an attractive plain background for bright flowers, but certainly brings nothing to the party itself.  The pots are relatively lightweight, and I anticipate they will hold up much better than comparable plastic pots.  Their lighter weight and user-friendly price are big advantages over comparable ceramic or terra cotta.They have three drawbacks that kept me from liking them more.  First of all, they have no drainage holes, so they are best used (as other reviewers have mentioned) as cache pots.  For my taste, they are pretty drab for that purpose.  Secondly, the lightweight metal is easily dinged and dented (although so far, the dents have popped out readily).  Finally, the lip on the edge of the pots is just turned over, rather than rolled, which makes the pots hard to handle and makes it difficult to get anything (such as the inner pot you cached there) out of it.  In fact, they were packed with the smaller pot inside the larger, and it was almost impossible to get the smaller one out without seriously damaging the larger one, because the lip was in the way (this was my first lesson in how easily they dent).
B001KOUDJ8 The pots are handsome with a rich dark matte grey  finish. If you use the picture zoom function on the product page you can get an accurate idea of what the finish and welded seams look like. The pots are very large but lightweight so cleaning and storing for the winter should be easy. The lack of drainage holes is disappointing though. If they are used in a sheltered area you could get away with using as is or as a cache pot with a liner. I plan on using mine to grow tomatoes so I will drill some drainage holes on the bottom.
B001KOUDJ8 First of all, these really are big, handsome planters. A five-gallon bucket fits neatly inside the smallest one with the top edge even with the planter's lip, and that planter fits inside the bigger one. This opens up a lot of possibilities for the inventive gardeners among us who swear by those free pickle buckets.The planters are more like cache pots, without drainage holes. You could drill holes, but it would be better to use an interior pot (like the black ones that your plants come in at the nursery) set on top of some stones or gravel. I filled them both up with water to see if they will hold the water. Yes. These won't leak all over your deck or inside the house; you just need to be sure whatever pot you use on the inside has suitable drainage.I'm thinking one or both of these planters could be used to construct a beautiful water feature using an aquarium pump--although I wouldn't take chances by not reinforcing the inside with pond liner material. The planters have a wide lip that makes them look very thick, even though they are not, and would look very appealing with water flowing over the edge.Yes, they are lovely to look at, and they are well priced compared to what one has to pay at a gardening center for larger planters. They aren't much heavier than the faux concrete pots of the same size. Based on the material they are made from, I don't know how hot they would get in a sunny location and don't have a sunny spot myself to test them in. Depending on what part of the country you live in, heat building up in the metal could be either a good thing or a bad thing. Being a darker grey color, I would expect they would absorb and hold heat.Very nice. Even a person who does not garden at all could use them as classy executive wastepaper or magazine baskets!
B001KOUDJ8 I had these shipped to my work address and promptly removed them from the box.  My initial thought was how boring and blah they were.  I left them out by my desk and had a few coworkers comment on the new \"garbage cans\", which happened to be my initial reaction.  I can understand how one might not want to take away from the beauty of a plant, but this is truly uninspiring.  Maybe a new paint job could help.  And considering it's an outdoor planter, the absence of drainage holes is rather comical.  The smaller planter, which I have included my own images of, fit my winter-indoor spring/summer/fall-outdoor palm's current pot very well.  The larger one I'll use to put a large potted cucumber plant in outside this spring, naturally drilling a few drainage hole in myself.  I don't see these pots as being durable outdoors, without an overhaul.
B001KOUDJ8 These are attractive, solid yet lightweight planters...note=they are not pots but rather planters. As others have already mentioned they do not have holes in the bottom making them the perfect solution for those wishing to avoid water spills or stains on their flooring (especially from that blasted blue fertilizer...all you gardeneers out there know what I mean!).The pair look great together and are actually larger than I expected even though I read the dimensions. My only complaint is the seam - yes, it can be turned to the back but it requires attention to placement to avoid seeing a fairly significant sized seam that runs vertically through each. Outside of that (and the lack of a drainage hole if that bothers you) these are terrific!I have a decent sized back porch, a second fairly large patio plus a small greenhouse with plants on each - as you might imagine, I have my fair share of pots and always on the search for more. I'm actually glad to have some without the holes to put on the porch itself and avoid unwanted drainage, stains etc...The zinc coating is relatively thick so I suspect it should wear well even with the added benefit of a nice neutral color that fits equally well with a rustic or upscale decor (great color!).Very pleased, price is competitive or better than the big box stores and a terrific option for those wishing to avoid draining related problems!
B001KOUDJ8 One of my pots (the largest one) arrived with cracked, chipped off paint around the top of the rim and I can clearly see the shiny silver metal bucket beneath the paint.  Disappointing.  I have my doubts as to whether this finish would have ever lasted outdoors, even if the paint hadn't already cracked off.  I am very hesitant to put this anywhere that the paint might discolor my wood deck.  I am using the large, cracked one as a garbage pail in the garage.Not to mention these pots don't come with drainage holes.  I guess I will have to use the small one as a cache pot since I don't want my plant to get root rot from improper drainage.In my mind, these fail on all fronts as \"planters\"
B001KOUDJ8 Let me start by saying some positives about these planters. First, I was surprised at how big they were. Guess I couldn't tell from the pictures their size. The larger one could easily plant a small tree in (i.e. if you were in the south, you could plant a small orange tree). Second, they were heavier and sturdier than I anticipated (no fear in leaving it on the patio and having it blow over). What I didn't care for it was the color first (a super drab grey), the feel of the pot (some kind of a metallic) and most importantly the fact that there is no drainage in the bottom (not good for root rot). I planted a rose bush in the large one to put out on my outside patio. Given that I don't have any kind of drill to make a hole in it, I am just hoping that the watering I am doing will not collect on the inside of the planter to harm the plant (I have several inches of potting soil beneath the roots and the bottom of the planter). I am sure, if I were handier or if I was more of a horticulturist I could have figured out how to solve this dilemma.Follow up 06-04-2011: Well, the inevitable happened. Without drainage holes in this, my rose bush died last year. There was so much collected water in the bottom (from rain) that although you couldn't see it from the top, the roots goet all rotted. The planter sat in my garage over the winter. Last weekend, a friend drilled five holes in the bottom of the planter for me and I replanted (this time with a large tomato plant). I will let everyone know how it goes. If I had the opportunity, I would have changed the rating of this to 1 or 2 stars for the aggravation and death of my rose bush. Never saw a planter that was set up like this before, really bad design. These are not cheap either, but honestly they are not worth the money at all.
B001KOUDJ8 I have similar planters from this company and they have held up well as cache pots when lined with plastic bags.  There are no drainage holes and the metal might rust with standing water, so that is the best way to use them long term.  If you put a plastic saucer on the bottom (not necessary, but a good backup) and add a double layer of plastic garbage bags, you have the perfect cover for the ugly black plastic pots that most houseplants come in.  Then either take the plant out to water it or leave enough room between the plant and the pot to make sure you are not killing your plant by drowning it in standing water.  I also add an additional clear plastic saucer outside of the decorative pot to be certain that I will not ruin my floor with leaks.  Although they are watertight now, I have learned the hard way not trust anything long-term on my new carpet.The dark metal adds a nice, finished touch to any plant without stealing the focus.  I expect to buy a few more of these to replace other style of planters that just don't look very good now these have arrived.They are being marketed as outdoor planters.  I don't recommend them for that use unless you want to drill drainage holes in the bottom and understand that they will not last as long.  I also would caution against using them in the hot sun as heat build-up could damage the roots of sensitive plants (as well as increase the water requirements).
B001KVZTSG When I received these, at first I was very pleased with the ergonomics.  They feel right and give you confidence to handle any courtyard task.  The handles are just the right shape to fit in your hand.When I took a close look at the blades, I was somewhat less enthused.  Either these are used or the metallurgy fell far short of your best German or Swedish steel.  They look rather crude, almost scruffy.  That doesn't fill me with confidence.As some reviewers have noted, these are purpose-built for small gardens and courtyards, NOT for your sprawling manor grounds.  I would guesstimate that my 1/2 inch shrub branches are about the limit.  Sure, you could attempt tree branches, but the labor involved would be high and the longevity of the shears would plummet to weeks vs. years.Overall, for the price, they're great for my minor requirements.  If you want comfortable shears for a small weekly task, then this is your choice.  If not, look for something bigger and better.
B001KVZTSG Literally the first time I used these shears on a small jasmine vine, one of the rivets that holds the blades together, popped out, never to be found again in the mess that is my mix of tall grass and mulch.  I tried to repair them, but noting I didn't have the right sized nuts and bolts, decided this was not one of those instances where I will just shrug off an inferior product, that I end up fixing myself (especially after the FIRST use!).So I sent a pic into Fiskars (online return/warranty system is very nice and easy FWIW), showing the problem.  I received no feedback for weeks (by this time, my jasmine vine was out of control of course), then one day received a box with a set of their lowest quality shears inside.  Not extendable, and they look like the cheapest shears I have ever seen.  I doubt they will last a season, with the obviously cheap plastic they used for the handles.Talk about a slap in the face.  My time is worth more than dealing with that kind of stuff, and I wish they would just lower their prices and forego the \"lifetime warranty!\" deal if that is how they roll.  I would never have purchased the shears they sent me, so basically I should have just bought another set (NOT Fiskars obviously) of shears when the originals broke.  Ah well, you live you learn.  Buyer beware on these, I see at least three other instances of this same problem happening in these reviews.UPDATE: To be fair, and as a credit to the company's customer service, I actually did contact them later to let them know that I wasn't happy about the switcheroo.  They promptly sent a replacement for the exact shears I originally bought.  Kudos for that!  Hopefully this pair will not fall apart when I start to use them.
B001KVZTSG These are designed for much extensive bush gardens than intentions warranted.  They are extendable and easy to handle.  Blades are long enough to handle even the most arduous work.
B001KVZTSG Made trimming back branches very easy.  Is built heavy duty. You do not have to open too wide to clip so better then many I have tried.
B001KVZTSG I have never owned a pair of sheers so awesome these guys are very powerful and cut great.Ive tried cutting a couple thicker branches from trees but have had trouble doing so taking a few firm cuts, but if your looking for a great set of hedge clippers that give you a clean look then these are the ones for you.Mr Ellis recommends these shears and scores them an A+ you wont regret your purchase!
B001KVZTSG I researched and studied and decided to give these a try.  I am happy with my choice.  Hopefully I will get a couple year's use out of them.  Good decision.
B001KVZTSG The telescoping works, but the design requires extra brute-strength to use at the extended length.I got these shears to reach the tops of bushes that I can't get with my old short-handled shears, but that don't warrant investing in specialized power tools.My reach was indeed extended, but I found the shearing slow going. It turns out that the 9\" blades (vs the 10\" more common for this sort of tool) provide less leverage.  And if I'm reaching out, my arms will naturally be closer together, making it harder to use the full cutting motion.The end result is I get greater reach than with my old shears, but must use notably more effort to actually cut anything.  For me, this limits the tool to selective pruning rather than shaping or hedge-trimming.The extending part of the handles is plastic, but the on the whole appears well constructed.The unique product design moves this up from 3 to 4 stars, but if you're doing a lot of hedge-clipping, something with better leverage will make your life a lot easier.  Recommended with reservations.Update: After a heavy multi-hour session one day, I find the blades no longer line up exactly right (there's a slight click every time I close the blades), even though I normally make a point of cleaning/oiling the blades regularly.  So I'll add the caveat \"lightweight use only\"
B001KVZTSG I have used this type of tool for over 40 years and find this to be a terrific one.  I use it to trim along the fence line on stuff thatis a little too big for a weedeater.  This did a great job and the handles were easy to adjust.
B001MMU0K0 Bought one of these at HD and loved the way it worked so I bought my daughter one too!  The weak designed lever which is made VERY weak broke off on hers the 1st year she had it..mine lasted out the year and then broke off the start of the second season....I put a small pair  of vice grips on shaft to use as the lever and got more use out of it until it  just blew out the shaft completely and the water just shot out of the side...A VERY EXPENSIVE PIECE OF JUNK!  stick with the old hand wind hose reels and save yourself a bundle..
B001MMU0K0 I actually love this reel since it does spare me time in manually winding or wrapping up the 100ft garden hose I have.  I just have a couple of gripes with the design and quality.  It comes with these foot holders and 12\" spikes to drive into the ground which keep the reel in place.  The feet didn't last long; pulling out the hose ended up pulling the box right off the feet.  After several times using it and constantly putting the box back into the foot holders, I got fed up and stopped putting it back in and just now leave it free standing on a mulch bed.  The hose stop (the black ball in the photo attached near the sprayer head) does not fit my standard hose that I bought at home depot.  The stop is two halves that wrap around the hose and are secured using screws.  Well, I ended up having to find longer screws and leaving a 1/2\" gap between the halves since it does not fit around the hose.  The water powered wind up function is extremely powerful, I've already had to replace one sprayer head cause the hand depressor got caught on a rock and was completely ripped off by the strength of the hose retractor; I switched to this model which prevents it from catching on anything during the winding processNelson Rezimar Fireman-Foots Style Twist Nozzle 50170.  When the hose winds up completely the strength again of the retractor shows up...it sounds like the hose stop is going to be pulled right threw the front of the box; so we have to rush to turn the water off or stand ready at the box to push the retractor handle back to the forward position.I am looking at another box to put at the opposite side of the house and unless I find another box with better reviews I will probably end up buying another one of these.  Again, despite it's downfalls in design and quality, it gets the job done.
B001MMU0K0 This is an ill-conceived, ill-designed, landfill item designed by a rookie engineer. The lever that is most used (to change the unit from retract to freewheel position) is designed with a definite shear point in the design.  No joke.  This thing is designed to fail. It is cast with a tee in the plastic lever that is .097\" thick - that's a little over 3/32\" thick - made of plastic! Mine snapped off on the first cool day - see the picture on the product page.  Don't buy this junk.Update 6/1/13:Just took mine to the landfill. Although I had reinforced the rewind lever with epoxy and 1/8\" aluminum plate - the inner drive gear snapped off.  I bought a metal, hand-crank model to replace it.  I see that Suncast has a newer (probably redesigned) rewind lever (black) listed here:http://www.suncast.com/replacement/replacementdisplay.aspx?repid=173&prodId;=504Hope that helps anyone trying to extend the life of their unit.  But I reiterate, this product is designed for a short lifespan. I highly recommend looking elsewhere for a legitimately designed product.
B001MMU0K0 Well so far we had none of the problems the other reviewers have had. It works great, retracts the wheel, and its quite cool and handy. I love the storage box. We got one for the front of house and now are getting one for the back. We had no trouble or leaks with hook up, and again works and retracts perfectly. I love the box idea, can place things on top and it keeps it nice and neatly, tucked away.I will update my review accordingly in a few more months seeing how they work out. I hope it doesn't turn out like the other reviewers. For what its worth we did purchase a no tangle hose which we use with the reel, not sure if that makes a difference or not? In either case ours from last year works great still and we are on to our second one.
B001MMU0K0 This hose winder is very compact and easy to install.  When you switch the lever to wind mode, it does use the water pressure to self-wind the hose.  The water that \"leaks\" out of its discharge hose is actually the water that is needed to wind it.  I simply let that small hose drain into the plants, so it's not an issue.The problem, as some people have mentioned here, is the winding track doesn't always line up the way it's supposed to, so you have to guide it along in the \"box\" as it's winding.  If the winding hose is extremely long, it can get frustrating to someone who has little patience.  Also note: From experience, if the hose you are using has a rubbery outside, it can get really stuck, so I do not recommend that type of hose for this product.  Other than the track issue which is a learning process to deal with, I have not had any other issues with mine, and it functions well even after 2 years.  I do believe that the benefit here outweighs the little snags.  Make sure you pull the hose straight out first, then take it where you need to; and on the way back in, it does the work - you just need to guide it a little.
B001MMU0K0 What a great concept with a crummy execution.  The first time I used this, I thought it was the cats meow.  It reeled up the hose nicely.  After about 10 uses, the hose guide started to get out of sync with where the hose should be.  It made loud clicking noises but still reeled up the hose just fine.  However, when you try to pull the hose out it gets totally stuck unless you stand at the base of the hose reel and pull the hose in the direction it needs to go (hose guide would be on the left side but the hose would be in the middle or on the right side creating a pinch that wouldn't allow the hose to come out).  This makes pulling the hose out a nightmare ... inch by inch is not the way to pull out 125 feet of hose.  Soon enough, two of our hose reels failed completely and stopped reeling in the hose (lots of loud clicks but little reeling).  The last one became so difficult to pull the hose out that we threw it in the trash (last one).  Given that I have experience with not just one, but three of these - I suggest you take heed:  DON'T WASTE YOUR HARD EARNED MONEY ON THIS JUNK.
B001MQB6WW These diurnal little people come around every evening to be served a fine meal with me as the maitre d .Ah what a breath taking plethora they envision from 11 squirrelys up at le bleu sprucee.
B001MQB6WW Has been on one of our pecan trees now since the summer and is holding up in the Louisiana heat and rain well. Good price!
B001MQB6WW This purchase is proving to be great entertainment. I have placed the picnic table on a tree in front of my office window. It took the squirrels about four days to find it. I almost removed it, because it took them so long to start eating the corn, but once they got started now they are always checking for new ears of corn. It took them about three hours to figure out how to turn the cob. Very Cute. Great Purchase.
B001MQB6WW Bought for my mother in law for Christmas. She loves it, as do her squirrels. Was easy to put up. Well made.
B001MQB6WW I wish i would've bought this item before the backyard boys glass squirrel feeder because the food disappears so fast in the glass feeder that I can't keep up with feeding them.  this feeder and the squirrelog feed are keeping the squirrels busy and because they have to gnaw on the log the food doesn't disappear as fast which is a good thing for me.  they seem to love it.
B001O8C8KW I went to this size of planter as I had previous size planters from Fiskars.  While it looks like clay, it is a durable product and perfect for planting a row of radishes or onions for the first summer crop.  We don't need a large garden any longer but still enjoy gardening at the smaller level.  You can do this with the Fiskars 30-inch planter.
B001O8C8KW This is a great little planter with drainage holes that are going to be the home of some low-growing plants.  I will spray paint the container to go with my house.
B001O8C8KW I purchased this and the Fiskars 26-Inch Veranda Rectangular Planter Box to plant herbs in.The rectangular shape is ideal to plant a few varieties in each planter. The punch out holes was a really nice option to prevent overwatering of the herbs.  These are great products for growing herbs, I highly recommend them!
B001O8C8KW OK planter that serves my purpose which is to grow tree seeds.  I plant the seeds in a row giving me three rows.  This size can hold a goodly number of seeds in the long rows.  Have to punch holes in the bottom for drainage although you might choose to leave as is.  Nice depth for roots to go down deep and spread out.  Is sturdy and a nice color.  Used it one season and it shows no wear at all.
B001O8C8KW I used these pots inside my outdoor, under-window flower boxes. After filling with soil and a variety of flowers it was super easy to put inside the box. Due to the lightweight resin construction, I am able to take them out easily when it gets to cold outside. I love that the drainage holes were optional so I could leave them in due to where I am using the pot.
B001O8C8KW Pros:- Sturdy construction.- Reasonable price.- Long, deep, and spacious.Cons:- Takes a TON of soil.- Not breathable. In my apartment, I have little air circulation, and these tend to stay too damp for me. This leads to fungus gnat problems.
B001O8C8KW I really like this Fiskars plant because it isn't too large so it was perfect for planting herbs.  It is a great price for the look and the durability.
B001P80H18 i've had this for a few months now.  works just as expected.  the only thing is that the circular label with all the numbers on it is starting to peel off.  i have this inside a well-ventilated greenhouse so it is not coming in contact with rain/water (humidity tho) so i'm not sure why this is peeling.  i'm glad i don't have it outside it would be gone by now.  need a plastic label with good adhesive or just paint the numbers directly on the plastic.
B001P80H18 Total bummer because the timer and valve seem to work nicely.  However, it has already cracked and it leaks onto my porch.  I wish we could get out of the &#34;plastic&#34; product obsession and go back to making things with quality materials.
B001P80H18 Was ok, I ordered another one so I guess it is good.  Plastic how ever is not very strong with heavy hose connected to it.
B001P80H18 It does what it's supposed to, I don't know what else to say about it, certainly nothing to complain about!
B001P80H18 This item is performing just fine so far however, the dial on the top of the timer is simply a poorly-glued on sticker that has essentially peeled off after about two weeks' of use.
B001P80H18 Unit arrive promptly and was packaged well.  I was wasting a lot of water because I forgot to turn off the hose, and I'm on metered water.  This unit works great.  Has held up for 9 months.  I'll take if off come winter. Timer seems very accurate.
B001P82AHM Mosquitoes are a real pain in the neck (and a pain to several other body parts) and keeping them under control is essential for outdoor enjoyment. Insect repellant applied to the skin is a good, inexpensive first defense, but if you want or need something that will kill the critters dead before they even reach your skin, then consider the Mosquito Magnet Executive Mosquito Trap, an electronic means to fight biting insects.The results I have noticed so far with this unit, as far as its bug- killing ability, have been positive. I was a little surprised when I opened the box and discovered that it didn't come with its own propane tank, but oh well- I just had to take the tank off of the gas grill and use it. Attaching the propane, charging the unit, and pushing a few buttons is all it took to get the unit going. I placed it in the backyard, near my pool. And what I noticed is that, yes, the bugs were not as noticeable as before. This device, like its name suggests, acts as a magnet to attract insects through its creation of carbon dioxide. The annoying little critters are attracted by the CO2 and enter the machine where they are then sucked into a net, dehydrate, and die.I like that this device is cordless and rechargeable and it does perform well at its primary mission. But there are a few things about this machine that concern me. First, it is very expensive and I doubt many people (unless they have a very large size yard and a serious mosquito problem) will be willing to cough up the cash to make the purchase. The manufacturer claims that it can cover up to an acre (which means my neighbors are benefitting), so it is really intended for larger areas. Second, there is the routine maintenance and cost of operation. If you use this on a regular basis, it will cost you not only because of propane refills, but also for replacing cartridges, insect attractant, and other things. Yes, these replacements are easy enough to find, but the cost does add up. And this is why I must stress that, unless you have a serious mosquito problem, a device like this will likely not prove cost effective.Mosquitoes and other biting insects can prove more than just a nuisance- they can also carry disease and controlling them is important to family health and outdoor enjoyment. The Mosquito Magnet Executive Mosquito Trap certainly kills its share of bugs, but it does cost a fair amount of money to operate and maintain and
B001P82AHM The first thing I noticed about the Mosquito Magnet Executive is that it's easy to put together.  No tools necessary.  One piece simply slides inside the other.  Unfortunately, this also makes it very easy to take apart.  This is a drawback because it makes it difficult to move and secure; and with a sticker price of $700, of course you don't want to just leave it sitting in your yard.  I would have thought it would have some sort of built-in mechanism for securing it, but theft-prevention was apparently not even a consideration in the design of this product.The next issue was that the battery was bad.  After charging it according to the instructions, we inserted it into the machine and got a \"low battery\" message.  We charged it again, but the same thing happened.  This is when we got a taste of Mosquito Magnet's famously poor customer service.  The first rep I talked to (Nadine) said we had to take our battery to Radio Shack to have it tested.  \"They don't mind,\" she advised, \"and they probably won't even charge you anything.\"  When I expressed reluctance to do this, she said, \"I'm just trying to save you money so you don't get a new battery and find out that's not the problem.\"  I pointed out that my machine was still under warranty and I shouldn't have to pay for a new battery.  She said, \"You said you didn't buy the machine yourself, so you're not covered by the warranty.\"  I pointed out that I'm reviewing the product and I was pretty sure Mosquito Magnet would want me to have a new battery so I could fairly evaluate the machine, so she returned to saying that I should have the battery tested.  I told her there was no point in that because the battery was clearly defective.  She then said, \"Okay, you can pack up the entire machine and mail it back to us at your expense, and we'll see what's wrong with it.\"I hung up and called back, getting a different rep.  The second rep was a little more courteous, but equally unhelpful, also demanding that I go to Radio Shack to have the battery tested (I wonder how Radio Shack feels about this).  I asked to speak to the marketing department, saying that they would probably want to know that the machines they paid to have sent out for review were not working right and customer service wasn't doing anything about it.  The rep said, \"I can't connect you to the company.  We're just a call center.  We don't have anything to do with Mosquito Magnet.\"  Ahh!  That explains a lot.I asked to speak to a supervisor, and after an extensive wait, I finally got a hold of one.  She held the Radio Shack party line for a while, but suddenly changed her mind, got my name and address, and promised to send me a new battery.The battery did indeed arrive a few days later, and it charged without problem (actually, it seemed to have been shipped already charged), and the machine worked . . . for a while.  But then we got a message that the fuel was low even though it had only been running overnight (NOTE: The Mosquito Magnet Executive does NOT come with a propane tank, so you will need to buy one, which, depending on your area, could cost $45-$60).Inexplicably, the machine began working again, and a bit to my surprise, it has actually caught a lot of mosquitoes.  After just a day, we noticed far fewer mosquitoes in the yard, so it appears that the principle works, but the design practicality, quality control, and customer service are so atrocious, I can't say that I would recommend this very expensive device, despite the fact that it actually *works*.  I cannot yet comment on the long-term reliability of the Mosquito Magnet Executive, but it's definitely not off to a good start.  If your machine has manufacturing problems, will the company actually help you?  They might, but you will probably be in for a lot of hassle (and possibly additional expense).  Until Mosquito Magnet addresses these issues (and reduces the unjustifiably high price), buying this machine might be a gamble.UPDATE 10/10/11: We used our Mosquito Magnet for the rest of the summer, and other than having to refill the tank (twice) and chemical attractant, we did not have any further problems, and the device continued to do an excellent job of eliminating mosquitoes.  I continue to have serious concerns (given my earlier experiences and the price point of the device) about the quality control and customer service, but if you have a problem with mosquitoes, yes, this product really does work quite well.
B001P82AHM Testing this product in two regions of the country that are infested with mosquitos, Virginia and Florida, has proven that this product works.Set up:Set up is takes some time.  Charge the battery for 2 hours.  Acquire a full propane tank.  Assemble the trap.  First, you must determine the most effective location where the trap will be placed, assemble the unit in 3 steps, transfer it to your selected location and then attach the propane tank.  Insert the mosquito attractant, then turn on the unit.  After a few minutes, it will warm up and be ready for de-population of your annoying gnats and mosquitoes.The basket, tank and attractant must be replaced every month for optimal use.  This can cost about $43 per month ($16 for propane, $16 for attractant, $8 for the basket, and $3 for the CO2 cartridge).  It's up to you whether it's worth it to you.  To me, it is.  I am prone to getting bitten.Limitations:This works best in areas covered by line of sight.  Around the back of the house on our one acre lot in Virginia, it will not cover that area.  In the house in Florida, it will cover the backyard and the neighbor's backyard in our smaller 0.3 acre lots but not the front yard.  If you needed optimal coverage for the front and back yard, you really need two units to cover the line of sight.  So, for me, access to the side yard and front yard is covered.  However, when I grill in the opposite side of coverage, I get bitten still.Cost of operation.  It is not cheap.  However, this only has to be used in the peak season of the critters (Spring through Fall in VA).Effectiveness:The device works and collects dozens of insects by the dozen each day.  The effects are not immediate, like lighting a citronella candle, so it is not useful as an immediate use product.  It does reduce the population in its coverage area efficiently over the course of a few days.Maintenance:Change the propane tank with a refill, change the basket, flush the system with CO2, and change the attractant.  I am not squeamish about changing the basket but it is not a pleasant experience - I suppose you can clean the basket but that is not an option that I wish to take.  The battery must be charged each season.Pros:EffectiveCons:Cost of monthly operationLine of Sight effectivenessTakes time for effectiveness to be noticedTime consuming monthly maintenanceOverall:It is not exactly cost effective for most people.  It works for the areas in the line of sight. However, if you are trying to find a solution, this works well.
B001P82AHM I have had a Defender model of this product made by the original manufacturer (American Biophysics which went bankrupt in 2007). This one is now made by Woodstream who bought the assets of American Biophysics.Anyway, these are by far the best devices to catch mosquitos and work exactly as described. After 3 to 4 weeks you will see a huge reduction in the numbers of mosquitos. The new executive trap I just got through the vine program started right up and has been catching well for the last 3 weeks. I am just about at the end of my first tank of propane so the rest of the story has yet to be seen. Like this product, the Defender caught tons of mosquitos. Unfortunately it also had to be sent back every year to be repaired when it wouldn't start up at the start of the season (and yes, I cleaned it and stored it exactly as they instructed). The repairs run anywhere from $80 to $250 and are done by third parties independent of Woodstream. Time will tell if this Executive product has the same issues as the original Mosquito Magnets had. I will update this review once I see how the device fares on restart. If it works well I will probably buy another one and dispose of the Defender.Just to leave on a positive note: This device is battery powered and still going strong at the end of 3 weeks. The manual says it should be able to get through the summer on one charge. This is way more convenient that the Defender model which require 120 volt power, therefore a very long extension cord (you place this away from where people are going to be since it attracts mosquitos to itself and then kills them).Update as of July 23rd, 2011. The rechargeable battery is doing quite well so far. The manual says it will run all season on one charge. This appears to be correct. I just replaced the first tank of propane. I used two CO2 cleaning cartridges and the unit started up just fine. This is a good sign. The real test will be if it starts up fine next spring.Update for May 5th of 2013 (Happy Cinco de Mayo): For the third season in a row this unit has started right up. Whatever problems they had with the earlier units seem to have been fixed in this model. I did the shut down cleaning last fall just like they recommend in the manual and did a start up cleaning this spring. I use three cartridges each time now just to be safe (If you buy them in boxes of 25 the price is low enough to do three at a time). The rechargeable battery lasted all season last year.
B001P82AHM I was excited to recieve this from the Amazon Vine Program.  Living in Alabama we have mosquitoes.  We have had nothing but trouble with it from the beginning.  It may be a great product, but we can't keep it running long enough to find out.  We have followed the directions closely & followed all the trouble-shooting tips, but alas it just won't keep running.  We have all necessary items needed for it to run correctly.  At this point I am not sure what to do...I guess just keep working with it.  I would love for it to work & trap all the pesky mosquitoes that keep un indoors.  I will update later if we can get it to stay running.UPDATE:  Talked with the Mosquito Magnet customer service.  They gave some help ideas that we tried.  It worked great for a few hours.  During the time it worked it did catch many mosquitoes plus gnats.  We were thrilled...but unfortunately it stopped working again & now stops working once it warms up.  Customer service was called again.  They were little to no help & didn't seem to concerned about their product.  After many hours working with this product, we have given up.
B001P82AHM Really only worth getting if you have a serious mosquito problem and are on a large piece of land to justify the cost for one of these units.  It does seem to work effectively to eliminate mosquitos.  You can notice a drop after a few days usage.  So, it does what it is supposed to do.  However, cost of use and maintenance can get quite high with the need to replace propane tanks and bait cartridges.  I don't yet know what the lifecycle is for the rechargeable batteries.  I can't imagine replacing them would be cheap.  Also, cleaning the unit is pretty nasty but really needs to be done diligently to maintain effectiveness.
B001P82AHM I've had the MM3300 Mosquito Magnet for about two months now, and the mosquito basket has been consistently full. I didn't realize how badly the bat population has been affected by a particular disease over the past year, but the flying insect population has risen dramatically because of it.  My wife and I have seen some bugs which must have escaped from science fiction movies and I really hope the bat population recovers!Assembly of the Mosquito Magnet was very simple.  Three pieces, and they just snap together sturdily.  We have the \"Executive\" model, so we had to charge the rechargable battery overnight.  According to the instructions, this charge will last all season long.  We were underway the next morning.  Within days, the \"bug bag\" was teaming with departed mosquitoes.I've used only partially-filled propane tanks so far, so I don't have the best measurement of how long a tank will last; my estimate so far would be about three weeks or so per tank.  I will update.After a while, I noticed that the MM wasn't attracting mosquitoes as well, so I did have to buy the Octenol Biting Insect attractant to bring the MM back to full efficiency.  Between the Octenol and the propane, there is an expense to running the machine.  The Octenol was $22 for a three pack, each unit lasting about three weeks, so according my best-guess estimate for propane, if you spend $20 to refill a propane tank and it takes three weeks to empty it, you're looking at just under $10 a week to run the Magnet.  Again, this is an estimate I will revisit when I can.I am always skeptical when I look at gadgets such as this one, but in my experience so far, it seems that the magnet is doing a pretty good job.  You can judge by the mosquito corpses and also from the number of buzzing noises you hear near your head when you're outside in early evening, and being super-sensative to mosquitos, I must admit that in both sets of measuring criteria, I am satisfied of good results.Now if only the cost of the unit and the operating price would decrease... that would make me give five stars instead of four!
B001P82AHM When Vine sent me this to try out I have to admit I was a skeptic.  When it arrived even more so.Took it on a week long camping trip in a place where there were TONS of mosquitos.Now whether it was this contraption or just plain luck I did not get on mosquito bite.  The bin was full of mosquitos at the end of the week.  Intially it did not look like the trap was cataching them right but when I went to actually empty the trap it was clear that it had worked correctly.The DVD that comes with it while it has some good information takes too long to actually get to the point and is very poor quality.While this appears more designed for seasonal use as opposed to event use it does seem to have an impact even in a short amount of time.
B001P82AHM My daughter graduates from college and we're having her party next weekend. This will be the first party we've thrown where people will be able to sit outside during the duration (weather permitting of course) and not get eaten alive. In the past, we've had to have bug spray cans at each table and use Yard Guard in order to spend even short periods of time outside during our parties.The instructions contain a few grammatical errors, but they also include a DVD that tells you everything you need to know with the exception of one fact.  The written instructions say to use it 24/7 for three days.  (An example of the grammatical errors.) It takes four weeks to get the full effect. It took about 15 minutes for the trap to be completely assembled. I am of the opinion it would be impossible to not put it together correctly. It is smaller than a small gas grill and does not stand as tall.It is suggested that it be placed in an area with a 30 foot clear perimeter.  We are not able to provide that because of our relatively small back yard and large garage.  I don't think that it will cause a problem, however, because the trap is filling up with mosquitos every day.I wholeheartedly recommend this product. We are thrilled to use our pool in the evenings now.  And our neighbors are thrilled to sit on their decks as well.  This trap can work for up to an acre sized lot.Follow up:  Party was great and people lingered in the yard well after dark.  I should add that the party was scheduled from 4:30 to 7:30.  It was very muggy and stormed between 3 and 4:00 p.m.  Due to this, I was quite concerned about mosquitos and dug out last year's insect repellant and left it sitting on the deck.  Not one person reached for it the entire evening.I just ordered the replacement attractents.  It was over $18 for a three month supply, which will last us the whole season.  That, coupled with the propane, makes it cost about a $100 per season if my math is correct. This, when compared to the expense of bug spray and yard guard, makes it seems quite reasonable - especially for those of us that don't like the feel or smell of bug repellant spray.
B001P82AHM The Mosquito Magnet is a very specific solution to a very specific problem.  You have to have 1) Ownership of a fairly large area of land 2) A particularly nasty mosquito problem 3) Enough money that you don't mind spending a tidy sum to combat those mosquitoes.  If you have all three of those you are going to love this.There is no doubt that the Mosquito Magnet works, and works well.  It works amazingly well, one might even say.  It works on the principle of simulating human breath that attracts the mosquitoes into a trap, a trap that fills up quickly.  It isn't an instant solution; you have to leave it running constantly for about a week before you start to see the results, but from then on out your mosquito problem becomes a non-problem.The magnet comes in a huge box, and is easy enough to set up and get started.  It isn't quite the same size as my small propane grill, but it isn't far off. It requires a newish propane tank to run, which you will have to buy if you don't already own one. Once you get it up and turned on, it runs without any further need for fine-tuning. You just start it up and let it go, then check the traps a week later.  I haven't had mine too long, but I have heard that they tend to burn out after a year, which is something to keep in mind.Ultimately for me I don't have the right confluence of circumstances to need the Mosquito Magnet.  My main mosquito problem comes with regular week-long camping trips in the summer near a river that has a particularly unpleasant mosquito bog.  But because the Magnet doesn't provide an instant solution, and needs to be run continuously for a week before you really see results, it doesn't help like I was hoping.  In my own backyard in the Pacific Northwest I get mosquitoes, and it was nice to be mosquito-free for awhile, but I don't really have enough of a problem to justify the propane-usage required to run the Mosquito Magnet constantly.
B001P82AHW The large, surprisingly lightweight box arrived in perfect condition, no visible damage inside or out.When I removed the head unit from the box however, I heard obvious broken parts inside and immediately called their customer support.After all, inside the box was a large STOP; call our dedicated, superior customer support for any trouble. I assumed this would be quickly taken care of since the self report their customer service to be so good.While they answered the phone quickly the quality of support was poor.I had an obviously defective unit with broken pieces inside and they wouldn't help unless I tried to turn it on first. This seemed like a bad idea for a product that hooks up to a fuel source. They wanted me to believe that the sound (broken pieces rattling and rolling around inside the head unit) I heard was normal.I could forgive this, after all they don't want to pay return shipping for an item that was misdiagnosed by a end user that doesn't have product experience. So I removed a cover piece and poured out the broken pieces, sent a photo to them in email, and was again refused support. They suggested  try turning the unit on and see if it worked, and then sent me to follow up with Amazon for the defective unit.The plastic pieces appear to be part of an internal frame, cage, or some other support. It is a strong, but brittle, black plastic. In addition to 4 large pieces, many small shattered fragments came out of the box. While the piece that was broken may not be critical, the question remains why it broke, and what else may be loose or disconnected. Am I going to end up with an internal propane leak that ends up causing the unit to catch on fire?As if this isn't enough to point to poor design/build quality, the unit is entirely made of lightweight plastic. The instructions even warn not to move the unit with a tank installed. I agree with their apparent admission that the frame would not support the weight! Perhaps an aluminum post that securely connected to the base and the head unit would be a good upgrade for them to consider.While the nearly all plastic construction was quick and easy to set up, there are no screws, no locks, nothing to hold the base, post, and head unit together. The head unit balances on the post with a short peg sliding into the support column. So the loop that looks like a handle opposite of the wheels on the base doesn't really work well for lifting and rolling the unit around. First as described above, you must remove the tank, even with that weight removed, the head unit tends to lift right off the post as it is a friction only connection.Chances are some of these units will actually work, some perhaps for more than the few weeks described by other reviewers, and perhaps if this unit was under $200 I could understand the build quality. But at this price point and nearly every review pointing out poor quality and poor customer service,  I would not recommend this unit to anyone and would be very concerned about any of their other lower cost units.The only positive note I can add for the Mosquito Magnet brand is that we have had an older design Commercial Unit Mosquito Magnet Pro in service for years. However it seems the current owners, Woodstream Company, discontinued this product when they purchased the company.
B001P82AHW The \"bad\" is only bad if you don't make enough money to buy this product and feed it. It requires a propane tank (not included) that must be refilled every 21 days plus changing lures and the catch net as it fills up with mosquitoes. The Mosquito Magnet is well conceived and solidly built for its intended purpose. Its niche appears to be the outdoor-room set, families who spend a lot of time outside, church groups who have frequent churchyard picnics, community-based/supported playgrounds and gardens, daycare centers, or any place people spend a lot of time outdoors.The \"ugly\" is that propane is burned to generate CO2. This is how the product attracts mosquitoes so it can trap/kill them. But with carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere wreaking climate change havoc, it's more than slightly disturbing to me to consider deliberately adding more. (Not to mention the volatility of gas prices!) I would not have requested this product for review had I realized how much propane is required to use it effectively.The \"good\" may be a silver lining. Plants in greenhouses and grow rooms benefit from controlled injection of CO2. A perusal of internet forums devoted to hydroponics and other indoor-growing techniques reveals that some growers are using Mosquito Magnets for CO2 generation. Using the product for this instead of its intended purpose would be less costly because changing the lure and net would not be required; only the propane tank would need to be refilled periodically, and the Mosquito Magnet would only need to be run long enough to maintain the desired CO2 levels. It's conceivable, too, that one's net carbon footprint could be reduced if food were grown in a greenhouse instead of depending on produce shipped thousands of miles and having to drive to the grocery store often to purchase it.Again, it's a well-made product that seems to work as intended. But taking into consideration all of the above, I can only personally give the Mosquito Magnet three stars and say that I am disinclined to use it. For some, however, this product may be just the ticket&mdash;especially those who are both chemically sensitive and concerned about the diseases mosquitoes carry.
B001P82AHW Update March 28, 2012:  Over the winter we stored this machine inside (minus the propane tank, of course) and covered with a sheet.  Starting it up again this year, we had some trouble getting the machine to give us the green go light.  Had a few conversations with the company's customer service and finally landed a person that provided us with a suggestion that solved our machine's problem.  So, with some TLC and good communication, we are up and running for another season.Update September 15, 2011:  We are still in a severe drought, which would normally mean no mosquitoes.  And for a few weeks, we actually turned the machine off.  But when we started running the sprinkler system every day, we started seeing mosquitoes again. We turned the machine back on and the mosquitoes disappeared.We have learned that the machine is more effective with the attractant.  So if you are going to invest in this machine, plan on getting a supply of the attractant, also.  Do not try to go without it.  Just my opinion, though.Having run this Mosquito Magnet for about five months now, we are still happy with the results.  It is temperamental, though, and it needs TLC:  Battery connections need to be checked weekly.  A one-time heavy rain caused the machine to stop working.Update July 17:  Machine is still working fine.  We've had rain and there have been mosquitoes around, but not where our machine is placed.  Please read through this review--all of it is still true.  The most important piece of advice I can give you:  If you have more than one area of your yard that can breed mosquitoes, then this machine will NOT kill them all.  If you are in doubt, make a diagram of your yard, all its obstacles, all its wet spots, hedges, gardens, etc. and ask the company for advice.  This machine is so very expensive for it to not cover your entire space.....Earlier update is at bottom of review, but the important information is:  It works on biting gnats/no-see-ums!  The bad news is:  This Magnet does not cover an acre if there is a house, garage, lanai or other out-buildings or obstacles on that acre plot.We received our Mosquito Magnet and it's been running smoothly for two weeks now.  We don't know how well it works--long-term.  But, I'm writing this review now, because we're already into mosquito season and there have got to be a lot of people out there thinking about purchasing this product right now--and wondering if the new machines work any differently than those produced in years past.  After reading past years' reviews, I believe prior \"issues\" have been addressed and corrected in the machine we received.I will continue to update the review as we determine how well it works for us--maximum effectiveness takes about a month to achieve, although insects were drawn into the trap immediately--I believe that would be because even though we see dead mosquitoes from the beginning, there are still eggs out there hatching.  So, as of now, I can say that:  The assembly instructions were adequate; all the parts were there; assembly was simple and not time-consuming; we are impressed with the quality of the components; the machine is surprisingly well-engineered; customer service is at your fingertips and pleasant; the machine is running just fine, and biting insects are attracted into the net.BUT, before you buy a Mosquito Magnet you should give its placement some hard thought:  It should be upwind and 30-40 feet from where people normally congregate; it must be located between breeding areas and people areas; ideally it should be in the shade, and it should be kept away from water sprinkler spray.  After analyzing these requirements, if you don't have such an area, you might want to rethink the investment.I contacted customer service by phone because I had a question.  The rep was polite and informative, even though he gave me an answer that I didn't want to hear.  Our property is about an acre and a half and we live in many parts of our yard:  On the front porch, on the back deck, in the veggie gardens on one side of the house and out back, and at the grill on the side of the house or the smoker in another area.  There is no \"best location\" to put the Magnet--putting it in one place will not protect us in all the yard areas we use daily. I wanted to know if the Magnet was effective if we moved it around the yard.  His answer:  No, the Magnet is not as effective if you move it around.  It should stay in one place.  But he said that we could go ahead and try it......Well, yeah, we sure can--but that's a lot of money to spend for a questionable outcome.But we'll give it a try anyway.  Since there is no clear-cut placement in our particular situation, we anticipate having a first season of trial-and-error.  But, hey, even if it only eliminates the monster mosquitoes that attempt to carry us away when we walk the dog in the early mornings and late evenings, it will be worth it.Be aware there is an investment here beyond the initial purchase price.  You have to provide the propane tank and refill it every 21 days.  Also, there are nets, attractant and \"Quick Clear\" cartridges to replace every 21 days.  So, between propane and monthly replacements and other enhancements--and the length of your mosquito season, you'll be spending at least a hundred dollars extra each year--probably more.Update May 9, 2011:  Our area in Texas is experiencing drought conditions.  There are not many mosquitoes around.  We placed the Magnet in an area upwind of where we thought mosquitoes would be breeding.  After a week there were many gnats in the net, but not many mosquitoes.  For the past few weeks I have been getting a lot of bites on my legs while working in the garden, and when I was able to catch one little bugger in the act, I realized the culprits were gnat-looking tiny insects.  We moved the Magnet to a position upwind of the main garden, and within an hour it had quite a few of the tiny insects in the net.  The insects don't look like the no-see-ums that I am familiar with from the Virgin Islands, but they sure do bite like them--and the bites really hurt!  And the bites are hot and hurtful for many, many days!  They are worse than mosquito bites.So there are two observations I can now make:  1.)  The Magnet is attracting biting insects; and, 2.)  The Magnet may cover an acre if the area is wide open, but it does not cover an acre if there are buildings, lanais, or other obstacles around.  Do you spend your time outdoors in just one part of your yard?  And can you place the Magnet in the shade, upwind and 30'-40' away from people?  If you can answer \"yes\" to both those questions, well then, maybe this is the machine for you--otherwise you may want to rethink your options.We still have faith that this machine will perform to our satisfaction--with a few \"give and takes\" in our ultimate rationalization of \"our satisfaction\".  So, I am leaving my rating at four stars.
B001P82AHW Given the cost of this unit itself plus the monthly feeding of propane and this turns into quite an expensive venture that only half works. I've been using it regularly for the past two months with little if any improvement in my yard. Unlike others, I had no problem in setup or DOA unit, all was fine. I have followed the instructions to a tee, but yet don't see a huge improvement, a slight one yes, but is it really worth the cost? I don't think so.
B001P82AHW Much like the other reviewers, I had a lot of difficulty to get this thing to work. I never did manage to in the end. I was hoping that they had fixed the issues with the product, but that doesn't seem to be the case [I tested it out in summer 2011].Even if this unit were to function properly, it still seems expensive, especially once you add the cost of a propane tank and frequent refills. Plus you're adding CO2 to the atmosphere - not very environmentally sound.
B001P82AHW My unit arrived at my doorstep DOA; it had a problem with start up.  When I turned it on for the first time, I had a blinking red error LED every 7 seconds after its lengthy (approx 25min) start up procedure.  It never worked; always had this same error light even after trying every suggestion from their customer service.I called customer service about 6-8 times (lost count).  They gave me tips and things to try to get it to work; all to no avail.  They were polite and professional, but extremely un-empowered.  They had no or limited ability to help me.  The problem is that even though they understood my problem, their management probably didn't give them the latitude to easily solve the problem.  They kept putting me on hold, check with someone, then back to me and not quite sure what to do.  It's like ABC, if B is not quite what they have on their form in front of them, they are caught in an endless loop and can't get to C.Finally, I got sick and tired of trying to make it work and shipped it back to the company since I didn't want this big useless thing junking up my garage.  They were nice & sent me a free shipping label.  They did offer to \"repair\" the unit but I was so tired of dealing with this & after reading all the bad reviews, was pretty sure it's a crap shoot to get a working machine.
B001P82AHW In order to be prepared for whatever nature threw at us, we set up the Mosquito Magnet quite early in the season.  Right from the beginning, we got a red warning light, signaling that the unit wasn't working.  We tried to clear it but nothing seemed to work.  Next, the Magnet signaled a low battery warning.  Since they were new and advertised to last the season, we were a bit taken aback but my husband removed and tested them.  Sure enough, they were fully charged but reinstalling them didn't help.  He substituted other new batteries to no avail and then he called customer service.  The woman to whom he spoke was quite pleasant but unable to provide any solutions.  At one point, after he explained that our device didn't exactly resemble the pictures in the literature, she suggested that perhaps we had been sent an earlier model as if that sufficed to explain its failure.After the call, he once again removed the batteries and decided to wait a few days and try the trap again.  The green light came on and we thought it was working but after going through two cycles with the attendant replacing of the propane and the lure, the Mosquito Magnet which is unobstructed and situated just a few feet from our patio area, has caught pitifully few insect pests and our yard is no more mosquito-free than it was before we set this up.
B001P82AHW This device works by sending out CO2 from a Propane tank.The thought of spending $20 or so and just leaking out CO2 is beyond me.I wish I had returned it on time. Now it is just clogging up my garage and I hate to even give it away or donate it.
B001P82AHW This review is a work in progress. As I'm writing now, the date is 5/3/11. It will be updated by 5/31/11, and again as summer rolls on and I have additional information to report. That being said....We live in the Midwest where summer months are extremely important, as we all look forward to sunshine after months of snow. Our property is wooded, and mosquitoes are a huge problem, especially since we do a lot of summer entertaining. After learning how mosquito zappers kill all the bugs that EAT mosquitoes, we tried every other option from foggers to citronella, all with little success and lots of worry about toxins around pets.I installed this unit 4/23. I took a photo, and you can see how it looks in the yard. After some pots of flowers are around it, it will blend in nicely. Setup was VERY easy, and I already had propane tanks that are used for the grill. It needs to be started up early in the season. It is nearly noiseless, and operating perfectly on what seems to be very little propane. Although I'll be updating so you can use this review as part of your decision making for this investment, I do want to share the experiences of my neighbor, who also has the Mosquito Magnet. They have had it for over one season, and had some problems. She kept getting an error light, but was able to troubleshoot it using online support. She said she would not have purchased it if she knew she would be plagued with error messages. She hasn't cranked her older unit up yet, but I'll be including her experiences in my updates. I have it at 4 stars now, as it was easy to install, lets see if it loses those stars in a few weeks!EDIT MAY 26th 2011: One bottle of propane down, and another lure later...not very many skeeters caught. Perhaps I'll try changing location. I spoke more with my neighbor who has one, and much of her problem is blowing it clean when it gets restarted in the spring. More to come in a week or so....EDIT 6/14/2011....The net bag is filled with skeetos! NO other insects, which is VERY nice. So, as a conclusion to this review...This product worked for me. If you think you can set it up and forget about it, you will be disappointed. You may have to move it around to find the best spot in your yard. A few times I checked it only to find it had stopped running. Turning it off for a few seconds and turning it back on took care of that problem. It is expensive to buy, and expensive to run. We have spent about $25-30 this month in propane and the needed lures. Still, it is cheaper and safer than having a service come and spray. MUCH safer. For us, because we entertain outside, it is worth it. While it isn't going to make your yard mosquito free, it will reduce the numbers significantly. My neighbor recently ordered a new cord as hers got lost. It was $50, but it's nice to know they can help with any bits you need. It seems like the company responded to the reviews about poor customer service. If the rest of the summer goes smoothly, we may consider upgrading units next year, that is how happy I am.
B001P82AHW I have heard wonderful things about CO2 mosquito traps so I was thrilled to give this one a try.I can't even begin to tell you how frustrating my experience has been.  We followed the instructions and kept getting blinking red lights (error notification).  We made several calls to customer service. They were friendly and helpful but nothing solved the problem.One rep suggested using a brand new propane tank.  Eager to make it work we went out and bought a new tank. That still didn't help.The unit is worthless.
B001PCRFYG I have tried many gas cans over the years and these cans are the best by far. The auto stop feature works great and it pours fast. The fuel does not leak but the locking cap can be hard to remove if you don't have a lot of strength in your hands.
B001PCRFYG Yes, this is overpriced but if you've ever overfilled your weedwhacker or lawnmower then you know you need this.  I won't happen again and it's one of those products that you just suck it up and buy because it's worth it.  Every other can I've bought has been garbage compared to this.
B001PCRFYG The average new gas can is horrible.  I was always spilling gas all over my hands and on the ground.  To me, the new gas cans are disasters in the making.But this little gas can is fabulous!  Just pull off the cover, push the little green button once before filling the generator tank, and then point it in the generator and press the green button.  The gasoline flows out quickly and without making a mess at all.  You don't even need to wear gloves.Yes, this gas can is a bit more expensive, but it's well worth the extra few dollars.  You'll save that much on gas alone, plus you won't be stinky!
B001PCRFYG Best gasoline container ever! Hands-down, seriously. I got this one and the 2 1/2 gallon. The spout is just great. I had considered getting the extension spout offered on Amazon here but glad I didn't now. For a lawnmower the spout on this is just fine for me. It's easy to hold, lightweight and the push-button spout is great!
B001PCRFYG i purchased this no spill 1 1/4 gallon tank for refilling my small 3.5 hp outboard motor.  the fill spout is outstanding and doesn't spill anything.  the short tube is perfect to go into the small fill hole in the tank.  the button could not be easier to start and stop the flow of fuel into the tank.  all of the others complaining about this unit must be impatient.  anyone can control the amount of fuel that comes out.  since the marinas do not allow storage in the dock boxes, i purchased a seal line dry bag to store this small no spill tank onboard until the day is finished.  if the yellow cap is on tight and the dry bag is sealed correctly, there is absolutely no gasoline smell in the cabin of the sailboat or car trunk on the way to and from home. the dry seal bag does its job of a perfect seal every time.  at home, of course, it does not smell out of the bag in the garage, either.  this no spill tank is a great product and refilling the small gas tank on an outboard is a snap!  a must buy for outboard motor owners.  i have used other portable gas tanks, but they were terrible.  this one will be a \"keeper\" for sure.  it is highly recommended for all portable gasoline tank uses.update:  i got tired of the poor starting 3.5 outboard, so i sold everything and got a torqeedo electric motor.  but anyone having difficulties with the no spill tank is probably doing it wrong.  it is still the best.  it is just that i don't need to smell gas anymore.the mechanic that rebuilt my \"new\" 6 month old 3.5 hp outboard carb said that this no spill tank is excellent. but, no one should keep the gas in it over a week due to ethanol in the gas making stuff that clogs up the jet in the carb.
B001PCRFYG This is my first &#34;modern&#34; gas can.  In the past, I've had the standard curved spout that you're lucky to not spill half a cup of gas just tipping the thing into your yard tools.  This can gives you perfect control for when to start the flow and you really can fill something to the brim without spilling a drop of gasoline.The flow button is pressure sensitive; the harder you push, the more gasoline flows.  This allows for fine tuning of the flow when topping something off.The 1.25 gallon size is very easy to maneuver.  I store gas in a larger 5 gallon container and then use a simple siphon pump to transfer gas into this container as needed.  All-in-all, a spill free operation!The see-through side is nifty for telling how much gas is left.  I do wonder about the durability since clearly the composition of the container is different there.  How it holds up to the heat cycles of the Texas day and night will be interesting.I love not coming into the house covered in gas fumes.
B001PCRFYG One of the best small gas cans, the spout works far better then any other ones I have purchased. It is especially great for filling in tight spots like weedeators, etc.
B001PCRFYG Expensive compared to the cheap can at the hardware store, but worth every penny.  I hope it last for a long time but so far no leaks and no over filling and spilling!  Should have bought a long time ago.
B001PCRFYG I have searched for a reasonable way to store and pour gasoline that is both CARB compliant and spill-proof. This can is the closest I have come to realizing that goal. The nozzle on this can allows good flow control, specially when transferring gas to a small gas tank (as one would find on most small engines).I am impressed! This can works! It is worth the money and time to invest in this gas can; I have no regrets about purchasing it AND I am finally happy to comply with CARB.
B001PCRFYG I have used old fashioned metal cans thru the years. Problem was when driving home from the gas station I had to hold the can so it did not flip over. Then I would constantly over fill the tank. This can will not flip over and immediately shuts off the gas at the touch of the button.
B001PCRFYG I have been using this for over 2 years now and im so happy with it that i finally decided to leave a review. I use it to keep gas in my trunk for emergencies. I never had to use it but i drive a little rough, so it gets tossed around in the trunk. So far it did not have any leaks at all. Very durable.
B001PL7XJE I am going to have to pick up more of this soon. my birds look forward to it every spring and will come to my window if my feeder is empty. This is a natural no color added food and it must be Good !
B001PL7XJE I put up our new feeder yesterday, and within hours we had 3-5 hummers visiting. Today, they were back almost the whole day long. And a month later, we're refilling the feeder (10 ounces) every two days!This nectar is affordable ... I think. I haven't worked out what a plain sugar and water solution would cost which is what I used to use in our old feeder. Now that the 5 pound bag of sugar has been replaced by a 4 pound (have you noticed?), this may well be a good value. But it's worth every penny to watch 12 hours of hummingbird antics around the feeder.I do wish that Songbird Essentials would have put the measurements with their scoop for a 10 ounce feeder. I never learned metrics, and I'm not a math whiz, but when my wife couldn't figure out that it was 1.75 measures for 10 ounces, I decided to note it here. The container gives examples of 8, 12, and 16 ounce, and here we are 1ith 10. Eight years of college down the drain.P.S. I just ordered two more.Feb. 16, 2012: We've had no winter this year and for some reason, the hummers disappeared in early January. If this happens to you, don't take down the feeder. If not in the sun and relatively cool, you can safely leave the \"nectar\" in the feeder for a week but check it every two days to be sure. And now the hummers are back in full force. I wouldn't be surprised if they don't mate early this year. If so, they'll need all the food they can find. The three males that were fighting this morning certainly needed a good lunch when they were done.Sept. 7, 2013: After a slow summer, we again have 10 or so hummers that alternately visit the three feeders every 10-15 minutes from sunrise until it's almost too dark to see them. They also love the three fuschia we planted which ultimately brings even more birds to the feeders.April 1, 2014: I've continued to order Songbird Essentials, and the hummers continue to love it. It's mating season here, and males are fighting off other males as they stake their claims to our three feeders. I only see females once or twice a day. A note to those with feeders: As the weather gets warmer (83 today and in No. California!), unless the hummers drain the feeders, this nectar will get mold and other spores faster than in cold weather. It's expensive, but you have to throw out the old, thoroughly clean the feeders, and refill them ... probably once or twice a week. It comes with the territory, but I wouldn't trade the \"show\" for anything.
B001PL7XJE This is \"for the birds\" .... hummingbirds, that is. I really like it, BUT.... It is just very fine sucrose (which is sugar). The advantage is it will dissolve in tap/warm water. No boiling water on the stove or in the microwave necessary. And, no red dye or food coloring.  The disadvantage: It's FAR more costly than using (white) table sugar. My 1 oz. scoop was buried underneath at the bottom of the can.  Good, yes, but you pay for the convenience. Oh, also.... I visited their website and watched a video. They suggest adding a piece of red ribbon to the feeder to help attract birds. I was outside doing just that, when a hummingbird flew over and startled me.
B001PL7XJE The hummers love it and it doesn't spoil fast as my homemade food did. It dilutes easily in cold water. I like no harmful colorant in it.
B001PL7XJE This is sugar. Period. If you want a perfectly acceptable hummingbird nectar, put 1 part sugar - any sugar - to 4 parts water (I usually prepare 1 cup sugar to 4 cups water)in a microwave-safe plastic container. (I use a juice bottle that has a flip-top pouring spout.) Stir it. Leave the top open or off (very important!) and put it in your microwave. When it comes to a boil, let it roll for about 30 seconds. (And, of course, you can also boil it in a saucepan on the stove.) Refrigerate it. Do not add any food coloring. It'll keep in your frig for as long as you need it. Empty, wash and refill your feeder every two or three days to prevent mold - especially when it's hot. if you do get a bit of mold, bleach will kill it quickly. Then wash the feeder, rinse well, refill and rehang. The hummers will love your simple, homemade nectar and you will have saved a TON of money.
B001PL7XJE I have to say that I am new to the world of hummingbirds.  That being said, I was fooled into thinking that I needed to purchase special \"food\" or \"sugar\" to feed the hummers.  That is not true.  After reading a number of sites deticated to hummingbirds, they all say to NOT purchase special sugar... Sugar is sugar.  Any fine ground sugar will make a great source of food.  Save your money.
B001PL7XJE We recently purchased a new-to-us home in a nicely wooded area. Within a few weeks of moving in, we realized that there were more than a few hummingbirds around... about that same time, we came across unused feeders while helping my mother clean her garage. This all seemed like the making of a fun hobby, and we have not been disappointed.We cleaned the feeders, purchased this Songbird clear hummingbird food, and set the feeder out on our front porch. This mix is easy to prepare and that is nice when we really only have a couple minutes to get-it-done as we head out to work early morning.When nothing really happened for the first few days, we were initially a bit disappointed. However, after two more days we were encouraged when we noticed that the fluid level dropped a bit.Following directions, we emptied and cleaned the feeder at week's end and then refilled it -- and that is when the nectar carnage really started! As week #2 of our feeder experience really got underway, the feeder emptied in about four days and we began to see hummingbirds coming and going at all times of the day. Guess the word got out!By the middle of the fourth week, the 16 ounce feeder was emptying every 2.5 days or so. We had wonderfully colored green, yellow, blue and kinda magenta hummingbirds flying around in singles and in pairs, and they are awesome to watch. They love this nectar, flying in to land on the feeder's perch and sipping until content, then buzzing right off. There were even times when hummers seemed to do a little battle for prime sitting position, with the 'winner' forcing the other one(s) to hover just a few inches away (im)patiently waiting for their tuns. Very interesting and beautiful to watch.It's November and night-time temperatures are dipping below freezing, and our hummingbirds seem to have migrated away now. Can't wait to get the feeders and nectar back out in the Spring and watch them frolic again.Highly recommended! Totally fascinating.
B001PL7XJE For some reason, I thought this would be a pre-mixed liquid. It's finely-ground sugar. Works very well, and they really like it.
B001PL7XJE I got this even tho I have a couple of packets of the 'red dye' type hummer food, mainlyI got this as I have only seen one Anna's hummingbird in my yard, Buzz, most of the earlyspring, I believe he lived here all winter, so will keep some out for him from now on.  The reasonI tried this is due to the fact with Buzz and maybe one/two of his girlfriends, don't eat it very fastso I can make just one cup of nectar for the feeder.  With the red dye packets, I was having to makea full quart which took forever for him to eat even if I did refrigerate most of it.  He seems to like itjust as much as any other I have put out for him and indeed, has claimed my backyard and thefeeder as his property!  5 stars from Buzz and 5 stars from me for easy to make smaller amounts,
B001PL7XJE I have 2 hummingbird feeders and use this nectar. My hummers seem to love it, I get lots of hummingbirds. It is important to pay attention to the temperature outside and how much sunlight is on the feeders. The nectar will spoil after a time (any nectar you use will), so you have to make sure to change it and keep the feeders clean. If you are nice enough to feed the hummingbirds, you should care for them properly!
B001QILPWC Akro-Mils 3 level Stack-A-Pot is a convenient way to grow herbs, strawberries and flowers in a compact space.  Each level has 3 sections, giving you a total of 9 sections.  The pot is easy to assemble.  Each layer is offset 120 degrees from the layer below.  There are small grooves on the bottom of each layer to help you line up the pots  Then, because of the connections, watering the top allows water to go to the bottom levels.  Because it is made from plastic, it is light without soil, and does not lose as much water from evaporation.I have been using my Stack-A-Pot on my deck, and it has been great!
B001QILPWC For the $34 I paid for this, I feel seriously ripped off! Impossible, from the photo to tell, but, I figured \"$34, it ought to be a LOT 'bigger' than this\"For what you get, a price of $12-13 ought to be max. There certainly is not more than $2 worth of plastic in it.Just feel deceived and led astray . . for the money, the consumer OUGHT to get a LOT more!
B001QILPWC Although this is called mini, it is not. It is larger than I expected. I cant imagine hanging it up because it would be too heavy with the soil in it. I filled all three layers. Only the top layer is sprouting plants. I worry that the lower layers will not grow.  I do rotate it daily to provide more equal sun. I will post an update if/when the botom layers start to grow.
B001QILPWC Perfect if you don't have the room and very attractive. I love it and have had a lot of compliments.
B001QILPWC There are a lot of options for this and my lovely wife is enjoying them.  Easy to water all the sections.  Just poor it in the top.
B001R1LQL8 This food includes a massive amt of thistle/niger seeds. I have very large variety of birds since I have a large platform feeder. The bottom is covered in those because NONE of my birds eat them. Not sure if poor quality or what, but I have to brush them out of the tray a few times a day. Basically you pay a lot and get junk. Going back to Wild Delight... expensive but every single bit of it is eaten so worth it.
B001R1LQL8 Well, the birds definitely liked the seed. However after filling up the feeder twice, it seemed to be the exact same kinds of birds who liked the other two brands I've tried. I didn't notice a greater influx in songbirds, but still saw lots of blue jays, cardinals, finches as well as the ever present squirrels. I did have to fill up the feeder a day earlier than usual and there was less filler in the package so that's a point in it's favor. I also liked the easy screw on cap and spout, it definitely helped with the pouring when filling up the feeder.
B001R1LQL8 I was a bit surprised that this bird seed attracted so many pretty little birds to our yard.  We've had more cardinals, but the biggest thrill is seeing so many gold finches visit us.  We still put out other seed, so we did still see blackbirds, but that's ok for us, we like to feed them all!  The squirrels and chipmunks quickly cleaned up whatever fell on the ground, otherwise we find this a lot less messy than other seeds we use. It's a great blend, although I might add that more birds means buying more bird seed, and that can get expensive.
B001R1LQL8 I can't vouch for keeping away those nasty, pesky birds that no one wants to feed because I haven't seen many this spring. There might be more of those that come around in the fall or summer months...so I will update my review if anything changes.We put this seed in a hopper feeder & have had considerably less waste than with other bird seed. I just went out to check the ground around the feeder & didn't see any bird seed on the ground...so they must like all of this seed. So far house finches, cardinals, & tufted titmice along with one squirrel have visited our feeder. I'm going to try this in one of our tube feeders, too.  Because there's less waste, we aren't filling the hopper feeder as often as we do when we use other types of bird seed.  The pour spout makes filling the bird feeder much easier & should also help keep out those moths that seem to find their way into our bird food.We are nature lovers & give this seed 4 stars.  (I will update with any findings I feel are pertinent.)edited to add: we use theHeath Outdoor Products FS-1 Feed Scoop-Funnelto fill our bird feeders & sock feeders.  Sure makes everything easier & less messy.
B001R1LQL8 I can't speak for the taste, but there hasn't been a shortage of birds (and squirrels!) stopping by the feeder.The easy pour spout on the bag makes it so much easier to pour without having to use a funnel, cup or other plastic pouring device. The bag was just big enough for 2 fills of the feeder with a little left over.The one thing I noticed was there are no corn or sunflower fillers in these bags. It was berries seeds of all sizes and no sticks or other debris.
B001R1LQL8 I buy about one bag of Scott's Songbird food a month. I have 4 tube feeders and a hopper feeder. I fill one tube with the Scott's, one tube with sunflower seeds and the rest with Pennington Premium Wild Bird Seed. Everything is positioned so that I can watch the birds gather and feed while I'm working at the desk at my front window. I started putting seed out for humanitarian reasons: the winter coming and my sympathy for anything out there dressed in nothing more than feathers. I've never been much of a bird watcher before, but now can understand the fascination one develops for these beautiful, sometimes colorful or fancifully marked creatures. They don't even have to sing to make me happy. The tube with the Scott's seed is the one I have to refill on a daily basis. The others, every other day. It's funny to watch a few birds land on the feeding perches and suddenly realize, whoops, this isn't the songbird food. They all try to get a place on the tube with the Scott's in it (even when that big fat catbird is sitting on top scowling at them).
B001R1LQL8 Since I am not a bird, I figured the best way to review Songbird Selections Colorful Bird Seed was to go directly to the source. I pulled out my smartphone and went straight to Twitter to see what the birds in my yard were tweeting about.@BobWhite tweets: delicious, I love all the crunchy sunflower seeds.@RobinRedbreast: Yummmy! Steve's birdfeeder has the best food.@BlueJay: I love how easy it is for Steve to fill the feeder with the handy spout.@Chickadee: Songbird is my favorite food. All the best dressed and most colorful birds hang out wherever it is served.@CanaryYellow: I'm never going back to regular food again. I'll search every feeder until I find Songbird Selections Colorful Bird Seed.So, there you have it folks. The results are in and all the most colorful and beautiful birds seem to favor Songbird Selections. Although it is a bit more expensive than generic bird seed the birds in my yard seem to truly favor it. They emptied their birdfeeder in just 4 days. It usually takes more than a week using store-brand seed. If the birds are happy and tweeting, then I'm happy too.
B001RCTX4E My husband ordered this for his Orbit tripod, works great and adds the height he was looking for to cover more ground.  He's always looking for extra help when it comes to yard work.
B001RCTX4E Covers about a 30' radius mounted in the ground.  Covers almost my entire back yard when mounted on top of a six foot landscaping pole.  Quiet.  Very low water impact.  So little force is imparted to the water than the birds play in the spray all day.
B001RCTX4E Using this for watering a large garden - plop it in the middle, wait an hour so so, then head back to check it out.  Works very well:  stays upright, keeps spinning, distributes water well, and doesn't show any signs of falling apart after a month of usage (including moving it around and sticking it in place repeatedly.)Even works well for kids playing in, since you can raise/lower the sprinkler part from about 2 feet to almost 3 feet.Overall, a great sprinkler...would recommend; would buy it again.
B001RCTX4E This sprinkle says it covers a 50 foot diameter circle, and it does. I like the way the water falls like a rain shower.Sometimes I sit under the sprinkler in my nude-ness. The neighbors love me.
B001RCTX4E For me, this is the ultimate sprinkler for garden and lawn.  It spikes easily into the ground and can be raised to a height of about 3 feet.  This puts it ABOVE the height of most garden plants.  There are three revolving arms on the brass sprinkler head which rotate when water is connected and turned on.  It covers a broad area when extended to its full height.  The watering is in fine droplets and works good for most environments.  In hot arid enrironments, significant evaporation will occur when using this system and perhaps a soaker hose is a better solution.  I had one of these for about 10 years before it finally quit working, so it is a durable sprinkler as well.  I just bought another.  I recommend custom making a length of hose about 30 feet long and connecting it to the sprinkler pole.  The hose should have a valve on it which then allows the operator to turn the sprinkler on and off and move it without having to go to the water spigot.  Here is the one-way valve:Gilmour Brass Garden Hose Connector With Shut-Off Valve 03Vkone
B001RCTX4E Prior to this purchase, I bought a &#34;decorative&#34; sprinkler which lasted only two years before major leaks made it inoperable.  This sprinkler appears to be much better constructed.  Hopefully, Orbit has no quality control issues with their Chinese manufacturers - Orbit has a good, longstanding reputation to maintain (I hope).
B001RD7LRO Seriously, how did i get by without this!  The slight bend on the blade definitely helps get more teeth on the branch.  Only need few strokes to cut through any branch.  I've cut through from an inch or so to several inch branch without any issues.  The blade folds into the handle to keep it from dulling and cutting through your tool box.Love it!
B001RD7LRO I love this portable pruning saw.  It cuts effortlessly and it's easy to carry around the yard.  I own a larger Corona Saw for large tree limbs, and the excellent quality is the same.
B001RD7LRO I have the non-folding version of these which are great, but climbing a tree with it was scary and dangerous.  With this folding unit I can put it in my pocket folded up to climb up safely, then unfold and trim after finding a stable place in the tree.
B001RD7LRO I bought this to replace another folding saw that rusted after several years of use.  So far this one seems like a great deal, it cuts fast and cleanly and seems quite sturdy.  My only complaint is that it doesn't shut cleanly, you have to really aim the blade when you fold it or it gets stuck on the soft black part of the handle.  Not a major issue but something you should be careful of since it doesn't lock if you don't get it fully folded.
B001RD7LRO Easy to open and close. Well engineered and quality product. SHARP!!!Cuts through a two inch diameter doug fir in 5 seconds. The blade is thin but strong. As long as you don't try to push it through wood it's plenty thick enough. Fits easily
B001RD7LRO hello,i had a very old hand saw that stayed sharp for about 20 years of service.  one day, i cracked the tip off and it somehow got lost in the rubble.  i ordered this new hand saw and it is better made than my old saw.  the blade is super sharp and cuts through any size item.  you can't go wrong with this hand saw.  well built, better safety features, easy to use, and more comfortable to hold while working.  if this lasts as long as the other one, then i will be totally impressed.  great product and service.
B001REDIZ2 The spikes are a quite convenient form of fertliiziling because they release over time. It is important to constantly feed tomatoes and this makes it easier.
B001REDIZ2 Had good luck with these. No brainer in terms of ease of use ( plug and play ) affordable and recommended.
B001REDIZ2 This product is working great my tomatoes are bigger and better then ever I do recommend this product and I am only recommending it because I am currently using it and I am keeping video and picture journals of every day growth and so far my tomatoes have grown every day and I cannot help but think this is one of the reasons.
B001REDIZ2 I grow tomatoes out of containers. I have been kind of experimenting with different fertilizers to use for containers. So far I have used these in four containers and the tomatoes seem to be doing great. I also used the same soil I did last year to see if they would still grow in them again. I know i have been told they won't, but mine has. Maybe it is because of Jobe's or could just be the soil. Either way I would recommend using this product. Very cheap in price and probably the easiest of the fertilizers to use. Just stick them in the ground and leave them be.
B001REDIZ2 This is the first year I have tried these stakes and also the first year my Sweet 100 Cherry tomato plants have ever been over 6' tall!  I guess they are working.  Package instructions state to use two stakes for each plant, not something that was clear in the product description when I ordered them.  Will be ordering again next year.
B001REDIZ2 These I put them last year and they were still present in my garden. Just picked them and threw them. Not sure what the contents are, and even if it is a slow release these are supposed to make the tomato plants healthier. Did not see anything....
B001SXUUVW I didn't expect Amazon to be able to come close to box stores for this product given the weight. But to my surpise the price was competative on Amazon and I found a base I liked better. I think the look in person is better than pictures; nice pattern, nice weathering.It is also heavy and easy to put together. You WILL want to use pliers or a wrench to tighten the bottom bolt. No way by hand you will get it near tight enough. Is it going to keep the umbrella up during the high winds I get in Texas? No. But I doubt any base would. You need to know when to take the umbrella and lay it down. But for any wind where I would still want to be outside enjoying an umbrella, it will do just fine. Recommended.
B001SXUUVW Its heavy and solid and looks great!! I think it will compliment any umbrella.  I like how you get the adapters rings to fit any umbrella with it.
B001SXUUVW We have this base set up at the bottom of a table.  The umbrella goes through the table top, through another hole in the bottom legs, and then into this base.  Thus, the base is not really keeping the umbrella upright.  It is just holding it down.  I would not use this as a freestanding base.  It would easily topple over - maybe just with the weight of the umbrella (if tilted).Assembly was easy and it looks just like the photo.  It is not metal, but some type of cast stone - like a fine concrete.  The whole thing weighs about 20 pounds.  Be aware that the base adds a few inches to the height of your umbrella.
B001SXUUVW 5 Stars for the Umbrella Base, 1 Star for Amazon Warehouse Deals. I love the umbrella base, it matches my table perfectly. The only problem I have with this purchase is that I purchased it from Amazon Warehouse Deals. This is definitely a case of you get what you pay for. The base arrived with missing parts, and a broken knob. I'm not sure I'd purchase from Amazon Warehouse Deals again. It's not a deal if you don't get all the parts.
B001SXUUVW THe base arrived in great condition and was a really great buy for the money.  BUT the screw that tightens around the base of the umbrella did not tighten and I had to have my contractor work  it for about 20 minutes till it was threaded properly.  It works now but still gives a bit of a problem.
B001SXUUVW Looks good; seems to be well made.  Not much else to say; its a stand and it works.  I like the design as well.
B001SXUUVW I am very satisfied with this product because it is extremely sturdy. We had many major storms with high winds and this stand never toppled even with the umbrella attached. Very impressive...
B001SXUUVW It's heavy but the base is not large enough to prevent tip overs.  I should have take some of the suggestions from other reviewers.  It's best to get as large as a base as possible.  For the price though it is okay.
B001SXUUVW This base looks great and is heavy enough (44 lb.) to solidly anchor the umbrella (TropiShade 9-Feet Bronze Aluminum Polyester Market Umbrella), which is free standing with no other support.  Held up well during several strong winds, but be sure to close the umbrella and tie it tightly to minimize the effect of the wind.
B001T4WJKU As they say: \"So far, so good\". . . it might be a little early to be 'rating' this, as every other hose nozzle I have bought in the last two years has malfunctioned (leaked, quit) even though I liked them to start with. I bought this because, while it did have a couple of bad ratings, the preponderance of ratings were high. Time will tell. I DO like the fact that it has several more 'settings' than others I have owned.
B001T4WJKU if this product is out of stock it should say so to not waste my time. Is it coming from China? why two months to ship???? WTF?
B001T4WJKU I have had two of these now but both have come apart after about 6 months and can't be reassembled.
B001T4WJKU This nozzle looks like a dozen others offered at your hardware store, but for some reason this is the one to get. Maybe they asked the factory in China to use better materials and tighter specs. In any case, this is the one that works. This is the one that does not leak or break. By the way, bought this in 2011.Update: May 2014: Still works. Still not leaking.
B001T4WJKU I give this 4stars as I have to have a longer use period to give a 5 star rating. Worked excellent for one full season. So now Im on the second season and the thing starting leaking between the hose and the sprayer. I thought well here we go now a battle with ray padula and his customer support team or lack of it. So I turn off the water at the faucet and remove the  sprinkler completely then reattach sprinkler tight as I can then turn on water at faucet and no leaks and I gave it a good workout too. So maybe the issue might be to leave the sprinkler on the hose and not keep removing it as I have done. So If I discover any problems down the road I will update but for now I have to recommend this product.Update-- This sprinkler started leaking in the second summer of use . After getting ahold of the Ray Paduka company. They said yes they would replace it but it might take a month to get it . Who would want to wait that long. Forget it ,, what a comeon this is doesnt quite come up as false advertizing but I sure wouldnt recommend doing business with this guy.
B001T4WJKU These guys advertise 15 year warranty but they don't answer the phones or emails.I have a wand that broke in one season.I thought if I pay a little more I could get good quality.....NOT.
B001T4WJKU Used it for the first time this morning - cannot believe the difference between this and the other (supposedly)efficient nozzles.  The stream setting is perfect to reach spots not easily accessible, and all the other settings are equally fine.  Thumb lever is so simple;  why didn't someone figure this out years ago??
B001TRELMQ I must confess that my initial attempt to put this together was a miserable failure. The end product LOOKED like a H-bird feeder but it was leaking like a sieve - and this where a star goes away because meaningful assembly instructions are largely missing. Well... a couple of days later my wife took over and... it worked. It took the birds only a few hours to notice it and, ever since, they've been all over it, sometimes 3 or 4 flying around and our kids love watching them.To make the long story short: it's not exactly a 'high end' feeder, the materials are cheap, it looks cheap if you care about the looks but it holds its water well and the Hummingbirds seem to appreciate. We've replaced the sugar-water several times already and nothing broke yet.
B001TRELMQ This feeder has worked very well for me.  The \"push-pull\" feature really helps keep sugar water from sloshing all over when filling and carrying the feeder to its hanging spot, and it negates the need to flip the feeder to hang it, which, with my \"classic\" Perky Pet feeder, always causes the nectar to spurt and spill.  It holds more nectar than we need, which would be a big advantage in a location where there were more hummingbirds; I usually just fill it partway.  I haven't had any of the leaking problems reported by others, although nectar will spill out of the ports if it sways too far or tips (as when a big bird lands on it).  However, every hummingbird feeder of this design (bottle screwed onto feeding-port disk) I've ever had does that.  All in all, I think this feeder is a very good value for the price.
B001TRELMQ This is a very cute hummingbird feeder. It's extremely easy to assemble and add the liquid (you have to mix your own, not included with the item). I only had it up for a few days but I haven't had it leak yet.Sadly, so far, I haven't had any hummingbird visitors but the item does brighten my patio decorations.
B001TRELMQ Other feeders I have had have been smaller than this one. One nice thing about the size if that you don't have to fill it as often. The bold, bright red and yellow colors on this feeder quickly let every humingbird in town know where to find dinner. We have it on a hook in front of a window at our house, so the kids and the cat can watch for them. Since it's on a hook and not in a tree, we haven't had any problems keeping it level, therefore no issues with leaking.The tips and ideas posted in the other reviews on here are very much worth reading. Many have gone through a lot of trial and error and have found the best ways to make this feeder work for each location you may want to place it. You will find this invaluable if your feeder also does not come with any instructions (like mine).
B001TRELMQ The hummingbirds in our backyard are happy again!  We took a break from hummingbird feeders after the last couple proved too difficult to fill without the sticky nectar spilling all over the place.  The Perky Pet Top-Fill Push-Pull Hummingbird Feeder makes that process virtually mess-free with just a few easy steps.Simply unscrew the red top and pour in the nectar to almost overflowing, then quickly replace cap in order to form a nice, air-tight seal.After hanging the plastic feeder in the desired location, you then open the reservoir by gripping the base with one hand while pulling up on the nectar receptacle (think sports drink bottle), allowing the nectar to fill up the magnolia flower ports.  So it's push to fill/pull to feed and you're done--with no trail of splattered nectar to clean up or a bunch of pieces to have to reassemble.
B001TRELMQ This hummingbird feeder is so easy to clean and fill. A thousand times better than the old kind I had. You just lock up the ports by pushing up on the bottom, take it in the house unscrew the top scrub out the container, refill. Take it outside hang it and pull down on the bottom to open the ports again. No mess. Highly recommend.
B001TRELMQ I was eventually able to get this set up and working as it is supposed to. I do have hummingbirds and they did come and feed from it, so I can say that it does work as intended. It looks interesting and people almost always ask what it is. If there was a way to stop ants from invading it, that would be great (not sure if they deter the hummingbirds). Now, since I received this as a Vine product to review, I am going to assume what they are shipping to customers comes with nicer packaging and instructions, because the one I got was just thrown in a shipping box with no instructions or anything. I had to go online to read instructions. However, even after reading the written instructions online, I have to admit I could not figure out how to activate the feeder. It was not intuitive that you need to pull the clear plastic bottle assembly up from the flower base to get the liquid to flow to the flower feeders. I only figured it out after seeing one of their videos.
B001TRELMQ I got this for my parents, who are building a cabin in N.C. and already have several other hummingbird feeders hanging from the roof of their back porch.They say this feeder works very well and attracts hummingbirds. They actually have another that's almost identical, but without the yellow centers of the 'flowers' like this one has.For some reason, hummingbirds in their area prefer RED feeders. They also prefer RED / pink fluid in them. I think my parents are going to trash their older feeder and use this one in conjunction with another newer all-red feeder. I don't know why, but the hummingbirds just seem to like drinking red nectar from a red feeder.Not sure if this applied beyond the mountains in N.C. but it may be useful info, so I figured I'd pass it on.Anyway, this is a nice feeder and definitely works... if you're thinking of a) starting a hummingbird 'hobby' or b) supplementing / replacing your current feeder with this one, I recommend.
B001TRELMQ I have had many different kinds of hummingbird feeders through the years.  Most of them were the kind where you unscrew the glass or plastic bottle and turn it upside down to fill.  The fill hole on them was small, so I had to use a funnel to pour in the sugar and water.  This hummingbird feeder works fine for me.  I like how you can unscrew the top without taking the rest of the feeder apart to fill it.  It's a nice, wide opening, so it's easy to pour in the nectar.  And it's also much easier to clean out the inside of the bottle as well.The push/pull and open/close part is so you can fill it from the top so that the nectar will not pour out through the holes in the bottom.  Once the top is screwed back on, you pull the bottle up to let the nectar flow down and create a vacuum in the bottle (so it all doesn't just pour out through the holes).  It doesn't leak if the bottom halves are screwed tight, and the hummingbirds certainly don't care how it gets filled.Make sure you clean the feeder and change the nectar about once a week in hot weather.  The nectar will ferment, which is not good for the birds.
B001TRELMQ This is a really nice hummingbird feeder for the money. It's plenty large enough, any larger and the sugar water will go bad before it's used. It is really easy to fill and it doesn't leak. I think it looks very nice and most importantly the hummingbirds love it. The hummingbirds visit all day long and I love watching them. They are amazing little creatures. The instructions are a little short but it's not very difficult to figure out.Sure there are more expensive feeders but this is nice and it gets the job done. I would consider it a good buy.
B001TRELMQ Since this is a Vine review, I want to make clear that I'm reviewing this product based on its price.  Today, that's $11.  I've got a few hummingbird feeders, all of which are in the $5-15 range.  This feeder is better built.These things are not complicated.  You fill them with water and sugar (4:1, IMO), or some kind of special fluid, and you lift the large clear section to open flow for hummingbirds (and wasps, btw).  This is a sturdy and very attractive design.  I like that the base is all one piece and the quality of the material.My local hummingbirds approve of this feeder, too, favoring it over the others around.  Even though there are several, I saw one get very territorial about this one this morning, too.To sum it up, you don't want to spend too much on something like this, because it's quite simple.  But you do want something that can take weather, UV rays, hundreds of trips up and down from its hook.  I think this is a strong value for the price, and will be replacing my others with this model when they break.
B001TRELMQ I've never had a hummingbird feeder before, but I thought I'd try this one.  The design is cute, with the red/clear outer shell and the flower-shaped \"perches\".The design seems prone to leaking if you don't form the vacuum seal required to keep the nectar inside from leaking out through the flower sections, but the design also allows for easy cleaning.For the price, this is a cute innovative hummingbird feeder.
B001TRELMQ Perky-Pet makes a fine product.  Ask any of the 10 or so visitors we have each year.  Wait you cannot do that now since most of them have made their way back to Mexico to enjoy their summer.  Come spring time, however, there will be constant visits to the 6 stations and soon to be 7 or more.  I cannot tell if they will like this iteration of a hummer feeder due to receiving it when there is no traffic for them here, but the Perky-Pet products that hang during the season we should be refilling this one as often as the others.Upon arrival I noticed several issues that could be a problem during that season.  The plastic material used for the liquid might not be suitable for them unless it is a plastic that they like.  Sounds weird, I know, but some of the previous plastic containers were not suitable for this batch of hummers and ended up in the land fill.  The top fill may or may not be of value.  I'll address that issue in the spring but for now it is not of significance since all the others are bottom filled.  The 4 foot stands on the bottom of the feeder are at first glance fragile unless built of a stronger plastic.  Even though the normal hummer's weight is slight and in the one to two gram size, the constant use might render the foot stand useless.  They do not care, however.  Even when the foot stands are in tact some prefer to hover when feeding.Regardless of any unknown factors, they will be back in the spring and at that time I will upgrade this review with facts and not assumptions based on many years of use.
B001TRELMQ My experience with this product isn't quite as bad as some reviewers have had, but I don't think I could ever recommend buying it.Like others, I was totally unable to figure it out based on the \"instructions\" printed on a sticker on the bottom of the feeder. After trying for a while, I came to this site to write a scathing review, but instead watched the (incredibly annoying) instructional video on this page. Then I tried again, making sure that the bottom piece of the reservoir was fully tightened and the feeder was in the closed position before filling. This time, success! there was liquid (I used water to test it) available through the ports, but it wasn't pouring out the crack between the two pieces of the base. The concept *does* work, despite my initial bafflement.That said, I agree with those who have noted that it will leak if it's not level. It doesn't seem to need to be totally and completely level -- a gentle breeze would likely result in the leaking of a few drops or less -- but it certainly seems like a strong wind would result in serious spillage. Also, even with the top snapped down to the shut position, if there's already nectar in the base (as there presumably will be every time after the first filling), it likely will spill as you're taking it down to refill it. Since non-spillage seems to be the major innovation of this design, it definitely misses the mark.I don't think there's such a thing as a \"perfect\" hummingbird feeder on the market, but given the flaws of this one and the positive reviews for other models -- and the fact that at this moment Perky Pet's highest rated feeder is only a buck more than this one -- I'd skip this one in a hummingbird's heartbeat.
B001TRELMQ I was anxious to attract these glorious and wonderful birds to my porch so I thought this would be a good item for that.  1st of all, the instructions were very sketchy and I had to go to the internet to get more information on how to set up a hummingbird feeder....I didn't even know what to feed them, as no food was included or instructions re: the same.  I knew that it was some type of sugar solution, so I found a \"recipe.\"  I also was one that noticed the liquid leaked out of this, which was very distressing, but I left it up anyway.  After a few days, I noticed one hummingbird, but he/she only came a few times and then lost interest in the little bit of liquid that remained...maybe couldn't get to the nectar??I had also placed it on a windy porch, and with being such lightweight, flimsy plastic, it fell off and broke one day, having been attached only with a little hook that came with it.Not a good experience, and I think next time I will go with a more quality, heavier model that will last.
B001TRELMQ I agree with the majority of the other reviews. This feeder initially seemed easier to use due to the twist-off top fill. However, it is very cheaply made and fragile and does not hold up well. It is a fine art to get it to the \"just right\" spot so that it doesn't leak and even then it sometimes still does.Better off to spend more money on a more sturdy, better constructed feeder (I like the glass bottle type the best, despite it being a bit of a pain to fill - at least it doesn't leak out or evaporate quickly.Pass this one up.
B001TRELMQ This feeder works great so far!  I haven't had any problems with it leaking as other people have mentioned.  I found it incredibly easy to fill and clean.  I love how it remains closed for me to carry it outside, then I pop it open and hang it.  Simple!  I noticed that there are a lot of moving parts in the feeder and hope that it holds up over time.  Also, I do make sure everything is tightened up before I place it outside.  I have had many feeders that leak and this one hasn't yet. Yay!Many hummingbirds nest in my yard so it is important to me to have a good feeder through the winter months.  For a price of around ten bucks, this feeder has done it's job and not broke the \"bank\".
B001TRELMQ The Perky-Pet Magnolia Hummingbird Feeder looks, at first glance, like a great feeder. Similar to many modern hummingbird feeders on the market, it's plastic, so it's light-weight. It has perches for the hummingbirds to sit on.However, we've been feeding hummingbirds for twenty years now, so we've tested a wide variety of feeders. When we put this feeder out, we put it into a spot which was getting a swarm of hummingbirds. We also put one of our normal, plastic hummingbird feeders near it.The hummingbirds would examine this - but absolutely refuse to use it. They went to the other one.We switched locations. Again, they refused to use this one. They'd try it out, try to stuff their beaks into the holes, and give up. They'd go back to the other one which was easier to use.Finally we removed the other feeder so they were forced to use this one. They might sip for a second or two - and then they'd take off. Yes - they will GO to it. But they won't actively USE it as much as they use the other feeders.We didn't have any problems with leakage. That normally happens if you don't fill and seal a feeder properly so the vacuum isn't formed. So it's not that leakage was a problem. It's that the tiny hole shape was one the hummingbirds disliked. Also, I think the \"cute\" leaves on the perches make it harder for them to land.There are so many other awesome hummingbird feeders on the market that are lightweight, plastic, and that hummingbirds adore. I just don't see any reason to use this. We experimented with it for two solid months during prime hummingbird season. The hummingbirds voted with their wings. They wanted nothing to do with this one.Normally we give away old feeders we aren't using any more, so friends can use them. This one, sadly, is going in the trash. I wouldn't want to subject anybody to the poor results this one gives, given how many great feeders are out there.We purchased this feeder with our own funds.
B001TRELMQ I only received this hummingbird feeder yesterday, but I have already cooked up a fresh batch of hummingbird food and filled the feeder.  I'm not sure why others were having so much trouble with it leaking all the food out overnight.  I watched the video on Amazon about how to fill the feeder by first pushing the food holding container down until it pops into the lower part where the hummingbirds feed from.  Then fill it to the top, screw the lid back on and carry it outside to where you want to hang it.  Then pull the food container up until it pops (you can easily feel it) and the liquid food fills the lower part of the feeder.  Make sure you have tightly screwed the two parts of the lower half together or else your food will run all over the place.  Maybe that's where some mistakes were made, I don't know.  But it's working great for me.What I especially like about this feeder over other feeders I've had in the past is that the hummingbirds can sit on the little red stems in front of the flowers while they feed.  They don't have to keep flying and feeding unless they want too.  I like to watch them land on the feeder and relax while they drink up the nectar I have prepared for them.  If you want to make your own hummingbird nectar it's very easy.  Just remember it's one part sugar (regular ole table sugar) to 4 parts of water.  I make about 8 cups at one time and store the rest in the refrigerator.  It's not red, but I like it clear and I think it's better for the birds not to have food coloring added.This feeder is bright red, a good size to handle and I can see nothing to complain about.  If I drop it I don't have to worry about the glass jar breaking like what happened to one of my other feeders.  I'd buy it for sure at this price.
B001TRELMQ First and foremost, if you read the instructions, this feeder works extremely well. The bottom section should be screwed on tightly. Filling is simple -- just make sure you have the container pushed down. Then pull out after it's filled and the nectar flows easily.I have three hummingbird feeders in the backyard. This is the easiest to refill and the hummingbirds seem to prefer it over the others. In fact, they fight over it. One day after I refilled it, I was out on the patio pulling the sections apart. A impatient hummingbird started feeding while I was still holding the feeder in my hands. He even sat on the little perch just inches from my face.Which brings up another point. Neither of my other feeders has a perch. The hummingbirds really seem to like the perches and about a third of the time, they actually use the perches while feeding. Who knew they didn't always want to hover while feeding?I've added a photo up above of one of my happy hummingbirds.
B001TRELMQ I have used many feeders in my yard and sold many more at my job in the lawn & garden department. And I have seen some bad feeders, more art object than feeder, but this is without doubt the worse feeder I have ever seen and used. It has taken me several tries to keep it full and even then when the wind blows, it leaks.The whole point to this feeder is that it is supposed to be easier to use, but it is far more complicated than it needs to be. Just look at the instructions above, I have never seen a feeder so complicated.To use it correctly;You must make sure every section is screwed as tight as possible.You must fill it completely fullYou must pull out the base to create a vacuumAnd you must hang it perfectly levelIf any of these fail, it will leak out all of the feed. The primary problem is the base unscrews into two parts for cleaning. If there was a rubber gasket between these, it would seal up much better.My advice is to avoid this product and go with the classic style feeders.
B001TRELMQ I suppose it's okay for a kid's project or something that you don't display proudly.  It's just so cheaply made, looks cheesy, bad plastic and it leaks.  It's only worth a couple dollars, if that. Invest in something a bit more higher quality and buy something you will enjoy looking at.  The entire nectar process, filling 
B001TRELMQ The instructions for this hummingbird feeder were vague, so I'm so glad that some of the other reviewers pointed out the important things, like filling this up completely to create a vacuum and keeping it level. I had initially only filled it half-way and ended up sadly watching all of the nectar leak out as I sat in my office waiting for the hummingbirds to come. It still leaks a little bit since it's hard to keep it level when it's hanging, but I finally have hummingbirds which my daughter and cat really enjoy watching.
B001TRELMQ Great little feeder - our hummers LOVE it!! It is a bit tricky, though. The base is made of 2 parts that twist together just below the flowers (for easy cleaning). The seal MUST be tight or it WILL leak. Problem is, the top part of the base can turn as you tighten the clear bell part on, loosening the seal. Just be aware of that and practice with plain water a couple of times and you'll be fine. We had a larger model of this same kind (that got stolen!!) and to refill, we've learned not to bother trying to fill from the top; just take it apart and give it a good cleaning (which you really want to do anyway to prevent bacteria buildup). The fact that the base opens is a good thing because it lets you get to every part of the feeder. We've had to toss otherwise perfectly good feeders because we couldn't get into the reservoir to clean them. (Beware of black slime! It's not good for your hummers...afaik.) The design of the flowers doesn't let rain in too easily, so we don't worry about diluted syrup. This feeder easily straps to a deck rail. Have fun!
B001TRELMQ I really WANTED to like this hummingbird feeder -- it is very cute, with vivid colors and an attractive design, and would (visually) be a welcome addition to anyone's backyard.However, I am finding it very difficult to IMPOSSIBLE to keep from leaking.  First of all, the one I received came with NO instructions!  But I looked the instructions up that the company provided online,Then I made the correct sugar/water mixture (you don't need to buy any \"hummingbird nectar\" mix - just Google \"how to make Hummingbird nectar\" and you'll find the simple recipe: 1/4 CUP SUGAR MIXED WITH 1 CUP WATER.  (Do NOT use honey.) The mix just contained added food coloring to make it pink.My mother and I thought we had it correctly set it up according to the (slightly confusing) directions, and it seemed fine.  Then a few hours later, we looked outside, and it only had a inch of liquid left!  This was not because of a huge convention of hungry hummingbirds...it had leaked all over the ground below.With some adjusting and readjusting, we did manage to get it to hold in the liquid once -- but every other time it leaked out nearly all of the nectar within a few hours.  (We can't figure out what we did \"right\" that one time, either!)Summary:PROS:- Cute design- My dog really, REALLY enjoyed lapping up the leaked sugar water from the deck below the feeder!- We did get it to hold the liquid in ONCE (but cannot figure out what we did right that time!)CONS:- LEAKS LIKE CRAZY!- Missing instructions- Confusing instructions obtained from the company- Cheap, almost \"brittle\" plastic for the clear container (the red parts are a bit nicer)-- I think it would break easily.- My dog is now a sugar addict from drinking the leaks.  ;-)I would not recommend this item for ANYONE to buy!  This feeder is either poorly designed, or there's no quality control at the factory (which is why some people seem to have gotten one that worked well.)Steer clear of this and go for a feeder with higher reviews!
B001TRELMQ I've never owned a hummingbird feeder before, but I found this Perky Pet Hummingbird Feeder very easy to use.  I just fill it with a 1:4 mixture of sugar and water and the hummingbirds come.  There are little vine perches next to each plastic flower.  Some people might not like that, because the birds end up resting on them to feed instead of hovering.  I think it's just as well to make life a little easier for the little guys.  They obviously prefer perching to hovering.The only difficulty I have is making sure all the screw on parts are tight.  It's easy to inadvertently loosen one piece while tightening another.  The push-pull feature makes it simple to fill and prevent spilling.  I haven't had any problems with leakage.Cleaning is a cinch.  It all comes apart so everything can be scrubbed inside and out.  The plastic doesn't rust and there is no glass to worry about.So far, so good.  I have this hanging off our fence but the ants and the bees haven't found it yet.  Even though it's plastic, it is attractive.  I think I'll go out and buy a shepherd's hook for it to show it off better.  It's a lovely little feeder._____________________UPDATE:  The ants finally found my feeder, and then they wouldn't leave it alone.  I boughtPerky Pet Ant Guardand now all is well.  The hummingbirds love my feeder and they are a joy to watch.______________________UPDATE:  I wanted a quick and easy way to wash the feeder (I'm lazy).  Just want to let you all know it doesn't melt in the dishwasher.  My hummingbird feeder sparkles.
B001TRELMQ I've been feeding hummingbirds for years and I'm always on the look out for good, easy to fill and clean feeders. I think this one fills that bill.  I like that the top comes off as well as the bottom so you can clean all the way through.  It holds a good amount of liquid and the hummingbirds took to it right away.  I had two drinking from it within 30 minutes.  So if they're happy, I'm happy.  Only negative is the little perches will probably not last very long and I'm not sure how long the base will snap perfectly onto the upper part.  Still, it seems to be a good design.
B001TRELMQ Unlike other reviewers, I have not experienced leaks on this feeder and have had no other problems with it. I've used various Perky Pet feeders in the past (I keep around 5 hummingbird feeders throughout my garden) and this company's products have always been reliable and well made. It is easy to fill and secures tightly. My lacking star is just due to the fact that I don't particularly like the look of this one - it is very short and squatty in design. But I'm sure the hummers don't mind that.
B001TRELMQ ***** Update 5/21/13 *****I received a new unit, Perky Pet Model 210P, from Woodstream after I called their 800 number and reported this unit defective. They offered to replace it with a new unit of the same kind, but I asked if I could get something else since this design seemed so poor. They acknowledged that the 120TF has more issues than their other models and that they could make this change for me. SO, I received the more expensive 210P and I have to say it is just great. The food doesn't leak out. It has a glass vs. plastic reservoir which I believe will last longer. As a result, I would buy this brand, but avoid this model, the 120TF, and go for the 210P, which is also available on Amazon. The 210P doesn't have the \"push/pull valve feature\" but my experience is that this is more trouble than help. The 210P is more \"old school\" in its design, but is by far the better feeder. *****The up front review of this item is that my sample was non-functional and that I'm kinda stunned that the manufacturer would send a Vine reviewer something this obviously bad. I guess this speaks to the authenticity of the program in that this must have been a random unit pulled out and shipped to me. It was clearly not \"cherry picked\".So, what was so bad? I carefully cleaned the unit and dried it as recommended online. BTW, there were no instructions or hummingbird food included with my sample, so I had to go online for instructions for bird food, prepping the feeder, etc. After the feeder was dry, I re-assumbled it and made sure all parts were fitting as tightly as they can. I closed the feeder valve and opened the top to load it with my homemade \"nectar\" (=1 cup pure cane sugar stirred into 1 qt. boiled water and allowed to cool). I half filled the clear plastic reservoir and then closed the screw top lid. After hanging it in the appointed place, I carefully opened the valve to allow feeding. This allows the nectar to flow from the clear plastic reservoir to the red plastic feeding port area. Then, all the nectar started leaking out of the seam between the top and bottom halves of the red plastic feeding port (part with the plastic flowers). The top and bottoms halves of this shell have no rubber gasket or washer between then and have only a narrow plastic seam around the middle with a tiny ridge in it. This does NOT sit perfectly flush and has gaps as big as 1/32\" even after I tried to tweak it to be tight.So, it is not just an imperfect unit, in my opinion (I'm one of those truly \"Dilberted\" engineering types) it is really poorly designed. This is strange since the materials are not bad or cheap - they just had no common sense when designing this unit. It also appears that it could never have been well tested by anyone after initial design because I can't imagine that very many of these come off the line working properly. You would think the very first prototype batch would have failed so bad that they would have gone back and re-designed it.My brief online investigation shows that almost all other reviewers have had as bad an experience. So, why am I giving this horrible product two stars? The answer is the customer service. Since I'm a Vine reviewer, I always feel obligated to go another few yards (in not a mile) to see if the company will stand behind their products when one gets a clunker from them. The parent company of Perky Pet is Woodstream, and they put their toll free number on the bottom of the feeder. I called it and was channeled in non-geologic time (&lt; 5 minutes) to a friendly, US-based customer support person. They admitted that this particular unit \"had more problems reported than others\" that they make and were willing to send me a replacement. Since I believed that this would just result in getting another bad feeder, I asked if they could send me one that works better for equivalent value. YES! I quickly picked a high rated one off of Amazon, and they took my data down and committed to get it into UPS today. Wow! Very cool, very positive and upbeat response.When I get the new unit, I will report here and let you all know if the new feeder is the one to get or not.
B001TRELMQ This is a totally plastic hummingbird feeder.  But, I like that!  It's a lot lighter than our old one that was glass.  I find I can hang this one in more places and not have a sagging tree branch if I choose a small branch.It works great and we are now in the month of December and we still have hummingbirds come and feed from it.  They are so amazing and sweet!  Little magical birds...Our feeder does not leak as others have said theirs have...I'm not sure why not, but ours is working great.Over all, very happy with this.
B001TRELMQ This product doesn't come with instructions. A few lines of instructions are printed on the label which is stuck to the bottom of the product. Those instructions are hardly legible and are hard to understand.However, I have read the other reviews before beginning to use the item, so I knew how to operate it. It didn't leak because I took the precautions suggested by other users.We have a number of hummingbirds in our back yard. However, they would not go to this feeder, but rather go to the flowers in the yard. According to my wife, some of the hummingbirds occassionally visited the feeder, but the syrup in the feeder lasted quite a few weeks.I noticed that the feeder was empty last week. I am not sure if the birds consumed the liquid, or the wind just spilled everything. So, I refilled the feeder over the weekend with 1:4 solution. Feeder is still full after two days. I think the birds rather go to real flowers than come to this feeder.I think I will drain the feeder and put it for recycling.
B001TRELMQ Edited due to further experience with the feeder:  I've tried again and again to get this feeder to work properly.  After hanging it up I discovered that the feeder leaks slowly over the course of 12 hours or so.  You fill it, hang it up and it seems to be okay and then the next day the feeder is empty and there's a big water stain underneath it.  The bottom casing of the feeder needs some sort of seal to keep the contents from leaking out.Original review: This hummingbird feeder is seriously lacking for a decent set of directions on how to use it!  Written in very small print on the bottom of the feeder, the directions say to push to fill. Well it doesn't say what to push to fill and since it came out of the box with it already in the fill  position it took me a few minutes to figure out they're talking about actually pulling or pushing on the clear container that holds the nectar.  And when they say pull, they mean you really have to pull to get it to open!Once I figured out the whole push/pull thing, I filled the feeder, screwed the top on and brought the feeder out to the hanger.  Then I pulled the clear container up into the feed position and hung the feeder up.  I can see from the other reviews that a lot of people had problems with leaking but I have to say I have had no problems at all with this feeder leaking.  If you tip it once it's in the feed position it will definitely leak so I recommend not setting it in the feed position until you've hung it up.
B001TRELMQ First off let me say that I have numerous hummingbird feeders around the yard so I do know how to properly handle them.  Unfortunately no matter what I tried the darn things leaked out all of the sugar water within a half hour of putting them outside.  I would have been happy if even one had worked properly but all three being bad is such a disappointment.  My poor hummers are all confused now thinking they had some new feeders so there would be less fighting amongest them and more happy campers but alas it's not to be.  I will try this weekend if I have a chance to silicone the entire base of the units to see if that will help.  It's the only thing I can think of left to try.  If that doesn't work they will become hangers in the house with artificial flowers in them so that during the winter I can remember all my little friends that will be back with the spring flowers.  I do hope some of you have better luck than I but remember there is always an alternative use for everything.  Just have to put the thinking cap on and you'll find some way in which to use them.
B001TRELMQ The feeder separates into three basic parts: base with flowers, middle clear container, red lid. The base separates further into two pieces that can be screwed/unscrewed to clean out the compartment. This is the part that's caused all the problems for me. Even when screwed closed as tightly as possible, it does not prevent the water from leaking out. The leak is a slow drip, and with the middle container filled all the way to the top, it'll take a couple hours to empty out completely, but this is still unacceptable in my view when it leaves that much waste and mess. It leaks when it's level, and faster when it's tipped swaying in the wind. There's just no way to stop it unless you take some glue or something to seal the seam between the bottom pieces - leaving you with no easy way to clean the bottom half out.
B001TRELMQ This is my first hummingbird feeder I've owned, so I can't compare it to any others.  The instructions on the bottom of the feeder were very vague.  However, after 5 minutes of my time, and through trial and error, I figured out the problem that some of the previous reviewers were having.1.  The bottom half of the red base either was not tightened enough during the manufacturing process, or came loose during shipment.  You need to tighten the bottom half of the base by screwing it clockwise - as there is a seam there and it will leak if not tight.2.  MOST IMPORTANT:  Keep the clear section pushed down until AFTER you fill it.  (it needs to form a vacuum and it won't if you pull on it during this step).3.  Fill the clear section with nectar, and put the lid on quickly to form the VACUUM so it won't leak out the holes.4.  Hang it with the included small S-hook, and THEN carefully pull on the bottom of the feeder so the nectar can flow into the flower ports.  BUT you still need to keep the feeder level; otherwise the nectar will flow out the flower port holes.Practice first by putting water in it and you'll see what I mean.I can see where this will be very easy to clean, haven't had to yet since I just recently received it, but I anticipate no problems with it at all.  It's been hanging up for 4 hours (as of the time I wrote this review), and I already saw a pair of hummingbirds stop by for nectar, so it must attract their attention.  It's a nice low budget (all plastic) feeder, the vine perches are a cute touch.
B001TRELMQ I was a bit skeptical in trying this hummingbird feeder after reading some of the reviews here, but I'm glad I did try it. It is so easy to use. Just unscrew the top, fill it up, hang it up and pull it to open it. It doesn't get any easier than that. Yes, you need to make sure that the bottom is screwed on tightly or it will leak. The very bottom is made to come apart for cleaning it and if that is loose, it's going to leak all over. I tried mine with just plain water in it first to make sure it was all together correctly. After that, I just filled it up and put it out and watched my hummingbirds come. I like the pull to open feature on the feeder as I used to get hummingbird food running down my arm when I hung my old feeder up (it's in a high place so I have to reach up over my head). With this feeder, it was much nicer to hang it up and then pull on it to open it and I had dry, clean arms in the end. :)  It looks nice hanging on my porch and is a bit more ornate than some of the plain feeders I've had in the past. Overall, a good product that does what it says it will do, you just have to be sure to check the bottom before the first time you use it.
B001UFLIA0 One of the other reviewers here stated that the trap wasn't sensitive enough to trap the smaller, lighter animals it was designed for.  I agree.  His/her suggestion was to put a small block on top of the trap.  I used a small stone.Sadly, the bunnies around here seem to be wise to the trap.  All I got were nibbles from slugs.  Next time, bunnies.....next time.....
B001UFLIA0 This Havahart Easy Set Trap is a good choice for those needing to humanly remove small critters from their property. This is the perfect size for small rabbits and just about any sized squirrels. We also have theHavahart 1030 Live Animal Two-Door Rabbit, Squirrel, Skunk, and Mink Cage Trap, which is a somewhat larger two-door trap and is better for slightly larger pests.Using this trap is very straight forward due to the clever design of the trapping mechanism and it works reasonably well right out of the box, but it can be made more sensitive by following the advice of other reviewers and placing a 3/8\" block under the handle when setting the trap (see picture in \"Customer Images\"). Be sure to read the information on bait selection and placement, since it does need to be customized for the type of critter you are after. I like placing the main bait in hole under the trap's trigger plate.Remember that these are wild creatures and should be treated as such. Wearing gloves is a good idea when freeing the captured pest as a bite or scratch from a rabid animal can be very serious. Rabbits can inflict fairly serious wounds with their claws, especially to young children (seriously, we raised them when I was growing up).Recommended!CFH
B001UFLIA0 This trap was pretty much ready out of the box, so getting it ready for use is a breeze. The jury is still out for me because the trap hasn't actually caught anything yet. Not sure if it is the trap or the animals. We have this trap near our bird feeder. The reason we wanted the trap is because squirrels had been eating all of the food and water we were leaving for the birds and pretty much being bullies towards the birds. So, a humane trap was really appealing. I will say that we haven't had as many squirrels, but still no squirrel in the trap. Since winter is close we will keep the trap up for awhile and if anything actually gets caught I will come back and adjust my rating. In the spring we may move the trap to our raised bed garden where we have trouble with squirrels and rabbits eating the strawberries and tomatoes.
B001UFLIA0 this is the easiest trap to set that I've ever had, just flip the handle up and set it where you want it. The steel appears to be non corrosive but only time will tell. It's light weight so easy to handle. The thing I'm disappointed in, and why I only gave it 2 stars, is the fact that we've been shooting rabbits almost every night and quit doing that when we set the trap and baited it and it's been a week now and no rabbits have been caught. No squirrels either and there are plenty of them around. They're still here because you can see the damage in the garden from them. I don't know if it's just so small that they won't even try to enter it to get caught or what. We have changed the bait 3 times and you get a booklet suggesting what to use but none of it is working. A cute little trap is just a cute little trap and nothing more if it doesn't work. I have the larger size of this same brand and style trap and it catches something every single day but nothing in this one. Guess I would suggest buying this brand but in a larger size.
B001UFLIA0 I do some volunteer work for a small animal shelter and sometimes we need a trap to catch a pesky kitten or small cat. This fits the situation perfectly.Having used older, hand-me-down garage sale traps, I was really pleased to see how easy this one was to use in both catch and release modes.We used it the other day to catch a semi-feral kitten that had been abandoned. Put in a small plate of tuna and left, came back a few hours later and voila--there was the kitten, an unhappy, hissing kitten, but now safe and getting used to humans. This is the smaller of the Havahart traps, so it isn't large enough for large cats, raccoons etc., but is great for squirrels, rabbits and small cats/kittens.The following are the aspects to the trap that I find I like:a) the rounded corners on the trap body. My older traps are square and hitting them with an arm or shin hurts as the sharp corner digs in. These are rounded corners and hurt a lot less.b) The easy set up for the bait.c) the easy catch and release door.Cons:None so far!
B001UFLIA0 I picked this up for my Dad, who actually uses it as an effective & humane way to catch cats that trespass thru our yard (we raise rabbits.) This live trap is large enough to capture cats and quite possibly a raccoon & has been an effective way to protect our own critters while harmlessly catching potential-wannabe predators and either a.) returning them to their owners with an \"I told you so\" (for some reason nobody thinks their cat EVER leaves their yard.) or b.) strays are turned over to our local humane society - and they are Awesome by the way for cleaning up, giving shots & putting these animals back out for adoption.Easy to set, bait & clean up this is a great trap for dealing with a problem in a humane way.
B001UFLIA0 We already have 2 sizes of live traps so we have some experience with them.  My 77 year old mother has trouble remembering how they work so we were really happy to get this.  It's super simple.  The suitcase-like handle does everything except bait it.  You flip it one way to open and the other to shut it.  Ta-da!  She's already caught 6 squirrels in 3 days.Sometimes it seems as though the trap doesn't shut on the victim, perhaps because they are triggering it from the outside when they try to get the bait.  It works often enough.
B001UFLIA0 You know the war we face in the suburbs...Rodent Nation vs. Plants, Gardens, Bird Feeders, etc. If you have gardening aspirations, yet just can't will yourself to pull the trigger against lil' Thumper, this cage is for you. Easy to set up, you don't have to worry about losing fingers/limbs in setting the trap and no cute (yet annoyingly destructive)critters are harmed - aside from what might be a slightly traumatic period of time behind bars.This non-lethal cage is a good option for individuals with small kids around and in neighborhood settings. I don't worry about setting a trap like this in an area with a bunch of kids around - my biggest concern is kiddos grabbing a free snack.Also like the feature with this trap that you can open the door with the handle on top. I don't know about you, but I'm not a huge fan of sticking my face and hands in front of an animal (albeit small) that's been cooped up waiting for the moment of release.
B001UFLIA0 I have been using and buying havahart traps for decades and recently their designs have taking giant leaps forward. This trap is incredibly easy to set, just flip the handle. On the old traps you had to get the trip wire lined up just right with the catch. If you didn't do it right it would either trip prematurely or it wouldn't trip early enough. This new design makes all that issue a thing of the past.
B001UFLIA0 This cage is more safe to animals because of it's smooth interior, it's less likely to hurt itself. Injuries are common in cheaper traps, most injuries are to the paws and feet or mouth.It is very easy to maneuver, one hand operation to release the door and another to lock the door.It is rust resistant too and the construction is high quality.You put bait food (depending on the animal) creating a short trail leading to the opening and beneath the entrance, digging a little shallow that you drop the food in. The animal will dig the food and be trapped so long as he's in close enough.It is very important to check that an animal isn't nursing. If it is a nursing mother, it should be released immediately.Another very important precaution is to check the cage often especially in extreme temperatures and conditions where the animal could be overcome by heat or freeze or starve. It is a trap, not a home.This is a safer trap and I'd recommend to anyone considering trapping an animal who is bothersome.
B001UFLIA0 I bought this to catch squirrels, as it says it does. Two things were wrong. One is the easy set/release works great, but the trap doesn't trigger and there is no way to adjust it's sensitivity. The squirrels just helped themselves to food and left. I did not catch a single one. I have used other models with the old style and caught 16 squirrels. Also, the area behind the trap is so short that it leaves little room for bait. Because it has a wire bottom, I needed a small platform to put the food on, and then the trap was in the way. 17\" is not long enough to do the trick. The company took it back and is sending me a refund. I bought another one that I know is tried an tested, the Havahart 1078, 24-by-7-by-7. I had borrowed this one from my local humane society and I know it works well.
B001UFLIA0 This trap works just as well as the smaller squirrel/chipmunk sized Havahart trap I own.  I caught a bunny with this one.  Hopefully there is only one in my yard leaving bunny marbles all over the place.  Normally I wouldn't have a problem with a bunny, or marbles, but my dog insists on flopping on her back and rolling around in the marbles (gross).  I relocated this bunny to the same place I have relocated 15 chipmunks this year.  I'm sure they are very happy there...much happier than they were living in my yard.Havahart traps are extremely easy to set up, and they are also very durable.  My chipmunk trap is in it's 6th year of use, and has captured 46 chipmunks.  Pretty awesome.  That's like $.50 a chipmunk.I have nothing against animals living in my yard, but they need to be controlled or they get out of hand, tunneling under the driveway and sidewalks, eating our garden, etc.  These traps help you do that in a more humane way than just blasting them with a pellet gun or worse, trying to poison them (don't do that).
B001UFLIA0 Check out the picture I posted on this product page:  It says it all.  Well, it almost says it all!  We put the trap out this morning and this afternoon this little boy squirrel took a ride to his new home across the river--took only a few hours to trap this squirrel.We've got a larger Havahart trap that is similar in shape but larger (it's 36\" x 14\" x 14\").  In the past six months we've caught a LOT of squirrels with the larger trap.  We load the trap with just a few pecans--one of our squirrels' most recognizable foods.  But, although we caught about 50 squirrels, (about two per week,) we were still missing a lot of them.  They were able to get in and out with the pecans and the trap would not spring.This trap offered here is a smaller trap and it's spring-loaded.  It is going to catch the smaller squirrels that we were missing before.  The larger trap is not spring-loaded.  I thought that this trap might be too small and the squirrels would sense \"a trap\" because of it, but obviously not!It's simple to set; effortless to lift and carry, and the mechanism won't pinch and the metal won't scratch you.  Once the little darlings step into this cage, they are not going anywhere--except to their new home across the Colorado River!
B001UFLIA0 Well so far I have caught a few squirrels in this trap that catches them live and does'nt kill the animal.I have yet to catch a rabbit or anything else yet.It's easy to set and setting the varment free  in the woods (far away from the home of course) is easy as well,just make sure not to get bit or scratched when doing so.The only prob, an endless supply of squirrels in my area!
B001UFLIA0 The Havahart 1083 one door cage trap is designed to be easy to set and easy to release trapped animals as well. For the range of animals it's designed for it seems slightly small, which means you need to be pretty deliberate about how you set up the bait and position the trap to make sure it gets triggered and traps the animal. Once you do have the animal caught it's easy to carry the trap to an appropriate destination and release your catch. This trap is a suitable size for the squirrels in my area, and it can even be used for small cats/kittens. Since I've had it there haven't been any new instances of rodents tearing screening around the patio at my home. Now that mango season is passed for my tree I will have to see how avocado season goes when the fruits mature this fall - will the squirrels make it to the trap instead of the tree? So far so good, but when those fruits are ripe you really need a good bait for the trap to compete with your produce.It is important to know in advance how/where you can release animals in your vicinity, since you don't know which animal may end up in your trap. Also, read the suggestions given about food baits to use - if you want the best chance of trapping what you wish to trap it helps to have their favorite food, or at least something they like that's not too expensive. This trap is pretty functional, learning how to maximize its effectiveness will bring greater success and satisfaction. This may combine with your satisfaction of dealing kindly with small animals that are a nuisance to your property. If that is your goal then this trap is certainly worth having.
B001UFLIA0 I've never been so happy with a product.  Impy squirrels can make a homeowner go crazy fast.  Within one hour of set-up, the Havahart Easy Set Trap had done its job.  I know because I watched and photographed their activities.  At first, squirrels entered the trap, delicately took pieces of food, then scampered away.  That was disheartening to watch, but soon the squirrels were emboldened.  They wanted every last morsel, even if that meant walking over and looking under the plate-trip mechanism.  Eureka!  One squirrel down and lots more to go.  Within one afternoon, three were caught.We own other different-sized (and effective) Havahart traps, but none as easy to set up as this.  The flip of a handle and the trap is set.  Nothing could be simpler.  I wish I had purchased this godsend long ago instead of resorting to squirrel violence and foolish ideas that mostly didn't work.Don't let squirrels win the war at your house.  If you've got the time to drive these pests elsewhere, this trap will oblige those efforts.  The direction insert was brief, so I immediately went to Havahart's website.  It's a treasure trove of information, bound to help homeowners with any critter problem.  I followed the advice to put a little almond oil on bread, but also included nuts and peanut butter.  I think I overdid food bait the first time, as you can see from the photos, and that is why they could easily snatch and run.  Just a little bait does the trick.Thank you, Havahart.  This is indeed Christmas in July for me.
B001UFLIA0 I've been using Havahart traps occasionally for 25 years, to relocate wildlife from my barns. The early ones I borrowed caught raccoons quite handily but oooooh that male raccoon was a danger even caged. I had to insert a broom handle through the carrying bale to transport the critter to vehicle (where even caged in the back seat of an old VW, he chewed up the upholstery enough that I made the discovery that the seat was stuffed with straw - note to self: put down boards first next time). So this model addresses that particular hazard of having to pick up the trap, with a protective plate. I might still use an extra device if I were to catch anything as snarly as that guy, but basically Havahart has made the right design change. So far this trap has worked for me in a completely satisfactory manner.I hope you realize the earlier experience I relate was with a much larger, raccoon-sized Havahart.The set and release mechanism on this model is also altered, which I appreciate because the old ones I used were a bit scary during the release part. I took that raccoon harem - caught his three females first - up to a river well away from habitation but getting Mister Raccoon out was scary. Luckily he was thirsty and headed for the river after a brief contemplation of the backing-away human.On the topic of relocation, I suggest being quite careful. People living in the vicinity where you release your problem varmint can become quite offended. Just sayin'.
B001UFLIA0 Having used a larger Havahart traps for some racoons and opossums, I was really wanting something much smaller to handle the rabbits in our garden.  This one definitely fits the bill!  Havahart traps REALLY work and are a safe way to move your problematic animals to another area without hurting them.  It is VERY small though, so if you are wanting to catch anything bigger than a squirrel or a rabbit, I would recommend something else.Also, if you are not catching anything, take a look at havahart's website. They have a link on it as to which baits to use for which animals. If you put the correct bait in and set it the way they say to you should have no problems catching what you want... unless it happens to be the David Copperfield of animals. Every once in a while you will get an animal that is very wary and wily. But I've been able to catch most every one of my problem animals, if it wasn't for Havahart my gardens and chickens would be gone!
B001UFLIA0 This trap is easy to set and to bait. Unlike some alternatives, it does not threaten to slice your fingers or otherwise hurt you as you set it. The integrated cocking/carry handle is well engineered and the parts all seem very nicely made. All that said, rodents were able to get into the trap, take the carrot bait away and not trip the trap. Perhaps they were small mice or something? Don't know. There are not instructions to help correct this issue. I guess they assume that only the correct size animal will go into the trap.In any case, I am lowering the rating to three because I would bet that competent trappers have used this rig to great effect and would have already captured the rabbits I am trying to rid our yard of. The answers are probably out there on the web, but why wouldn't the manufacturer put a few more tips in the box instead of the meager instructions provided? I will try a bit longer and update the review if I can actually trap anything.
B001UFLIA0 Overrun with squirrels and didn't want to harm them.  This did the trick.  Over the course of two weeks captured, transported and released them safely on a farm we own outside of town with the humane society's blessing.  Easy to set up and use. One door design works well.  This is a perfect trap for the first time trapper in it's sturdy construction and single set-up and release handle.  Highly recommend
B001UFLIA0 I have purchased a couple other brand traps in the last couple years, most are just junk. The last one was squirrel sized, and one morning I witnessed two grays actually playing in the trap, the plate triggered but no activation. grrrrr....Within minutes of taking delivery of the 1083, I baited and set, and located in my back yard near a bird feeder. Less than thirty minutes later, I looked out to see the trap sprung, containing a troublesome squirrel. That particular rodent is now residing fifteen miles away, and the trap is set awaiting his friends and relatives.This unit is out of box outstanding, needing no adjustments, almost too easy to set. Make sure to place bait beyond trip plate. Also, I have read that gray squirrels should be released at least ten miles away, even then almost half will return in days. More success if you can put a wide river between you and the newly relocated varmint.To sum it up, I don't know if the 1083 is the \"cheapest\" trap on the market, but now I don't care because it just flat out works, and worth every cent. I highly recommend.....
B001UFLIA0 Wow!  I've handled hundreds of cage traps, and this one has to win the \"easiest trap to set\" category.  The \"Havahart 1083 Easy Set One-Door Cage Trap for Squirrels and Small Rabbits\" is too small for cats and raccoons (and it is not designed for these larger mammals) and perhaps too big for red squirrels, but it's about the right size for stocky gray and fox squirrels and smaller cottontails.  It sets like a dream, is built rugged.Just know what you plan to do with any animal BEFORE you set the trap.
B001UFLIA0 Periodically my inner Elmer Fudd comes racing out.  I see a wascally wabbit on my lawn, remember my little apple tree killed by bunnies chewing the bark off it, and go beserker.  I run after the offending rabbit, waving my arms and screaming \"Get off my yard!!!!\"  That works on a short-term basis and I'll admit it helps get out pent up frustrations.  But as a long-term strategy for critter removal, it is remarkably ineffective.My brother-in-law suggested shooting them with a pellet gun.  I considered this option but there were three problems: (1) My suburb prohibits shooting (even pellet guns) inside city limits, (2) I have terrible aim, and (3) I'm not completely certain I could bring myself to pull the trigger -- I'd probably be thinking Thumper not the pests who killed my apple tree and almost chewed my azaleas into oblivion.So this little trap seems to be my best option.  It's a good size for the bunnies that frequent my yard but too small for the neighborhood cats that come through my back yard. (It is also suggested for squirrels but in my neighborhood that would be a neverending battle so I'm only interested in the rabbits.)  The instructions give suggested baits for a variety of critters so I hope to minimize the number of squirrels I catch by choosing rabbit bait that isn't on the squirrel list.The directions are super easy to follow, with photos and three languages.  If it would only drive itself and the captured Buggs out into the country for me, it would be the perfect solution.
B001UFLIA0 This is easy to use, and the tips from other reviews were awesome. Peanutbutter is the best bait I agree. This is a nice way to relocate those small animals that are taking advantage of your bird feeder or garden! I had no problems with either the catch or the release.
B001UFLIA0 These Havahart traps are great.  This one is a new design that makes it even easier to set than the older ones.  No more trying to lightly wedge the curved trigger bar into the slot on the trip pallet.  This one comes with a sliding handle that makes it super easy and when it has been triggered, it is locked down good.  No escape.  I was able to trap a squirrel the first night it was out.  Hopefully he doesn't find his way back after setting him free at a neighboring lake.  I couldn't be more happy with it.Highly recommended.
B001UFLIA0 Compared to my other, much larger,Havahart 1081 Live Animal Professional Style One-Door Large Raccoon, Small Dogs, and Fox Cage Trapthis small 1083 is a breeze to operate. Setting is as easy as lifting the handle on top. On top of that, it is sturdy and quite secure. The first critter I trapped was a young skunk.  There was no chance of it escaping. Thanks to my experience with the 1081 I have become a master skunk releaser. And releasing animals is a easy as setting the trap.But back to the 1083 and it's one slight drawback. Because it is so small, the average garden ravaging wild critter will have to be sorely tempted before entering this little trap. Bait it with whatever is most desirable to the creatures one needs to relocate or one will be disappointed when the trap remains empty.All in all, a great trap.
B001UFLIA0 A few times in the past, I've had to release animals out of Havahart cages.  One was a poor opossum someone trapped and then just dumped in the woods, with the cage!  I don't know if that was because the cage was old, or the trapper was too terrified to get near a opossum who might be angry when released, or the trapper just couldn't get the cage's door open.  I suspect the latter, since I had a very hard time opening the door.  Fortunately, I eventually got it open, and the poor opossum just made a run for it, as I knew he or she would.  Hence, I was delighted to see how improved the doors were on new Havahart cages.  The traps are very easy to set and the doors are very easy to open, when you need to release the animal.  I got this little trap to trap something in a friend's garage.  It sounded like a large enough something to be trapped, but unfortunately it wasn't.  The bait was always eaten, and the door was always still wide open.  Thus, for those hoping to trap animals more of the rodent size, this trap may not work.  Havahart obviously needs to make an even smaller trap than this one.  (Oops . . . they do make smaller traps . . . even one for mice!)
B001UFLIA0 I have been aware of Havahart Traps for many years as someone who believes in the Trap Neuter Release program for feral/stray cats.  I have never had a problem with a cat being hurt using a Havahart as some off brand traps have been known to do.This size trap is excellent for squirrels, small rabbits and feral kittens. A larger animal could be hurt because the trap just would not be large enough to accomodate it's size and it could get caught half in and half out :(  So, please be sure what size trap you need before ordering one.  If you even think a large cat could get caught in this size, please don't get it or if you do, put it in an area where a large animal could not get to it.As with any new trap, experiment with it first to make sure it works properly and make any necessary adjustments before actually using it.  I use an old dark colored pillowcase to drap over the trap to make it less obvious to the animal.  (For a larger cat trap, I cut a hole in the cloth on the top to fit around the handle so the cat can be transported to a clinic with the sides and top covered.  Helps with spraying accidents, too).I have a large park behind my home in which recently several pet rabbits have been abandoned...I know.....don't even get me started on how I feel about that :( .....thanks to this Havahart 1083, myself and members of a rabbit rescue were able to trap and transport them to foster homes.I highly recommend Havahart Traps!
B001UFLIA0 We'll it's official... it really works.Our neighborhood is infested with feral cats, but we don't have a rodent problem.I really don't mind the cats themselves, it's the crapping in my garden and my children's sandbox that has me up in arms about them. Plus, all they do is breed, multiple and fight.I chose this trap to help resolve our little problem. I didn't want to use inhumane tactics, like a pellet or paintball gun, or poison, so the live trap was the best and only alternative.My children got all excited that we actually caught our first cat yesterday. All we did was put a $0.40 can of cat food in the trap that night and in the morning we had a trapped cat. Beautiful!We will be setting another can out tonight. It's quite exciting for the family to have this much anticipation over catching a cat. I like it more for the simple fact that I will be reclaiming the yard.
B001UFLIA0 Last year I paid a lot of money to have an animal trapper remove squirrels from the attic, and to have the holes patched where they came in. Guess what...they came RIGHT BACK. According to the trapper, the scent of squirrel will draw them back. Now that its getting colder and wetter, my attic is starting to look inviting to the squirrels again. So, I got this HAVAHART Cage trap. Its so easy to use. You just pull the handle back, then bait it. I throw peanuts IN THE SHELL around the outside of the trap, and inside. Then, I check the trap at least once a day. Sometimes a squirrel will bang themselves against the side of the cage, until they are nearly dead. If you have a squirrel, you wont have to worry about its rodent teeth biting your fingers off, cos there is a thick steel plate, between the carry handle, and the cage. I still wear gloves, tho. In fact, if your attic has as much squirrel \"dirt\" as mine has in it, you'll maybe want to wear a resperator over your face too.Take the trapped squirrel inside the cage, put it in the car, and release it a few miles away. The other side of a river, or large highway, keeps them from finding their way back to your house. It's illegal to trap and kill without a licence, in most municipalities. After you have a baited trap without any action for more than a week, you can stop trapping. If you hear squirrels again in your attic, you just have to bait and trap again. You wont have to worry about hurting the squirrel with the trap's gate, cos it wont snap shut, unless the target animal is stepping on the trigger plate, well inside the trap. Good Hunting!
B001UTY5MY This is a wonderful hummingbird feeder! Out of all the different ones in the yard, this is the only one they actually sit on to feed, so they can rest their wings. Very attractive as well, I love that it's very light green/clear instead of those bright red ones. It compliments the green space instead of standing out like a sore thumb. Excellent product, we may get a few more!
B001UTY5MY This is a well-thought-out series of feeders. The base separates into two halves for easy cleaning, and the hanger at the top is nice and secure.This particular model -- the green antique bottle -- has a 10-ounce capacity. The bottle is specially made for the feeder -- it isn't really an antique. It has little hummingbirds and the Perky Pet name embossed in it.The bottom part of the base is plastic. The top part is metal, with candy apple red feeding port flowers. The base is flat on the bottom so you can easily stand the feeder during cleaning.The proof of the good design is in the \"flip\" -- that point after refilling that you turn the feeder over for hanging. Not a drop of nectar spills when I flip mine. Other feeders spill a lot. Not this one.So do the hummers like it? You bet they do. I suspect there's an advantage to a glass reservoir that appeals to hummers -- less plastic taste or smell.I'm hoping the metal part of the base has a good coat of clear lacquer on it to keep it from rusting. I'm making sure to use a soft sponge for washing it so I don't accidentally scrub off any clear coat.Love this series of feeders! I hope they last years!
B001UTY5MY I have yet to catch a hummingbird at this feeder, but I love it just the same as a practical ornament for my flower garden. The glass is beautiful and looks expensive. Plus it's easy to fill.There are lots bees and yellow jackets in my garden, but the feeder's red flowers keep them away. I'm looking forward to the day the hummingbirds discover this feeder; until then, it's a great garden piece for visual interest.
B001UTY5MY This feeder is much more attractive in person.  It is well-built.  I like the size--it holds a bit less than our other feeder but I feel this will help us keep the nectar fresher for the birds.  The design is very nice.  I has the appearance of an old coke bottle but the detailing makes it more attractive.  Nice value.
B001UTY5MY We needed a new hummingbird feeder.  The old plastic one was cracking and fading and getty moldy in the hot backyard sun.  But a lot of the ones we'd see in home improvement and garden stores were pretty tacky-looking.  Not so the Perky-Pet 8108-2 Antique Bottle Glass Hummingbird Feeder.The 10-ounce antique-style textured green glass bottle sets it apart.  It's both classy and functional--easier to clean than plastic and a cinch to take apart and put together.Also especially decorative are the four metal feeder bases.  The feeder has an attached metal hanger that makes it easy to put up and take back down again whenever the nectar needs changing/refilling.Now all we need are the actual hummingbirds.  They can be pretty finicky, unforgiving little creatures and weren't very pleased with the condition of that old, plastic feeder.
B001UTY5MY This hummingbird feeder is beautiful. I love it, as far as looks go! You just can't go wrong with its appearance.The negatives:The mouth is REALLY small, which is most likely to be expected, since it's shaped like a coke bottle. I used a funnel to pour the sugar water in there, but the mouth was still too small for the funnel. I just had to hold the funnel on as tight as I could. Some still leaked out, but it's not the biggest deal, since I did it in the sink.The hanger part at the top is also really small. You pretty much need to tie something else through it to be able to hang it. I have a small metal hook on my porch, and I was able to hang it without anything, but just barely.As far as attracting hummingbirds and keeping their interest, I can't say yet. I still haven't saw any hummingbirds around it.For me, it's appearance makes up for any negatives as long as some hummingbirds eventually show up for it.
B001UTY5MY Just on the grounds of aesthetic appeal, this is a winner.  The most widely-available mass-produced humming-bird feeder is large, with a plastic base that wears very badly. This version is smaller and more discrete; it blends nicely in with my garden d&eacute;cor - which is heavy on the funky vintage recycled items anyway. The small size is also plus for me - as there is not quite so much wastage of nectar. And if it comes that there are enough humming birds coming around to sip this feeder dry every couple of days, then I will just buy some more!
B001UTY5MY This is not my first Perky-Pet hummingbird feeder, it's my 4th. And while I have to admit that thePerky-Pet 30-Ounce Glass Hummingbird Feederis still my favorite, this is next in line. For me a feeder has always been about function, not beauty and that is why I love the 30-Ounce feeder.  I can put it out and not worry about it being emptied for a week in the summer and even longer in the other months.  But having received thePerky-Pet Green Antique Bottle 10-Ounce Glass Hummingbird Feeder, I wonder why we have to give up beauty?I absolutely love the green glass bottle and the feeding spouts are actually pretty. Putting it together is easy and I like that this feeder has the metal clasp at the top for hanging.  The other ones I have came with a plastic covered wire, which can be problematic at times when hanging.  I decided to hang this one in the front of our home, instead of hiding it in the back or side yard where I have the others.  We have lots of flowers in front that attract them without the feeders so it's a good spot. It was easy to hang and we had birds at it within 2-3 hours.Overall I am pleased with this feeder, but I really wish that it was larger.  I can already see that I will need to refill this one very often compared to my 30-ounce feeder. So while it does have beauty & function...it could function just a little bit better in my opinion.*I wanted to note that I always have people asking me what I fill mine with and I tell them I don't bother with the expensive mixes. I found out long ago that a simple water sugar mixture works just fine and will keep the birds coming around. I use a 3 part formula: 1 part sugar, 2 parts water.
B001UTY5MY UPDATE:I went outside the other day and noticed that the base had fallen off.  After investigating, I found that the skew in part was cracked.  I returned the item and got a new one.  The new one was not cracked and the base screwed on tightly (review below states that it would pop if turned too much), the first one was popping because of the crack.  If you get one that is cracked where it screws into (plastic), then it will not hold and the weight of the food will make it fall off and you will feel the popping out.  Below is the original review, but the proper one allows for the screw to go in tight and fit perfectly!  I would recommend checking it before you hang it outside.I have found in past experience that getting the ones that say \"Antique\" is the best way to go, they normally have the metal cover that fits tightly on the hard plastic bottom and require creatures with stray like mouths to obtain the food (this prevents bees and wasp from getting at it).  I got this item and it looks great in the garden, it has an old look to it that sets if off perfectly in a garden.  The metal flowers are well made and are affixed to it very well.  The bottle is small, but still looks nice.  However, I did have two flaws with it (compared to my larger Antique hummingbird feeder), first the bottle does not screw tightly to the bottom, if you overturn it pops right back out (the other one turned snuggly on it, next the top part that hooks it to a pole is to small, therefore it will not allow me fit it over my Shepherd's Hooks, instead I had to use a wire tie to hook it to the pole (wire tie does not look as good as the metal hanger).  For the price, this is a very nice one, it does require a few tweaks, but for the price I can live with that.  I filled it up with hummingbird food, and turned it over (a small little nuisance is that when you flip it over the bottle then looks half empty, not a big problem (because it has to fill the bottom, but it makes me with that I got the Red painted ones; like my other one).  I highly recommend these metal bottoms, because they keep the food in, my old plastic feeders would be empty after a day of windy weather, these are heavy enough not to blow too much, but when they do it requires them to near flip over before leaking any food -- Just make sure that you screw it on as tight as it goes.In the end this is a nice a little hummingbird feeder, it looks elegant in the garden, and holds the food in better than the small plastic ones.  I highly recommend the metal base ones like this one, and only wish that this one had a better screw on base and a bigger hanger on top, however, for the price it is a win!
B001UTY5MY I have been a bird feeding enthusiast for years now. I enjoy providing food year-around for a variety of birds but think I gain greater pleasure from watching the birds through the family-room windows.My two favorite birds over the years have been the yellow finch and humming bird. Just recently I watched a PBS nature program on the hummingbird and am even more amazed by this intriguing hovering creature.But I always have had problems attracting hummingbirds on a consistent basis in any quantity, until trying the Perky-Pet green antique bottle feeder.  In the past I have tried a variety of plastic, low-cost hummingbird feeders with mixed results. Now with my Perky-Perk feeder my hummingbirds arrived earlier than past years and return more often. Part of this may be because of climate change but I'm convinced the green-glass feeder has a lot to do with this year's success.The feeder has four colorful feeding ports decorated like flower petals to attract the hummingbird from afar. The rays of sun shining through the green glass with brushed silver accents, as opposed to plastic containers, draws like a magnet. And the shaped-designs on the glass provide an attractive glitter of light at times. This feeder is easy to clean, easy to fill, and easy to hang.And this feeder does not cost that much more than my cheaper plastic feeders. The difference in results is certainly worth $3-$4 more.
B001UTY5MY When this feeder arrived, I was surprised at how heavy it felt. No cheap, flimsy plastic to easily crack, this is a solid glass feeder that is also quite attractive. We'd never tried to attract hummingbirds before, so I read up online on how to properly clean the feeder regularly and how to prepare the nectar. Filling the feeder isn't the easiest for me alone, I finally found a funnel and only filled the feeder about half way. I carried it outside upside down, so if any leakage occurred it would not be all over my kitchen. There was minimal leakage so that was a nice surprise. After I hung the feeder up, we both agreed it looked lonely and ended up also purchasing the Perky-Pet Red Antique glass feeder to help balance it and attract more birds. I'd like to say we now how hordes of hummingbirds but it's been a very, very wet month down South thanks to all the tropical storm activity and so far I haven't seen a single visitor. Of course, none of my neighbors have either so I'm hoping that they'll start to show up soon. Overall, I'm happy with it. It's quite attractive and eye catching and even though it's best to clean it often, it's not difficult to make the nectar or clean so it's really not a bother.
B001UTY5MY This is a well crafted, sturdy and elegant little feeder.  The local hummers found it of the first day it was up.  It also seems to keep away some of the other birds who like to feed on my other hummingbird feeders.  I'm quite happy with mine!
B001UTY5MY May 12, 2013: My feeders (I bought a second one) are still in use, not rusted, and it's been 18 months. However, I have to mention this about attracting hummingbirds. In my area of California, there are only two resident species, and one is rare. So unless there are Anna's around, don't expect much traffic. In other words, migratory hummers are scarce even during migration. They have real flowers to provide food. During mating and nesting season (NOW), I've been taking the feeders down: I'm lucky if I see one or two hummers in a week, and the food spoils quickly. And, last, if your feeder gets any direct sun during the day, that bottle is going to warm quickly. Maybe in New England in December, that's okay, but here the food spoils within three days. The feeder does attract hummers, but a plain bottle with water will attract them (they get thirsty, too), but for us in the west, October through April is the season.***March 2, 2012: I don't know what others are doing to theirs, but after almost five months, and there are no chips and no rust. I'm buying another.***I've never seen a hummingbird feeder that looks like an antique Coke bottle, and I really didn't think that it was going to work (since hummers are attracted primarily to red), but I hung it up just yesterday, and today, I had 5 Anna's hummngbirds at the feeder. Two were sitting, one was drinking, and two were \"fighting for position.\"Since the top of the bottle is small, a funnel helps tremendously. I do suggest that when you turn it right side up, do it over the sink or outdoors. The reservoir fills up quickly and it can leak a little.Our feeder is in the shade 90% of the day, but it does a brisk business from 6 AM to 6:30 PM. It's truly fun to make coffee in the morning and watch the antics of these birds. I just wish I could get bright, dazzling photos, but they get up much earlier than I do. (Still, see the one photo that I've posted. That guy was at the feeder for at least 5 full minutes.)
B001UTY5MY I have been a fan of Perky Pet feeders for years now.  All are clear plastic with red bases, either a wide mouthed bottle or saucer.  I haven't had a lot of hummingbird activity for a few years now, and currently have only seen one male on one of two feeders out.  I put this one out in an area that does get travelled by hummers, but haven't seen one stop by yet.  I moved it next to one of the other feeders, and the other feeder is still preferred over this one.  I don't know if it's because of the lack of red, which I know doesn't really matter, but my guy doesn't like it.  I clean my feeders out twice a week, and this one is a lot more difficult to properly clean without using a brush, which I do not have at the moment.  I rinse the bottle out with scalding hot water and rinse thoroughly.  I also have my doubts about the base top part of the feeder, which is metal, I fear it will rust over time, but will comment back if and when I see that.I'll give it a few more weeks; hopefully activity will pick up.EDIT:  I decided to temporarily lend the feeder to someone with more hummer activity, and his hummers had no problem using this one along with the other red base feeders he uses.  After receiving it back, I put it next to my usual feeder, but I didn't see any of the hummers use it; they still preferred the other feeder :(
B001UTY5MY Offhand I see nothing fancy in this serves-four-at-a-time, 10 ounce plus, antique green glass hummingbird feeder, but it gets the job done.  About a week after setting it up, we spotted our first hummingbird feeding.  I was surprised at how fast they fed before flitting off to return later.  The wire hanger at the \"bottom\" of the bottle attaches easily to most hooks, and red colored nectar shows up well in the green glass.Note: Once you screw the the metal base to the nectar filled bottle and flip the whole thing over, several ounces of nectar drain into the base, which means that even after you can no longer see the nectar in the glass, there may be several ounces left in the base so take care when cleaning.
B001UTY5MY We all have the same hummingbird feeder -- the red Perky-Pet one. Every household has at least one. So this product is a really brilliant improvement on that ubiquitous design, and it looks much nicer. The glass is like an old Coke bottle type of green, not quite as thick, and the feeding ports are made of metal with the flower part painted red. Very nice! See the photos for an understanding of what I mean.This holds ten ounces, so if my old hummingbird recipe was 1/4 cup sugar suspended in 1 cup of water... if that's eight ounces... &lt;del>I need to add three tablespoons and one teaspoon to ten ounces of water to get the right amount of sugar.&lt;/del> Check my math and let me know if I'm wrong. Actually I think for ten ounces of water I'd add 1/4 cup of sugar plus ONE Tablespoon.To mix hummingbird food: boil the water, ten ounces in the case of this feeder, then stir to dissolve 1/4 cup plus one tablespoon of sugar. Cover and gently boil for three minutes. This creates a \"suspension\" meaning that the sugar will not precipitate as it sits in the feeder - it'll stay mixed. It's a \"simple syrup\" -- also very handy for iced tea, but that's another review.Overall a brilliant take on something that was ripe for an upgrade. I'll save my old red plastic Perky-Pet hummingbird feeder, but I'll be happy to see this one hanging outside our window. The real test will be whether the hummingbirds like it.
B001UTY5MY This feeder is so pretty!  Green is my favorite color and the sage green color they used along with the touches of red in the middle of the flowers makes this look so nice. The bottle is smallish and it has designs all the way around the glass, even has a tiny little bird on the sides of the glass. Really cute! :)I was worried about their little feet getting burned after reading one of the reviews here and was going to keep it in the shade and was even thinking about gluing a few tiny little sticks on the sides for them to use as perches. But when I picked it up to look at I noticed the bottom section is made out of plastic, not metal. So the part they will use to perch on, if they do, will be plastic and not metal, so that made me feel a lot better about their little feet. :)This looks so much nicer than the plastic, red  ones we have!
B001UTY5MY We've had this feeder up for a little while and have already seen 2 hummingbirds. Clean-up is easy and fast.
B001UTY5MY We love feeding the birds but hate the idea of a gaudy red plastic feeder hanging in the garden.  Yes, the red plastic ones attract the hummingbirds quickly, but they sometimes look a little tacky.  That's why I was excited to see this one: it looks good and doesn't draw attention to itself in a bad way.  Unfortunately, it took the hummingbirds over a week to find it!The antique bottle and metal look very nice.  The base is plastic and holds a significant amount of liquid, but is sturdy and cleans up nicely.  The mouth to the bottle is quite small making filling a bit challenging, but it screws into the plastic base very securely.  The metal hanger on the top is quite small and doesn't leave much space between the hanger and the bottle - in contrast to my previous feeder which had a metal wire and loop.But the hard part was attracting the hummingbirds.  Even hanging it in place of my prior feeder the birds seemed to bypass it.  The only red on it is the small shiny metal \"flowers\" on the feeding ports, but they're rather small.  Also, because the glass is green I had to put a lot of red food coloring into my sugar mix (I try to keep the food coloring minimal) to get it to show up.  Even then, I had to tie a red ribbon on top before I finally saw my first reluctant hummingbird, and it's still not as popular as my prior feeder - which was clear.  I wish I'd got the clear one of this model.
B001UTY5MY The hummers have been slow in appearing this year but when I put out this 8108-2 feeder it was almost like magic.  Two (male and female) appeared and began their ritual.  The male chases the female and the fun begins.  Thank goodness we have more than the one hanging.  Less than 4 and it is an all out battle.  At least this way each bird can have a gulp without too much hassle.  The new one (8108-2) seems to be favored over the other Perky-Pets hanging from prior years.  I filled all 4 of them and even though the 8108 was full it was the first empty.  The other 3 were filled with about the same amount of sugar water and they did not empty as fast.  The 8108 has no separate foot holders but it is built in and that makes for a sleeker feeder.  The green antique does not have any effect on their assumption of command.  Because the other 3 are red in several places I thought that would attract them and while it might have they seem to prefer the new one.  Great.I just returned from my weekly cut the grass routine and plopped onto my recliner and aimed it to the hummer feeders for a quiet spell of rest and watch.  That is one fine way to spend an hour of doing nothing but permitting others to entertain the simple minds of a couple of young at heart old folks.  Try it but forget the yard work.  It will be there when you are ready.
B001UTY5MY Hummingbird feeders and I go way back.  There is only one species of hummer that makes it up here to New England, and then only in summer.  So it really is a lot of fun to make them as welcome as possible while here by offering to cater their visit.  Just about all hummer feeders are pretty much the same in that they have a bottle, a base with some red and often yellow ported flowers, and sometimes a ring for the hummer to perch on while dining, (nice idea but not really necessary).  This Perky Pet model has a very nice bottle that holds kind of a measly 10 oz that looks very nice in your window or back yard, and a base that comes with a chrome plate that covers the bottom basin that like almost all hummer feeders, comes apart for cleaning.  Despite the fact that the metal piece looks kinda rich and cool, I don't care for it personally.  It's very thin and cheap feeling and has to be held in place carefully while filling it.  Since the metal hanger on the bottle prevents it from being stood upright, it's rather a clumsy affair to fill it and screw on to the base.  Also, as a couple of other reviewers here have noted the metal rusts over a short period of time, thus spoiling some of its looking fashionable to be sure. I know a lot of other reviewers seem to not be bothered by it, but personally I think its cheap and a pain to deal with while filling.  Lastly even if the chrome finish and handsome bottle appeal to you, this is one of the very few times I would suggest you go elsewhere for this unit than Amazon. I saw it recently at Walmart for $11.75 and there were plenty of them there.  I at least suggest that you check it out there first and see if you like it before buying it, and then buy it there if you do.  Unless the price happens to come down on Amazon, I cannot recommend buying it here... : )
B001UTY5MY This is such a lovely hummingbird feeder.  I was overjoyed to get it and see how our charm of hummers would like the newest feeders.  Our hummers are always ravenous and it's touch keeping a single feeder full of food.  I put up the feeder and eagerly awaited the arrival of hunger customers but to my surprise no one would go near it.  Days turned into a week and still no one seems vaguely interested in this newest feeder.  I can't figure it out.  The feeder is lovely and charming to humans, but the humingbirds just ignore it.  I've taken it down to clean it and refill and will try it in a different location.  I am wondering if it's just too close to the primary feeder.  I will report back after a few days if this works.  We do have a couple of aggressive hummers that chase others away and placing the new one further away may help the non aggressive ones.It is such a wonderful looking feeder and really is a work of art.  Another thing that I really liked about it is that the base which is metal actually comes apart for easy cleaning.  I wish all manufacturers would consider doing this to make the feeders easier to maintain.
B001UTY5MY This hummy feeder was a surprise in that it is much nicer in person than the Amazon picture shows.  Refer to the customer images posted to get a better idea of how it looks.  Having had many feeders over the years, the two things that I really look for is that (1) it does not lose half or most of the liquid when I flip it over after filling and (2) does not leak, hence, this one gets five stars from me.  This feeder is one of the most easy to fill that I have ever used.  At 10 ounces, I wish the size were a little bigger, but you are supposed to be washing this out twice a week, and you will need to have or fashion a hanger. It is a little pricey at $15; if Amazon ever marks it down to $10, it would be a real buy.
B001UTY5MY The picture of this item (Perky-Pet 8108-2 Green Antique Bottle 10-Ounce Glass Hummingbird Feeder) does not do it justice!  It is so pretty!  It is a delight for the eyes!  I couldn't believe just how pretty it was when I unpacked it.  I was ready to write a glowing review right then & there!Unfortunately there were no instructions for use.  Basically they recommend you purchase their brand of hummingbird nectar aka a sugar packet with red dye.  Personally if I am going to feed the wildlife, I am not going to poison them with artificial crap thanks to the dye nor risk using a sugar from genetically engineered beets &/or loaded with pesticides.  Thankfully making sugar water for your little feathered jewels is super easy.  You don't want the solution to sit longer than 3 days so making a lot is a waste.  For this little feeder I find one cup does the trick.  For every 1C of water use 1/4C of sugar (organic is best).  Heat the water in a pot on the stove until it is nearly boiling.  Add the sugar & stir to dissolve completely.  Let it cool.  Once cool you can add it to your feeder!  So easy!I have used many different types of hummingbird feeders over the years & this one is by far the easiest to clean.  The base is 2 pieces & then you have the jar.  So far I haven't even had an ant or wasp problem unlike I did with all my other feeders.  If you have an ant problem you should get an Ant Moat.  They work like a charm!  I like the one that is a little parasol & it is made out of metal, not plastic (you can find it on amazon). The less plastic I buy the better!  When you unscrew the  jar from the base the bottom pieces immediately come apart & clean up is a breeze.  If you don't have bottle brush, you will need to get one to clean out the jar as the opening is very narrow.  I use the same bottle brush as I use to clean out my rabbit water bottles.  You can get them at Petsmart & probably amazon.  Once rinsed out (no soap), flip the bottle upright & it will stand on it's own even though there is a metal holder there.  It will lean to the side a bit but it is surprisingly sturdy.  Next you will need a small funnel to pour the sugar water into the jar unless you want to live dangerously & try your skills at getting all the sugar water into the jar & not all over everything else.  Go outside, flip it over & hang it up.  You need to hang it from another hook (if you have an ant moat you hang it from the ant moat).  The attachment on the feeder is not likely to fit most garden hooks as they are much too fat.  If you have a hook ready, you will not spill a drop when you hang it.I was very disappointed when after 2 weeks not one single hummingbird visited this feeder.  They visited me plenty when I walked around in my bright colored clothes!  I was pretty discouraged & decided to try one last thing.  I added a ribbon from a Victoria's Secret shopping bag to the top of the feeder & tied it in a perky little bow.  BAM!  Hummingbirds at the feeder!Overall I'm pretty satisfied.  My biggest complaint is the lack of instructions for the newbie to make their own sugar water at home & it needed a brighter splash of color to attract the hummingbirds.  Other than that, this performs like a charm.  I've been using it for about a month now & am thoroughly enjoying seeing all the hummingbirds visit & perch at this feeder all day long!
B001UTY5MY For years my wife has put out hummingbird feeders and every year we get quite a few that visit her feeders - one year, we counted ten individual hummingbirds - so we were very interested in seeing how well they would do with this Perky Pet hummingbird feeder. While it's a well-made feeder and it is very pretty (especially in the sun) we have observed some minor flaws in the design.This is a particularly easy feeder to maintain and clean. It comes apart very easily, there are few places in the base that are not accessible with a small brush while cleaning and the bottle itself is shaped nicely to make scrubbing with a bottle brush almost foolproof.A *huge* plus with this feeder is that it does not leak. When properly assembled, the metal top where the feeding ports are clips seamlessly on the plastic base into which the bottle is screwed down. This creates a nice seal, and so far we have seen no leakage at all. Leaky feeders serve one purpose, and I speak from experience: they attract ants. This feeder should pose no issues in that respect.This is a smaller feeder which is not necessarily a bad thing. It holds less nectar than most of the other feeders we have used so it requires more fillings than average. It is well-suited for lower-activity feeding stations but will require frequent fillings under more active environments. That said, if it is necessary to fill more often, then it is likely that the food is usually fresher, which in turn should attract even more hummingbirds over time.We ran into an issue when we hung up the feeder. The metal loop on top which is used to hang the feeder from a hook is very low and narrow, making hanging a lot more difficult. Depending on the hook being used this may be a messy proposition, as spillage is quite easy when the feeder has to be angled to be hung at all.It would have been nice if the metal harness that holds the bottle was coated in plastic or other rust-resistant coating. Though it has not started to rust, I can see where the exposed metal harness will oxidize over time.Considering the number of hummingbirds we have seen, we expected them to feed from this feeder almost immediately. This was not the case, and we don't know why. We left the feeder hanging with fresh food for several days and the hummingbirds only very occasionally bothered to come, though a different feeder on the other side of the house has seen activity. I am not sure why this feeder hasn't attracted them as we expected, but regardless of the reason we have been disappointed.This is a very attractive feeder and it's easy to maintain and keep clean. It is made well, though there are a couple of design issues that prevent it from being great.
B001UTY5MY This was a great gift for my Mother, who just moved into a new place last month. Her old house was in the country and there were a lot of birds, so we are hoping to get a good mix in her new suburban area.This was a wonderful addition to her other feeders, that were already starting to attract local wildlife. I found the bottle and base to be sturdy. It was wonderful to take out a real glass bottle! It gives the feeder such a substantial feel. The bottle is attractive and just a bit green. The base is metal with tiny metal flowers. Its smaller than I pictured, but the dimensions are obvious when reading. For some reason I just thought it would be bottle of wine big.She has had no trouble filling it, cleaning it or replacing it to her hook. We have not seen an abundance of birds yet, but there have been a couple.
B001UTY5MY I bought this as a gift for my mother, and she says it's unique and she loves it!  It's good to have unique hummingbird feeders around, and to remember to feed them year around.
B001UTY5MY This is a pretty feeder with a vintage sort of look.  The antique-style bottle sets it a notch above the typical plastic feeders you find at the local home improvement store.  Our resident blackchin hummers had no trouble adapting to it.  I found that it goes together easily, with little or no spill.  It's also easy to clean.  It has a relatively small capacity which will keep nectar from spoiling, although you might stay busy refilling it when midsummer comes along.My only mild criticism comes from the fact that there's no perching area beside each 'blossom'.  While hummingbirds are perfectly capable of feeding on the wing, they also don't mind catching a breather once in a while. That quibble aside, this feeder is a nice way to spruce up the yard with welcome visitors.
B001UTY5MY Good looking feeder, but the hummingbirds avoid it and the fluid does not flow well into the feeding tray, so the level there gets very low even when there is fluid in the bottle.  Slow turnover of that fluid then results in bacteria growth inside the feeding tray, which is harmful to the birds.  I would not recommend this feeder.  I've owned many hummingbird feeders and by far the very best ones are the Aspects Hummzinger feeders and those made by Best.  Both are available on Amazon.  They attract hummers very well, and they contain no metals (zinc, copper, brass, lead) that are toxic to hummingbirds.
B001UTY5MY The Perky-Pet Antique Hummingbird Feeder is so beautiful in person! I was pleasantly surprised when I opened it... looks so amazing. I really like that the price is only a few dollars more than my standard, plain glass, plastic trimmed feeders. I am certainly going to buy another one of these when I replace my cheaper feeder.This feeder doesn't have much plastic; it's glass with a metal hanging latch, and the base is a colored metal. I think the inside is lined with plastic, but you can't see it.It's a 10 oz feeder, and when you fill the bottle and turn the feeder right-side-up, it goes down several inches, filling up the base. The feeder doesn't leak.See the photo that I uploaded to get an idea of how it looks in use.Thanks!
B001UTY5MY I love the elegant, understated beauty of this little feeder. The only reason I've deducted one star is because there's not enough red on the feeder to attract the hummers. After I embellished it with some red nail polish, the birds began to come feed more frequently. I chose nail polish because it's both weatherproof and easy to remove.This feeder doesn't come with any nectar to get you started. You're supposed to clean the feeder and replace the nectar once a week, so just start with a little until you know how much the hummers will go through in a week. You'll also want to find a chain or other sturdy way to hang it.
B001UTY5MY I love feeding and watching hummingbirds every year.  Although the hummingbirds don't seem to care whether the feeder is plastic or glass, this glass feeder is so much prettier to look at for the people.  I've had many compliments on how nice it looks.This feeder is very easy to fill and assemble.  It doesn't drip as I walk it from my kitchen to outside which is nice.My only complaint about this feeder is that there aren't little perches for the hummingbirds to sit on.  I see in one of the pictures that a hummingbird is sitting on the edge but I have yet to see any sit on mine.  Last year on my feeder with perches I had about 8 different hummingbirds that would come and sit there for long periods of time.  I even started naming them because I could tell them all apart when they'd sit there long enough.  I don't seem to have as many hummingbirds this year though.  The ones that are out there seem to be shy this year though because they never even come in for a drink when were out there as they did last year.  It's not the feeder though because they nectar is certainly getting drank and I seem them zoom by from inside the house.Overall I love the look and quality of this feeder and I would highly recommend it.
B001UU01US Perky Pet has introduced a well-thought-out series of feeders with \"antique\" glass bottle nectar reservoirs.This particular model -- the red \"liquor\" bottle -- has a 16-ounce capacity. The bottle is specially made for the feeder -- it isn't really an antique. It has little hummingbirds and the Perky Pet name embossed in it.The bottom part of the base is plastic. The top part is metal, with candy apple red feeding port flowers. The base is flat on the bottom so you can easily stand the feeder during cleaning. And the base separates into two halves for easy cleaning, and the hanger at the top of the glass bottle is nice and secure.The proof of the good design is in the \"flip\" -- that point after refilling that you turn the feeder over for hanging. Not a drop of nectar spills when I flip mine. Other feeders spill a lot. Not this one.So do the hummers like it? You bet they do. I suspect there's an advantage to a glass reservoir that appeals to hummers -- less plastic taste or smell.I'm hoping the metal part of the base has a good coat of clear lacquer on it to keep it from rusting. I'm making sure to use a soft sponge for washing it so I don't accidentally scrub off any clear coat.Love this series of feeders! I hope they last years!
B001UU01US I gave this to my mother for Mother's Day, and it's been a big hit in her small garden.  The design is really, really attractive and much better than the plastic feeders that are so common.  In addition, the red bottle makes all of the dyes and other additives completely unnecessary - just a basic sugar syrup is all you need.  Also, because of the quality of the materials, it's very easy to wash and is holding up very well in the weather.
B001UU01US I just moved to a neighborhood that has hummingbirds. This feeder is lovely. It holds 16 ounces of nectar and it is easy to take apart and clean. I am very happy with the stylish nature of the bottle. The base has 4 flower like apertures that the birds can drink out of. The only thing I worry about is that because it is glass, I am not sure how it will hold up over time (will it be more breakable than the usual plastic ones I have used in the past)?  Only time will tell with that but it is a stylish addition to my porch, easy to fill, easy to hang, and easy to clean!
B001UU01US Had a cheap plastic feeder that the hummingbirds went nuts over.  It eventually cracked due to sun exposure so a glass and metal feeder would be the solution to that problem right?  Well not a single hummingbird came after that even after washing and refilling it multiple times.  Went back to a glass and plastic feeder this year and the hummingbirds are back.
B001UU01US My parents have a cabin in the mountains of North Carolina -- a part of their morning ritual is watching hummingbirds from their back porch while having coffee. I brought this feeder up when I visited them recently.- They're got a whole bunch of different feeders, but this is definitely the best-looking one. The glass is a deep cherry-red and is crafted in a way that's reminiscent of 'antique' bottles, only with a much more vibrant color. The hummingbird and labeling blazoned into the glass looks cool as well.- Hummingbirds up there seem to prefer RED to CLEAR nectar. This red bottle is great for that reason; if you have clear nectar you won't have to worry about coloring it red if your hummingbirds prefer that color.- Solidly constructed from metal and glass... feels well-made- I actually saw hummingbirds using this feeder while I was up there at the cabin. I tried to get pictures of some, but never managed to snap a shot before they buzzed off... but my mom snapped a pic of one on her phone. I've uploaded it to the product page.BOTTOM LINE: this is the coolest hummingbird feeder I've seen. If you like hummingbirds and want an attractive, effective feeder to hang... get this one. You won't be disappointed.
B001UU01US The Perky Pet 16oz Red hummingbird feeder is a good looking feeder & the red color does attract hummingbirds.  The glass bottle mimics an antique glass bottle in that it has raised lettering on the glass.  The flat base is plastic & the feeder port top is metal. The bottle easily screws into the base.PROS:Good LookingFlat BottomSturdy Wire HangerBase allows hummingbirds to restCONS:Glass is still coated red (so I am worried that it will eventually peel off)Feeder ports are also coated redBottle has a narrow neck so it is harder to clean & you must use a funnel to pour in the nectarMy initial impression is that I like this feeder.  I don't fill it up because I don't have enough birds to finish the nectar before I need to refill the bottle (maybe I will over time).  I'm concerned about the red coating, so will wash as usual & post results as the feeder ages.
B001UU01US My backyard is a certified wildlife habitat but I have found most himmingbird feeders to be tiny, not durable, or a tad tacky.This is actually an art piece to the eye! The raised lettering truly makes it look like an antique bottle and it's quite heavy and durable. (except for the color---it's not red glass but a red wrap. I'll get to that)There is room for a few hummingbirds to feed at a time which makes it even better and they found it quickly. I think that is because the red bottle stands out so well in the tree that it truly drew them to it.I was surprised that the bottle didn't print the recipe for the hummingbird sugar water but that was simple to google.I use raw sugar that isn't bleached and processed and all should know never to put red food coloring in the water as was old school--that actually is toxic and will kill the poor hummingbirds.Even when they are not feeding, this bottle is beautiful. I do clean it out about once a week as I do all feeders because any mold is toxic to birds as well and it can grow easily in sugar water. You have to hand wash this.Really a well done piece BUT I hate I have to hand wash it and frankly because it's got a red colored wrap on it rather than it being real red glass like I originally thought I worry that the red dyes might make this toxic. I can't watch the hummingbirds days after they drink and I have lots of them---my one negative is red real glass would be better for both washing and toxicity.
B001UU01US This is a very attractive hummingbird feeder.  The glass bottle is cast to look like an antique bottle and has a red coating to attract hummingbirds.  The bottle screws into a grey plastic base with a brushed-copper-look top with red metal florets.However, as I was given this to review for the Amazon Vine program and it is a product that has been launched over a year ago, here are my observations based on previous comments and reviews:1) The glass bottle is still coated in red coloring, it is not made of red-glass.2) So far after 3 handwashings, the red coating has still remained intact. I will report back if the coating flakes or peels as mentioned in other reviews.3) The base of the feeder is a hard grey plastic that has so far remained intact with no cracking.4) The top of the base is a brushed metal plate with metal florets where the birds are supposed to feed from. The edges of the metal are slightly sharp so care must be taken when washing.So far I love the look of this feeder - especially the way the colored-antique-look glass catches the sunlight. It looks much better than my red plastic feeders.I will report back if there are problems with peeling or flaking that previous owners of this feeder have experienced.A solid 3-star for looks. Stars were taken off for the use of coated glass instead of actual red glass and the sharp edges of the metal disc.
B001UU01US I've got three other feeders, one being very similar to this, but having a green glass bottle.  I use a solution of one part sugar to four parts boiled and cooled water and the hummingbirds prefer this feeder to the other ones I have.  I think it may be because this one has much more red color than the other three.  It's really easy to clean; the bottom part comes apart into two pieces so you can scrub the inside well and I use a toothbrush on the flowers.  The bottle stays clean with just a rinse every couple of days.  Sometimes I had a little salt and hot water and give it a good shake and rinse well.  If you let it go for a few days, you may need a bottle brush to clean the inside.
B001UU01US I just received the most beautiful hummingbird feeder from Amazon.  The red antique-look bottle is fabulous with an imprint of a humming bird.  The feeder is easy to fill and refill for the season and looks so elegant hanging on my back deck for the hummers to now flock to the sweet insides!!  Get one for you nad your best friend. Beautiful indeed!!  (Perky-Pet Antique Glass Bottle 16-ounce Hummingbird Feeder)
B001UU01US This is a gorgeous bird feeder.  It is made from a beautiful, red piece of sturdy glass. It further has a hummingbird etch with the brand name on the bottle.  There is also a strong hanger to attach to a tree or deck.  The bottom of the feeder has a high quality, brushed nickel look to it that compliments the red.  There are 4 metal flowers that are of high quality on the base where the birds drink from.  It holds 16 ounces and I like that I don't need to dye the liquid due to the red glass.  It is beautiful when the sun hits the glass.  This really is the prettiest, highest quality bird feeder I have ever owned.  Highly recommended for self and gifts.
B001UU01US This item is a gorgeous red glass jar (made to look like older jars) with a secure metal ring at top for hanging and a nice metal/hard plastic design for dispensing.  The first thing you notice when you open this item is how elegant the glass is formed, the hummingbird in the glass is gorgeous and looks amazing when the sun comes through it.  The metal flowers with hole for the hummingbird are well made and felt tight and secured to the case, and the bottom screw on part is well made and felt sturdy.  I always use the pre made hummingbird food (no mixing required) and all I did was pour it into the nozzle (pour slowly, since the nozzle is small or use a funnel), and then screw on the bottom part (which tightly holds the metal flowers in place) -- Also you can fill the jar up to the mouth since it is going to pour some into the bottom part when you flip it).  Once you are done you can flip it, and then you will hear some of the food going into the bottom part and filling up so that the hummingbirds can get to it.  The metal flowers and base are tightly held together (tighten the screw on base tight (don't break it, but give it a little pressure)) and I had no leakage of any food and did not lose any (my old plastic one would lose it when I flipped it), but since this one has to fill the base up it has time to make the flip without losing any food.In the end this looks gorgeous in my garden and is well made, and hangs easily and securely.  I like the metal flowers and design of this one, and feel that it will last for a long time (my plastic flowers were breaking to pieces on my old feeder), and the adding food is super easy, since you have time to make the flip without losing food.  Also, the glass and metal is heavy so it hangs straight down and the wind does not cause it to move too much (my old one would swing and lose food during heavy wind).  I am very happy with this item and it looks amazing in my garden!  Highly recommend it and am loving the way it looks and the easy of filling!!!
B001UU01US So far I cannot say I am displeased with this hummingbird feeder.  Feeders such as this are a rather big deal with my wife and me and this is the eighth one which will be hanging around our back porch.  All of our feeders are quite large but we have to refill at least two of them per day (We try to stagger them) during the peak of the season.  We have a lot of hummingbirds.  We live in the woods and our entire yard and orchard have been designed and planted to attract birds.Anyway, I will say that this is the most attractive feeder we have.  The hummingbirds themselves don't seem to place aesthetics high on their list of requirements, but it is very pleasing to the eye of us humans.  I found the feeder to be easy to load (we make our own nectar; make it by the gallon as a matter of fact, and even though the neck of this bottle is a bit narrow, we had no problems.  I have special hangers built for all of our feeders and the attachment at the top of the bottle worked well with my homemade hanging devices.This is made of glass which is an absolute requirement for the feeders we use as we have found over the years that plastic just does not hold up well and is much, much more difficult to keep clean.  I use a small bottle brush on our feeders and the same brush works well with this product.  Feeders, by the way, should be cleaned at least twice a week and unused nectar, if any, should be removed.  DO NOT put this thing in the dishwasher.  For one, the detergent is not good for the birds and it is impossible for a dishwasher to clean this item properly.  It is the INSIDE that is important and NOT the outside!  A damp cloth will work nicely on the outside.The bottom of this feeder is metal and has a silver and pewter look to it.  The flowers on it are reddish.  Red attracts hummingbirds so between the bottle and the flowers, this is already a very popular item among our current flock.So far I have found no leakage.  We really do not have all that much of a bee problem here, but we do have a horrible ant problem.  Like my other feeders, I thickly coat the insulated wire I hang these feeders on with Vaseline.  This stops the ant problem but the Vaseline must be reapplied ever-so-often.I like the red color of the bottle.  We do not use any sort of dye in our nectar but red is a requirement to effectively attract these birds.  I note that other reviewers have stated that the red seems to peel off over time and washing.  So far we have not had that problem.  We have been washing this with very hot water with a five percent bleach solution I am going to be somewhat put out if this things starts peeling.  We shall see.  I suspect that some of this peeling problem may be due to dishwasher use or the use of overly harsh detergents.  The company should note this in their product description and directions.Right now I am giving this product five stars.  Should it start peeling after time I will reduce the star rating as required.Don BlankenshipThe Ozarks
B001UU01US Common wisdom is to not feed hummingbirds colored nectar -- and I don't -- but they still love red, and this feeder is an instant magnet if you have any in the neighborhood.  I have another hummingbird feeder already hung, but the little hummers went right for this one and bypassed the other, even though both had fresh homemade nectar inside.  It took no more than 30 minutes to get my first hummingbird at this feeder.I like that the bottom of the feeder, made entirely of metal, comes apart to enable washing the inside.  The top metal plate fits on a lip so that it doesn't leak.  The construction makes it a little awkward to reassemble because you have to work with three parts, not just two, but the seal is worth the extra seconds it takes to put together.I expected a round glass feeder from the product photo, but it is a flattened bottle, shaped more like an antique medicine bottle or flask.  Because some people had complained about the red being only a coating, I expected the exterior of the bottle to have a plastic-y feeling.  It doesn't.  If I hadn't read other reviews, I wouldn't know that the glass is not red through and through.  The instructions recommend hand washing only, with either plain water or a vinegar/water solution.  It is not dishwasher or bleach safe.  The metal hook attached to the top is sturdy.I have yet to find a perfect feeder, although this one is near the top.-- Debbie Lee Wesselmann
B001UU01US Yes, the warning about color given by other reviewers still holds true.In my case, I was trying to be very careful not to cause any color to come off. But then I tried to remove the sticker that says \"Glass\" in 3 languages. Sure enough, as I began to peel it off, I could see that the color was coming up with it! Fortunately for me, I quit before it was off and was able to just leave it there. But I know that with time, it will continue to wear.I could not discern, from the commercial photos, that this is a flask, not a round bottle. I don't care for the shape. Also...even though we all know hummers CAN hover while they eat...they'd rather have a perch!UPDATE: Although one reviewer said that there is no problem from mildew with these Perky Pet feeders, I was surprised this morning to discover lots of mildew on one feeder. My birds had not been using one of the feeders so I finally took it down to see why. The base was full of mildew. All around the join of the two pieces, but also on the interior around the inside edges and down around the baffles. Yes, I should have cleaned it earlier. But I just thought I'd let folks know that mildew can take over this kind too.
B001UU01US The pictures do not do this hummingbird feeder justice! When it arrived I was surprised at how beautiful it is and how tacky my red and yellow feeder looked. For the price the quality is phenomenal. Some reviewers have complained that the glass has begun to fade, I haven't had it long enough to say, but it does not seem like the red should come off. The glass actually looks like it is tinted red, and I have not seen any fading in a month in scorching Arizona sun I don't know if the company changed the way they manufacture them or if other reviewers washed it with hot water (dishwasher?).I love hummingbird feeders and am happy to have this elegant feeder as a backyard decorative accent. The birds love it, and it doesn't degrade the \"look\" of the yard like the cheaper feeders I had used previously. I will be buying these as gifts for the hummingbird lovers in my life (Mom, if you are reading this close the browser now and forget your read this so you can be surprised when your birthday comes).
B001UU01US My previous hummingbird feeder wasn't very good. All plastic, cost about three bucks at the Wal-Place. This one is much nicer. Glass feeder, a metal flowery cover thing, and a plastic (but decent) solution-holding base. This feeder holds more, and I expect it to last a lot longer than, my cheaper feeder. When I opened it, there were flakes of red stuff all over the thing. They washed off easily, but as others have stated, I would have preferred red glass, rather than red flakey plastic crap *on* the glass. But, it's been hanging a month, the birds have found it and use it regularly, and I haven't yet had any issues with red stuff flaking off when I wash it.Anyway, it looks nice, cleans fairly easily, and works fine. The birds don't mind it, and neither do I.
B001UU01US This feeder was an immediate hit. It joined 4 other feeders and became the first choice. This is a recommended buy. See the uploaded pictures.
B001UU01US This feeder is painted red glass, not solid red-colored glass. I imagine with weather and such, that red coating will wear off over time.  It's red to attract the hummingbirds, who like bright colored flowers. The sixteen ounce size has one advantage and one disadvantage. Advantage; light enough to hang because there isn't so much sugar water inside to weigh down a branch, let's say, on a small tree or bush. Disadvantage; those birds are voracious. It empties in no time. So I rate it \"ok\" --does the job. Perhaps there is something better out there but this is the only one I've tried.
B001UU01US I loved the look of this hummingbird feeder. The fact it is glass and has a vintage design were a big plus in making this choice. Let me tell you my mistakes so you don't make them also. I used a powder form food. I made the mistake of putting the powder in the bottle with a wax paper funnel. Then the water. Now you have no way to shake it. The feeder area is metal and the base is plastic, why plastic I do not know that is not vintage. They are 2 separate pieces and you must make sure to screw the bottle very tight to hold them together. So lesson learned make up the mix and pour in.Next issue if you are using a shepherds hook with a wide curve at the end you will spill some liquid out when you place it on the hook as the drop from the bottle to the top of the hook is not very long.The good news is the feeder looks very attractive in my Victorian backyard garden. It is a 5 star to look at but a 3 star for ease of filing and mess it makes and lost when hanging.
B001UU01US This colorful vintage looking feeder is a welcome edition to our garden.  It was packaged securely and appears to be made well.  I was concerned about how it will hold up due to comments by other reviewers.  I am very happy to report that I hand washed this feeder with regular dawn and had no trouble with the vibrant red color fading.  The only real issue I have is the narrow opening for filling this.  I had to use a funnel, as there was no other way to quickly refill this. 4 stars
B001UU01US I love the look of this hanging outside half-nestled and hidden among the red pansies and fuchsia with gladiolus and hibiscus a little bit off to the side. The glass itself is long and flask-like and held more sugar-water than I thought it would. There are four actual little feed-spots which are rather small compared to the red of the glass. The metal of the dish is thin and has a sort of hammered feel to it. The same metal but thick and sturdy is wrapped around the top of the red glass to hold the feeder aloft with a handle. The glass and metal cause it to be heavier than other hummingbird feeders I have had but I like that since it hangs better and doesn't blow in the breeze and spill out the sugar-water.  I have seen a few visitors (I'm not sure if it is just the same visitor or if he has started bringing in his friends yet...) at the feeder but it is still early in the season.
B001UU01US I gave this to my 82 year old mother for Christmas.  What do you get for someone who doesn't need anything?  A beautiful red glass hummingbird feeder.  It looks great...no plastic...all metal and glass...and it has held up during some terrible wind storms. The large red glass bottle really stands out.  The little hummers are in and out of it all day long.  Great quality.  Well worth the price.
B001UU01US One would think that there's not much to be said regarding a hummingbird feeder. Unfortunately, this hummingbird feeder merits some attention for the wrong reasons. There are some good features with this feeder, too, but the bad should not be ignored.As delivered, this is a very attractive and well-made feeder. The base is well-designed and in my observation it does not leak when properly assembled. I have read reviews that claim that this style of base (which Perky Pet uses with more than one feeder design) tends to leak but that has not been the case for us. I honestly believe it comes down to proper assembly.The red glass bottle is very pretty - at first. The problem is that it's not red glass. It's clear glass that's simply painted red. Worse, the paint has a bad tendency to peel when wet and chip when dry. What is the point, then, if it's not going to retain the red color? I have a red Nalgene drinking bottle that is sturdy and scratch-resistant - why not make the feeder bottle from the same material, or use a real red glass bottle instead?The feeder's harness which is used to hang it up is my other major complaint. It is exposed metal, which over time will corrode and rust. It would have been a small things to either coat the harness or insulate it in plastic to make it weather resistant.My complaints would be for nothing if the hummingbirds came to this feeder. So far, we have not attracted any to this feeder, though two other feeders we have see activity all day long (one in particular often has three or four hummingbirds on it at the same time).From my observations and experience, I just can't recommend this feeder. It's very pretty and the base is designed well, but unfortunately it falls short on a number of other points - most important of which is the lack of hummingbird visits. Consider other feeders before trying this one. This feeder, for us, is little more than a decoration.
B001UU01US This red antique bottle hummingbird feeder is really beautiful. One thing that you cannot tell from the picture is that this bottle is not round, but a rounded flat bottle, with a sculpted glass hummingbird on one of the flat sides. The red glass is really pretty and it looks much nicer than a clear glass and red plastic feeder. Another nice thing about this feeder is that the bottom flowers are made out of metal, it looks much nicer than red and yellow plastic.Besides looking nice, this feeder is easy to fill, just unscrew the bottom flower portion and fill with two cups of hummingbird nectar. I make mine with 1 part sugar to 4 parts water, so I use a 1/2 cup of sugar to 2 cups of water and bring to a slight boil, then let cool and fill feeder. The top of the bottle is narrow so you will need a measuring cup with a spout or a funnel to fill without spilling.I have a feeder on the patio that gets a lot of hummer action, so I hung this one outside of my office window. Once they finally discovered it, the hummers love it. This is a really nice looking feeder that is also functional.
B001UU01US I read that the red peeled off of the bottle. So far, I have only filled it, haven't washed it yet. I will edit my review if it peels. I do like the way the bottom comes apart so that I can clean the inside of it.  No humming birds have come our way yet. Kind of disappointing but hopefully, one day they will find our feeder.
B001UU01US Beautiful feeder that works well. Was easy to fill and is easy to clean.. not very large but good for a small area. Looks great and hummingbirds love it... only took off one star because as so many reviewers have stated the glass itself isn't red it's a coating and that is highly impractial for something that has to be cleaned so often. Other than that had no problems with it. The very bottom is plastic but the rest seems well made.
B001UU01US Great for feeding hummingbirds we have about 8 that frequent our feeders.The only downside is the bottle is hard to clean, and it is not Red glass, it is painted glass so it will peel leaving you with a clear bottle.
B001UU01US First off, this feeder just looks great.  It has the look of a hand-crafted feeder, looking like someone took an antique bottle and made a bronze bottom with lovely little flowers on it.  Of course, it's not an authentic antique.  It just looks like one online and, honestly, in person.  It is, however, much more affordable and a great option among other more standard looking feeders. My wife was delighted when she saw it, as was I.It's also very sturdy and easy to work with--to fill and to clean.I'd suggest hand washing it. Do that, and this will serve you and your local hummers for a long time while added a bit of character to your yard.
B001UU01US UPDATE::: 6/5/12I'M tentatively taking away a star because, guess what?!?, our little guests don't seem to like this feeder.  We aren't swamped this year --only 2 that are hanging around-- but both are showing an overwhelming preference for our older Perky-Pet model.  (Note: we only get Ruby-Throats here.)ORIGINAL REVIEW:::My current Hummingbird Feeder is the classicPerky-Pet Plasic feeder with the little perches.  And gosh, I guess I've been using these for decades.  The advantage of the plastic ones is that you can purchase extra beeguards when the old ones get moldy, and you can toss the whole thing if it gets yucky over the winter, without a big hit to the wallet.  I love this type because of these things, and because the Hummers love to sit while they eat.  Or at least mine are sort of lazy.  Plus it allows my sugar-junky Titmouse to snack as well.Still, I'm a sucker for additional bird gear, so when this antique glass version became available I thought I'd take a look at it.In appearance it's very pretty.  The bottle looks like an antique and has a nice imprint of a majestic hummer on the side.  The base is burnished aluminum and little redish aluminum flowers sit on top of it.  The base breaks apart for cleaning and looks sturdy enough, although only time will tell how the metal flowers --which can't be replaced-- hold up and attract birds.POSITIVES:::--Very pretty.--Bottle is red and theoretically this should make is very appealing to Hummingbirds.--Since Bottle is red you won't be tempted to add dye to make the sugar red.  (dye is not recommended)--The bottle was easy to clean with a standard small bottle brush.--If you have dozens of hungry hummers, this bottle takes 16 oz.  Which is huge.  So huge that I'll suggest you not fill it all the way if you have a normal amount of visitors because the sugar solution goes bad quickly in warm weather.NEGATIVES:::--The nice red color might make it more difficult to see whether the inside is clean.--The 'flowers' are not removable and might be difficult to clean.--The huge 16oz size makes for a beautiful feeder, however that's too much food and people who fill it up, might not clean and refill often enough, sickening birds.POSSIBLE NEGATIVES:::--No beeguards and 'flowers' are not replaceable.  Will have to wait and see if they can be cleaned.--I just noticed that some of the reviewers have said that the red pealed off their bottles.  Now I washed ours before filling it and didn't have any problem, but it would be disappointing if this will occur to everyone's feeder.  We'll see.Overall, I really like the look of this feeder.  And I'll report back about success.Pam T~bird lover
B001UU01US Living in San Diego, I constantly have hummingbirds in my back yard, and I've tried several different feeders. This is the first glass one I've tried, after going through a few plastic ones in the past. (And based on that experience, I recommend staying away from plastic, by the way. Temperature variances will eventually create small leaks as the plastic expands and contracts, causing the liquid to drip down to the ground. Ants love it! I've seen this happen with every single plastic feeder I've had after some time.)This glass hummingbird feeder has a beautiful design and is built very sturdily. And - no leaks! The only issue I've seen (from other reviewers) is that the glass is apparently not real colored glass but just transparent glass with cheap paint that comes off if you wash the feeder. So, it's probably best to just rinse the feeder out with the garden hose instead of trying to wash it with warm soapy water, if you want to keep it looking nice and new. If you take that simple precaution, I think you'll be quite pleased with this feeder.
B001UU01US I love this feeder, and it looks great on the porch, but I haven't really seen any humming birds around it yet.  I think I'm not in a good area for those things.  Plus it's probably not the time of year for them to come out.  I don't know.  But it looks good anyway, and I like it.  It's also very easy to clean compared to other humming bird feeders.
B001UU01US Positive:Hummers like it.  Red color is lovely.  Glass tends to hold up to UV better.  Bee's tried but did not seem to succeed in feeding.  Base is easy to clean as it comes apart.  Does not drip.Negative:The bottle neck is narrow and a bit hard to fill.  Makes cleaning inside difficult (you will need a bottle brush).  Really should just use red glass instead of coating.  Also, the red glass makes it hard to see when the solution is getting cloudy and spoiling from the heat.  One star off for these.Neutral: Top of base is metal, bottom is plastic.  I like a resting place for the birds so they stay a bit longer.  It is easy to clean.By the way, you can easily make your own nectar.  Please do not dye it red (this bottle is red enough to attract them!).  Recipe is 1 part sugar to 4 parts water.  I make mine by adding the sugar to a clean juice bottle (originally held cranberry juice) and adding boiling water and then shaking.  This is quick and easy.  I marked a one cup mark on the bottle with a Sharpie and then the height of the water to add.*UPDATE  Removed a star.  Red coating is starting to peel off after a month.  Was only gently hand washed.  Still works, but does not look as nice.
B001UU01US What we have here is a very pretty, and surprisingly large, glass hummingbird feeder.The bottle looks every bit the antique part with bas relief designs on it and the metal loop on top is securely fastened for easy hanging. The base is a metal/plastic combination and on it are the metallic faux feed-port blooms which really look awesome. The whole base comes apart with a few twists for easy cleaning and refilling.Very happy with the form and function of the Perky-Pet 8109-2 (not the best name though guys!) and I look forward to having many new hummingbird friends enjoy a sweet drink or two from it during the summer.
B001UV6P9I Arrived discreetly, well packed and on time a month ago. Has been working well witth low heat output for vegetating. Would definitely recommend for anyone needing a good seedling, clone and vegetating light.
B001UV6P9I This is a great light for any starter setup. The light is bright enough that you don't have to put it right next to the plants, and it's very easy to hang with it's included hooks. No S hooks included, but if you have anything that a S hook can attach to, this will most likely work without them. I've noticed the bulb appears to be a little too heavy for the socket as it kind of hangs low, but it seems to be stable there.Note there's no on or off switch on this, so you will most likely need a timer for it, which you should have anyway if you use lights on plants.
B001UV6P9I I looked at the Lumens output for my needs and for a somewhat small garden this light is an excellent price and worked fine right outta the box.Bulb was good,everything seemed as I was hoping it to be.Two of these would be awesome for most ANY indoor grow situation.Excellent price for (what I can tell thus far) an excelent product!!! Shipped quick and had it in a few short days.EDIT:Well its been several months with off and on use.One of the two bulbs(I have two of these lights)went out with a extra fun sqeek and a mild electrical smell.So,in review.These lights are really greatfor the price.But i think its hit or miss as to how long the bulbs will last.My second one is still going strong and it was bought a few weeks after the one that went out most recent.Im upgrading to a T-5 2ft 4 Bulb.Same company i believe but we'll see.
B001UV6P9I Straight out of the package, running on 96 hours straight.  Nice item and the light/heat it gives off is just enough.  Will update post in the following months to make sure the bulb has lasted.  So far, so good!
B001UV6P9I I ordered this on Oct 10th,got it the 15th.Perfect for starting seedings & vegging stage of plants.Working very well & bright,I'm using two currantly in a 24x48 area with very low temps inside the grow area.Great prod
B001UV6P9I VERY bright, good sturdy construction (other than noted below), easy to assemble and plants respond very well.My only complaint is that the bulb is a minor defect with the bulb itself. It has some \"play/movement\". It doesn't seem seated well in it's base, but it's a minor issue since it still works well. I didn't think it worth returning the unit over since it still operates great.Didn't come with hanging chains. Had to improvise that.
B001UV6P9I I almost went with Hydrofarm jumpstart setup, but was on the fence about purchasing it with a stand I didnt need. I also ran across a jumpstart light at a local nursery and wasnt impressed, especially of all the spindley plants under it. I am pretty new to germinating my own seeds and fairly new to gardening so I don't know a whole lot about whats top of the line or better, but I was blown away by the quality of this fixture and size of the bulb! I have germinated lots of plants so far this season with this light along side using the germinating heat mat. I set this up inside a greenhouse tent in our house next to a south facing window. I run the germinating mat at night and plugg the light in during the day with the added supplimental light from the windows. When it was still getting dark fairly early and well into the morning, it was nice being able to keep my seedlings under enough light as they needed. I added a photo to this page and you can see where I lined the inside of the guard with foil and made an added shade on the side so it would be more reflective and block the light from shining out into the rest of the room. The bulb does put out a bit of heat, but that's expected and doesnt seem to be enough to be any sort of problem.I plan to purchase another one of these for a the second shelf of the greenhouse since the light cant see past all the trays to the space below. I am very happy with this purchase and see no need for anything higher wattage for the time being. I couldnt recommend enough!
B001UV6P9I I use several of these lights for side lighting and the T-5 fluorescent 8-2ft tube fixture for horizontal, above the canopy lighting.  They burn very little electricity and give off a small amount of heat.
B001UV6P9I I wasn't sure if this would grow what I needed, but it turned out to be just fine.  Follow the instructions for your plant(s) and you'll be OK.  I'll be buying another one of these soon.  Thanks to Hydrofarm.
B001V6WXEI Best price I could find, and it works, just like it should. I mix it with coconut coir for a soil-less growing medium. Couldn't be happier.
B001V6WXEI The perlite was a mix of different sized perlite from very small to some about 1/4 inch in size. It's very light but easy to handle as long as a strong wind isn't going by as you're pouring the dry stuff. I'm using it to hold my strawberry plants in place in their hydroponic containers, and it's doing that well. I plan to buy more of this perlite in the future.
B001V6WXEI it's perlite. does what it says on the tin (bag - whatever)have not needed a mask or anything (people may be thinking of vermiculite aka asbestos)
B001V6WXEI I HAVE BEEN USING FOAM PRODUCT AS A PLANTING MEDIA FOR MY HYDROPONIC SETUP. I DECIDED TO TRY THIS ALONG WITH A COCO PRODUCT. SO FAR SO GOOD, BUT IT'S MUCH MORE MESSY THAN THE FOAM PRODUCT.
B001V6WXEI My favorite perlite on the market, and you cannot beat the Amazon prize. I primarily use this perlite for propagation rather than using just potting soil which houses more microbes that may mess up the young rootlets. As long as it's kept moist, my propagations do well. The upside with using this for propagating is that I can rinse it, sun dry it in shallow trays, and reuse it for later propagations... sorry, Hoffman! =)
B001V6WXEI Not much to says about rocks,but it was the biggest bag for the best price.Plus it has big and small chunks in it.Big thumbs up on this!!
B001VEJHSU Received this item today.....charged the battery in about 30-40 min and took it out for a test run....Edged the front lawn by the 156 ft of sidewalk (both sides)that's over 300ft! and the driveway edges in no time and did a GREAT job.....then went out back to tackle the 9 brick and stone lined gardens....again did over 1/2 of the back before battery needed a quick recharge....went in to put battery on the charger and and registered product for the warranty on-line..had a coffee and battery was ready to finish...Did a great job...quite, powerful, clean and so light weight! Looks like gas trimmer will sit on rack most of the time now....this will do my over 1/2 acre yard so easy....Love it!
B001VEJHSU UPDATE 5/17/12:  Here it is almost 2 years after my original review, and I still love this product.  Finally, a yard trimmer that's truly lightweight, and because of its telescoping wand gives someone who isn't 6'2\" comfort.  This Worx is like the energizer bunny .... just keeps going and going.  The auto line feature is great, and I still haven't had to replace a spool yet.  After each use, I immediately charge the battery which only takes a few minutes.  And I've even kept the battery charged through Winter months of non use.  Perhaps this is the secret to a long battery life.  I can't say enough good about this, and don't understand why there are so many negative reviews.The WG151.5 is the best trimmer/edger I've ever had!  Wave goodbye to dragging around electric cords, bumping the head to lengthen trimming line that breaks repeatedly, and man-handling a tool that wasn't built for a petite woman like myself.  Kudos to Worx for producing this tool with a telescoping handle that can appeal to all size gardeners.The 30-minute battery quick-charge is a plus that got me motivated in short time.  This tool trimmed around all my gardens (front and back) without breaking the line, and impressively ate its way through patches of crab grass, weeds, and clover with power to spare.  (Hey, as long as it's green and growing, it has a place in my yard!)  The battery never did run down; and as a further test of the WG151.5's capability, it had rained recently and everything was still damp.This particular model is a great piece of equipment with many useful features, and well worth the price.
B001VEJHSU I purchased this grass trimmer to replace a Black & Decker trimmer that comes with the usual useless ni-cad battery that lasts about 1 1/2 minutes and takes forever to charge with the rinky dink charger that came with the unit. The Worx has a lithium-ion battery that provides excellent use time and a first rate charger that charges quickly and indicates when the charge is complete. I also have the Worx hedge trimmer that replaced a similarly useless Black & Decker. I hope that Worx keeps up the good work and offers more of these type outdoor tools. I have several more poor quality Black & Decker items I would love to replace.
B001VEJHSU I received this product as a combo package with the blower from another online retailer, the combo from Amazon also includes a hedge trimmer which I do not need.  Before making my purchase I read all the reviews I could find and I believe my expectations were realistic.  I was in need of a decent trimmer that didn't require dragging 100+ feet of cord.  I've owned gas trimmers before and they have their own set of drawbacks, primarily weight and often being difficult to start.Enter the Worx GT WG151.5 as a possible solution.  Cutting performance is about on par with my expections which would roughly equal a very small and inexpensive electric corded trimmer.  It will cut tall grass and weeds but not quickly.  Larger diameter or woody weeds create a challenge it has difficulty overcoming.  It is a useful tool as long as you don't expect performance equal to heavy duty corded trimmers or gas trimmers.  If that is what you want, look elsewhere.The Good:It is lightweight making it easy to carry and use.  Depending on the task, battery life is about 20 or 25 minutes but can be lower if you work it hard.  The battery charger does recharge the lithium ion battery in the claimed 30 minutes, a big plus over other battery types.  Worx equips the trimmer/edger with a proprietary spool of \"double helix\" line which does seem to cut better than regular round line.  With a quick twist the Worx GT is turned into a wheeled edger; perfect for trimming along sidewalks and flower beds.  Cut/head angle is easily adjusted to personal preference.  Shaft length is also adjustable.  Over all, with all the available adjustments, it can easily be used by everyone.  The battery is interchangeable with other Worx products which use the 18v lithium ion battery (Note:  not compatible with devices using the NiCad battery).The Not So Good:Not powerful enough to quickly cut through heavier grass growth or large weeds.  If you have a larger property, expect to need to recharge the battery multiple times.  I have about 1/3 acre on a corner lot and need to recharge the battery 3 or 4 times.  If you've worked it hard, you will need to let the battery cool a few minutes before attempting to recharge it.  For convenience I ordered a spare battery ($60 - $80 with the best price right here on Amazon.com) and have one charging while using the other.  There is only 10' of \"double helix\" line on a spool so expect to change the spools often or buy .065 line in bulk and rewind spools yourself.  The round line doesn't cut as well as the proprietary line but is more cost effective and isn't as easily broken.  Line is fed each time you release the trigger whether it needs it or not so that 10' can go very quickly.All in all, I'm pleased with my purchase.
B001VEJHSU --UPDATE!! 1/2012 ---So I received my replacement battery back in November and I hadn't updated my review as fast I was thought I would. The new battery has a different color button to pop it off the charger so it's obvious Worx is trying to distinguish the bad batteries from the new ones. The battery came to me free of charge and they even included 2 spools of trimmer line, a nice free addition given they sold me a broken battery to begin with. I've charge the battery several times and have used it and it's working perfectly now. If you have the Worx check your warranty status to see if your battery is part of the recall, you'll be much happier if it is and you get it replaced.--UPDATE!! 10/2011---I was finally going to trash my work gt and did one last check of reviews to see if others had issues. Turns out one other owner found out about a battery recall. Sure enough I went to the site, put in my battery info and Worx confirmed my battery was eligible for free replacement. To see if your battery is on the list as well you can go to(...) and in 3 simple steps it tells you if you are eligible or not. I expect my new battery in the next 7-10 days.Sure would have been nice if Worx got in touch with me since I did register my trimmer instead of me having to find out via another reviewer. Talk about lousy service.---UPDATE---After only 3 months of owning this the battery went bad and will NOT hold a charge. It is flashing on the charger the red light which per the charger means to dispose of the battery... After only 2 months???? What a piece of junk! Worst purchase ever. I pulled out my old black and decker cordless trimmer out which hasn't been used in 3 months and it worked beautifully. I'm dumping this Worx and going back to my old trimmer. I wish I could get my money back but it's past 30 days. What a waste of money.-------------I have a small yard and used a black and decker cordless charger for years. It was finally time to retire it and after much research I opted to get the WORX GT. The price range was similar to other models I was looking at so I figured why not give it a try.The worx showed up and I instantly hung up the mounting brackets for the charger and trimmer, it was easy and sturdy. The trimmer itself was quick and easy to assemble. I will say one thing I DON'T like is the amount of line on the spool. I actually ordered replacement spools from WORX website for $6 for 6 spools. Not a bad deal, but it seems like the line itself is short. BUT after using the trimmer it does cut standard weeds and brush and I was surprised the auto feed actually works.The battery itself lasted about 20 minutes of use and like it says it works just fine at full strength and then it just dies on you. I like that there is no loss of power until it's dead. What I did was trimmed the yard as much as I could then when the battery died I put the battery on the charger and mowed the yard. By the time I was done I was ready to finish up the trimming.I wasn't sure about the feel of this thing. With the extra large adjustable handle, adjustable head, etc it just seemed like too much. But the more I used it the more I found that there were specific angles I liked it set at that my old trimmer didn't have. And I was actually able to do like they show in the commercial and put the head flat and reach the thing under my deck and get way in there. It really is a neat tool and does the job like it should.Overall I am impressed and do recommend this trimmer.  Don't expect a long battery life, 20 minutes is what I got, I suspect after a few charges it will increase a little, but 20 minutes at full power is what I would want rather then 30 minutes with power loss immediately.
B001VEJHSU I have used this product twice. It works well and the battery charging is fast. The edger function did not work well for me. It could be the type of grass in my lawn. Overall a good product and very ergonomic.This is an addition to my review above and a few months later. I reduced the rating for this product to one star or perhaps 0 stars. I have used it no more than five times since I bought this a few months ago. The battery just died and could not be revived even after several attempts at recharging for the specified time and more.I will stick to known and tried brands next time I buy another weed whacker.This is an addition to my review above. I was ready to throw this weed whacker when I saw the worx website on the warranty card. It has a two year warranty. In the worx website was a link to battery trouble shooting. After I put in the battery's serial # and model # I was taken to a free battery replacement order form. It seems to me they know about this battery problem and is replacing those thru their website. I am waiting for the delivery of the replacement battery.Another addition to my review. Have received the battery replacement and so far after several weeks, the new battery is keeping it's charge.
B001VEJHSU I used to use the Black & Decker 18volt cordless lawn tools that used those horrible ni-cad batteries that never lasted more than a year and required holding your breath just right in order for them to charge back to full, and even then, it seems that most after a few times of use would never charge back enough to give full power to the tools (the bush trimmer, after only a few uses was virtually worthless because none of the batteries could charge fully enough to give it enough power to go thru anything). I finally got tired and frustrated with continually low charge and no power to do anything and have been gradually replacing the B&D 18v Ni-Cad yard tools with the Worx line of Li-Ion cordless lawn tools.  I've had the worx weed whacker since christmas, and I love it - not only does it maintain full battery charge for longer than the old Black & Deckers, but it was much more powerful than the B&D was the first time I used them.  With this trimmer, I've never run out of battery in the middle of doing the front yard like I used to (so frustrating to have to leave your yard half done while you charge batteries overnight!), and if I ever do run it down, it only takes 30mins. to charge it and get back to work.  I've never fully it run it down to see, but I think I usually get at least an hours run time out of one battery, which is more than enough.  The only drawback to the Worx weed whacker is the small spools - sure you can order 6 spools for $6 from Worx online, but it runs thru them very quickly because they are very small spools that don't hold a lot of string - but this is an annoyance I can live with - I estimate I am using about one spool every 2-3 weeks in the summer.  I also like the fact that the Worx tools are much smaller and streamlined than the B&D tools, not just the battery, but the motor housing is smaller too - not a bunch of unnecessarily large plastic housing, but the weed whacker handle still extends out to a comfortable length for taller people.  I guess B&D makes their lawn tools look big and bulky so the men will feel manly when they use them, but I'm a petite woman, and I appreciate that Worx doesn't make their tools any larger than they need to be, while still functioning perfectly and having plenty of power.  So for anyone out there still struggling with crappy NI-Cad yard tools and perpetually low batteries - get the Worx Li-ion tools - you won't regret it.
B001VEJHSU My mom uses this for trimming around the yard.  No gas and no electric cord.  Very light weight and gets the job done.  Battery last much longer than needed for the job.  Perfect for those who do not what to deal with a gas trimmer and much safer than an electric cord.  The lithium ion battery should last for years.  Very happy with purchase.
B001VNC5TO There are some really good aspects of these skewers. They appear to be well-constructed, functional, and easy to use. The twin prongs work well to hold the ingredients without spinning. Other skewers, even those with flat blades, usually have some rotation. I usually notice this when flipping the skewers, after the ingredients have cooked a while. With these, the food stays put even after flipping the skewers several times.Removing the food is a breeze with the pusher. I really like this feature and have managed to avoid poking myself so far. The solid wood handle also helps a lot. With all metal skewers, I'm usually holding the (hot!) end with a fork and trying to slide the food with another fork. On these skewers, I still slide the pusher with a fork, but the food pretty much goes where I expect it.A few minor points: the steel is not high quality--a magnet clings easily to the prongs and pusher--so they may rust or corrode; there are no instructions beyond the basic insert included with all Tom Douglas products; and in this price range I would expect a cover or carrying case. Otherwise it's a very nice product.
B001VNC5TO The skewers impressed me right out of the box with the comfortable, good looking wood handles and the thick 1/8\" stainless steel prongs. The usable food stacking length is 10\" for a generous single serving. The points are sharp enough to make loading a snap and I greatly appreciate the stainless steel sliding disks to make removing the food quick and easy. I think they are an excellent value.
B001VNC5TO These are quality skewers. I use them primarily for shrimp and they do an excellent job. The ends are sharp enough to pierce the shrimp with little effort. The design keeps the shrimp from falling off. There is a small coin-shaped disk that can be used to help with removal of the food.They work equally well for other types of food. These are the best skewers I have ever used.
B001VNC5TO I know, I know, you don't see what makes these so special.  It's just a stick for meat and veggies to go on, right?Well, yeah.  But I really liked these a lot more than I thought I would and will probably be buying several.The wood handles are quality.  I have run mine in the dishwasher a few times (top rack) and they look new.  That's critical to me.  If it can't survive the dishwasher, I don't want it.Each skewer is two long prongs.  They are at a slight angle, which provides just enough tension to keep food in place without stressing delicate food (stretching or compressing it).  This sounds ridiculously picky, but that's the basic requirement I have.  Hold the food in place without destroying it.the little coin thing you see in the picture, near the handle, slides up the prongs up to a little catch on the end of the prongs.  This catch is no problem for food to go over, and the coin thing makes getting food off a skewer a lot easier than expected.  I haven't had any problems.I have some much more primitive skewers that don't hold meat in place and are harder to remove meat from.  You'd think it would be one of the other.  I'm really pleased with this great design and the quality of the product build.  Buy these!If you spend the money on decent food for grilling, you should have some nice skewers!  They have enhanced the experience for me.  I don't know who Tom Douglas is or what Pinzon is.  I just think this is a quality product.
B001VNC5TO My other half laughed at my excitement over these super nifty kebob skewers...but I had the last laugh after he tried them for the fist time. Sure, shish-kebobs are not exactly a high excitement item nor are they something you prepare every day of the week...which is why it's important to have a good set of kebob skewers available - make it fun rather than frustrating.This set does exactly that. Well designed to address the most common kebob problems including...1. Rotation Rage - y'know what I'm talking about. Twirling tomatoes, precarious pineapple chunks and mushroom that slide in slow motion right off the skewer. All fixed thanks to dual prongs.2. Short Stacks - face it, short stacks are a mans worst nightmare. Few things are worse than a lot of veggies with tiny chunks of meat...much less when the skewer is only a few inches long. Full sized skewers assure a hearty meal.3. Pain - Whether burning your had on metal handles or stabbing yourself while trying to tug/chew food off the skewer, pain is a typical outcome associated with shish kebobs. Pain free food is simple with a ergonomically correct handle that stays cool to the touch and the (very smart) addition of a pusher to easily remove food from the prongs.Bottom line - the most fun, least hassle shish keebob skewers I've ever tried!
B001VNC5TO I have tried numerous skewers over the years:  flat, round, wood, and metal, with varying success.  I have burnt bamboo skewers and had food slide of and into the fire during dinner parties.  I really need some good skewers.  Here are my initial thoughts on these:Pros:The prong tips are sharp enough to pierce meat and vegetables, but not so sharp they are a danger in a drawer.  They came shipped with plastic tip protectors, which look like they are designed to be thrown away and if not will certainly get lost. Plastic straws work well as covers.The prongs are big enough to hold heavy cubes of meat.The skewers are round, but because there are two of them food doesn't stay in one spot when you try to rotate it, a problem with some single-prong round skewers.There is a disk that is supposed to help push the food off the skewer and little bumps near the front that appear to be designed to keep food from slipping off.  The success of these features is dependent on what you are cooking.  Some foods will stick to the skewer and some (like tomatoes) will always try to escape. Never trust a tomato.They feel solid and are said to be dishwasher safe (but hand washing is recommended).  They are too new to determine how well they will hold up over time, but they look like they will last a long while.Cons:It is difficult to use these with a closed grill if you want to cook four sides of a kabob. When sideways the skewers keep the top propped open. Things with only two cooking surfaces, like shrimp, would work well.The prongs are too big for the smaller chunks or strips of meat that I would normally cook on two sides. Bamboo skewers just work better for thinly sliced meats like satays.Because I normally use skewers for big chunks of steak (which I want cooked on four sides)or strips of chicken (which won't fit very well on these large skewers) these skewers won't be the first ones I reach for.  They are excellent for the right applications. If you are a big shrimp griller, these would be great.
B001VNC5TO First, let me confess that these are the only skewers that I own other than using disposable bamboo skewers.What I like: wood handles (to reduce chances of burning hand), metal disc to push the food off easier, double prongs to prevent unweidly food rotation when trying to turn food, and finally think prongs.These are well thought out prongs that are nice to use compared to bamboo.  I am curious to see how the wood will hold up over time.  My competing method, disposable bamboo skewers, allow me to put the whole skewer into the grill but obviously I wouldn't want to do that with these unless maybe I had some aluminum foil under them (which I still may not want to risk).I'd also like to try a single prong skewer that is flat and a bit wider to compare but for now these will do!
B001VNC5TO It's easier to cook all sides evenly with these two-prong skewers, because food won't rotate around a single axis when trying to turn during cooking.  The sliding center ring keeps the prongs separated at an even length, and also helps push the food off the skewer once the food is ready.  The product is well-built and the wood did well in the dishwasher, though it's likely the wood will degrade a little over time with many washings.  I only wish the skewers were at least 2\" longer.
B001VNC5U8 This is a well constructed little wood box. The metal is solid and there are grates on top and bottom which is nice. It can hold about a large handful of wood chips.The cover is difficult to open and close. It would be unsafe to try to remove the cover when it is hot. You certainly can use it without the top though which would work just as well.This box is not meant for slow-cooked smoking or barbecue-ing given the small size. It can't really handle big wood chunks which work well during smoking.The situation I can see this box being useful is for high heat grilling where you are looking for some real wood smoked flavor. You can place this smoker box right on the grates and shut your grill lid to create a smoky environment for your food. Leave the smoker box cover off which allows you to refill the box while cooking.The thing is you can easily replicate the function of this box by wrapping up wood chips in some aluminum foil which is far cheaper and easier to clean up (just throw it away).
B001VNC5U8 I already have a bigger box-style smoker already. I also have the Cameron stove top smoker. This \"Tom Douglas by Pinzon Metal Grill Smoker Box\" is kind of small, about you palm size.However, it's a really well constructed little box...a little bit on the elegant side. Specifically, there is no sharp edge or sharp corner that could be scratch your skin. The holes on the top and bottom are on the smaller size too.Due to the small size, it won't hold big amount of wood chips. Be expecting to refill wood chips for long cooking.The cover is a little tight and hard to open and close. I believe the intent is to make sure the cover does not open if you throw it into the charcol. For my big smoker box, I have to carefully lay it down in the grill to keep the cover close.While trying to refill wood chips during cooking, I put the box in water to cool it down first and then open it safely. This extra step does not add too much hassle, as the bucket for soaking wood chips is usually nearby.I wouldn't recommend to put smoker box (any smoker box) right on top of the charcoal, as the wood chips will burn out too fast and don't have sufficient time to smoke the food and you will be busy in refilling wood chips.All in all, a well made nice little smoker box.
B001VNC5U8 What a fun toy, just add the soaked chips, set on the grill and go. I was using foil, but this is a lot easier, and reusable.
B001VNC5U8 I'm a user of small grills -- not those great big monstrosities that you use for a backyard barbeque (wish I had one, though!) -- so this size smoker is good for me.  If I did have a much larger grill, I might want more than one of these cause you can't get that many chips in it.  It's a very heavy, sturdy  box, so I anticipate it lasting a long time.  I wet the chips, as one of Tom's tips suggested, and I was happy with the amount of smoke that I got -- nice smoky flavor on my chicken. I'm new to smoking, and just recently got a grill with a top (as opposed to the Hibachi I was using) so I'm anxious to try the smoker again with it using different meats!
B001VNC5U8 My main gripe about this box is the shape.  For my gas grill, there is a long narrow spot for smoker boxes where this guy won't fit well.  On the other hand, maybe this oval shape was well-researched to optimized smoking capabilities?  I have no idea because the product literature says nothing in detail about why the box is designed as an oval and why it centralizes the air holes in the middle.  A little more information about the design rationale would be helpful.  I am going to test this box however more to see if it really does perform better than my other box and/or compare it against wrapping wood chips in aluminum foil with a few poked holes.
B001VNC5U8 This little box is a handy size and it's built strong.  I don't see it burning through for years, and the lid fits well.  The lid is easy to get on and off when the box is hot or cold.I've used it 3 times.  I set it on the grate over the coals each time, not IN the coals.  The first two times I was grilling indirect at lower temperatures.  The first time I soaked my chips.  All the while I was cooking I had a light aroma from the chips.  That's what you want.  Thin wispy smoke, that can be hard to see.  If you can smell the wood, you're smoking.  You don't want lots of white smoke pouring out of your vents.  Anyway.... Next time I had the same set up, except I soaked half the chips, and placed them in this chip box with some dry chips.  I got a little smoke for a little while, and then the dry chips all went up at once for a short, intense, smoke bomb.  The third time I was grilling proper, lots of coal, good and hot.  I don't know what happened.  I used soaked chips, and put it over the coals.  But I got no smoke.  The chips were all burned out when I checked it later.  I guess they must have flashed and burned up real fast at that temperature (500*)Chips don't work well with hot intense grilling temperatures.  They make these boxes to help, but I've never seen one that worked real well.  I will continue to use it when I grill indirect I suppose.
B001VNC5U8 I finally got a chance to use this, and well, this is one of those products that you don't really need.  For the amount of smoke flavor that it puts out, soaked wood chips wrapped in a piece of aluminum foil will work just as well.  It's a cute little box that holds a small amount of wood chips and delivers an equally small amount of smoke.  If you just like to have gadgets and cool looking tools then this will fit the bill. Otherwise, save your money and invest in a roll of heavy duty aluminum foil to fashion your own smoker box and call it a day.By the way, the lid is sort of hard to get off, and I broke a nail in the process.
B001VNC5U8 I'm a Texan (Texaswomyn, right?) so I love smoked meat.  Brisket, chicken, ribs, pork chops, beef roast, etc. We've got smokers: two big 'ole charcoal smokers, a big 'ole propane/electric smoker, and I've even got one of them Cameron stove top smokers, (I'm gonna drop the bad grammar now) so I was quite curious about this smoker accessory.  First off, it's small. I mean, Rhode Island small. It's about 6 inches long, 3 inches wide and maybe 1.5 inches tall, so the wood you use to smoke with has to be chipped up very small and it doesn't hold a lot; I didn't weigh or measure what it holds but it's probably not over a cup of chips. One big problem is that small quantity of wood doesn't last long enough to provide a good \"smoke\" flavor and create that highly desired smoke ring on meat.If your only desire is for a hint of smoke to mask the charcoal (and heaven forbid - charcoal lighter fluid) taste from your grilled steak or chicken breast, then this little box will do that, to a small degree.  Be sure you soak the wood first so it lasts a little longer and smokes a little more.And hey, Rhode Island - no offense, OK ya'll?
B001VNC5V2 I had to wait a bit to review this, since several feet of snow on my deck made it impossible to wheel out my grill.  Recently we got a little break in the weather, just enough for a die-hard griller to fire up the kettle, and I got a chance to use grill-wok.  I can see it's going to be part of my regular rotation throughout the grilling season this year.The wok is very nicely finished, with no rough metal edges, and the lid opens easily and closes securely.  The handle is quite long, as it should be for a grilling implement, but balanced so that it's not difficult to lift the wok and toss the ingredients.  Cleanup was relatively easy, although the wok is too big to fit in my dishwasher (I have an apartment-size dishwasher; a larger one might accommodate it).  I sprayed both the vegetables and the wok with oil prior to grilling to help prevent sticking, and that worked fine.I have a flat-bottom, pierced grill pan that I like to use to grill vegetables, but I think the grill-wok may nudge it out of the lineup this summer.  The grill pan requires me to stand right over the grill and toss the ingredients with tongs, spoon, or spatula, making it hot work and causing me to flip the odd piece or two into the grill.  With the grill-wok, I can stand back and just shake and flip the entire contents for even cooking.I have a 22-inch Weber kettle, and it was easy to position the pan so the handle stayed cool; a larger grill that leaves the handle over the grill would probably require a mitt or potholder.  Also, the pan is big -- nice for lots of contents, not so nice when trying to find a place to store it.  I think it's going to have to live in the garage in the off-season, but during the summer it will be hanging on the porch right along with the rest of my grilling utensils.  I'm looking forward to some creative grilled stir-frys this year!
B001VNC5V2 Out of several grill woks/toppers I have, this one is the best. The mesh allows the smoky essence to permeate food (yum!) while holding everything inside. The other toppers have 1/4\" to 3/8\" holes so ingredients invariably fall out. This does not happen with this wok. The lid is securely latched and tossing the ingredients is possible and even desirable. No need to move things around with a spatula or tongs. The steel is high quality and does not appear it will corrode.I tried it out with a Kamado style cooker (my \"fake Green Egg\") and a propane grill. The Kamado cooker worked well and provided a wonderful smoky finish to the ingredients. I simply tossed some frozen veggies and frozen shrimp in a bowl, added a little olive oil, and put it in the wok on the grill. Very simple and it turned out great. I also tried it on a propane grill. It cooked well, faster than the Kamado cooker, but the end product did not have as much smoke flavor. I did use a grill lid holder both times to partially close the lid and trap more heat. It's a useful addition when using this wok.There were a few things which could be improved: 1. The edge of the lid lock lever is sharp. I cut my finger while cleaning the basket. This may just be an issue with mine, but I'm careful around this now. 2. The mesh is not super easy to clean. I poke mine with a kitchen brush from the outside and then scrub it. 3. Minimal instructions are included. Amazon/Pinzon should consider including additional information and recipes.
B001VNC5V2 I've really enjoyed cooking veggies in my new Grill Wok. It's so easy. You can chop up just about any combo of veggies you like and cook them quickly and evenly without losing flavor, moisture, or the good vitamins. I like to add a dash of olive oil to help keep the veggies from sticking to eachother or to the wok. I look forward to trying new things such as adding chicken/beef chunks and different spices to my creations. My only complaint is that with any screen/mesh type materials, food particles can get stuck and it takes some extra effort to clean. This is a great way to get the whole family eating healthier.... and hey, it tastes good too!
B001VNC5V2 I've been wanting a grill wok or similar product for a while now, and this one is a beaut. It is larger than I anticipated, and yet it is well balanced and easy to handle. I especially appreciate the second-handed assist handle because, when the wok is loaded down with food, it could be heavy.While the lid itself does detach from the bottom of the skillet, it won't come off unless you deliberately open it all the way up to remove it. This is a good thing! Finally, the hanging loop is wonderful. The mesh holes MAY be small enough to pop popcorn, too, but I haven't tried that yet.This is going to sound crazy, I know, but I'll also use this to sift compost. (I don't buy or keep anything I can't use for at least several purposes!) Held hanging down at my side and clipped shut, the width is perfect to shake along a row to side-dress growing plants. This wok is made of durable, high-quality stainless steel, so I'm sure it'll hold up to this purpose. And if it doesn't, well, it'll be another versatile gardening tool. I could use it to shake dirt off mushrooms I harvest or to thresh dried beans.
B001VNC5V2 This has the potential to be a good product if it had a removable handle.  I don't understand why it does not.  The handle is very long and therefore I cannot close my grill lid when using this product.  Plus the handle becomes extremely hot (obviously) from the heat of the grill.  I probably would have given this a 5 star if it had a removable handle.I do like the solid, sturdy construction.  It cleans up well.  The screen mesh helps cook all veggies nice and evenly.  Really could be a standout product if they built it with a removable handle.
B001VNC5V2 I was actually surprised by the high quality of this product, since grill woks are like the bastard child of outdoor cookery. I was expecting something of cheap quality, like most grill woks tend to be. But this gadget is of very high quality and will please any grill wok enthusiast (are there any out there?).First, it feels much heavier than it looks. The wires are strong and do not bend and warp. The spacing of the mesh is sufficient enough to not allow most things to fall through. The metal used on the rim and handles is strong and feels solid. I think that's the defining character of the item - it feels SOLID, despite just being a wire mesh. It will last a long time.The mesh lid is attached to the bottom part by a hinge at the helper handle. And there is a spring latch on the main handle that locks the lid down. It works very well and again, feels solid.The wok works well enough on the grill. The metal does tend to discolor and get s dark, but how can you not expect it to over a charcoal fire? And of course, use a pot holder when handling it, since the handle will get hot. It's not nonstick (thankfully), but it does mean that a few items tend to stick. If you preheat the wok and then use some spray oil, you'll avoid major disasters. Use a wire brush for cleaning.
B001VNC5V2 The Tom Douglas grill pan is wonderful for grilling small items together on the grill. You can cut up veggies, place them in the pan and they are done in less than five minutes. The dish my guests liked best made in this pan was shrimp and summer vegtables grilled together and then served over pasta. No more making little shish ka bobs which is time consuming. Just add shrimp and vegetables in a bowl with a little olive oil and then toss into stainless grill pan and you are finished making entire dish in under 10 minutes. The pan is very sturdy and well made. The cover that fastens securely lets you toss contents of pan as much as you would like.It is a pan that will inspire you to become creative. As luck would have it, my stovetop failed just before I received the pan. The Pinzon 2 piece stainless grill top frying pan with removable lid was a life saver while I was in process of replacing the stove. I used it to grill some fruit to mix with yogurt and granola for breakfast, yummy!If you purchase this pan you will not be sorry, thats for sure!
B001VNC5V2 When Amazon is nice enough to send me a Vine product for review, I hate to complain about it. But this pan was a disappointment.The design is nicely done:- the mesh of the pan body is fine enough to hold in pretty much anything (even popcorn), while still allowing heat and smoke to permeate- the lid is high enough to accommodate a whole bell pepper or large Spanish onion, if you somehow wanted to roast one- the lid detaches completely for cleaning, or to use the pan as an open stir fry- the long handle will keep fingers (or, rather, forearms) away from hot grill parts- there are four thicker steel rods and a metal ring supporting the bottom of the pan, not just mesh (much preferred if you want to put drippy things down on an outdoor surface).- The lid handle and hinge make it easy to refill and rearrange things in the pan.The execution of the pan I recieved, however, was miserable:- One of the four support rods under the pan was welded so poorly it had come loose during shipping- A narrow metal plate that is attached to reinforce the handle was attached off-center, leaving a sharp exposed edge- The mesh had one strand that must have come loose as the material was being woven, because it was rippled and twisted and generally out of place (if you've ever gotten corn in a crazy ear, you know what I'm talking about).Amazon has a money-back guarantee, and the Vine items are probably the first ones off the production line (before all the bugs are worked out), so if you really want this pan don't let the problems discourage you. But be prepared take a gamble.
B001WAL3WG I have 3 Brome birdfeeders  one finch and two Brome 1024 and would highly recommmend them for being well built and long lasting. That said for me the finch feeder works well, but the birds for the most part are not interesting in it and prefer the Brome 1024 that can not be beat.
B001WAL3WG It's been in the garden about a year. So far it is durable and popular with the birds.The squirrels don't bother it now. But they periodically check out the regular version.Both have the weight triggered mechanism that bars access to the seeds.
B001WAL3WG You Have asked me to review it before I have used it.  Hard to answer till I see the finches on it and deal with my squirrel problem. It will probably be about another month before my finches return. They will return here in late September and October and spend the winter with me.  I had to replace my finch feeders and was not going to wait till they were already here to do so.  I like what I see but to truly say how it performs for me I can't answer that yet.
B001WAL3WG My finch love this feeder! So do the woodpeckers love it too. Very well constructed looks great, easy to fill and easy to clean. I have seen as many as eight birds on it at one time. Great price great product fast delivery
B001WAL3WG We were having problems with rats getting into the feeders and needed to find something that would defeat them but still work for the birds.  We saw this and decided to give it a try.  Here is what we liked:1.  Very nice design!  The top is easy to open and to fill the feeder.2.  The rats are heavy enough that the metal closes over the openings which really frustrates them!3.  The weight of the birds is not enough to close the feed openings.No more rat or squirrel problems with this feeder!  It is amazing how much longer seed lasts now!  Would highly recommend this feeder if you are having issues with rodents.
B001WAL3WG Works great, good capacity, do I need squirrel busting for finch seeds?Feeds my 40+ finch population for 5-7 days. Note - I do have two other non-thistle feeders which they like as well.
B001WAL3WG When this arrived, I thought how can a bird get seed from these tiny holes.  When I hung the feeder there almost always 6 or more birds at this feeder.  Finches love it and squirrels hate it.I have four Brome squirrel buster feeder and will never buy a different kind.  I have thistle in two of them and sun flower seed in two.  I have plenty of birds year around.  I highly recommend Brome bird feeder to anyone whether you have squirrel or not.
B001WAL3WG Even though this feeder is next to 6 other feeders, it took quite a while for the finches to start using this feeder.YOU HAVE TO BE PATIENT FOR THE BIRDS TO FIND THE FEEDER!When the Goldfinches were passing through, the feeder was covered with them like in the photograph. Now we're down to one couple that come to the feeder simultaneously several times/day (off-season for Goldfinches). The Goldfinches aren't attracted to any of the other feeders that have different types of seeds.Squirrels can't get in.  Great product. Love watching the flying yellow flowers.
B001WAL3WG I wasn't aware it only held niger seed.  None of the birds that come to my feeders eat niger including the American Goldfinches. The other problem was for it to work the squirrels had to come from the top.  Mine all come from below.
B001XW0WIY Had it for almost a year now, stays outside in the elements and other than being a little dusty it still looks new.
B001XW0WIY Buying an ash bucket seemed like a silly waste of money; our aluminum pail worked fine, and this fancy little thing seemed to be frivolous.  On a whim, we bought this on amazon just because we had company coming over and we thought it might make it easier for them to clean the fireplace when we were gone.Now, we love it. The little shovel on the side of the bucket works better than our long shovel from our fireplace set.  The lid isn't too tight, the size is perfect, the wood handle easy to carry.Silly for us to not buy this a long time ago.  It looks nice, it is easier to clean out ashes, and the price point is perfect.  Recommended.
B001XW0WIY Feel sturdy, doesn't look bad, holds a lot of ash. I only use it for cold ashes so it should hold up well. I like the shovel holder, but it should have a closed bottom so that the ash that sticks to the shovel doesn't just fall on the floor... The lid fits well.
B001XW0WIY It&#8217;s just an ash can.  Does what an ash can is supposed to do, but won&#8217;t win any beauty contests.  If it was a little bit more antique looking I&#8217;d probably give it higher marks, but it&#8217;s just a plane old black ash can...
B001XW0WIY If you are new to woodstoves, you will need one of these to go along with your new source of heat.  The bucket itself is larger than I expected (nice surprise).  The large size is going to come in handy if you actually use your stove a lot like we do.While I do not keep the shovel attached to the bucket, the metal that would hold the shovel is useful then empting the ashes.  The bucket can get very hot very quickly if the ashes have some hot embers.  I dump my ash in my outdoor fire pit (made of stone) and being able to touch this protrusion intended for the shovel is very useful.  The lid is nice too for keeping any dust or smoke that may come out of the ash at a minimum when carrying it outdoors.The shovel is a little on the cheap side and the handle is shorter than the two other shovels we have already.  It doesn't hurt to have this shovel as an extra, but my old ones are much better quality.I cannot say this is the best ash bucket out there, but it is lower in cost than many of the others I looked at and does the job well so far.  It would have been nice if it did have a double bottom, but at least the metal is fairly thick on this bucket.
B00215LFZQ i had two Ames reels which both leaked after about 2 years of light garden use and can't be repaired as no parts are carried. so i am trying the liberty. fortunately both makes use the same bolt pattern.
B00215LFZQ This is not as nice as my Rapid Reel, but it was also half the price. The powder coating is not well done. Areas were missed. The metal work was stamped and not well finished. It needed more filing before powder coating. The mechanism works well, but does not have a brake, so a heavy dangling nozzle will tend to unroll until it hits the ground. I really like the tray in top. The supplied leader hose is absolute junk. The attachments are not plastic, which is nice. The internals are plastic, so ill have to carefull blow out all water before winter.
B00215LFZQ I have installed 3 of these over the past several years. They are wonderful compared to the ones that sit on the ground. You don't have to worry about them moving around as you try to wind the hose up, provided that you have securely attached it to you house or shed. There are four mounting holes at the rear corners of the mount.The spinning action of the reel is very smooth and easy. The handle is made of a comfortable rubber that seems like it will last for many years. The one I have in full sun has shone some fading of the finish after 2 years but otherwise doesn't show and signs of rust or breakdown. They can hold up to 150 feet of hose. I like to keep a spray nozzle on my hoses and when winding the hose up I usually wind till the top storage shelf of the reel is in the v-notch of the hand sprayer. It keeps the hose tight and everything tidy.I am very happy with these. Best garden hose reel I have ever owned. 5 stars!
B00215LFZQ It's hard to pick out something like this, since it doesn't really matter how it looks, or how large it is, what really matters (to me at least) is, will it leak?  This one is listed is specifically listed as non-leaking, it has double seals, etc.  And the reviews were good, so I bought one.First off, it looks great.  It's made of sturdy metal, and the reel turns perfectly, even when loaded with hose.  No leaking issues at all so far.  I didn't need to assemble or adjust anything in any part of the wheel or plumbing.  All the end-user needs to do is mount it up and put the crank one with the included bolt/washer.Mounting was easy.  The pictures show the bolts going into brick, but I was always told to never drill brick since there is a danger of breaking the brick, you should always drill the mortar.  Not sure if that's the universal truth, that's the way I've always done it.  The mounting holes line up almost perfectly with &#34;standard&#34; brick walls.  That was my one worry, if I would have to mount this into the brick.  All I needed to do was drill out 4 holes with a standard masonry bit, and put in self-tapping masonry bolts.  4 decent sized bolts are more than enough to hold up the reel and fill it up with hose.There is a 6' &#34;leader&#34; hose included, it's standard rubber hose, but it's not cheaply made at all, has solid brass ends, with rubber gaskets, and it sealed well.Overall, a winner in my book.
B00215LFZQ This hose reel is heavy duty and nice looking.  I have a 5/8&#34; 125' hose on one and a 3/4&#34; 150' hose on the other.  The 3/4&#34; hose is just a little tight if you don't reel it up perfectly, but the 5/8&#34; hose fits with plenty of room to spare.  It's not advertised for 150', so I'm very pleased that it works.  The shelf on top is perfect for little sprinklers or hose attachments.  Drawbacks:  1. No hose guide which makes reeling just a tad more difficult.  2. It comes with no mounting hardware whatsoever.  I understand that there will be many different ways to potentially mount this guide, but for the price it would be nice if they put a few masonry screws & a few wood screws in the package to save most folks a trip to the hardware store.  3. The bolt holding the handle together seems to get loose (this has happened on both units I own); I'll be treating it with some thread locker --- the bolt should have shipped that way.  Since all these are fairly minor issues, I still consider this a 4 star hose reel; so much better than the plastic garbage out there.
B00215LFZQ After purchase of the first one immediately ordered a second.  Well-made, attractive, and works like a champ. A little more expensive than some, but worth it.
B00215LFZQ after few years, still work goodno leak so far, and reel action still smooth.light weight alu metal, but help up so far with light use.no issue with corrosion so far.
B0024ECDL4 After looking around orange and grey box, I found a better quality and cheaper price here. They work great and  feel well built. Just change the rubber hose washers (buy the Gilmore brand) every year. Our summers are hot here and then we get snow in winters, and that probably cause those washers to break down and start leaking, but other than that Camco valve is holding its ground.
B0024ECDL4 I acutally purchased these to use with a Mop sink faucet not a RV application but it is well made for garden hose connections. Much better then the cheap ones you normally see at Walmart
B0024ECDL4 Just put it on to replace an old one. Looks great, feels solid and after flexing the valves a bit to loosenthem up, everything seems to be first rate. Only time will tell if its a great purchase, but it looks well worth theprice
B0024ECDL4 I really liked this splitter, after trying all the made in China one and getting 'leakers. The Camco unit has fantastic quality and large ball valves allowing full flow. It was way to cheap for its quality, so I purchased several more spares for future garden expansions. Hats off to Camco for making such rocking good quality.
B0024ECDL4 Of all the valves we have had, these have held up the best.  We run a farm and tend to go through stuff like these.  These have withstood the test of time and two harsh winters.We actually also use this on our well and we have never had it bust or freeze or break during big freezes even though many other parts have had to be replaced on the well itself!I feel bad for the negative reviewers because we have been through a lot of hose parts ourselves but this has upheld over them all.  For whatever reason, the garden hose industry is incredibly cheap and crappy and awful in quality.  They really need to step up their game.
B0024ECDL4 No problems until recently, but now one of the shut-off valves is sticky and almost impossible to turn.  That's not really surprising since it was left in the open position for years.There is a substantial reduction in line diameter through the valve, but our water pressure is sufficient to maintain more than adequate flow through a heavy-duty 3/4\" hose.  I'll probably replace it with aGilmour Full Flow Aluminum 2-Way Connector AY2FFM...just to see what happens when there's no obstruction in the line.
B0024NDVRA The price of this is high, but worth it. I cannot believe how well my plants are doing with this stuff, it's almost like they were meant to grow in water!Okay, but really. This stuff works great, the only downside is that it takes half the bottle of FloraGro for 40 gallons of water. I will be upgrading to the gallons and switching to a 2-week cycle to save money since I'm only doing this as a hobby. I plan on adding Floralicious Plus to my plants diet (lol) to make they grow better.
B0024NDVRA Just like the rest of the reviews say; this stuff just works. Just remember the ratios on the bottle are MAXIMUM amounts. I've found 1/2 strength to work best.FloraBloom is amazing. Period.
B0024NDVRA Work great in both hydropoinc and dirt applications.  My peppers, tomato's and limes were 10x better than years before when I was growing with just water and some miraclegrow.  Mix according to directions also remember to mix into water first!!!!!! DO NOTmix the concentrates together then into water.  Do them one at a time.  Furthermore, do not blast your young plants with a heavy dose.  Introduce the stuff slowly to prevent shocking your plants.
B0024NDVRA They work. Very straight forward and simple. Most importantly, the plants seem to really like them. And, the price is about as good as I've found for quality Hydro nutes in small quantities for hobbyists.I found the chart on the side to be easy to follow. Although the writing is really tiny so hopefully there's a better version on their website for printing.
B0024NDVRA I've never found any product then the Gen. Hydo products best fertilizers I ever applied to my garden plants , I've never had a single plant t burn or wilt using this brand of plant food products
B0026MHWZ6 Very very pretty and cute for a plastic watering can.  It is pretty enough to not look like junk left lying around the yard or garden.  Holds about half what a typical watering can does and has no spread on the nozzle, but we use it almost exclusively for our seedlings.  Just too cute.  It has also held up very well.  No seam splits or anything despite being left out in temperatures from 32 to 95.  Also no sun fade yet.
B0026MHWZ6 + Looks better than a standard watering can sitting around the house.+ Accurate pouring into small spaces/gaps- Spout is a bit drippy because it ends more horizontal.  You have to tilt the can all the way back to horizontal and wait a while for the water to drain from the spout back into the can before leaving the plant you're watering.- I find it a bit small for watering all but my smallest plants.  I wish it was larger.-Mold quality is a bit roughOverall I like it.
B0026MHWZ6 Fairly large watering can that is made in the shape of an elephant.  I like it because I can fill it with filtered water and then water all my house plants the same time.  don't over fill it or it will spill all over.  It is made of hard plastic.I really had a hard time finding a decent looking watering can, so I am so happy I found this. Plus, when I look at the elephant, it always makes me smile.  :)If my review helped you, could you please click \"helpful\" button below. Thank you!  :)
B0026MHWZ6 Bought this for a friend for Christmas. She didn't have a water can and thought this was simply delightful. It was a little bit smaller than I thought it would be, but should work for most of your plant watering purposes.I appreciate the fact that it was made in the USA. If you're looking for a cheaper can that is still USA made, check out your local Ace hardware store. I bought mine last weekend for $4 and it is about twice to three times the size.
B0026MHWZ6 My girlfriend likes elephant stuff so I got her this for the indoor plants.As other reviews state, it is very 'plasticy' and the seams are rough. It doesn't look as good in person as the pictures online did. Also, the stream is unruly and is easy to spill. Finally, the hole in the back for filling definitely does spill if you tip it too much, and it's difficult to get the last bit of water out.Overall, it's very poorly designed/made, but it's cheap and cute... I probably wouldn't buy it again, but if you're into elephants, maybe you'd like it.
B0026T6778 I used this add-on for the first time this afternoon.  It is well designed, appears well made, and seems to be high quality metal.  It adjusts easily to fit the Larger basket, and works very well to add a second level of cooking.  I roasted a 6.5 pound chicken in the base with six ears of corn (wrapped in foil) on top.  At 70 minutes, the chicken was at 173 degrees.  I turned off the gas and let it rest.  Within five minutes the alarm went off on the temperature monitor - the chicken was at 175 degrees as recommended.I let it rest in the cooker for another half hour as we were not ready to eat.  By then the metal was cool enough to handle without gloves or mittens.  It cleaned easily, and is ready for another use.Highly recommended.FYI:  The corn on the cob was still over 140 degrees forty minutes later. (left wrapped in foil)
B0026T6778 I purchased the Big Easy Oiless Turkey Fryer, but am more likely to use it for chickens.  This is a great accessory, providing room for a second chicken, potatoes, corn or other veggies.  It really increases the versatility of the Big Easy.
B0026T6778 The basket works in tandem with the basket insert for the Big Easy.  By have multiples of this basket, you can stack veggies and cook an entire meal in the Big Easy.  We especially love cooking potatoes in the basket, the skins are nice and tender and the inside is fluffy, yet moist.
B0026T6778 The Big Easy has a lot of additional accessories that you can purchase to go with it and this is the #1 most useful one that you can get for it. It's simple to use and it tremendously expands the limits of your cooker. Please be aware that this is only for the Big Easy, not the Big Easy Smoker, Roaster & Grill (SRG).
B0026T6778 French Fries in an oiless fryer - what's not to like?  This is amazing - you can gorge on fries and actually not feel as if you are in calorie overload.
B0026TA5JE This is the first season I've used but so far I like the way it runs.  The six inch spacing is good for a great variety of plants.  Beans for instance.  Not quite close enough for carrots but it's good for a bunch of things in the garden.  If it plugs up for next season - I will report.
B0026TA5JE Works really well.  The rubber hose is good quality and emitters flow evenly.  I have a 25ft length that all emitters are flowing evenly.  Very Good Stuff.
B0026TA5JE I counted emitters (6 inches apart) to measure the length I need. Since my vegetable beds were built from 8 ft length of redwood, I counted 16 emitters per length. I expected to get 12 lines, but only ended up with 11 (and 8 emitters left over), which gives me 92 ft. Mine has the blue stripe running along the length of the tubing, if that makes any difference.The drips work well otherwise. Definitely much easier than installing individual drippers. I also mixed and matched plugs and barbs - from Rainbird and Raindrip. No issues.6 inch emitters definitely work much better for a vegetable bed. I'd have preferred even less spacing. I tried a 1/4&#34; soaker tubing, but that didn't work well at all - the output was very uneven, with only the first foot getting any significant amount of water.I ordered one coil to test it out, and it looks good. I'm ordering another to finish up the drip irrigation for my vegetable beds.
B0026TA5JE Very well made.  Hooked it to Rainbird 1/2 poly to water cucumbers growing on trellises.  Watered very evenly and look durable.
B0026TA5JE Item arrived on time.  Tubing was unrolled as it was used.  Getting towards the end of the roll, I found I wasn't getting any water.  Upon closer review, there was an 8 ft section that had no emitters! Since you pay by the foot, I immediately contacted Amazon and asked for a credit for the 8 foot section.  Amazon was great, and the credit showed up within 24 hours.  It wasn't a lot of money, but I was really happy that Amazon took care of the problem.The tubing itself works great.  Water is delivered at advertised rate, and so far no emitters haven't clogged.My only suggestion would be to review the whole roll BEFORE you're out in the garden.
B0026TA5JE For drip solutions, you have a couple of solutions.(1) One is to buy separate emitters and connect to either 1/2 or 1/4 tubing. This solution allows you to be specific in your drip locations. However, the cost can add up quickly depending on how many of the emitters you need.(2) Buy another vendor's drip tubing with emitters. However, I've found most of these competitors provide emitters only every 18 inches. Did find some with every foot. This approach may not provide emitters close to where you want them.(3) Use Toro's product. The emitters are every 6 inches. I love this because it allows for a greater coverage area.  How well do the emitters hold up? I have some tubing which are several years old and still working. I now have several beds with these laid out. I can simply snake this tubing though my bed and not worry so much about where the emitters or plants are.
B00280MVAC We live like mountain goats.  And our lawn is pitched at an angle steep enough that a riding mower would be at risk of tipping.  As a result, we've always used a large self-propelled mower for most of the lawn.  There are certain very steep and tightly confined areas, though, where the heavier self-propelled mower doesn't work...it's simply too heavy to maneuver while trying to keep oneself upright in that steep terrain (I think I need one leg shorter than the other).  So for those areas, we've always kept a cheap lightweight push mower.  We've gone through a bunch of them, but always just replace them with the cheapest thing we can find -- usually in the $150 range.Because these cheap push mowers usually feel like I'm pushing a sled uphill rather than something with wheels, I decided to take time to do some online research for the easiest mower to push...basically which brand and model \"rolls\" the best.  I checked a number of sites and looked for unbiased reviews.  The mower that was repeatedly highlighted for \"easy pushing\" was this Husqvarna 7021P because of its ball-bearing wheels.  I decided to give it a try...and am glad I did.Before I get to the other qualities of this mower, let me first say that this baby ROLLS.  While I definitely wanted a dependable mower that cuts well, my primary reason for buying this mower was for ease of pushing.  And it delivers completely in that area.  On our few flat stretches of lawn, this Husqvarna rolls so easily that it almost feels like a self-propelled model. With its double-ball-bearing wheels, it even rolls more easily over steep and rough terrain.  Its light weight (55 lbs) and extra-large back wheels make it easier to maneuver in tight, steep spots.It starts up easily and has a solid, dependable four-stroke Honda engine.  Its compact design features three cutting systems: bag collection, mulch, and side discharge.  The control bar (which runs the length of the handle) must be pulled back for the engine to run and the blades to turn. For safety, as soon as the control bar is released, a brake stops the blades from spinning and immediately shuts the engine off.  A lever on each of the wheels adjusts the cutting height from 1.25 to 3.42 inches. The handle has two height adjustments.The only issue I had with ours isn't a biggie for me.  The bag for grass collection fits easily enough, but it tends to clog up when it's barely a third full.  Since I generally go \"bagless\" and just mulch our grass, this isn't an issue for us.  While the mower doesn't appear to be of the highest, most-durable construction, I think this is how it manages to be so lightweight for a 21-inch mower.  I'll update this review if I notice it not holding up due to poor construction.While Amazon's price was slightly better than my local home improvement store, I decided not to buy it from Amazon since I would be unable to return it directly to Amazon if there was a problem with it.  I spoke with an Amazon rep and was told that I'd have to deal directly with the manufacturer once it arrived.  I believe that is Amazon's policy on any products that would be gasoline filled.4.5 stars -- highly recommended
B00280MVAC The actual mower met my expectations, however one of the front wheel axils was bent. Happy with the product as it still mows the lawn but with a bum wheel.
B00280MVAC The mower is well made and works right out of the box with no issues.  It is easy to start for me and I am a grandma with not that much strength.  The directions to put it together which is only a few screws and bolts was very easy.  I was mowing within a few minutes.  I like the ruggedness of it.  I got it to mow uneven and rocky ground out in the fields and it is holding up nicely.  I have maybe 20 hours on it and it is still performing flawlessly.
B00280MVAC I have had Briggs and Straton motors for the most part, and heard great news about this one.  So far its OK, but not as strong as a base model Briggs motor. Not impressed with the Honda engine like I thought I would be.  It may last longer than my old Sears Briggs, but only time will tell.  Don't get me wrong, it does the job, just was expecting a bit more as far as power.  Its struggles with thick grass, but gets the job done.  My old Briggs did bet
B00280MVAC Husqvarna makes Craftsman mowers, just like Black and Decker makes DeWalt tools. While it might seem reasonable to expect that the quality of Husqvarna's own branded products are a cut higher than Ctaftsman products - which have quite a few issues - it's difficult to analyze what parts they share. Sears sells a lot of mowers, so naturally with high volume comes more complaints. I know that when I have brought back to Sears Craftsman mowers with issues within 30 days, they readily accepted them back. They were not at all surprised with quality issues. In fact, they use those issues to sell their 3 yr. Extended Service plans which add another $80 to the final cost. A Sears 2010 version of this particular model mower being reviewed is equipped with a Kohler 173cc/7.0 torque motor made in China. That shows you the direction that Husky is taking for quality: outsource for lower price points and  - probably - lower quality. The two year limited warranty ( manufacturer defects only) on Husky mowers is only for residential use. It is only 90 days if used commercially. I suppose the curious issue is whether the OEM Honda engines are the same quality as those used for its own products.
B00280MVAC I don't have any complaints to give with this unit yet, not one. Seems very fuel efficient as well, Its been ran for about 3 hours now and is till on the first gallon of gas. Oil and gas are separate, and it has an air filter which I haven't seen on a simple push mower before. Great Honda engine, great purchase.Update 5-19-12:I have owned this unit for almost a year now and it is still a great unit. Blade is still sharp, engine still starts on the first pull and and adjustment for the wheels and handle still operate flawlessly.  I live in southren California where grass grows year round and I cut about 1/8 acre of lawn ever 5 days. Not one problem or issue so far. Still the best lawn mower out there.
B00295N5VK Sturdy components, right down to the reinforced hose. Long wand allows you to get close to your 'target' to limit over spray. Very efficient pump needs only a few strokes to pressurize. Nice wide mouth on the bottle makes adding chemicals easier. I'm spra'n and kill'n weeds by the thousands now.
B00295N5VK Excellent quality sprayer at a bargin price.  The two gallon size is just right for most uses.Comes with additional spray tips.
B00295N5VK In the past five years, I have used four different Chapin sprayers. Compared to the ones sold at Lowes and Home Depot, the Chapin brands are higher quality and \"longer lasting.\" Although they are the best, they are not perfect. Here are the PROs and CONs...PROs.1. The wand and nozzle are made of heavy brass..2. The hose is large, thick, and heavy..3. Customer Service is the best - second to none. The people are cheerful, knowledgeable, and helpful. They will \"bend over backwards\" to solve any problem and to guarantee a successful experience with their products...CONs.1. The pump rod is made of mild steel and is prone to rust. Rub it with heavy grease after each use to retard oxidation..2. Some models come without a plastic filter on the end of the plastic intake tube. Call Chapin's customer service and get one. . . . Dust and tiny debris tend to travel into the wand and plug up the nozzle without this needed item..3. It is almost impossible to read the gallon markings on the liquid container. Use a permanent marker to mark off the necessary measurements..4. Chapin Pro Series and Premier Series are almost identical, except for a few cosmetic changes. Buy whatever is cheaper. . . . For the cheapest prices, go to the Chapin website. I purchased a 3-gallon Pro Series for $27. Apparently, other companies hire Chapin to make sprayers. The firm just take their Pro Series or Premier, make a few cosmetic changes on the handle, screw cap, container color, and labeling. . . . During production, the company makes extra units. Later, it needs to get rid of the surplus. So, it sells these at cost.
B00295N5VK This is well made and I am pleased with it for the price but they need to include instructions. I had to go to their site to get them and it was annoying. Would it kill them to print out one sheet instructions and include it in the box? The warnings all over the product say heed the instructions, could be hazardous to your health if you don't follow the instructions, then they don't include them!
B00295N5VK this is probably the best sprayer I have eve used. lasts a long time and is durable. I would recommend it to anyone. 2 gallons reservoir holds a lot of spray.
B00295N5VK My choice of sprayer from now on. This is well made. Love the wide opening top for adding chemicals. Filter on the inside hose helps prevent the nozzle from clogging (haven't had mine clog yet). And, I have a big enough yard, that I need the 2 gallon size. It also can be literally be taken apart to clean if necessary.
B00296C7PO we bought a house that was occupied by grandchildren for about 5 years so the yard was left to go wild. I have been pulling weeds for days and ripping up blackberry bushes (the worst weed and so aggressive, especially in the PacNorWest) and finally I just had to get some help. I sprayed this stuff just about everywhere. Oddly, Morning Glory didn't give a $4*t. Everything I sprayed was either suffering or dead in 24 hours. 28 hours later everything was dead. Everything except for the morning glory. 5 days later the morning glory is doing just fine. I used 3 packets to cover roughly 3,000 sq ft.
B00296C7PO we run a storage facility, and somethimes the weeds grow a little.  This stuff works great.  My husband usually uses roundup, but it seems the weeds are getting a little immune lately.  So I got this stuff.  It works great, and I love the premeasured packets.  Going to order more in a day or so.
B00296C7PO I mixed this up in a spray bottle and hit the problem areas.  About 2 weeks later and the plants are wilted and dead.  I haven't tried using it on large areas, but for spot treatment it seems to work great.  The fact that it comes in individual packets is nice, I just wish the packets were resealable for those of us mixing up small batches.
B00296C7PO 1) save an old bottle of roundup, with the sprayer if possible2) save a bunch of money by getting these single-use, ready to mix powder.  Each of 5 packs of non-selective herbicide mixes with 1-gallon of water3) be impressed by the results - this has an additional chemical which allows its round-up-like chemical to penetrate and enter the plant more quickly than just plain round-up
B00296C7PO This is a great product for removing unwanted vegetation.  Mixes easy and kills fast.  Within 24 hours, anything this product contacted was dead.  The weeds I sprayed this on in my mulch bead were history.  What's even better, after about a week, the weeds decomposed so quickly, that they didn't even need to be removed from my mulch bed!  I was expecting to spray the weeds, wait a day or two, pull them out.  Instead all I had to do was just spray them and they disappeared.  Really hard to believe, but this saved me a bunch of time after moving into a house that went without maintenance for about 2 and a half years.
B00296C7PO Wild violets laugh at QuikPRO.  Except for germinating below-ground weeds, this stuff usually does the job in about 3 days.  Bright sun helps.  If you're working in mostly shade, expect it to take a day or so longer.  It's rain-fast in about an hour.  Bright sun helps, as I said before. According to their website, the area can be reseeded or replanted in about 2 weeks - longer than I would have liked, but within an acceptable range.  Oxalis, yellow sedge, crabgrass, shot-weed (one variety of bittercress or another), dandelion, all the rest are fairly easily eradicated.  I will apparently have to up my game with those damned wild violets, though - the only thing in my yard I can't blame on my neighbors. You're wasting your time and annoying me by trying to talk me into liking them.
B0029D6NZC its ok the orange spout fell off the same day I used it very cheap plastic not glued on good , but I glued it on an it works fine for now but was not happy with that
B0029D6NZC Great watering can. I love the fact that there are two handles, which is great for heavy buckets of water. I found that the two spout options are nice. I used the shower spout to water my hanging baskets, and used the pour spout for watering my bushes. The watering can is a nice size, so I am able to water more than one plant at a time. Anything with a Fiskars name, I have found to be a very good and durable product. Once again, well done Fiskars!
B0029D6NZC I really like this watering can. It is big enough to carry a ton of water, but designed that it is pretty easy to carry the weight. I like the two handles.
B0029D6NZC Looks nice and holds good amount of water, but, the water spills everywhere. Thought it would be better but was disappointed. I would try other watering cans
B0029D6NZC Giant watering can that's easy to use because of the secondary moveable handle.  Though I can't explain it the secondary handle does not leak.  The reversible spray/pour nozzel head is really convenient.
B0029D6NZC Great watering can...easy to use and carry...seems sturdy...just twist the head to sprinkle or pour...just the right size opening to fill
B0029D6NZC Love the hole on the side to fill easily.  Love the other handle that moves and makes it easy to carry and pour.  Having a little trouble getting the shower head on.  Waiting for my husband to come home and show me.  I think this is going to be a great watering can and it holds 2 1/2 gallons of water.
B0029D6NZC First, I was impressed that someone came up with the sense to place the hole off center for adding water - then when I automatically held the fixed handle with the additional balancing handle, I was sold. I have been a fan of Fiskars products, from sewing scissors to all of my gardening needs. Most every one in our gardening clubs are loyal Fiskar users. They stand by their products, are always innovative and guarentee their products for life. Can you beat that?
B0029D6NZC I got this because the 2 handle design intrigued me and the rotating pourer/sprinkler meant I wouldn't have to misplace a part.  I am very good at misplacing.  The fill hole is offset so it is easy to fill even with my sprinkler wand and the upper rotating handle makes it a joy to carry around as well as extra support for pouring.  One review says that it sprinkles heavy but with this size can that is not unusual and it is a better sprinkler than many, like a heavy rain with a large pattern.  If you need a lighter sprinkling can get the OXO which I also have and is  very good.[...]One thing though, if the can is partially filled and you grab the upper handle and start walking the can will tip forward and spill water from the spout.  You have to get used to using the fixed handle when the can is partially full but it is lighter and not a problem.  It is very well built and the pourer/sprinkler fits tight.  I have many containers so I use a can a lot so for me 25 bucks was a good buy. I'm hoping they make a smaller one handled version with a rotating spout, that would be great for hanging baskets and such.
B0029D6NZC Lightweight, durable, well-balanced. The filling hole on top could be larger. I use a hose to fill the can as it becomes rather heavy holding up to fill at a faucet, about 20 pounds filled with water. When you first tip the can forward after filling, water tends to spill out of the filling hole. However, I use mine only in the garden where a little spillage is not a problem. Spout twists easily from spray to stream and both work well. The soft plastic doesn't dent like a galvanized can. No rust, no sharp edges. The swivel handle is very handy for carrying the watering can. I have a very \"hose unfriendly\" garden and will usually fill this can dozens of times daily to water. While it may not have the same balance, feel, or looks of a Haws, it is an inexpensive alternative that works well.
B0029D6NZC We were using pitchers to water some peppers and other plants on the back porch. We had to refill 2-3 times to get them all, and the stream would disturb the soil more than we wanted.This thing is awesome! The rotating handle lets you hold it in a comfortable way, and the shower stream is very even, gentle, and FAST! It takes about a quarter of the time to do the watering now that we have this, and the results are better in the end. Flipping the nozzle changes it to a single stream, which is nice for certain things. Feels a bit wonky changing it, but we hardly ever change it from the shower function.Great can.
B0029D6NZC The handle design is pretty good and easy to manipulate the can.  However the real problem is that the spout is designed to come off so that you can turn it to pour or shower.  The problem is that if you tilt the can too much, then the detachable spout just pops off and the water comes out so fast that it digs a hole..The next problem is that the glue failed on the orange cap and it just falls off.  So the can is nearly useless.  So far every fiskars can that I've ever had has falled apart, split, etc.  Won't waste my time with any more of them.
B002B9COD4 I knew I'd lost the game when I saw these worms on the surface the next morning.  Yeah, the moles just moved them out of their run and left them on the ground.
B002B9COD4 Tried the traps for a few weeks, and got nothing.Put a few of these babies down in the holes and tunnels, and within 2 days, no more mole(s).These work great.
B002B9COD4 Must follow directions. Use gloves so moles won't detect human smell. These worms are the only product I have ever used that actually work. I use 1/2 worm in each hole. Works!
B002B9COD4 Apparently this product is not on the menu for the moles in my area. I would check every few days and they just decomposed.
B002B9COD4 I took the ten worms and cut them in half buy taking an knife and cutting the plastic worm holder in half. They seemed to be a bit large for a little mole so I decided on half a worm. (The instructions do not say this.)  Instead of following more of the directions I put the worms in the holes so I could see if they had been taken. Within two days all twenty half-worms were gone. A couple days later I crushed all of their tunnels and since then two weeks have passed and none of them have returned. The poison seemed to work. Now the problem - it's too expensive. Now that I've cleared the area around my house I have many more acres that need mole extraction. It's not in the budget so I'm trying a trap. You may want to keep this in mind.
B002B9COD4 I bought these after reading some university studies claiming good efficacy.  I have had good success with mole traps but there are certain runs that are not amenable to traps.  I put one of these worms in using a zip lock bag over my hand to handle the worms and then cover up the hole.  After a couple of days, I verify the worm was taken and squash down the tunnel.  Supposedly the product can take up to 3 days to work.  After about 5 days, sometimes there is still activity.  I don't know if this means that the mole didn't die or that more than one mole is using the tunnel (which is very true in most cases) so I place another worm.  With trapping and using Talpirid worms, I have no further mole activity!  Definitely worth the money spent for the aggravation and damage spared.
B002CIRD1C My grill has no thermometer in the hood, so I was constantly guessing at \"Medium\" or \"Low\" heat.  Just because the knob setting says medium does NOT mean that it is in the 350 degree range or any range at all.  You can place this directly on the grid after preheating and check when the temp is right for your roast or veggies or other things.  Glad to have one that is so easy to use and well made.
B002CIRD1C I place this in my smoker as an added measure of surface temperature.  This has been very accurate an just stays in my smoker all the time..
B002CIRD1C I got this to use in grilling. I noticed that all the grills I have owned have the temperature gauge in the lid.unfortunately, the food is on the grill, not the lid.this gives me a more accurate reading when cooking pork loin roasts or other items that require a bit more timing and helps me gauge when to take an internal temp with the meat thermometer.
B002CIRD1C This thermometer confirms my guesses as to grill temperature when cooking, and helps me adjust my cooking times with the existing charcoal.  Works well.  You should wipe off the glass after use, and don't use it until the coals are 'bout ready for cooking.
B002CIRD1C Fantastic for kettle grills that do not have external thermometers and those that don't want to do a modification job.  Extremely accurate.
B002D925D6 This is the third type of compost maker I've bought over the years.  The other two didn't suit me, but this one is a definite improvement.The cover fits nicely, it's very sturdy, and I think it'll hold up well through our New England winters.  In just a couple months, it's broken down everything I've thrown at it and produced some pretty impressive compost.  Of course, I was religious about turning the drum every day.  I agree with others about how heavy and difficult it can be to turn once vegetation starts breaking down.  So before I started using it, I sprayed silicone on the rollers and bottom platform.  Unfortunately, I don't think that helped!  So lately I've resorted to (1) either enlisting the help of a stronger friend or (2) reaching into the drum with an effective tool and turning the stuff by hand (ugh). In spite of that one issue, I think this one's a keeper.
B002D925D6 We bought one to replace a very poorly designed one we had picked up locally. It is a little hard to turn if it gets too full. We purchased another to avoid that problem--and to give the materials time to compost. We've only had one for for about 4 months so I can't speak to longevity. We just bought the second within the past month.
B002D925D6 I currently have two geobins going in my backyard, but they were taking forever to compost. Part of this is my fault, as I don't turn the piles often enough. As a remedy to this, I decided a tumbler was the way to go. I was searching high and low for one when I came across this product on a Woot! deal. It was priced better than anywhere else so I decided to give it a try.It comes fully assembled and ready to go. A few other tumblers I read about require a great deal of assembly, including numerous screws that eventual rust or break. This product consists of a large bin and the base. You can set it up out of the box in less than a minute! The barrel does have some weight to it, roughly around 30 pounds empty.I have read a few reviews about the hole being too small to fit a shovel or other instruments in. I have not had this problem at all. I was able to transfer compost from my geobin piles into the tumbler with no problem whatsoever.My suggestion is to only fill the container half or 3/4 of the way. Empty it seems pretty heavy, but would quickly become unmanagable the more materials you put in it. I decided to put the tumbler next to my garden so it could get more sun. I rolled it from the compost piles to the garden. It wasn't the easiest thing to roll, but it did eventually make it (after knocking me in the shins a few times, ouch!) Even with it being only 1/2 full, this was quite a chore.The holes in the bin seem like they are a decent size. They are not large enough to allow scraps to fall out, but small enough to allow some rain water in. It seems to be the perfect size without oversaturating the compost materials.I would buy this product again in a heart beat. Turning it is super simple (I think my almost 2 year old could do it if he had a little more strength), and much quicker than turning a pile with a shovel. I can go through roughly 10 rotations in a minute if I wanted to.
B002D925D6 I had higher hopes for the Good Ideas EZCJR-BLK 7-Cubic-Foot Compost Wizard Jr. to be honest. It works OK, but I found that 7-cubic feet is really not that large for a household where we try to compost quite a bit, including some yard waste, too. It's easy to add material to it, but not that easy to rotate it once you have any biomass inside. If I had not built a wooden stand to elevate this composter, it would have been more challenging to try to rotate.It turns out I could not replace my old upright composter with this one because if holds far more, so I use them in tandem now. Again, this one is OK, but if I had it to do over again and could have tested this model before buying it, I would have likely not purchased it unless the price was a more reasonable $69 or less. Afterall, it is just molded plastic.
B002D925D6 I am senior it is too heavy to roll when the bin is full.I should get the spin one well it is too much to be buy another one you never know other problem. The way is leave all compost on the floor and turn it.
B002D925D6 I absolutely love it. It is so compact and small that do not take much space on my back yard (it is about 2/3 of standard trash can), but it holds a lot of compost, it has a lot of room inside. It does not stand up like a sore thumb in my back yard but neatly fits in the corner. Very easy to turn but very stable, not flimsy, no installation required (just put main thing on the top of the base and it is done!). Lid closes tightly with no spilling. Made from durable, thick plastic. I added water to my compost (it was a dry leaves and grass) and what I noticed that excess water sipped through at the bottom, which is good thing because it prevents from making compost becoming stinking mud. Bottom line, it is a great product, worth every penny.
B002DM1Z5C It's very easy to use, and it works like a charm. It's safe for a condo that does not allow gas or charcoal. I'm happy with it since the house doesn't smell when I grill my fish or meat.
B002DM1Z5C First I did a lot of research before purchasing this. Needed an electric unit because I have to BBQ on my balcony. My kitchen and dining and living areas are all on the main floor of my house with a large balcony and a sunroom below in my split level home.(did not want to climb stairs for the sake of a gas BBQ). Ace had this unit for $129 and an addition $5 coupon they handed me was just too good a deal to pass up. Sorry Amazon. I still love you.It was already assembled. Yay!Cranked it up first thing to make sure all worked. Went to 550 in 15 minutes. So I turned it off and left it open. Cooled in no time. I added lava rock from my yard. Live by Mt. Shasta. Lots of lava rock on my property. Found an old grate and put just below heating element. Put Lava on grate. I think it heated faster the second time. Then came the thick sirloin and buttered corn. It was all done in 12 minutes. Absolutely delicious. After taking out the steak I left heat on 550 (max) before I turned it off. Cooked the gug to a crisp and I wiped off easily once cooled. There was no fat in the little tray. It all dripped on the lava rocks. So I can honestly say clean up was a breeze. Much better than my many many gas BBQ of prior years. I'll update this once I've owned for a while but for now I'm pleased. I've posted a pix. With the heating element off. Remember to take heating element off and keep away from weather. Think that is probably the reason people's elements fail. I put mine in the BBQ so I don't lose track of it.Update: Put heating element indoors. The sun heated the black exterior and made it almost 200 degrees inside. Don't want the electronics to melt so inside the house the heating element went.
B002DM1Z5C I purchsed this grill today at Kroger's, no less, on sell.  I put it together while watching TV and was careful to follow the instructions.  I'm a 65 year old female and didn't pay attention to the time, but the movie was still playing when I finished setup. It went together without incident, is sturdy, and works well.  I love it, and it is so convenient not to have to deal with charcoal and fire!  I felt comfortable using it on the patio as there is no open flame.  It is so easy to use (plug it in turn it on) I plan on using it regularly.  It does not appear poorly made, so I wonder if there are more than one of this model based on the comments I read.  If you're sick of charcoal or just need a grill with a small foot print, is easy to start and looks nice, I suggest this one.
B002DM1Z5C Fabulous!  Took a few turns to figure out how to add the wood chips but now everything tastes like real charcoal BBQ.  Wonderful!  Highly recommend and a whole lot less mess.
B002DM1Z5C I really like this grill, it is compact, doesn't require much room. I have a big three burner BBQ but, this one is perfect for a couple of people to grill up a quick dinner. I took a while to assemble, the instructions were adequate.I would recommend it.I
B002EJLLEE I can a lot of fruit and tomatoes in the summer and fruit flies make me crazy!!!  I put this product in my kitchen and the problem went away!!!  I got this to try, with pretty low expectations, and I was delighted with it.  It is cheap and effective!  I put out the trap with the lure liquid and within 20 minutes, I didn't see a fruit fly in the house.  I had to change the liquid often because of the amount of canning that I do - but this product was simply wonderful at keeping the fruit flies controlled.  It might be overkill if you just have a few of them around, but if you keep lots of fruit and vegetables around or if you can I highly recommend it!!!
B002EJLLEE I have an occasional problem with fruit flies and gnats in an office and though I assume there's a food source, I haven't found it so I've tried a couple of things to get them under control.  I've tried the classic vinegar in a dish, wine in a dish and fly paper.  They all work in part, of those three the traditional strip of fly paper works best but not well.The Terro is relatively expensive at a little over $7 each with the packaging recommendation that it be discarded after 30 days, so basically  $7/month.  I also have a Fly Web Fly Trap (Amazon)so decided to compare them.  I started with a clean sheet of sticky paper in the Fly Web and the fresh Terro Fruit Fly Trap, placing them about 5' apart.  I left them for a month.There were 5 fruit flies or gnats in the Terro, I quit counting at 100 on the Fly Web, but definitely a lot more.The good news is that between the two, there are no more gnats or fruit flies in the office.The Fly Web Trap draws 8 watts of electricity so just under 6 kilowatt hours for a month, our local rate is 8.1 cents per kwh, so it costs about 50 cents a month to run.  The sticky paper lasts for months, so throw in another 50 cents a month for a high estimate of $1 per month to operate. Plus, there's no smell.  It is a tad messier to dispose of the paper.The Terro liquid smells like vinegar so other than the convenient holder and easy disposal, it doesn't seem to be much different or work any better or worse than a small bowl with vinegar.
B002EJLLEE I received this fruit fly trap about a month ago in late August. Here in Silicon Valley, CA, this is NORMALLY a warm time of year with a fair number of the little buggers around pestering the bananas we leave out on the counter. This year was a bit cooler and we didn't have a good baseline density of flies, so we were unable to give the TERRO a really great test. In fact, the few fruit flies we had seemed to avoid it.The instructions for set up are clear. The bait fluid comes pre-mixed and contained in a squeeze bottle that makes it easy to fill the trap itself. I'm sad that this creates another small landfill item - as does the trap itself -  but it is recyclable in our waste service, so perhaps that's OK.I'm giving this a two star rating because, although it didn't get the few flies we had, the fact is they were really sparse this year so perhaps it would do better if there were more. If not for this, I would give it a one star rating because it did not catch anything, even other insect types.I'm keeping the trap out until it dries up. If something changes, I will update the review.
B002EJLLEE This Terro product traps many fruit flies in the liquid at the bottom of the trap.  However, if you have an open compost bin or bowl of 'seconds' bananas, they equally attract fruit flies. So removing the offending product and using this trap should solve the problem.
B002EJLLEE You catch more bees with honey, but you catch NO fruit flies with this trap.  Seriously, it caught not a single fly.
B002EJLLEE Does it work? Kinda sorta. Would I buy this item? Nope.Be careful upon opening this. It has a red liquid that spills out easily and stains everything it touches. I was able to get it off the formica countertop but it required a lot of scrubbing. Marble or granite might absorb the stain.It's been almost a month and there are a few flies in the trap. All the rest are still flying around my kitchen, driving us nuts.I'm thinking of making some homemade traps using kombucha (I brew my own) as the lure. They love the stuff.The directions on this thing tell you to close the lid and throw it away after 30 days. It didn't do much of a job, and I don't like the idea of cluttering the landfills with silly plastic doodads. So I'll keep looking for an alternative.
B002EJLLEE As a billion other people have already commented, and I will try not to rehash, you can use cheap and common ingredients you already have to achieve the same thing.So maybe buy ONE of these for the original container/trap, then refill with your own \"special sauce\" (vinegar + water + dishwashing liquid).Actually this little deal worked so well that before I read the other reviews, and after our trap had expired, as it were, I searched by the company name to see if they sold refills (wanting to buy more).  NOPE!  Considering the unit only lasts for 30 days (ours lasted much less time), they want you to buy a new wasteful little plastic unit every 25 days, @ $7 a pop?  Insane.  Even the least intelligent among us would soon figure out that that is a TERRIBLE deal for consumers.  At least they should sell a multi pack or something - maybe a pack of a dozen.OTOH, maybe most customers don't have as much fruit in their house as we do, on a continual basis, which constantly keeps these little buggers around.I also saw that this company has both fly traps, and moth traps, which would be useful.  How great would it be if they could make One Trap To Rule Them All, as it were?  THAT would be a great product that I would consider buying.Unfortunately, can only give 2 stars here due to crazy residual cost, wasteful design (to be replaced/thrown away every month), and the fact that it's so simple to make your own trap.  Hard to see a reason for this product to exist (but I AM interested in their moth trap!)
B002EJLLEE Being that it is small, and made up to look rather like a piece of fruit, this item could easily be tucked out of the way within a bowl of fruit, which would certainly be getting the wretched little flies at their source. I put mine under the sink, adjacent to the kitchen trash, which seemed to generate the heaviest infestation. It hasn't wiped out the entire population by any meands, but it has diminished the numbers considerably - which is good enough for me. I would suggest that two or three of them in use at a time might have the desired effect.
B002EJLLEE This Terro 2500 Fruit Fly Trap has a cute design but it did very little to control my fruit fly infestation. We tried three products side by out of desperation and here are the results after 48 hours:Terro 2500 Fruit Fly Trap; used as directed, caught 2 fruit fliesFly Web Fly Trap; large plug in light based trap with sticky pads, caught 11 fruit fliesFly Paper Strips, Fly Catcher Trap, Victor Fly Bait 4 Pack; the old standby, not attractive but effective, caught at least 32 (perhaps more)The Terro product did not perform as well as the other two products we tried, but no telling how many it would have caught if it was the only product we used at that time.We are sticking (mild pun intended) with the Fly Paper Strips going forward.CFH
B002EJLLEE I bought this since it was cheaper than the other fruit fly traps I've been using and not so obvious looking.  While it does as good a job as the others, I don't like the container.  My old traps had small holes and a design that, if you knocked one over (tough to do since they had a square base) nothing would spill out. This less stable container has a hole the size of a penny so the liquid can spill out.  And I'm  not really fond of seeing all the dead fruit flies in there.Another annoyance was getting the opening open - I had to use a pliers for that AND to open the bottle of liquid to pour into the unit (and I'm no 90 lb weakling...).  Will stick with the other traps next time.
B002EJLLEE Disclaimer: I am reviewing a trap that I received for free through the Vine program.Well I'm not sure that this product is worth the price, and I don't know if I'd buy one, had I not received one for free to review.As other reviewers have pointed out, you can make yourself a homemade trap with red vinegar.The trap itself looks nice to us humans; not sure what fruit flies think of it. And the juice inside, as some have pointed out, seems to be quite similar to red vinegar. So you might be better off just getting a nice little bowl and a big jar of red vinegar, for less than the cost of this trap -- the trap only comes with one shot of the liquid bait.Sorry I couldn't give it a better test; sometimes we do get infested by lots of fruit flies but this month there were just a couple around. They ARE gone, so either the trap did catch them or they died on their own.
B002EJLLEE I've had my trap in place for about 3 days and see a few victims in the bottom.  I don't have a infestation like a few have copmained about, but the little buggers are annoying and i'd like to avoid them from becoming a problem.The trap is shaped like a small peach with a cap covered funnel entry.  The entire contents of the liquid is poured into the trap and its supposed to be effective for 30 days.  Once that time is up, I'll probably continue to use the container and mix my own cider/soap trap attractant, and still have the cute little trap on the counter... which is much less ugly than custom containers.I like the fact that there is a clear viewport on the side to allow you to see how well your torture chamber is working.  The biggest downside is the price, which is probably due to the cost of the plastic trap,  separate bottle and packaging.  Buy once and reuse...
B002EJLLEE It does work..I tried to make my own but the flies do prefer this one..I have them side by side and they are on the Terro Fly Trap, not the one I made.  I think this is a bit expensive unless it was reusable, but it's not.Update:  Since I wrote this review, I found a McCormicks small plastic herb container with a lid that has holes in it and used that in place of this.  I filled it with some homemade water kefir, a drop of dish liquid and that works just as well as this Fruit Fly Trap, and I can reuse it.  I tried vinegar with honey and it didn't work so well.
B002EJLLEE This time of year is harvest time.  That means various things.  There are many vegetables that pass through our kitchen.  There is a lot of chopping, cooking, canning, and preserving going on.  In addition to that whole scenario, there is one more thing that is almost overwhelming at times- FRUIT FLIES.The Terro 2500 Fruit Fly Trap seemed like a godsend.  I could not wait to use it.  I was disappointed, however, when I saw that you get this little plastic apple like thing, and inside is a wick.  There is a little squeeze bottle of oil that you put in the plastic apple and the idea is that you leave it standing upright in a place where the flies are and let it attract them.  They stay trapped inside and can not reproduce.PROSThis does attract a lot of fliesIt is non-toxicIt is small to put in handy placesDoes trap fruit fliesCONSIs one time use onlyCan be tipped over easilyWastefulNeed to have a LOT of them to be effectiveIf these were re-useable, I would get them again for sure.  I don't think they are cost effective, however, and don't like the fact that you have to keep throwing them away and use a lot of them to keep fruit flies down especially during harvest time.I only have one, and it has put a very slight dent in our fruit fly population, which means I would need a LOT of them to truly work.  This is fine if you have occasional flare ups of fruit flies.  If you have a bigger problem, however, they are not practical or cost effective, I don't think.
B002EJLLEE We put this thing out and it started killing fruit flies almost immediately. Eventually it dried out (or maybe all of the dead flies dried it out?) but I added a little warm water, swished it around and we are back in business again.Yes, there are are relatively cheap alternatives to the Terro 2500 Fruit Fly Trap but this clever little trap is convenient, easy to use and quite effective.
B002EJLLEE I was a bit dubious after the first few days when I only had caught 1 fruit fly. But things ramped up since then and now I have over 10 flies floating in my trap. I have also noticed minimal fruit flies around my fruit. The trap seems to work pretty well.The trap itself is very compact and attractive on the counter. There are transparent areas at the bottom and lower sides so you can monitor its efficacy. It is also re-usable if you want to put a home-made remedy in there.To re-use the trap, cut off the decorative plastic wrap and unscrew the trap. Then pull out the cone filter with tweezers or a blade. Refill with apple cider vinegar to a level below the bottom of the cone.My only complaint is that the liquid has a red coloring that can potentially stain stuff if spilled. I found this out when my child grabbed the trap and started running around with it. It spilled on the carpet but I was able to clean things up quickly with some Folex. A clear fluid would have been preferable since the trap is not spill-proof in any way.Overall, it is a good product that works.
B002EJLLEE During gardening and canning season, we have alot of fruits and vegetables in the kitchen.  The fruit flies are very annoying, and they seem to follow you everywhere.  Because these little creatures follow the scent of fresh ripe fruit -- this discreet little trap draws them in, and doesn't let them out.  Seems to help alot!
B002EJLLEE I laughed when I opened the Terro 2500 Fruit Fly trap.  The description said it looked like an apple.  It doesn't look like any apple I have every seen.  It is a small bright yellow bit of plastic with odd red and green patches.  I had hoped it would be somewhat cute sitting on my counter.  But it isn't.The trap is very easy to use.  You pull off the \"leaf\" tab (which is unfortunate because it was the cutest thing about the apple.  Then you add the red liquid that was included.  So it takes seconds to set up and is very self explanatory.I chose a rather hard test for the Terro 2500 because this is canning season.  That means lot's of fruit, peelings, juice and seeds.  This also means lots of fruit flies.  There are still fruit flies in my kitchen.  But there are fewer than other years.  I can see lots of them in the trap.  So it is working.  I wonder if I had more traps if they would completely eliminate the flies.
B002EJLLEE I have a huge supply of apples and pears from the garden and I can't process them fast enough, this thing is great, at about the size of a golf ball but looks like a little apple, you pour this little bottle of fluid into the trap set it next to your produce and they are attracted to it and I assume drown in the liquid. I have what looks like maybe a 100 flies in there, its been almost a month and i still see them hanging out around the top.  Can't wait to see if it rids me of all them after I stop bringing in the apples.
B002EJLLEE This is a cleverly designed little product and very convenient to use for those who do not want to make their own homemade trap.  The non-toxic ingredients of the liquid lure are essentially a soap and acetic acid/vinegar.  (I inadvertently left a jug of vinegar opened in my kitchen once, and it became a \"lure\" too and drowned a few flies.)  The plastic \"apple\" is a bit smaller than I expected, but it works fine.  It is meant to be a one-time use and disposable.
B002EJLLEE Terro insect killer products tend to be pretty effective and reliable, so I thought this product would be very useful. Normally during fruit fly season, I fill small ramekins with a mixture of cider vinegar and dishwashing liquid. The result can be unappealing, but the mixture is very effective. The little plastic apple dispenser is much cuter than my usual method. The solution in the kit just fills the little apple. Certainly, the solution attracts fruit flies, but not all that well. Terro's instructions suggest that the solution works for a month. Maybe not so much. After a few days, I put the little apple side by side with my usual ramekin of cider and soap, and guess which one attracted more fruit flies. Yep. I might keep the little apple anyway, though  -- I'm sure that once I dump out the Terro solution and rinse it, my usual mix will do just fine.
B002EJLLEE I've always relied on no-pest strips to keep the flying insect population down, but when I saw the Terro 2500 Fruit Fly Trap, I thought I'd give it a try. For the first week...nothing. I put it on my stove--nothing. I put it on the kitchen counter--nothing. I put it on the kitchen table--more nothing. These are places where fruit flies have been irritating me, and I was hoping for something.Four days ago I moved the Terro trap to a shelf near my kitchen sink. Lo and behold, the darned thing is full of fruit flies, and my house is not (when you live in farm country, you get fruit flies even if you don't eat fruit). What a great surprise when I had originally been planning to write a negative review. Instead...five stars. Even that super annoying fruit fly that wouldn't leave me alone is gone. Five stars, definitely.
B002EJLLEE I'm happy to see this little trap is working at reducing the number of fruit flies we see around our little compost bowl. However, I was disappointed to find that the instructions call for the user to completely dispose of the entire trap (not just the liquid bait inside) after 30 days. There's got to be a better, less wasteful alternative to this thing. Not recommended.
B002EJLLEE Easy to use and effective. You just pour the red liquid into the top of the apple. Then you place it wherever you need it. The fruit flies fly in and never come back out. I put this on the counter overnight. In the morning there were a bunch of dad fruit flies. I keep it by the fruit bowl. I would recommend to anyone that keeps fruits or veggies on the counter.
B002EJLLEE My family loves to eat fresh fruit, so we always have some available on the kitchen counter.  Although we always wash it as soon as we get it home from the grocery store, sometimes we get fruit flies, especially around bananas.  This was the case recently, so I immediately pulled out the Terro Fruit Fly Trap.  It was easy to set-up.  I pulled the lid off the fruit shaped trap, squeezed the liquid lure into the trap, and set the opened trap close to the area where the fruit flies were.  After around 1-2 days, I noticed the flies were gone and in the trap!  My only complaint is that the leaf shaped pull on the lid tore when I was opening the trap, so I had to gently use a table knife to pry it open.  However, the trap is supposed to be discarded after 30 days of use, so it's really a very minor issue.
B002EJLLEE TERRO Fruit Fly Trap works great at getting rid of fruit flies.  The trap is easy to use, and is not messy.  It is small and attractive (considering it is a fly trap).  It is safe to use around pets and children. I recommend it.
B002EJLLEE I received this Terro fruit fly trap from the Amazon Vine program, in order to review it.  We've always got fruit flies in our house - around the bananas and the trash can - so I was hoping this product would help eliminate them.I set it up next to the bananas, and in one day it had three fruit flies in it.  There were still several of them flying around, so I left it several more days to see how it worked.  It did catch a few more fruit flies, but it didn't attract all of them.I cut off the plastic wrapper, unscrewed the top, removed the little inner funnel, and dumped the contents out.  I refilled it with about 3 tablespoons of apple cider vinegar and added a couple of drops of dish soap to break the surface tension (this keeps the fruit flies from being able to escape from the liquid).  After reassembling it, I left it sitting near the bananas.  The apple cider vinegar did a much better job of attracting fruit flies into the trap. I haven't seen any flying around, even by the trash on the other side of the kitchen, since I refilled the trap.I'm giving this product 5 stars for the cute design, and for the fact that it can be refilled at home.  I give the liquid inside three stars because it just didn't attract enough fruit flies.  
B002EJLLEE Ahh summer time in South Carolina!  I love fresh produce and always keep some in the house year-round.  Of course every summer the fruit flies find their way to my home too.I usually keep a tiny jar (Baby Food) on the kitchen windowsill with red wine vinegar and soap to trap the little buggers.  It usually does the trick pretty well, but its not that attractive to look at.When I saw this little Apple shaped trap, I thought, oooh pretty!  That would dress up my kitchen window and serve a needed purpose as well.Upon its arrival, I opened the package and read the very simple instructions.  Just pull off the lid, discard it and fill the chamber with the bait liquid.  Simple huh?Well I pulled and tugged but no way that lid was coming off, it wasn't cut out.  Finally, I took a razor blade knife, sliced the top off, and then proceeded to fill.I placed this little apple on the window sill and waited.  Now a week later the chamber has attracted and trapped numerous victims.  Its done the job!This would be a much welcome addition to my kitchen if it was refillable, and not disposable.  I would see no need to re-purchase a new 'apple' each month, if the design was tweaked a bit.  I may try to clean this out and refill with vinegar & soap.  I'll update my review at a later date.
B002EJLLEE I have a big issue with Ga fruit flies, but this product is practically the same as an entire gallon of red apple vinegars. Nothing magical or special here....it is basically the same as using red apple vinegar and a little dish detergent.
B002EJLLEE I have used the Terro ant formula and was so pleased.  I haven't tried this out yet but I expect it will do the job!  The only thing I had a problem with is releasing the lid... Be careful and just pull on the leaf, and it will release.  Jesus' Blessings and Peace ..... I have reviewed the other comments and I'm just wondering if the covering makes a difference.  There were not clear instructions at first I thought I was suposto remove the covering around the apple, but then my husband was able to life the lid without removing the covering.  I'm wondering if the product works if you remove the covering?  I do like the idea of the vinegar in water, I havn't tried that yet either so I can't comment on it.  If there are any changes I will post again!  Jesus' Blessings and Peace
B002EJLLEE Late Summer brought out the little buggers in spades. Does fly paper work on fruit flies? I think it does, but nobody likes to have those nasty, curly killing fields hanging all over the joint. This little bugger worked like a charm, just put it up on top of the fridge where I keep my bananas and other fresh fruit, and within a day or two the only fruit flies I could find in the house were at the bottom of this liquidy grave. Highly recommended.
B002EJLLEE This is a little globe containing a funnel (to trap fruit flies: they fly in but can't fly out), into which you squirt some vinegar.It's totally useless. Fruit flies will totally ignore it, and will land instead on your fruits and vegetables. Even if you put this directly next to fruit fly habitat, they will entirely ignore it.The only upside is that it's nontoxic.
B002EJLLEE This does work like it says and I imagine would be very useful if you had a serious fruitfly problem.. but it smells very strongly of vingear which gnats and fruitflies are attracted to and I think if you just left out some vinegar water it would probably have the same effect. Therefore, I think this is rather gimmicky and the container it's in is not really attractive and when I opened the lid to pour in the solution the little \"leaf handle\" broke. I guess if you try just using vinegar water or another homemade solution and nothing works this would be worth a shot.
B002EJLLEE Love this little thing. It sits unobtrusively on the countermand does the trick to kill fruit flies. I even left out ripe bananas and a cut tomato, and it worked great. The main active ingredient is basically dish soap (sodium laureth sulfite, I believe), so I'm going to try refilling it next month with dish soap. Nice little product.
B002EJLLEE This is a small plastic container, smaller than the palm of your hand, with an upside-down, grooved triangle at the top that stops fruit flies from escaping once they fly in. You pour in what smells like cider vinegar and leave the trap in place. Mine started to work immediately, and 2 weeks later it has collected a good few flies.My only disappointment is that I can't use it again -- there is no way to unscrew the top of the container, but then again, the price is decent enough to be able to by a few at a time.
B002EJLLEE The Terro 2500 Fruit Fly Trap is small and attractive, and can easily be placed where fruit flies are a problem. You pour the included bottle of bait into the trap, which contains a \"funnel\" that makes it difficult for flies to escape.  The flies are attracted to the scent of the bait and drown in it.However...  The bait is simply the classic solution of vinegar and detergent, plus some red coloring (which is for your benefit, not the flies'.)  After 30 days you are supposed to toss the whole thing and buy another.  The trap does not come apart, so you can't just clean it out and refill it. At least it is designed so that you can see how well it is working, but if you have a severe infestation, you would probably go through a bunch of these.  If you don't mind a lower-tech solution, just fill a shallow dish with apple cider vinegar and add a few drops of dish detergent - you'll accomplish the same thing and spend a lot less.
B002EJLLEE Love fresh tomatoes.... Best flavor when you don't refrigerate them.  Of course, they come with those pesky fruit flies.  As do almost every other fresh fruit and vegetable summer delight.  But the Terro Fruit Fly trap works wonderfully.  It's small and east to use, since it only requires that you open the clever apple shaped container, and set it near your produce.  I have tried many home made ideas and solutions, but this works best.  Keeps the tiny varmints from taking over the kitchen.  Works for me!  This shall be a summer staple from now on.
B002EJLLEE The first thing I noticed when I opened the container - it smells like vinegar. If anyone takes the time to search the 'net for home remedies for fruit fly issues, you'll find vinegar and dish soap as key ingredients to stopping them. Seems Terro has decided to market the home remedy to make a few dollars.Having tried the home remedy, I can say that given time, it can and does work. And given this is essentially the home remedy, it can and does work given time.If you're looking for an instant fix, you'll need to look elsewhere. If you're willing to wait 2 weeks, most likely one or two of these (or the home made remedy) will do the trick.
B002EJLLEE Yes, you can make your own low cost trap with apple cider vinegar + dishwashing detergent + jar, but this is a handy all-in-one trap.  At work we had an infestation problem in the area where there was free fruit, and we tried all sorts of traps, including homemade ones.  This Terro trap came after a series of traps did not help us get completely rid of the flies.Pros- Looks better sitting next to the fruit than anything else we had- Pretty effective, lots of dead flies, but didn't completely eradicate them (nothing else had either)- Easy to prepare- Easy to cap and tossCons- Lots of wasteful plastic if compared to the homemade remedy- Pricey
B002EJLLEE Most everyone knows that something sweet with vinegar will attract fruit flies....which are ANNOYING.You can make a small container at home and have it do what this product does...  However, the design of this little trap is awesome in that it is made to look like a piece of fruit and is not an eyesore in your kitchen/bathroom/under the sink etc..  It just is there; catches flies; and then after about 2-4 weeks you throw it out.  It is capped at the top so you are able to close it when throwing out and or when not needed.Awesome...must buy if you have a fruit fly issue.
B002EJLLEE We have a container in which fruit and vegetable scraps are placed to be taken out to the compost pile. It doesn't always get taken out every day. We make fruit smoothies every day so we get a good accumulation at times, plus we have a lot of fruit on the counter waiting to ripen. The first day I put out the Terro 2500 Fruit Fly Trap near the container of fruit scraps, the little buggers were near it or on it the whole day. The next morning, no flies in the trap. But... the next morning there were many flies in the trap and the following even more. I haven't seen a single fruit fly around the kitchen today. The traps do not have an odor, are very small and easy to use. The trap must be replaced after a month which is likely because they might develop an odor at that point. My hope is that I no longer have fruit flies all winter around the kitchen. I highly recommend the Terro 2500.
B002EJLLEE I've tried both Terro and Springstar. They both work. Terro lasts a lot longer, about a month, but works more slowly. Took a few days before I noticed the fruit flies gone. Springstar only lasts about a week with one extra refill (so 2 weeks in total) but works quite quickly, about a day before you'll notice the difference. I would continue to buy both depending on the situation.
B002EJLLEE So, we keep fruit and veggies in wire bowls on our kitchen counter.  We had a fruit fly problem recently as a result.  I was thrilled to receive this, in hopes that it would make a bigger dent in our fruit fly problem than our current strategies / actions / solutions.  Sadly, it did not.Now, it definitely DID catch fruit flies - just not enough to really matter, not particularly quickly, and not in the same quantities as basic homemade solutions did.On the whole, I was disappointed.  Compared to putting some wine in a clear container, sealing it with Saran wrap, and punching a few holes in the Saran wrap for the flies to get in (but not out), this product just didn't hold up.  In one or two days of the homebased solution  we caught multiples of the fruit flies we caught using this Terro Fuit Fly Trap.  Plus, the Terro trap is a one-time only / disposable  deal, which isn't exactly my favorite thing.So, while it did work somewhat, it really wasn't enough for me.  I wasn't impressed.  So, I'm giving 2 stars - it worked, a little, but not enough for me to purchase in the future.
B002EJLLEE This little device worked well.  I just poured in the bait and put it behind the sink.  The flies flocked to it, and the kitchen was fruit-fly-free by the next day.  The only reason I don't give it five stars is the cost.  People are telling me some vinegar with a couple drops of dish detergent in an old jar works about as well.  I have to try it.
B002EJLLEE This container is great and looks sharp on the sink but after having limited luck with Terro's provided attractant after two weeks, I kept the container but replaced what was inside with vinegar and dish soap. My results almost doubled compared to the provided attractant and it will save me quite a bit of money on going to not have to purchase expensive attractant.Would I purchase this again? Yep, because for the small price you get a cleverly designed container and don't have to have an ugly babyfood jar sitting out with dead bugs in it.Below is detailed insturctions on how to do what I did.Using the Terro container, I filled it with a teaspoon of cider vinegar, 2 tablespoons of water, and a drop of two of dish soap will attract and drown fruit flies.The fruit flies are attracted to the vinegar smell and any fruit smell from the dish soap. If you need more \"power\", you can use a tiny bit of old fruit or fruit juice to really attract them. Once the scented items attract them, the detergent traps them. The detergent actually reduces the surface tension of the liquid, allowing the flies to more readily sink and drown; if the fruit flies fall in, it sticks to wings so they cannot fly.Just dump the mixure out every 5 days and replace it to keep it cleaner and fresher.To quickly kill off the rest of the population, try pouring two cups of warm vinegar (can be diluted with half water) down your kitchen and bathroom drains.I hope this detailed instructions were helpful to you! Best of luck fighting your little enemies!!
B002EJLLEE this little fruit fly trap works!of course, so does using some cider vinegar in a tall glass with an inverted paper cone...however, this trap is small and attractive (the flies are drawn to the smell of the included colored vinegar, not the size, shape or color of this plastic trap, which looks like a small Gala apple)i like how the bait was included - very convenienti used mine next to a small swing-top compost canister i keep on the kitchen counter for trimmings and other debris
B002FV81DA The debate continues over whether or not to use a cover on a central air unit but I chose to buy one and I am glad I chose this one. Living in the Pacific Northwest produces more than a fair share of rain. The position of my Central Air on the outside of the house allows rain to drop right into the unit. Not anymore. This cover has two adjustable drawstrings and even includes a buckle to accomadate the coolant lines on the back of the unit. I was very happy when I realized this cover had these features. This thing is strapped down tight and doesn't move a bit in the wind.+ Lightweight+ Great Quality+ Price+ 2 Drawstrings plus Buckle Strap+ Snug Fit_Bottom Line_ Yes, I would recommend this cover to a friend and I am also ording a cover for my gas grill. I am so thrilled with the quality of this cover that I am confident I will not regret buying a cover for my grill.
B002FV81DA This Air Conditioner Cover is nicely made, strong and fit our old air conditioner perfectly.  We now have a larger air conditioner and the cover goes halfway down, but the top is the part that needs to be covered in the wintertime.  The cover is absolutely fine on the larger a/c unit.
B002FV81DA This is a really nice cover and is well made. It is the best cover I have found for my AC. You won't go wrong with this cover.
B002FV81DA At this price it's a no brainer - exceeded my expectations. I can see this lasting a few years even - seems well made.Really at this price, it's easily a 5-star product. The others I looked at were 2-3X the price and it felt silly spending that much on a cover for your AC. But, maybe that's just me.Perfect for our new Trane AC.
B002FV81DA These covers are not only well made, but they look great.  The fabic is heavy and solid and does not become brittle when it gets cold outside as so many other have done.  It fits snugly over the compressor unit and has a pull cord at the bottom so that you can make it really snug.  Even has an opening for the coolant pipes and electrical line to come in and out of the unit.  Best covers I have ever found; and I've unsed a number of others and they all got brittle and cracked and had to be thrown away within a year or two.  I expect these to last many years.
B002FYAQ2Q Elsewhere on Amazon these same staples are described as 5&#34; long.  They're not.  They're barely over 31/2&#34;, very lightweight and flimsy.  They could be used in soft ground without rocks and where strong holding power isn't necessary, but otherwise I wouldn't use them.
B002FYAQ2Q I use these to hold soaker hoses in place and for that they work well in dry soil, but pull out easy when it rains.
B002FYAQ2Q I use these staples to hold down weed cloth.  If you've never used weed cloth, it's pretty handy stuff.  You just spread it out on areas where you don't want weeds to grow, and they don't!  I also use weed cloth in areas where I'm putting down things like pea gravel.  This keeps the gravel from working its way down into the soil.  But of course, in each of these cases, you need to secure your weed cloth.  (It's a little like staking down your tent when you're camping.)  These &#34;Easy Gardener&#34; staples work very well ... they're exactly the right size and and heft for the job.  I tried other means of staking down the cloth when I first started, but it's best to just shell out a few dollars and get the &#34;right tool for the job,&#34; so to speak.  In this pack, you get 75 staples ... that will last me probably forever.  (The staples are re-usable if/when you decide to take up your weed cloth.)  I've never used the staples for this purpose, but I think they would be very handy for staking down things like bird netting, in your garden.  Really, in any instance where you need to secure something fairly light to the ground, these staples would do the trick.
B002FYAQ2Q These work well to hold down the Harvest Guard fabric covers on your plants. but be prepared they rust very quickly and then are hard to handle.  I don't think that they will work for very many years, I have only had them in my garden for about a month and they are really rusty.
B002FYAQ2Q Using it to hold down chicken wire in really hard clay like soil. Works very well. I will probably buy several more boxes.
B002FYAQ2Q These are only 4\" long, not enough to hold much of anything. Don't bother with these.I am annoyed that nowhere in the description do they state that the size of the pins, so I am uploading a photo of one next to a ruler, hoping to prevent others from making the same mistake.UPDATE: Within a few days they started rusting too. I was going to try to use these for other simple things - no more.
B002FYAQ2Q These appear to be the same strength as what I purchased in a retail store. Although they are about 1/2 inch shorter, they were still long enough for my purpose which was to fasten rubber tree rings around my trees. They will bend if you hit a stone or very hard ground, but are otherwise sturdy and pound it easily. This value pack is a good buy.
B002FYAQ2Q I had landscaping fiber put down under my enormous two story hollies after a major trim job. First major rain and the fiber was coming up through the mulch. The landscaper said he would come back and use landscaping staples to hold it in place. Despite having worked at an upscale nursery for several years I did not know there was such a thing as landscaping staples. After giving up on the landscaper, I went on Amazon and searched for these and was happy to discover they were so cheap. I went out and fixed it all myself.I wish Amazon sold 5 star landscapers.
B002FYAQ2Q I found these landscaping pins absolutely perfect for holding ivy and like ground covers to establish. Now my erosion control methods are working - with very little cost.Thanks, Amazon
B002ITKYRK For years I have been having a black spot disease problem on some heavenly bamboo in my yard. I live in Seattle and fungus is an issue due to the climate. I started using this product and I'll admit I've been pretty inconsistent in applying it--although when I do, I'm diligent about coating the tops and bottoms of all the leaves. Well, despite my lack of following directions, the spray is working. In fact, I am surprised how well it works...even with sporadic use. Plus it's organic. I'm satisfied and plan to try it on my vegetable garden when pests show up later this summer.
B002ITKYRK As an organic gardener for many years, Safer products have been my mainstay. For a large garden it makes sense to purchase the concentrate and mix up your own spray. For houseplants or a small raised bed, this large spray bottle is perfect. If it's just an aphid infestation, blast them off with a hose. For tougher bugs, mites, scale and fungal diseases, grab the Safer spray. You need to be sure to coat the undersides of leaves as well as the tops. This is a multi purpose spray, but for roses I use Green Light Rose Defense.
B002ITKYRK I have a minifruit orchard in my backyard.  All my small trees and shrubs seem to be okay except for one of the persimmon trees, which has riddled leaves.  So my initial impression is that it works okay, but I haven't tried it out for a whole season yet.  Might be cheaper to just get regular nonfancy sulfa based spray.
B002ITKYRK I have the perfect test for comparing this spray with the typical stuff you find on the shelf at your local Lowe's/Home Depot, etc.I have a gardenia at the back of my house, in a fairly tough area for a gardenia, that is constantly plagued (especially this time of year (Spring) by white flies, disease, leaf drop, you name it.  So I have to almost constantly spray the things down with pesticides and fungicides.So I sprayed one of my suffering gardenias with the \"Less Safe\" brand (Immunox) and the other gardenia with this \"Safer Brand\" to see which would be more effective.  Fortunately, both showed noticeable results in a few days, as there were no white flies in either gardenia, and the black spot was much less prevalent in both, and I think less black spot on the one that was sprayed with this brand.  Both gardenias were so bad (before the first spraying) that a second spraying was necessary after a few days however.Not a huge difference between the results of the two visibly, but I would definitely give the nod to the gardenia that had been sprayed with Safer Brand (i.e. the gardenia sprayed with Safer Brand seemed to respond much better and as a result looked better).  Cannot speak at all to the chemicals (and their relative safety profiles) used in these as I am not in that field at all, so I will have to trust the mfr on that I guess.Overall, good stuff, would definitely recommend, and if it's competitive, price-wise with Immunox, I will definitely buy in the future.
B002ITKYRK This product does what is says it will do.  I like the fact that it is all natural. I try to buy organic, so why would I want to use pesticides on the food that I take the trouble to grow?All in all, I am satisfied with this product.
B002ITKYRK Since so many pesticide products are harmful to people or animals, I'm glad to see less toxic ones on the market. This one worked on our rose bushes. I can't report on any other plants I sprayed because the hot dry summer did them in.Even though this spray is \"Safer,\" there are still precautions that you must follow so read the label. For instance, do not use it  on Delicate Fern, Apricots, Filberts, Stock, Walnuts, Nasturtium, Sweet Pea, Violet, Mountain Ash, Japanese Maple, Horse Chestnut, Spinach, Vibernum, newly planted cuttings, or plants stressed out by drought.When I first used this product, I noticed a sulfur smell, but it was not overpowering. Other than that, I didn't observe any drawbacks to the spray.
B002ITKYRK Because it was billed as a safe and organic product, I first used Safer Brand 3-in-1 Garden Spray on some pesky flies on my indoor plants.  While I realize that the product isn't really designed to kill the larva that are in the soil, it didn't even kill the flying adults - even when I sprayed them directly onto the bugs.  I also used the product on the aphids that were eating my roses and again there was no affect.  After going 0-2, and it wasn't for underuse - I repeatedly sprayed mass quantities on the bugs - I decided to throw the product away and invest in something that would actually kill garden pests.Safer, organic, or not, I see no reason to spend $13 on a product that doesn't work - and the Safer Brand 3-in-1 Garden Spray doesn't cut the mustard!
B002ITKYRK Every year, I lose my bok choy to flea beetles.  At first sign of them this year, I used Safer  Brand 3-in-1 and it took care of them right away.My roses tend to get a black spot and yellow leaves, so I've sprayed them well and so far, they've just lost the few leaves that I didn't catch early.  Same goes with my bee balm, so I'm trying the spray on the lower leaves of it as well.My tomatoes have had a fungus for the last few years that I'm told is carried in the soil.  I mulch and remove the lower leaves to keep it under control, but this year, I've also used the 3-in-1 spray.  It may have been a little too warm when I sprayed the tomatoes because it seems to have burned the leaves a little.  They seem to be recovering though. I had the same results with my miniature roses...slight burning of the leaves, but they are recovering too.
B002ITKYRK I mainly use this product for roses and other flowering plants, I do not have any vegetables or fruits in my garden, but if I did, I love the fact that you can use this spray up to the day you pick the vegetables, since it is organic and safe.  I sprayed down my roses and flowering plants and coated the stems and leaves, and have not seen any spots or bugs walking or biting my leaves.  The bottle has a large quantity of spray and has two spray settings (direct or wide area spray) I used the wide area spray and coated the leaves and everything.  This is product is easy to use and is not poisonous or nasty to get on your hands or clothe.  On the bottle it mentioned something that I found strange, it says it is bad for aquatic invertebrates, I just found that strange, so if you have aquatic invertebrates, keep the spray away from them, I do not, so I sprayed away!  In all it is good product and is easy to use and is little maintenance.
B002ITKYRK I've only been using this product for about a week, but already I'm very impressed with it. I sprayed some echinacea seedlings that aphids had descended upon, thinking for sure the little seedlings would not be happy being sprayed and might die, but the aphids promptly died and the seedlings rebounded beautifully. I've also hit the cabbage, tomato, and cucumber leaves in the garden, and I'm seeing improvements in the leaves and no bugs. Powdery mildew is especially a problem in my area, so the 3-in-1 utility of this Safer spray is a great blessing for me.I'm kind of a klutz when it comes to knowing what's best for different plants in the garden, not because I'm not interested but because my memory is so poor. I love it that I can carry this one spray bottle with me when I'm checking the garden for problems and hit them as I find them, whatever they are. The fact that this spray is organic is essential and fantastic, because I won't use non-organic products in my garden. In the past, I've just let the bugs and fungal infections have their way, but not this time.When I finish this bottle, I will be buying theSafer Brand 5462 3-in-1 Concentrate, 32 Ouncesto refill it. In short: This looks to be an awesome product! The full effect of it won't be in until the end of the summer, but I can see how useful this spray will be in helping conscientious organic gardeners nurture balance in their gardens.
B002ITKYRK Safer is a brand I trust.  I used this spray to battle aphids on pepper plants and a few other pests on other vegetables.It's more expensive than mixing your own solutions, but very convenient.Most of us who garden lack the luxury of time and it's often wiser to have a quick solution than waiting until you have time for a cheaper one.  Worked for me.
B002ITKYRK We live in the North East, an area where we can put our house plants outside in the summer, so that they can get more light and fresh air. The trouble is, when we bring them in in the Fall, they tend to bring some passengers, which spend the Winter chewing their way through our plants. We're reluctant to spray them with anything heavy duty, since we have to share the house with any toxic fumes.Insecticidal soap, like this product, has the advantage of being completely harmless to mammals. No problems with your cat, dog or child. The manufacturers claim that it's safe on food crops as well.However, you need to be aware of a few things:Insecticidal soap works by direct contact with the beasties. Don't expect it to work if you spray it before you see the infestation.Quite a few plants won't tolerate soap (including Maples, Viburnum and Camellias). Check the label on the bottle before using it.Fish don't like soap. Keep it away from your pond or tank.This product also includes sulphur, as a preventative against fungus. Remember that fungicides are only preventatives - not cures: it's too late to use it if you can already see the symptoms. Some plants don't appreciate sulphur, particularly under drought conditions. Again, look to the directions on the bottle.It's too early to say whether this insecticide will work. I suspect that it won't be as effective as a good systemic, but I'll give it its best shot over the summer. I'll update this review with my findings.
B002ITKYRK This comes in a handy spray bottle and is very easy to use. How well it works is subject to personal opinion when compared to other products. Like many garden products the cost of this spray is dependant on where it is purchased. I have seen it for as low as $8.04. There is a 32 oz. concentrated version of his product for $18.06. I have sprayed it on my roses and will apply additional treatments as directed. It is working well in eliminating insects. I am giving it five stars because I cannot find a reason not to do so.
B002ITKYRK I found this product to be an effective aid to my gardening.I applied the product to the back of leaves, just at dusk.  In particular, I have a problem with aphids on squashes, and this product eliminated that problem.Unfortunately, it seems to have deterred my ladybugs as well, at least for 2-3 weeks (I use soaker hoses, btw, rather than sprinklers).I had no problem with fungus or mites or other problems of that type.  I only sprayed occasionally, and early in the cycle (before flowering) and it seems to work well.  Compared with last year (I used dish-soap) this product is far superior.  It also lasts a good while if you're sparing enough.As best as I can tell, the contents of this are merely salts and fats and sulfur, and this is a comfort.
B002ITKYRK I loved using this on my plants. It worked great. It smelled great and it was very easy to use. I will be buying this again next year. I love that it is safe for my plants and to use around me and my children.
B002ITKYRK Being an individual who has never bothered with marketed spray of any kind and has priorly relied on much more homemade methods of pest control, I must say this Garden Spray is very much something of an improvement.  My little garden consists of a variety of vegetables, herbs, and flowers.  In the two months I have been using the Garden Spray I have yet to see a bug, everything looks quite healthy, and my cat, who for some inexplicable reason wants to nibble the spinach even right after I spray it, has shown no adverse toxic effects.So what am I to conclude from this?  It seems quite safe for humans and animals alike.  My plants are happily growing. It's comfortably organic. It's easy to use and I enjoy the stream vs spray options.  I'm quite pleased with the product and would recommend it.I only must mention that I am unable to test this in, shall we say, extreme garden conditions.  I have an apartment balcony garden in the middle of town where I dare say bugs and other such problems are a little more rare.  Also, while this is certainly a fine little jack-of-all-trades product, I wonder how it would stand up to a singular nasty incident.But all in all, it seems to be very much doing its job.
B002ITKYRK He's a licensed pesticide manager but in his heart he is an organic type.  Our garden is organic.  It will take until the end of the season to be sure if this stuff is as good as it looks.  The ingredients are time tested.  So far - so good.  Tomatoes are getting ripe and are looking healthy.  The bugs got the peaches before this product arrived - so no verdict on it's usefulness there.
B002ITKYRK A great gardener I'm not.  I always seem to spray the wrong stuff at the wrong time and I was never sure which product I should be using.  This product simplifies my life by taking care of most common problems with a single product.  I figured with the Safer Brand 3-in-1 my roses might have a chance this year.  What I'm doing differently is instead of waiting to see insect damage or disease, I'm taking a pro-active, preventative approach.  As soon as my roses started leafing out this year I started spraying them weekly with the 3-in-1 spray.  Either my roses developed a self-defence strategy over the winter or this product is working (I tend to think the latter) since I can't find any signs of insect damage or disease.The spray can be used safely on many vegetables so I'll be using it in my garden this year too.  As with any insecticide read the label to make sure it is safe to use for your application.  With the help of the Safer Brand 3-in-1 I hope to have a great insect-free and disease-free vegetable crop this year.Happy Gardening!
B002ITKYRK I rarely use chemicals or pesticides in the garden but had the opportunity to give this product a try.  I have a perennial Rose Mallow (hibiscus moscheutos) whose leaves get devoured yearly by the caterpillar of the sawfly.  I've tried handpicking, but they just keep coming.  I used this product specifically for the leaf eating caterpillars it says it controls.  It did not.  After one weeks use, there were still caterpillars eating the sprayed leaves, the few I chose to spray daily.
B002ITKYRK This all purpose garden spray is perfect for ALL your plants from carrots and tomatoes to roses! Its a no brainer: got fungus, use this, something eating your plant up, use this, not sure what kind of bug is enjoying your growies, use this! What could be simpler? PLUS, its very effective. I used it on some web making bug in my roses, aphids on my flowers, and horn worms in my tomatoes. DONE! Now I spray every week during the growing season to PREVENT problems. Highly recommended!
B002ITKYRK I have several different types of plants, flowers and herbs on my patio.  I've tried a couple of other brands which didn't work as well as this one.  The thing I have the most problem with are spider mites.  So far, this product has worked and I haven't had to spray nearly as often as in the past.  I don't have a large garden or anything, so that's why the ready-to-use spray works for me.  I just have several planters, and so far. . . so good.
B002ITKYRK UPDATE:Several weeks after spraying my rose leaves with this product, I noticed that they are in much worse shape than they'd normally be now, in this first blooming cycle after winter dormancy.  I can't say for sure it is this spray, but I can't think of any other factors. The leaves have been eaten by something, in a \"lacy\" pattern.  Don't think I'll be using this product on my roses again; maybe on other hardier plants.--------------I've used Safer brand products for at least 20 years.  Sometimes I'll just mix up some homemade soap solution, and that will work just fine.But some garden phenomenon require a few relatively benign chemicals. Trouble is, most products have way too many, and this spells trouble for beneficial insects and up the food chain.This product contains everything I'd normally use in the garden but no more, and I don't have to mix myself!
B002ITKYRK I grew up in an age where everything was sprayed in DDT.  I can remember the Orkin Man spraying our house while we children were playing nearby - no concerns at all....  so I was a little skeptical that an \"organic\" \"safe\" product existed...that worked.... I'll have to take their word on the \"safer\" part of it, but after one application to my roses, the black spot and whatever else was ailing them (who knows, leaves falling off, blooms eaten) was solved...the roses look better than they ever have.  I just ordered another bottle of this stuff - I'm very happy to recommend it.Good luck with your garden!Update 8/1:  My roses now look better than they ever have in the past 5 years.  The main issues I was having were around mold and spot... which this stuff definitely controls.  Seems like other reviewers are having less success controlling insects... and I can't vouch for that as I haven't had an insect problem yet (though now that I've typed this, a swarm of locusts will devour my roses).
B002ITKYRK Each spring, my roses get an orange growth on the underside of their leaves.  It appears soon after the first roses are mature enough to cut for bouquets.  If we can defeat this first onslaught of the fungus, the roses are healthy for the remainder of the year.  Safer 3 in 1 spray is effective when used on a small area.  If I am diligent and catch the rust in its beginning stages, so I only need to spray a few leaves, I love this product.  However, if the fungus gets away from me and an entire bush is affected, it is next to impossible to spray all the leaves on both sides to the point of run-off with this spray bottle.  At that point the gardener has to come in with his industrial sprayer and get down to business.  There is little scent to the Safer 3 in 1, so it isn't obnoxious to use.  But it does leave a very slight flavor in my mouth for several hours afterward, which tells me I have breathed in more fumes than I realized.  It defeats small bits of rose rust, and whiteflies hate it.  It definitely gets put to good use in targeted areas of my garden.
B002ITKYRK Our biggest problem is snails on canna and agapanthus, and this actually does deter them a bit, but you have to coat both sides of all the leaves, frequently if you have showers. However, Safer Brand isn't really meant to deter snails, so it's not surprising that it didn't stop the snails.This does seem to work on regular buggy pests that I had on a couple outdoor flowers. However, per the directions, you have to coat both sides of the leaves fully.  In short, one spray container of this doesn't last that long when you have to use it heavily on a bunch of plants.  Consequently, I think this might be a better bet for inside plants with the occasional pest, rather than outside plants under constant attack.
B002ITKYRK Hard to get super excited over a product that seems to do what it advertises to do.  Bugs die.  Diseases and fungi disappear.  That's what it is designed to do and it does it.  So does almost every product like this one.  If their claims are correct, it is nice to know there are less chemicals and poisons in this product, yet it is still effective.  So, for a \"semi-green\" shotgun for garden ailments...this one fits the bill.
B002ITKYRK I used this product on my basil plants started from seed in one of those peat pot starter boxes.My basil seedlings got watered from the top and they began to turn black, shrivel, and damp off.  I saturated them with the product and lost only about 2/36 plants.  I'm sure some of you have had the experience of watching your entire basil crop turn to black slop - I don't know what causes it or if this is really what stopped it but I was amazed.  We also have had no aphids or fruit flies bothering the starts (which live on the kitchen table from Lent until the rain stops in the spring and the flood waters recede and we can get in the garden- about June 1.)Again I don't know that it was SB5452 3/1 that did the trick but I had much better outcomes than usual this year with seedlings.
B002ITKYRK I LOVE that this is a safer, not-crazily-toxic product. I try to use green whenever I can on my garden, especially for edibles. My cucumber was having problems with both mildew and bugs this year, so I thought this might be a way to take care of both at once. While it did seem to take care of the bugs, the mildew continues. The plant is still alive and making cucumbers, but not as healthy as it could be because of the issue. So I'd recommend this for bugs and possibly other problems, but not for a mildew issue.
B002ITKYRK I have a sun problem at my home. There is none. All the trees are to large. So I also have a fungus problem that comes with the lack of intense sun. I sprayed the dirt and containers with this to see if I can rid the early fungal growth and it seems to be working great! I will update later in the season on how the insect control works. I'm happy that I do not have an early fungus issue this year so far!I received this product free of charge to try through the vine program.Would I spend my own money on this? Yes
B002ITKYRK This spray has helped get the insects and fungus somewhat under control on our rose bushes. At first I thought that it was also discouraging the deer, but that effect didn't last long. Then again, the company makes no claim about it being a deer repellant.
B002ITKYRK I got this insecticidal 3-in-1 spray for use in and around my vegetable/flower/herb gardens.  The spray did an excellent job at eliminating the caterpillars from my collard plants.  Whatever was eating my sprawling mint has also disappeared.  The spray also did an effective job at reducing the black spot and leaf spot on my roses. Of course, roses will need repeated application of the product.  I did a general spraying of the other vegetables and flowers in the vicinity. However, as one reviewer pointed out, this spray is best used against visible pests, not as a preventative.I usually have an infestation of whiteflies and aphids by now, but I have not seen them this year, so I cannot comment on the usage of this spray to control those pests.  When they do appear, I will test the spray against them as well.The only downside so far is that my green beans seemed to get some leaf damage from using this product.  Also, I wiped out a tiny (4 leaves) watermelon plant that sprouted from seed.  I would not use this product on young/new plant life.  Other than these minor issues, I have no complaints.  I will also add that spraying a large area can be tiresome and probably wouldn't be suitable for someone who has arthritis.I give this product a green light for general usage around the garden, in flower beds and in herb gardens.  The organic formula should lessen worries about the use of harsh chemical pesticides.
B002ITKYRK about a month ago I noticed that some of the plants in my backyard were developing spots on them.  I had no clue what was causing the spots. Was it bugs, mold, maybe even a plant disease? I had no clue.  Enter in the Safer Brand 3-in-1 Garden Spray.  I followed the directions and hit my roses and infantile blue berry bush with this stuff hoping it would solve the problem and so far it has.  I'm impressed. (mostly because now I don't have to checkout and read books on plant disease).  This products great and took the guess work out of gardening for an amateur like me.  Only if it would water and feed my plants too.
B002ITKYRK Last summer I spent more time than I care to think about wondering what was causing my zucchini plants to die from the bottom up, and picking caterpillars off my kale and collards. I wasn't really interested in repeating either experience, so I was thrilled to find this.I've been applying regularly, re-applying after rain (not that we've had any) and watering, and....watching my kale getting eaten by caterpillars. Those little green ones that are supposed to be easily killed with BT. But I guess not with this. Even spraying it directly on them doesn't seem to have an effect.As for the zucchini, I'm not really sure what's going on. It doesn't appear to have that stem worm thing, or at least I can't find an entry slit, but it's definitely not doing well. This may not be the spray's fault, but having seen no evidence that this is improving anything, I'm afraid I won't be spending any money on it. :-(
B002ITKYRK My garden is a mix of flowers and veggies.  Some plants have some small insect issues, others have a bit of browning in the leaves.  I tried this spray and noticed no effect after a week of daily use.  The good news is that it didn't do any harm - used it on saplings, grown plants, flowers, etc.  The bad news is that I didn't notice any improvement in the health of my plants either.  Maybe it takes longer.  I'll keep using it and update this review if anything changes.  For now, it seems to be the equivalent to spraying water on your plants.
B002ITKYRK I am excited to be able to try this Safer product.  I have used alot of their stuff in the past and have been very pleased with the results.  The fact that this is a 3 in 1 spray saves room on my gardening shelf.  I haven't had any gardening problems yet this season due to late season  cold and rain but will update my review when I have actually gotten some field use from this product.
B002ITKYRK My roses get some type of bug every year. So I am proactive this year and I have sprayed them with this organic 3 in 1 spray. It is good for flowers and trees. I like that is safe around pets and humans. I am counting on it to work and I will have no issues this year. If it doesn't preform I will come back and give you an update. I cannot really tell right now in a month will tell. I like what it claims. So is you see no updates then you will know I was satisfied and had no need to come back and warn you. Trust me I would come back.
B002ITKYRK Safer products are the ones to turn to when organic insect control is needed. I rarely use insecticides of any sort, but every once in awhile there's a garden problem that can't be eradicated without help.  I successfully use 3-in-1 Garden Spray to periodically control Japanese Beetles, although Safer does make other products specifically targeted for Japanese Beetles.  I like 3-in-1 Garden Spray's broader scope, as it kills a variety of insects/mites. This is the one to have on hand \"just in case.\"  It also prevents and controls fungal diseases like powdery mildew, black spot, leaf spot and rust.  Ingredients consist of sulfur and soap derived from natural fats and plant oils.  While more natural than traditional synthetic insecticides, gardeners should still use 3-in-1 only when necessary and with discretion.  Not all insects are harmful. This product cannot discern a beneficial bug from a bad one.  Being a conscientious gardener and using organic Safer products, like this one, will help minimize environmental and health risks.
B002ITKYRK I've tried a lot of pesticides, and to be honest, most of them aren't very successful. The best luck I've had is with Ortho RosePride Insect, Disease & Mite Control Aerosol, but the scent is so strong you need to wear a mask/eye goggles to spray it (in my opinion) and you cannot safely use it indoors. (As a general aside, the effectiveness of pesticide seems to be directly proportional to how severe the headache you get from the pesticide/scent when you use it.) This left me in a quandary, since my mealy bug/spider mite problem on my indoor citrus and coffee trees was horrible all winter. I did use the Safer product until I ran out of it, and it was initially moderately successful on the spider mites.  It did not, however, work at all on the mealy bugs, and the spider mites seemed to build up resistance to it.  I was left using rubbing alcohol soaked paper towels to scrub each leaf and stem of my indoor coffee, citrus and other plants at least once a month.  Unless you have a mild infestation of an easy to kill bug, don't bother.
B002ITKYRK I tried this spray for several pesky problems, and have had success with each.  I have northern kiwi plants that develop a powdery substance (mildew?) on the leaves.  I usually try to trim them off, but can never completely control it.  This product worked great, and the plants were able to grow and spread without any additional problems.  I also used it in the garden, and it decreased the insect population to a great degree.  I am a novice, so I could not say which buggers were eating out there, but this was the best year ever, with less vegetable rot and insect damage.  I have one issue with it though, it has ALOT of instructions and restrictions, so be sure to read the label to be sure it will work with the issues you are dealing with.
B002ITKYRK Safer Brand 5452 3-in-1 32-Ounce Ready-to-Use Garden Spray is a natural detergent-based way to keep critters and fungus off of the plants, and so far, I've used it at night to keep creepy crawlers off of our vegetables with very good success. We have had snails and bugs attack our gentle little garden, but what is safe to use around what we may ingest? This stuff is.The blight that had been hitting our flox and some leafy plants ( lilac bush and grapes) has not come back.  an ounce of &lt;safe> prevention is really good, so use Safer Brand with confidence that so far, we're still here and healthy... and so are the the best parts of our plants!
B002ITKYRK One of the biggest problems with the \"Organic Gardening\" movement is that it has people believing it is an \"either/or\" situation between Organic and chemical control. Your best option is to use both!Organic products are best used as a preventive and an early strike against garden pests. Chemical products are best used as a last option when the pests are wining. As I explained once, \"Organic products are like drinking a glass of Orange Juice each morning, Chemical products are like taking a mega does of Vitamin C when you get sick\".Safer 3 in 1 is an even better choice as a preventive, because it works against Insects, Disease and Mites. Using the right product for the right problem is an area where far too many amateur gardeners waste chemical sprays as well. With a product like this, you use less since you are fixing three problems with one squirt and you are keeping your garden and its crops safe to eat.  If you use it regularly on a schedule, you can stop the problems before they become bad enough to require a chemical solution.
B002ITKYRK I have battled infestations of mealybugs on some quite valuable yellow clivias for the past several years.  From dabbing on isopropyl alcohol to spraying on pyrethrin in an oil medium, nothing worked until now.  One application of this spray wiped out the infestations on all the plants.  The fact that the active ingredients in the spray degrade quickly and do not persist is a bonus; this product's effectiveness is its real virtue.
B002ITKYRK We had an attack in the garden from the squash bugs, so I was more than happy to take this to the little buggers. Although it definitely had a marked difference in the number of them, it wasn't enough to really eliminate the problem.  Although to be fair, they were really going at it when I discovered them. So perhaps the plants were too far gone already.  That being said, it seemed to definitely help (I tried it on some and not the others).  So I would recommend it for general use when you are keeping a close eye on your plants. It's not magic though, and I would recommend a harsher product if you REALLY have an outbreak like we did.  Still, for a natural product, I would definitely recommend it!
B002ITKYRK I used this product on my plants about a month ago. I didnt notice any immediate improvement but I did notice that whatever was on my plant stopped growing worse. I cut off the few leaves at the point they looked rotten and the rest of the leaves are ok. This was on my spider plant. On my green hanging plant the spray did not help at all. It seems to have sped up the dying process as the plant now is completely an off yellow color. So be careful what type of plant you spray it on.
B002ITKYRK I have found this product to be ok but not great.  It did a pretty good job on some bugs that were chomping down on my broccoli's plants leaves.  But it took a few days for them to be 'discourged', it seems to have had no effect on a fungus effecting some watermelon plants.  On some other vegetable plants and mint, it seems to have been keeping them fairly insect free so far as I can tell and no new pests have appeared on the brocolli.
B002ITKYRK I've used Safer Brand products for over a decade.  First, because I didn't want inorganic poisons around food I was growing and going to eat; and second, because I didn't want my babies, who crawling and toddling around the garden when I was out there, touching anything with poison on it since they always put there fingers in their eyes and mouth.  (This, of course, also explains why the grass part of my lawn is covered with crabgrass and dandelions.)What I can tell you about my experience with hot humid climates (Houston and the DC area) is that sometimes you've just got to substitute hearty plants for one's that don't do well in hot, humid places.  What I'm talking about here is roses.  I love roses and blackspot is their, and my, bane.  This Safer product with the sulphur, definitely works on some fungi, rusts, and mildew, but I've not had good luck with it working on roses.  So now I plant other things.  (For some reason I've never used a copper based fungicide, but I've heard people get good results with it.)As for the small critters, like aphids (darn them) and thrips, Safer soap works well if you get the infestation before it is totally out of control.  In that case, rampant aphids, I'd try another of the Safer products -- the one with Neem oil.As for use:  let me suggest that you treat the Safer products just like your would less safe varieties.  You don't want prolonged contact with your skin and you want to read all of the directions.  For example, there are plants you don't want to use the soap on, and there are times of day when it is better to use it.  Specifically, you don't want to spray when it's hot and bright outside.  You can spray early in the morning, but generally, I sprayed in the evening when there was no danger of the plant suffering from 'sunburn'.The SKINNY:::It's a Safer product, not a 'totally harmless' product.  READ the directions.It works best on soft bodies critters and mild cases of mildew and rust.For hardbody critters, you should look into one of the other Safer products.For blackspot and other persistent, annoying plant diseases, try one of Safer's other products.Now, if Safer can just get rid of those pesky deer...
B002ITKYRK Amazon page does not list the active ingredients. They are potassium salts of fatty acids 0.75%, and sulfur 0.40%. So far, I tried on on small insects such as thrips. I haven't tried on heavy-infested plants because it is too early for the season. I think the spray works on contacts with the insect, and not for preventive measure. By the way, don't forget to shake well before spraying.
B002ITKYRK I got this to treat some aphids that seem to love my new trumpet flower plant. I sprayed the leaves top and bottom and it seems to have killed them. I'll keep an eye out and see if it also keeps them from returning. I'll update in a few weeks on that.There is no smell from this spray and it comes out totally clear. I'm not sure if its rain resistant, but it is supposed to be 3 in one meaning it will treat mites, fungus and insects. Some of my plants both vegetable and flower suffer from mildew and his spray is supposed to treat that. I'll update this again when the time comes.The one problem with this spray is that the sprayer stops spraying every now and then and it takes a bit of work to get it working again. If that keeps up i'll buy a new spray bottle at the dollar store and switch it out.So far so good, no dead plants or messed up leaves from the spray so hopefully the mildew and bugs will be gone too. Over the next few months i'll update this and give a better long term review.UPDATE:Sprayed an Angel Trumpet because its prone to aphids and the first and second times I sprayed it everything was fine. I sprayed it yesterday and 50% of the leaves look like they have bleach stains on them and they are all wilted. I don't know what happened.
B002ITKYRK Like the description says, I have no patience for discovering what kind of bugs are eating leaves off my plants. All I know is that I want them to stop.I used this as directed- a light mist is all you need and wow! The tomato leaves, the hollyhock leaves and the hostas no longer have new leaves with holes in them.  So far application was was all I needed but since it's so safe I will not be afraid to use it again.It's great to only have to purchase 1 product and have it work so well on just abt everything!
B002ITKYRK I love to grow vegetables every summer. Nothing is nicer then a tomato fresh from the garden, but I do like to keep my garden organic.  I've used the Safer Brand 3 in 1 spray for a few different problems and it's worked every time.First I had some powdery mildew on my zucchini plants. I've had a problem with this the last few years. The spray did help.I also have a celery plant that I let go to seed. It's really big, but I want to save the seeds to replant next year. It got infested with spider mites and every time I walked by the plant they would jump on me. They're tiny but boy do they bite. The spray worked on them, thank goodness.Then came the tomato worms.  Even my chickens won't eat them!  Sprayed and it worked on them too. Recommended!
B002ITKYRK I've been using this on our roses this year and for the first time ever, we've not had aphids or that rust stuff. THe roses are super-healthy this year. We will absolutely be using this again.
B002ITKYRK Even though this is touted as environmentally safe and ok for organic gardening, it still works.  It is basically soap salts with sulfur added.  These fatty acid salts have been used in insecticides since 1947.  They have very low toxicity to humans, as long as not ingested in large quantities and dissappears from the environment in less than a day.My wife and I use it on our rose bushes.  Following the label, it put an end to the aphids, thrips, and japanese beetles feasting on the leaves.  The old dish washing liquid mixed with water in a spray bottle can do the same thing but, it seems, not as effectively.The added sulfur is the fungicide.  I routinely dust my plants with powdered sulfur.  I actually prefer the spray, though, because the plants don't look, well, dusty.  The safer brand is easy and convenient to use and effectively kills pests and inhibits plant damage caused by fungi.
B002ITKYRK I ordered this specifically to use on my magnolia tree. Every year it loses all of its leaves (or they turn brown/spotted) and maybe makes one blossom.  I have been using this stuff for about a month and I have almost all the leaves back on it and none of them have brown spots!  I have had 4 blossoms this year also.  Whatever is in this stuff is exactly what my magnolia needed.  It is a dwarf version and not very tall...and has been struggling every year for the last 4 years.  Hopefully this year it can get ahead!
B002ITKYRK When sprayed it appears a bit lumpy or grainy on the plant until it dries.  We appreciate that it doesn't have a bad odor like other plant sprays.  The fact that it's organic and safer make it worth trying before harsher chemicals.We used this in our vegetable garden.  It seemed to help our beans recover from something which was turning the leaves yellow but didn't help the cucumbers which had a similar problem.
B002ITKYRK The Safer Brand 3-in-1 Garden spray really seems to do the job effectively. I've been very pleased with this product. Organic products are not always 'strong enough' to take care of the insect problem on plants (I use mainly on flowers and roses), but so far I think it's doing fine. Be sure to read the label/warnings, as in all products of this type.I highly recommend this garden spray. Not much I can add to the other reviews of this product--it's effective, ready to use, and does a great job.
B002ITKYRK I felt very comfortable using this product in my garden knowing it was food safe. My roses looked great this year and it worked well for my other plants as well. I am sold and will plan on reordering this item.
B002ITKYRK We have several little dogs but sometimes get into the garden so we wanted to get something that was non-toxic. I always worry that the little monsters will get into the garden and lick the plants there.  I feel a little safer now knowing that even if they lick it they won't get hurt.  The spray covers most of types of plants we have in our garden and was more inclusive than some of the specialized sprays by the same company.The product has worked very well on our plants. We spray it on our tomatoes and we haven't seen any bug attacks. The spray doesn't have an unpleasant odor in the fumes don't irritate your eyes or make you feel sick. Be really careful you don't want to use this on plants that are stressed by too much sunlight and not enough water or you can injure/kill them.  Other than that concern, the only real complaint I have is that you have to really spray a lot of the stuff on your plant which uses up the bottle pretty quickly.It's not a stated use, but one thing that we found this useful for was to get rid of some mold. We have some wood near the house that was being eaten away by mold. I tried scraping it off but naturally it would always come back. However, after I sprayed this stuff on it several weeks ago, completely soaking the wood, it seems to have killed it dead.  To our delight there has been no mold growth since then which made us very happy.I really enjoyed this product and I probably would buy it in the future. I don't think it works quite as well as some of the harsh chemical sprays, but it works well enough to do the job and it's much safer so as far as I'm concerned I'm happy with it.
B002ITKYRK Started up nearly a hundred seedlings and I could see red spider mites popping up everywhere. I sprayed this 3-in-1 all over and have not seen any bugs near my plants for nearly two weeks now after the one application. Seemed to be okay for using on tomatoes, eggplant, peppers, green onions. No noticeable bad side effect. Wouldn't hesitate to use again if needed.
B002ITKYRK When reviewing something like this spray, it's pretty much impossible to tell how well it's working unless you treat half your yard and leave the other half untreated...it's not statistically valid, but at least you can tell if it's made a difference.  I didn't do that, so this review is based upon a few observations and some common sense.1. It appeared to reduce the aphid population in my basal plants.2. The black what-ever-the-heck-they-are bugs on the chives were pretty much gone the day after I sprayed them.3. The aphids, scale, whitefly and other crud that lives on my lemon tree seemed to be pretty much unaffected.  The only thing I think will really help that poor tree is a chainsaw.  And a bonfire.4. My roses still developed black spot, but I think it was better than previous years.Will I buy more next year?  Probably.  I'm not much into using chemicals of any kind, but this is (theoretically, at least!) safer than most.  I'll still mostly use the old standby...a garden hose with a hard spray.  It may not kill the bugs, but at least they'll wake up in the neighbor's yard.
B002ITKYRK NOT THE PRODUCT FOR MEI am a weekend gardener, who doesn't know the difference between a pansy and a petunia.  I plant, I water, I fertilize, and I hope for the best.  Occasionally I even spray for bugs.  I was excited when I saw the bottle of Safer 3 in 1 Garden Spray because it is an organic product that claims to be not only an insecticide, but also a fungicide and a miticide.  However, after reading the instructions, I doubted whether this was the right product for me.  My first concern came when I read the label, which clearly stated that the product is \"gentle on most plants.\"  Most plants?  That caused me to dig a little deeper.  The instructions state that 3 in 1 Garden Spray is not to be used on about twenty different plants, most of which I don't know if I have in my garden or not.  Then I read that the product is to be applied once a week.  Once a week?  My guess is that it will require at least two 32-ounce bottles to complete one application to my medium-sized garden.  At $12.50 per bottle, that's $25 per week.  Holy crapinoly.  That's when I realized that this is definitely not the product for me.
B002ITKYRK I hesitate to review this product before I have given it the COMPLETE test ( my aphids don't show up until the hostas bloom) but I think there are a few things which should be mentioned BEFORE you buy. I will be back to update this review later.This product is safe for children and pets BUT don't get it in your pond.  DON'T use until four weeks after you have used an oil spray. DON'T use in full sun or on cuttings or plants stressed by drought. DON'T use on sulfur sensitive plants: delicate fern, apricots, filberts,stock,walnuts,nasturtium,sweet pea, violet, mountain ash, japanese maple, horse chestnut,spinach, viburnum.  DON'T use on strawberries which will be canned. Does this mean jam?I have a dwarf peach which is fine until the peaches start to ripen then it gets some kind of fungus on the fruit. I had hoped this would help but peach isn't mentioned in the list of plants. When I called customer service they said no DON'T use on peach trees. sigh...I live in a climate where spring has hot days and cool humid nights  so my roses leaf out, bloom once then give in to blackspot.  Nothing has ever helped. If this works I will be back to report a miracle.May 18.. I'm back as promised and I'm sorry that the only thing positive I can say about the spray is it doesn't have a disagreeable odor but then neither does water. Since the other reviews seem to all be positive maybe it's just me.  I used the spray ever five days and still some of my roses are stripped bare, some with blackspot starting. This morning I found a little persimmon tree with lots of little green worms rolled up in the new leaves. I unrolled the leaves and sprayed the spray directly on the worms. Maybe I heard a faint gasp as the cold spray hit them but when I went back thirty minutes later they were just as active as ever so I had to pick them off individually and stomp them. I wish I could say something good about the spray but I can only give an honest report as to how it worked for ME.
B002ITKYRK I thought it was a good sign that when I sprayed \"Safer Brand 5452 3-in-1 32-Ounce Ready-to-Use Garden Spray\" on my strawberries, I saw a bunch of bugs go scattering.  They didn't like this at all!Since I have been using this spray, there are far fewer of those little tell-tale holes appearing in the leaves of my garden.  I never really have a huge bug problem, but even a small infestation can cause trouble.  I mainly grow vegetables and herbs - things I plan on putting in my mouth one day - so it was important for me to use a pesticide that was organic and unharmful.  In all respects I have been pretty pleased with this spray.The only problem is that some plants don't like this.  There are a few warnings on the label for specific plants; Japanese maple, pears, and a few others.  But the list is far from complete, and I noticed my dill was looking poorly since I started using this spray.  I have since stopped using it on my dill, but kept spraying my other plants that seem to be getting the benefit.
B002ITMVR6 I've shopped for flats and trays at the big box stores and garden centers, and I'm here to tell you:  What I paid for four of these was about the same price I'd pay for two at the B&M; stores.  Sure, they're not Prime eligible, but they shipped fast and they're the same as the trays you decide you need when you're buying weed and feed - and if you are buying these retail at a store, you are paying way too much.These are a standard size and my David's Garden Tool Seed Starter Plug Flat 72 Cells per Flat 4 Flats per Order fit in them perfectly.  I bought four of these, and even with shipping, I'm very happy.  The trays are perfectly fine.  They are lightweight, so you don't want to overload them, but if you put flats in them, that should be no issue.  When finished, wash and dry them and use them again next year.  They occupy very little space, so why not?Now, go forth and plant some petunias and tomaters!
B002ITMVR6 Too small and flimsy; is there a larger and more sturdier tray out there???
B002ITMVR6 There is a version with holes but this one's not supposed to have any.  Mine did, just because the plastic it's made of is so incredibly thin that I guess not enough molten plastic got into the mold to completely cover a corner of it.  You can flap this thing around like a dishrag.  If (that's IF) you get a watertight one and don't plan to ever move it, it may (that's MAY) be suitable to hold some plants.  If you attempt to move it with anything in it (like, you know, water or plants), be assured that it will deform/collapse and spill whatever's in it.I had a lot better results with some similarly sized plastic storage containers from Target that are very sturdy, very waterproof and cheaper (taking shipping into account).
B002ITMVR6 I wish I would have ordered more - the trays are a little light weight but good for my starts to go in.  They are good enough to reuse and have been shuttled through several transplants, etc.  Just what they describe
B002ITMVR6 I was pleased with the use of this trays for this seasons seedlings. I have enough that will be used again next season. Pleased with packaging and prompt delivery service.
B002J0PMOS These male/female connectors save a lot of time and aggravation when it comes to changing out different sprinklers, power washers, taking off hoses for storage, etc.  The idea is so ingenious that we have tried all the connectors available in our local hardware store. But ended up tossing all of them into the recycle bin because they either leaked or could easily get bent so that they would not connect.  These have lasted around our house for a few years and are a real plus to getting those tasks done out in the yard.  Who wants to spend any time at all being miffed about trying to connect up hoses?  Heavy duty, highly recommend this product.
B002J0PMOS There are definitely cheaper alternatives but I wanted the best on the market that wouldn't leak.  These are the ones!
B002J0PMOS Just like the old days, these are solid red brass, not the cheesy far-east yellow brass, and certainly not the &#34;alumabrass&#34; which is soft aluminum with a thin coloring of brass.Expensive, but durability wise-worth it.
B002J0PMOS Most of Dramm products that I've used are solid and well priced. This is no exception. The movement mechanism is fluid and locks in solidly. I believe this is the best product of its type on the market.
B002J0PMOS Great package I had lots of fun with It, If You shake the package It sounds like a gasoline Engine but with some practice You can make It swirl around In the package but be careful unlike click clacks made of plastic this Is made of brass which can really hurt someone If It comes out of the package and hits them.I do Not have much use for I was going to use It for to disconnect and connect My Sears rubber Garden Water hose which I use for My house Water lines because It does Not bust until the temperature gets 35 below zero F but still freezes and wanted to taking In the Water line In the house to thaw It then  reconnect It but I use a 4 Inch flexible drain line for a covering see My review on drain line.I had No problem at all with this disconnecter and that Is with high pressure and freezing cold but when connecting It You must push hard while twisting It to make a connection and It Is hard to disconnect If there Is high pressure In the line, If Your strong enough to disconnect It will blast off like a rocket unless You relieve the pressure first.Now If If Dramm can make a 2 or 4 way shut off valve as good or better than Gilmour brass valves that will be something. Also Its made In USA and I seen Nothing on the label that said anything about causing cancer and I do Not know why It would besides most cancers Is caused by pathogens as found out by Doctor Royal Raymond Rife In the 1930'S
B002J0PMOS Product works great, held up so far.Fit and finish is prefect.Only wish its came with more male adapter, I have try other brand's male adapter, all fit in this unit fine.
B002JM1ZMY As subversive as it may sound, I've never looked forward to holiday feast featuring turkey.  The birds never cook evenly with parts overly dry and other parts greasy.  And this happens despite basting, changing temperature, brining, tenting with foil.  Friends boasted about the great results they got with their outdoor turkey friers but here in New York, it gets cold outside.  I was also dissuaded by the hellish tales of houses burning down and propane gas explosions.  So after infomercial indoctrination and a gold box special, I purchased this indoor fryer.Easy to set up, it uses only two to three gallons of oil. We cooked a ten pound turkey(must be completely thawed) in forty minutes.  It was a gorgeous --golden brown and could have graced the cover of a magazine.  But most amazing of all was the juciness.  The skin was crisp but the meat cooked to mouth watering perfection.  Since then I have fried chicken, turkey and even prime rib roast, with the same succulent result.Draining the oil is easy.  There is a valve and an attachable spout that makes emptying a snap. The unit is compact and can be stored on a countertop.I recomend this fryer.  It is versatile and can be used for a wide variety of foods and steaming.  Most importantly, the reslts are uniformly excellent.
B002JM1ZMY This electric turkey fryer is great, though I am totally with the do it in the garage and NOT your house review! The oil heated quickly and our turkey was done in 45 minutes. My husband put the dry turkey in the fryer, poured the oil over the turkey, lifted the turkey out and let the oil heat. This allowed the perfect measurement for displacement without guesswork as to how much oil we would need.The versatility of this fryer is great, not just for turkeys and french fries and spinach, but it also works as a boiler. Here in New Orleans we boil a lot of crawfish, shrimp, etc, and this is the perfect size for a smaller group. The fact the fryer both fries and boils is a real bonus.Clean up is easy with a convenient drain spout. No open flame to spill oil on makes me feel safe, while the electric feature provides a more consistent temperature. So come on ya'll, fry yourself a turkey, boil up some shrimp and potatoes, and enjoy!
B002JM1ZMY Just what you need for Turkey Day. Frees up my oven for other dishes and cooks a bird quickly. Easy to clean, but marked the spigot inside with an arrow so I know if the valve is open or closed.
B002JM1ZMY Purchasing the Butterball/Masterbuilt turkey fryer was a last minute decision.  It arrived the day before Thanksgiving so there was no time to try it out first.  Not to worry, the turkey was excellent - crispy skin, moist, juicy meat that wasn't greasy, and it was done in 35 minutes.  Immediately prior to putting in the turkey (and at a slightly lower temperature of 325 vs. 375 for the turkey) 2 lbs of beer battered mushrooms were fried for appetizers which were also excellent.I have read some reviews that were negative saying an electric fryer will not properly fry a turkey.  To those I say \"cow pies\".  Regardless of the means the oil is heated, it is important that once the food (turkey or anything else being fried) is placed in the oil, the oil must be brought back to the correct temperature quickly.  This fryer was able to accomplish that and I verified it using aKINTREX IRT0421 Non-Contact Infrared Thermometer with Laser Targeting.Because the Peanut Oil is so expensive I decided against applying a poultry rub to the inside and outside of the turkey and relied on the flavor solution that Butterball injects into the turkey.  I was afraid the rub might contaminate or flavor the oil and I intend to reuse the oil for other fried foods until it needs to be disposed of.  I used a funnel with a strainer and some cheesecloth stuffed between the strainer and the spout to filter the oil as it was drained into plastic containers.  To preserve the quality of the oil before the next use it should be refrigerated.  However, this time of the year in the midwest the temperature is cold enough that containers can be placed in an unheated garage or storage building with no degradation of the product.  The extension drain provided on the Masterbuilt fryer makes it very easy to drain the oil out of the fryer, through the funnel and into plastic containers.  Only do this when the oil has cooled.The fryer uses an immersion heating element inside the oil pot which can react more quickly to temperature changes than can an element imbedded in the cooking vessel.  There is an analog temperature control ranging from \"min\" to \"max\".  Again using the Kintrex thermometer, I was able to determine that max on mine was 385 degrees vs. the advertised 375 degrees.  When cooking it is important to keep the lid closed as much as possible for a couple of reasons.  First, it will help keep the oil from splashing out during the cooking process and secondly, it will help keep the heat in and allow the temperature to recover to the set temperature more quickly.  The lid's unique design includes a steam vent and an aluminum mesh oil filter.  On one side there is a removable panel that gives you access to the oil drain valve and also holds the power cord and oil drain extension when not in use.  Also included is a seperate handle to attach to the fry basket making it easier to lower the basket into or lift it from the hot oil.  Lastly, there is a small digital timer which is nothing more than a timer, it will not shut off the power when the cooking time is finished.  I chose to use a better quality kitchen timer in the house.  The lid, filter screen, and fry basket fit in the dishwasher for easy cleanup.  Do Not put the heating element into the dishwasher, it must be hand washed and not immersed in water.If I am so pleased with the way it worked why four stars?  Here is why I found it to be less than perfect.  The power cord is very short and the manufacturer states not to use an extension cord.  This made it impossible for me to use in the garage although I probably could have taken it to my tool/storage shed and set it up on my work bench.  I finally set it up on the patio since no rain or snow was expected.  Having such a short cord severely limits it's versatility.  My second reason is for semantics.  This is by no means a professional or commercial fryer, it uses a \"commercial style\" immersion heating element but that's where the similarity stops.  It is nothing more than a larger than average home fryer.  Next is the word \"indoor\".  The manual recommends that the fryer be used in the garage or on a covered patio, not in the house.  I would agree unless you want your house to smell like hot oil for several weeks.  Plus, there is a lot of oily steam that comes out which would settle out on cabinets, walls, and any indoor surface. Lastly, although it is sold as a fryer for up to 14 lb. turkeys, they recommend using nothing larger than 10-12 lbs.My final comment and my reason for buying an electric fryer:  Using this I don't need to worry about a huge pot of oil over an open flame on a flimsy stand.  Every year there are people who have burned down their homes using a propane fryer and I'm sure countless more fires went unreported.  The Masterbuilt fryer is a good and safe product that I plan to use for years to come.Recommended accessories:  cooking thermometer and leather bbq gloves (to protect your hands and arms when lowering or removing the cooking basket).Happy Frying!
B002JM1ZMY I have friends who SWEAR by deep-frying the Thanksgiving day bird. They have the propane-fueled, outdoor tank, and it has to sit on the ground, not on the wood deck, thank you very much. And our deck is vinyl-clad aluminum. An open-flame, hot oil tank is a no.  So, how to fry the turkey if you don't want to deal with the fiery apparatus and medieval danger of dousing onself (and the neighbors below, if you're in an apartment) with boiling oil? Thankfully, Masterbuilt has come up with the idea of an electric turkey fryer, thus saving how many houses, apartment and body parts from conflagration. And it can be done inside, a boon for those who live in snowy climates. (One year, we tried to grill on a gas grill in 20 degree, windy weather out on a snow covered deck. Not successful. And no fun, either.)The unit holds two gallons of oil. The heating of all that oil takes over a half  an hour, and you will have to defrost that turkey thoroughly, and it's recommended you brine the turkey (if not the kind that is injected with oil.) So count on a few days prior for this preparation if you use a frozen bird, as it must be completely defrosted. Or a day to brine overnight, if using a farm-fresh unfrozen bird. The bird should be at room temperature, for best results. This all takes a bit of planning.Frying takes about four minutes per pound of bird, and the maximum size of bird you can do is fourteen pounds. However, only ten to twelve pounders are really recommended. I find those birds a bit small, and bonier (the bigger the bird, the more meat to bone ratio) and sometimes the younger, small birds are tougher. The bird sits horizontally in the basket. They recommend peanut oil (it doesn't degrade under long, high heating) but for those allergic or not liking peanut oil, you can use canola oil. However, frying DOES retain all the juices of the bird, and once you've had a fried turkey, it's hard to go back to roasted ones, though I will say, a smoked turkey is pretty darned good, too.The frying takes place in a basket, which you lower down into the oil, which is contained in a porcelain-lined pot, using an extender hook for safety. After thoroughly cooling the unit, you can drain the oil off and disassemble for cleaning. This is naturally a big unit (bigger than a 14 lb turkey) so you probably want to clean it up for storage if you don't fry turkeys for your family on a weekly basis. If you should want to fry bigger birds, Masterbuilt makes an XL size, Model 20011210 which holds up to a 20 lb bird.Though more expensive a unit than a propane tank-style cooker, it's safer, more controllable (digital thermometer included) and it's able to be used in the house. In fact, it is not recommended for outdoor use due to it being electric, so if you intend to fry outside the house, the garage or covered porch is recommended, to keep the unit dry.
B002JM1ZMY I had been wanting a large deep fryer for a couple of reasons.  First, it is nice to be able to fit a small turkey or a large chicken in it, but I don't do that too often.  Mostly I wanted to be able to deep fry a larger number of items at one time when I entertain.  I love to make small plates for my guests and a deep fryer lets you serve some tasty treats that you would not want to eat on a regular basis.  In addition to Belgium fries, crab Rangoon and Cornish Game Hens, I like to make a favorite from my home town, toasted raviolis!The two gallon capacity of the Masterbuilt fit the bill.  As soon as it arrive I filled it with Peanut oil and fired it up.  It was nice to be able to just pop a couple of bone-in chicken breasts and have them done in less than ten minutes (they were delicious!)  The temperature dropped 25 degrees right away but recovered quickly.  However, for cooking a whole 12 pound turkey (which I just recently accomplished) it should have more power.A few days after I received myButterball Professional Series Indoor Electric Turkey FryerI arranged to have a small dinner party.  I warned my guests that most of the food would be deep fried.  After a day or two of fasting, they showed up and the fryer worked like a champ.  After a thirty minute warm up time, I was able or fry enough appetizers for 4-6 people at one time instead of having to fry them in smaller batches.  The odor filter, which is built into the lid, didn't help too much.  I had to open a window to keep my most sensitive guest's eyes from watering.  All in all the fryer worked well.I like 
B002JQBQZQ I bought couple these for my dad and he loves them, put out high quality light and efficient cost and low watts per unit. Highly recommended for the price, BEST for 2-3 smaller house plants.
B002JQBQZQ This T5 bank puts off 8000 lumens (says it right on the side of the box). A typical 250w HPS light puts off anywhere between 20,000 and 30,0000 lumens (depending on bulb of course) but requires you to keep the light farther away from foliage and requires more cubic feet for cooling (assuming you are not using air cooled hoods)The light emitted by this T5 array has a 6400k color temp (kelvin scale). This is a cool white / blue hue best used during vegetative growth. I typically use my Envriogrow T5 for rooting and veg. A typical 250w High Pressure Sodium light has a color temp of 2100-3000k. This falls in the yellow/red light spectrum and is best suited for flowering.IMHO, I like to start plants off with the T5 bank. Its cooler, I can get it closer and it puts off almost zero heat. I can run the thing for hours on end without fear of something catching fire. After about month, month and a half of 24hrs straight light I switch to my 250w HPS for flowering. In the event you only plan on running one light I would personally run just the HPS as it is decent for both stages of growth.Do NOT pass this light up if you have the money though. It is an excellent light for the price.
B002JQBQZQ I bought 2 sets of these lights and they worked great.  They are sized perfectly for standard flats that hold 18 4&#34; pots or 12 9 cell containers.
