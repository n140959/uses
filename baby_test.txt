B0016KV73W Used it numerous times in less than 60 days! My daughter was potty trained the first weekend of November 2013. I took this with us on a trip into my office for a backup plan. She has great bladder control (can last upwards of three hours). We left the office after three hours and put her in the back of my SUV with the potty and me (not a ton of extra room but we managed....wanted to give her some privacy from prying eyes :)) she never saw this thing before. She sat right on it and did her business (#1). This portable solution fits in a large tote or purse. I have used it to attach to a regular toilet on the go (just used it tonight at a friend's house at a child's bday party). Very easy.The liners are good. No leaks. I purchased extra liners too. I haven't tried rigging a regular plastic bag with paper towels yet. Afraid of leaks.With newly potty trained tots, I think you need a convenient solution for an immediate need. Buy it!
B0016KV73W I'll cut to the chase.PROS:Here's the brilliance of this potty seat:1) the \"wings\" (which serve as the base for the seat when in stand-alone potty form) that flip out to put on the adult toilet seat are secure and heavyweight;2) these same wings have rubberized grippy bits on the ends, which keeps them from slipping around on the adult potty seat;3) the base of the flipped-out bits can serve as a grip for the child inclined to grab the (*ack*) public seat.We've used this primarily as a portable potty seat, because we have another portable potty chair in the back of our van.  It fits neatly into its plastic bag, and the plastic bag fits very easily with room to spare into our backpack (which we use instead of a diaper bag). But I can see this working well for that function, too.CON:1) the hole is small, which makes wiping a newbie a little challenging.  (It doesn't bother me, because my child stands to get wiped at this stage.) I suspect some ankle-grabbing would suffice.  It doesn't pose a problem for the function, just, potentially, the cleanup.Overall: win!
B0016KV73W I love this potty! Much easier to use this then hold my 14 month old son over a regular toilet every morning to do his business! We part time EC, and this has been working perfectly, wish I had bought it sooner! He loves it set up on the floor, & has become much more interested in going #1 in the potty as well!To those complaining that it collapses on their little ones, you don't have it set up correctly. You need to push the legs into the potty base till you here each side click. I highly suggest watching YouTube videos on potette plus set up.I purchased the silicone reusable insert for the potty so we don't have to mess with bags... Much greener and cheaper! I bought the potty & liner for $15 bucks, you really can't beat that!
B0016KV73W This is so perfect. We go to the beaches all the time and there are no bathrooms and a child learning to potty can't hold it til we find a toilet somewhere. This works perfect. Small, easy, secure. I love that it also comforts to a toilet seat to put on an adult toilet seat in a public restroom. I use it most though for our beach trips. The liner you can buy for it works great but when I run out and haven't ordered none regular grocery bags work just as well.***edit. Oct. 5th, 2012 I had to order another one since we lost or had our stolen when we were getting some maintenance done on our car and it was in our car :( but soon as i realized it was missing I was online ordering another one because this is the best invention in the world especially for long trips, beach trips, or out anywhere that just doesn't have potties, especially for a little one that can't hold it like adult can, when my 2 year old says I have to potty she has to go and go NOW so its great to have in the car when there just isn't a store or gas station around for her to go potty at. I ordered 3 packs of refills with my original purchase and still have 2 full packs left LOVE LOVE THIS product and so does my daughter she has no problem going on it***
B0016KV73W Pros-Travels easy (it fits in my diaper bag) & it has a travel bagSecures great on the pottyYou can do it as a free standing for out & about emergencies ( they have an insert you can buy)It gives my toddler confidence that he's not going to fall inConsIf you use it as a stand alone the legs have to be locked in & it was a little hard for me to snap into placeI've bought 2 - one for home & one for travel. He loves it, this was the only thing that was worth a darn besides the primo potty
B0016KV73W This seat is such a convenient thing to have! It is small enough to put in a backpack or diaper bag and it comes with a storage bag. It makes sitting on public toilets easier (for kids and parent) and could be its own potty in an emergency. The only reason that I deducted a star is one design \"flaw\" that I'm not sure if they could do anything about. The front bottom is shaped/sized so that if my son's aim isn't down enough, it will actually cause the stream to start splattering. He's usually good about it and it isn't the end of the world to clean up a little, but I think it could be better in that respect. Would definitely recommend.
B0016KV73W This is extremely handy for an outing, especially when potty training a 2 year old. It took me some time to figure out how to lock the legs in place, but it's not a big deal now. My only complaint would be that the legs are so short, so even my two year old's knees end up in his chest. But I guess that's what you get for portable.
B0016KV73W This potty was a total impulse buy for me, before we started potty training my son.  I thought it looked cool, and I was pregnant with my 2nd, so I bought it on a whim.  However, it was SO worth the money!  We are outside a LOT, especially at parks/playgrounds....and I'm not going to lie, I just can't handle the port-a-potty.  I can't do it!  So, this has really saved us from having to pack up and go home early.  We keep it in the back of our car, and just set it up whenever we need it.  We've never really used it as a seat cover, just as a travel potty.  I can fit it in my diaper bag, but it takes up a lot of room.  It would be nice if it were smaller, but for what it does, I highly recommend it!
B0016KV73W My almost 3 year old daughter falls through the opening when sitting on it. She also tells me &#34;it hurts my butt&#34;. It will be in our next yard sale needless to say. I was hoping this would work for her. I even tried putting her foam cushion from her home potty seat on the top and she still refuses to use it. The foam isn't a perfect fit and just makes it clumsy feeling to her. The opening is way too big for a typical child of 2 to 3 years of age in my opinion. My daughter is not petite either.
B0016KV73W My son is in the 97th percentile and about 2 1/2.  This thing was so tiny it was a joke.  I could see how it might be great if it was appropriately sized for your child, but it is definitely not the answer if you have a bigger than average kiddo.
B0016KV73W We initially got this for our petite 2 year old. He was already going potty in a little froggy potty (also bought on Amazon) and was doing so well but it became a problem when we would go out in public because he was terrified to use the large toilets. So we bought this and it solved the problem! So small and extremely easy clean up. He has even gone in the car with this little potty. Needless to say, he didn't end up using it a ton since he eventually got brave enough to use a normal toilet but we still keep it in our truck in it's nice little bag just in case or if we need to use while on the road. Great product!
B0016KV73W The potette is really portable and well-made, but I think I was happier with my ikea potty - it took up a little more space and didn't fold down or convert to a training seat (which is cool) but at least I didn't have to use plastic bags with it (I don't buy the potette liners - they seem pointless. I just use an old plastic bag and a rag or cloth diaper in the bottom, and then wait until I'm somewhere I can offload the poop without having to send another plastic bag to a landfill). I would love to figure out an \"on the go\" solution for the potette that didn't require a plastic bag at all. On the other hand - the potette is thoughtfully made and small enough to fit my one year old, who much prefers to use a potty than a diaper.
B0016KV73W I bought this potty to keep in the car for when we are out and about. In the &#34;potty&#34; position (legs down) it isn't sturdy at all because the legs don't lock in that position. Twice it has collapse under the my baby which has led to epic meltdowns. So in reality it's just a travel toilet reducer. Not very 2-in-1.
B0016KV73W This was the best buy I could have done for the summer vacation on the beach. We went to Europe on vacation and it is usual  there not to have restrooms available on the beach so I was worried about how to handle my 3 year old potty training phase. I bought this product and it has proven to be phantastic!!! Clean and easy to use and comfortable for the kid. Size is also quite reasonable as it fits perfectly in the beach bag. All my friends with kids same age wanted to get it too.
B0016KV73W I bought this because I needed a portable potty for my son. He is fully potty trained but doesnt tell us he needs to go until he is about to pee himself. I was really tired to hovering him over the toilet (thank goodness he is small for his age or else id drop him right in) especially with a bad back and weak arms. I was really looking into the foldup ones for convenience but saw that it was not sturdy and did not fit public toilets. I am so glad i found this. it folds up nicely and is sturdy. I am so happy i read reviews because i found on another review that to use it in a sitting position/potty you have to push it up to lock in place. Anyways the day i got this in the mail my sister took my kids and me to the park and as soon as we got there my son was doing the pee pee dance. I pulled this out, popped the legs in place, popped the baggy in it, put it behind the tree, shimmied down his chones and plopped him on there. He was a bit confused cuz the bag and all but he did his thing and it was all gravy. We also used it on our toilet at home. He loves it. And i love it. =)
B0016KV73W A great little travel potty for early trainers, but the instructions are not complete.Pros:Small size is perfect for babies and young toddlers.Can be used as either a stand-alone potty or on top of a toilet, giving you options.Folds up very compact.You can use standard plastic grocery bags, just put a paper towel or cloth diaper inside.Cons:The legs are wobbly in the stand-alone potty position, making me a little nervous if my baby was too wiggly. EDIT: I figured out why the legs felt wobbly. You need to push them UP towards the seat to fully lock them. The enclosed instructions do not say this, but it's very important!!!The bags that are designed for the potty stink of perfume.
B0016KV73W My 2 1/2 year old was ready for potty training and we love his potty seat at home (which also sits on the toilet but is for all day use), but we are on the go quite a bit so we bought this potty seat.  He loves to use it!  It's compact enough for a diaper bag (or backpack which we use) and it worked great at Disney World.  It's pretty darn sturdy too.  I've even set it up in his carseat for him to go in a compact car.  Yeah, it's not as sturdy as a free standing training potty, but it's not meant to be kept at home on the ground for use all day.  I love that it sits on top of a toilet as well, which made potty training during a hotel visit a piece of cake.  I do NOT recommend buying additional bags.  A plastic grocery bag with a paper towel works just as well.  Just be sure to check the bag for holes first and have them ready to go in the car.
B0016KV73W We were happy our toddler has been successful with potty training with her baby bjorn potty chair, so we decided to get this for on the go.  Unfortunately, she is so scared and doesn't want to sit on the Potette.  =(  We have tried countless times and she refuses to sit on it.Read some amazing reviews and hope we would have the same luck with the Potette.
B0016KV73W let me just say this potty seat is amazing! It's sturdy, little enough to put almost anywhere, folds down great. I bought some extra liners, but in my opinion save your money & buy the reusable liner that goes with this seat. Also wonderful quality, and come on, how hard is it to dump out & wipe with a wet wipe.
B0016KV73W This is the best baby product ever invented!  It's cheap, sturdy & fits in my kid's skip hop bag.  We have had potty training success because of this gem!  She's going on her 3rd week of PT & this weekend we took her to Disney on Ice & a weekend trip to the beach.  The crowds in public restrooms I think intimidate her but I just put this potty on the back seat of the car in the parking lot & wha la! When the crowds are smaller I use the handicap stall & set this potty up on the side & we take a potty break together.  On the beach I set up her potty in a play tent & she had her own little outhouse.  She loves her new potty & so do I!  We no longer have to fear accidents or her holding it too long till she feels comfortable.  The liners are super absorbant so you don't have a messy, leaking bag to deal with.  I won't leave home without it.  Thank you inventers of the potette travel potty.  THANK YOU!
B0016KV73W Seriously, whoever came up with this invention is even better than Henry Ford for inventing cars; hands-down this is the greatest purchase I have made for my 18mo daughter...and we've purchased a LOT!  My daughter said \"potty?\" the other day while in public, and was terrified of me holding her over the big (nasty) public restroom potty and wouldn't go...so in the diaper it was, poor thing. So we purchased this potty on the suggestion of a fellow Mom.I was skeptical, as my daughter is used to a padded seat, that sits on our big toilet (we've gone that route and not a mini-potty...she's done amazing starting at about 16mos~) so I was a bit concerned on whether or not she would understand what this was (when used as a stand-alone potty on the floor/ground):  it came in the mail, I opened it, popped out the legs and locked them in place (**you have to pull them out to standing position, then push them upwards into the seat until you hear them click**) and set it on the floor...she immediately exclaimed \"potty!!!\" and sat down to hang out.  SUCCESS!!  From here on out this new travel potty was my bff.I keep it in it's plastic bag, in our diaper bag 24/7...it paid for itself twice already: having it at my parent's house 3hrs away to pop the legs to the side and put on the big potty, when I didn't think to bring her usual potty seat, and again when we were on the beach and she said \"potty\".  I don't go anywhere without it, ever.It comes with plastic bags that will hook around it, that they pee/poo into when you'er on the go, and inside is a little \"pad\" to soak it all up...don't waste your money on more of these specialty bags...use some plastic grocery store bags, and line them with the thick maxi pads...it's the same exact thing, and a FRACTION of the cost since you can buy cheapo brand pads.BUY THIS ITEM!!!!
B0016KV73W This toilet helped make potty training so easy for us. We brought it to the park, the playground, shopping. I was a little shy using it indoors in public (although would in a pinch so long as I could find a somewhat quiet, uninhabited corner somewhere), but had NO shame whatsoever having my daughter cop a squat at the playground or wherever outdoors. And when we were running errands, I would open the back of my SUV, and have her sit there and go. I would just stand in front of her for safety and to give her a bit of privacy. Also, when I was pregnant, it helped me avoid public restrooms and having to hold my almost three year old over a toilet, big belly and all. I cannot recommend this enough.
B0016KV73W We carry this with us in the car whenever we go out.  It has a little plastic case that comes with it, but we use that to store the bags, and got a separate (washable) bag to carry the potty in.  It's fantastic.  Going out to eat and don't want to balance your toddler on the big toilet seats?  Bring this along, lay it flat and your toddler is comfortable and protected from germs!  On a road trip and don't want to risk a gas station restroom, or your toddler needs to go NOW and you're on a stretch of open road?  No problem!  You click the potette into the \"seat\" position (note that people complain about the seat collapsing, but it won't do that if you just click the \"legs\" into their place.  You MUST click/lock it in to the upright or flat position, otherwise it's not stable), put it in the back of your wagon,  or in the back seat on a relatively flat surface, or on the side of the road even, your toddler sits down and pees/poops, you tie up the bag and knot it (please don't litter - just store the bag in the back of your car, or the trunk until you can toss it in the garbage - if you knot the bag, you don't smell it), and boom, you are on your way!  My daughter loves it - she prefers going on the potty \"in the car\" rather than going into an unfamiliar restroom, and on more than one occasion, it's been a lifesaver pulling over by the side of the road for an emergency pit stop.It's all plastic and is easily wiped down by a disinfectant wipe, and takes up little room when stored flat.  You can buy refill liners for about 50 cents a bag (I got a 30 pack from Wal-Mart for 40 cents a bag), which some might say is costly, but we only use them when we go out, so 30 should last us a long time.  When we ran out of our initial supply that comes with the potty, I did use plastic grocery bags (make sure there are no holes in the bag!) and some left over absorbent pads from my pregnancy kit.  You can save money by going this route, but you either have to carry around a bag of women's panty liners/pads and grocery bags, or do it up in advance and then fold them all flat so they are ready to go.  That seems like a lot of work to me, so we just buy the pre-made ones from Kalencom.The only \"negative\" I can comment on about this potty is that it's not ideal as your primary potty seat for potty training.  I like that it's all plastic for easy clean-up on the go, but we did end up buying a cushioned potty seat for at-home potty training.  When your toddler is sitting for a long time on the potty, cushioning is nice, and our daughter found this seat too uncomfortable when sitting for long periods of time.  However, now that she is fully potty trained, she could use this seat for everyday use at home just fine.Overall, I highly recommend the Potette and it's definitely one of our best purchases for our toddler.
B0016KV73W Great on-the-go potty because the sides fold in and it's easy to stash in a bag. Love that it's both a stand-alone potty and a toilet topper.  if your toilet is oblong shaped like ours, this potty seat will seem too small.  We always have to remind our son to point it down and to close his legs before he starts to pee.  Otherwise, it will almost always splash out of the gap between the potty seat and the toilet seat or over the potty seat - something we do not have a problem with on our Baby Bjorn toilet trainer.
B0016KV73W This potty lives in my car trunk and its great for car trips and has been used more then I thought it would be.  Only minor issue is the seat sometimes wants to close while my kid is sitting on it but I just hold her and for a 30 second potty break it works perfectly.
B0016KV73W This little portable potty chair has been a life safer as we have traveled around with our almost 3 year old
B0016KV73W This travel potty is on my \"baby must-have\" list.  We've used it while traveling on both long trips and short and also while camping.  It's great to use as a booster potty on those icky campground port-a-potties.  We keep it in the car just in case!
B0016KV73W This is one of my top five favorite baby/toddler items to ever purchase.  When my daughter needs to go it isn't an issue finding a clean restroom.  I highly recommend to anyone who is potty training and beyond.
B0016KV73W I really couldn't even tell you how many times this little potty has saved my daughter's outfits, carseat, my van, and my sanity. I don't use it in public restrooms as we have something else we use for those instead. I keep it set up in my van with a bag already lining it (we ran out of those little bags that it comes with, with the absorbent pad to help soak up the liquid, but in a pinch, sassy disposable diaper sacks work wonders!!), and that way when we get the opportunity to pull over there's no wasting time trying to set it up while she does the potty dance. Not sure how it works with boys yet, as my youngest boy has not potty trained yet, but time will tell.Here's what I like:-convenience. I don't have to worry about trying to find someplace with a public restroom to take her in. I can quickly get her on it, take out the used bag, replace it with a new one, and be on the go again in no time.-portability. It doesn't take up much space at all when it is folded up and it fits fairly well in my diaper bag, and j
B0016KV73W We have been so pleased with our &#34;travel potty.&#34;  It is so compact and perfect for traveling.  It fits easily in a backpack or large purse so you can use it anywhere.
B0016KV73W Awesome product.  I travel a fair amount and didn't want to delay or jeopardize potty training my toddler because of my fear of getting stuck somewhere without a toilet.  I used this mostly on top of public toilets for the first few months - and it was GREAT for that.  It reduced the anxiety of my little one trying to go in strange places, especially when he had to sit for a while to, ahem, produce.  We used it on airplane toilets, you name it.  Then one day we were about to get on a subway train in NYC and he announced that he had to go pee... I pulled out the Potette, had it set up in seconds, and he was able to sit and pee in comfort (if not privacy!).  You really do have to push the legs hard to snap them into place so it is sturdy - but if you do that, it is strong enough to hold my 35lb little guy without a problem.  I also love that this is super small, lightweight, and easy to carry around.  Can't say enough good things.
B0016KV73W Like many others here, I had to learn the hard way why the standalone potty won't stay put and the legs kept slipping out from underneath my toddler mid-pottying. It's because each side needs to be pushed to lock in. Then the only caveat is that the legs sometimes pop out of the potty when I pull it back out to unlock it but it's a very minor incovenience compared to having the most accessible potty ever, which is so crucial especially when your toddler is potty training...and especially on vacation...to large parks where restrooms aren't always super accessible (not to mention the lines!)...via a road trip. I can't imagine how we could've survived our last vacation without it. Best invention ever (my husband and I kept saying to one another)! I do agree/have to admit that the seat is very small and very low...but any bigger and it would be a bother to carry around. It's difficult finding the balance between portability and usability when it comes to a portable toilet, but this company certainly made it work.
B0016KV73W I had high hopes for this based on the reviews that I read. Unfortunately, it was a great disappointment. It's really flimsy and quite frankly too small to be of any use for my 2-year-old son. Despite following the directions, it kept tipping over every time we used it. Don't waste your money on this. I recommend the smaller version of the Baby Bjorn potty.  We use that now whenever we go out. The quality of the Bjorn is far superior to the Potette.  That's my .02.
B0016KV73W We have tried so many potty seats that I've lost count.  This one is by far the BEST.  It is compact and fits in my 2 year old's little backpack.  It is very sturdy, and she's comfortable because she does feel like she is falling in.  It cleans up easily, travels well, and is cute.
B0016KV73W Potty training was a terrifying prospect for me, especially being out and about. At the same time, I didn't want to be stuck at home for weeks/months until my toddler was potty trained. We live quite far from &#34;town&#34; and that was another fear of mine. So I bought this more for the &#34;travel potty&#34; use than the &#34;trainer seat&#34; use. However, on our first excursion out with it, we used it both ways, and it is so useful! It's small enough that it fits easily in my 14&#34;x14&#34; wet/dry bag, with extra liners, change of bottoms, wipes, and a cloth diaper for wiping up messes. It's really easy to whip out in the very short amount of time my daughter has between &#34;I have to pee!!&#34; and actually going.Like at least one other reviewer has said, it's important to know that if you're going to use it as a potty, you need to kind of &#34;lock&#34; the legs into place by pushing them up into the seat part. Then, to fold back up, you just need to carefully pull the legs out one notch. To go from folded up to trainer seat, there's no locking into place necessary.The liners that come with it are really amazing. The absorbent pad holds most if not all of the pee my toddler releases at a time (it claims to hold 5oz) so I'm not just carrying around a bag of liquid. At the same time, $10.xx for 30 liners (when my daughter, who is still in the early stages of potty training, can pee 5 times in just a few hours) can get costly. So we've found that the small plastic garbage bags (4 gallon) are much more cost effective. (Our grocery store has a generic pack of 30 for $1.67.) If I'm really concerned about the bag of pee, I can throw some paper towels or even a cloth diaper in it. I still plan to buy the Potette Plus liners from time to time as a luxury item, or maybe if we're going on a trip where we might not be able to dispose of the bags in a timely manner. =)I've read that plastic shopping bags like from the grocery store would work well, and I could see that. But I don't know about you, but most of our plastic bags have holes in them, plus now more and more cities are going bag-less anyway, so it's nice to know the small garbage bags work, too.I've never tried any other 2-in-1 type travel potties like this, but I'm very, very happy with my purchase.
B0016KV73W A friend had referred this product to me when she was potty training her son. It is small enough to take everywhere you go and big enough where the child is comfortable. I have two: one in the car (because who likes using the public restrooms?) and the other in my bathroom (because I have a small bathroom, no extra room for another toilet).
B0016KV73W I cannot rave about this product enough - it has been an absolute lifesaver!  I LOVE that it serves dually as a trainer seat on a large potty OR a stand-alone mini-potty.It folds fairly flat, so it's easy to fit in a diaper bag (or even a large tote-style purse).  It's awesome when on-the-go (whether long car rides when you just need to pull over for a sudden need to potty break, or at a fair/carnival setting when port-o-potties are the only other option - and who wants to put a little kid through that?).  It's also great even for vacations or going to other's houses.  My daughter is very petite, and cannot sit on a regular-sized toilet or she will fall in.  We bring this everywhere with us.1000% worth every penny.  I would recommend this to everyone.
B0016KV73W This is really great and we have gotten lots of use from it! We have used it as a potty seat over toilet and it can also be used to keep in your car in case your child needs to use the potty. This is a great all in one potty seat and we really love it!
B0016KV73W I take this chair everywhere with me! It fits sturdily on every type of toilet seat I have tried it on. It has little rubber strips on the underside of the legs/seat support that hold it in place. It folds up small enough to fit in a side pocket of my diaper bag or a large purse. When my son uses it it puts him in the right position to entirely miss peeing on the seat (mothers of boys know this is important). My only complaint is that the splash guard in front is kinda wide. To allow him to sit comfortably I have to take one leg out of his pants and underwear, which also involves taking off a shoe. I don't mind this so much since he just turned two and is peeing in public places thanks to this potty but might be a bigger deal to other people. I have never used it as a stand alone chair but I know that the legs must be positioned to point down and then clipped into place to be sturdy. I have tried that part and found it to be very sturdy.
B0016KV73W This may be the best baby product I've bought. My daughter was recently potty trained when we had to go on a very long road trip through rural Oregon. We were very concerned that she would regress and bought this potty out of desperation. It worked wonderfully! The legs are very sturdy when locked in place and work well on uneven ground. The bags are super and we have not experienced a single leak. We've used the &#34;mergnancy potty&#34; everywhere from the back of the SUV to the park to the beach to the side of an interstate highway. It's compact enough to fit in my big purse, so it goes everywhere with us.
B0016KV73W A travel potty is an absolute must for potty training, especially in the early days.  It is literally the difference between a breakthrough success and yet another accident.  This travel potty is exactly what we need.  It's lightweight enough to fit in the diaper bag.  When the legs are snapped into place (which took me a few tries to get right), it is extremely sturdy.  My daughter feels very secure sitting on it - it's not wobbly at all.  It's a very smart design to allow it to be placed over a public toilet too, although we mainly use it as a stand-alone potty.  I keep a bag already loaded on so that it's ready to go at a moment's notice.  We have used it everywhere:  in the front seat, back seat, trunk, on the side of the road, in the park, everywhere.  The absorbent inserts in the bags are brilliant.  The bags contain messes perfectly; we've never had a mishap.  This potty seat affords us a LOT of confidence that even if the urge sneaks up on my daughter, we will still be okay.  Every potty training family needs one of these.
B0016KV73W We are loving this potty seat for our 19 month old. He is usually slow to warm up to new things, but took to this potty seat right away and has been going potty in public restrooms with no problems now. It fits conveniently in the diaper bag. Haven't used as a stand-alone potty seat yet, but can see that double duty can come in handy too. I like this item way better than my sister's quad fold dora the explorer seat for her daughter - that one is very flimsy and I think my son is comfortable on this seat b/c even though it is small and portable it is sturdier. Great buy for ten bucks!
B0016KV73W With the reusable liner we have been able to use the 2-in-1 potette plus at home, in the car, and while traveling.  Great product.
B0016KV73W Love it! Easy to transport, fits in a backpack or handbag. So convenient for potty training on the go. Came in very handy when we went camping.
B0016KV73W So happy with this purchase - and I was sceptical.  1-Because it good TOO many good reviews; and 2-My 2 1/2 year old newly potty trained daughter can be a little particular and dramatic about new things. But I was wrong and made a great choice in my purchase.  It even fits in my tote bag.  It comes with 3 pee bags and a plastic storage bag.  The extra bags and silicone seat insert/liner are separate, but well worth the extra purchase.  The potty does sit very low to the ground, and having a tall child made me think maybe she wouldn't like the way that felt but she is fine sitting low, even though her house potty's are higher.  We use the liner/insert at houses we visit because I can easily dump it and wipe; as well as the bags for in the car or at stores so I can just toss.  I prefer to use the Potette brand bags instead of using a garbage bag with paper towels as some suggested - you never know when there is a small leak.  The bags are easy to use and have little turtles in the bottom pad which make it fun for the child to tinkle on.  The pad is genius - nothing sloshes around!  Although when I have used the silicone insert in the car, I just put paper towels in the bottom and that works just as well. My only, very small, con is manuevering the legs/handles of the pot.  It is not easy.  You have to push each end of each leg/handle all the way in to click, to make it a sturdy sit-on-the-floor potty.  Then they snap out again to fold in to store, or to flip outward to use as a toilet seat.  Our babysitter has issues with this aspect so she actually pulls each handle all the way off, and folds them in and THEN snaps them in to store it. Otherwise she can't go from the locked to the fold position.  Even I have trouble.  But the more you use it the easier it is and it works so well otherwise I will deal with that.  This really is one of the best purchases I've made as a mom so far, it makes running errands with a toddler who doesn't like big toilets so much easier!
B0016KV73W Got this just for its dual purpose of being able to use on a regular toilet and on the go.  It is nice that it is small and portable but it is really tiny when you get it on a toilet.  It looks more ring like than seat like.  This is especially true if you have an elongated toilet bowl.  And if you have an elongated bowl the seat actually ends up sitting towards the back making it a little hard for the kid to climb on to.  The worst part for boys is that if you/they are not careful the design tends to allow \"sprayage\" all over the place as there isn't much room between the kids \"junk\" and the front of the bowl.  Have the Bjorn seat in another bathroom that works really well.  Will likely get another for home and keep this one in the care for outings only.
B0016KV73W I got two of these bc we were traveling and boy they were so uncomfortable.  After every time my toddler used it, you can see red marks on both sides of his thighs.We've only used it on top of the regular toilet seat, hadn't try it the other way like we were in the woods or something.
B0016KV73W We are not a fan of this product.  I have the Baby Bjorn ones inside the house which my son loves but he refuses to use this one when we are out and about.  The first time he sat on it it wasn't correctly locked in place and the potty gave way and he fell down.  He's been traumatized every since and now I just bring the Bjorn one along for the ride in the trunk and wasted all of my money on this.
B0016KV73W Great if you travel with a kid in potty training period. It is small enough to be carried around. It can fit even in a larger purse. It is very stable once it is locked in the position. The only problem is unlocking it. I end up with the handles in my hand every time I try to unlock it and I have to put the handles back. I do not know how long the plastic is going to resist to this maneuver.
B0016KV73W This is a great small size and fits comfortably in my bag. I love using this when we are out in public. It folds out nicely where my 2-1/2 year old can hold on to it's handles and not the icky public toilet seat. I love how it folds up very small.  Great product
B0016KV73W This has saved us on road trips on the side of the road and on icky public toilets while out running errands.  Holds up well and I pretty much don't leave the house without it.
B0016KV73W This is a great seat to keep in car for going public places, but not small enough to fit in my purse or anything. It is extremely low to the ground when used as a stand-alone potty, so not very useful for that. Will do in a pinch, but my daughter is 3 and already about to outgrown ability to use it on ground.
B0016KV73W Where do I start? I love love love this toilet seat. During my search for a portable potty for my daughter I looked at many different brands and options. But after reading many reviews for this I decided to give it a try even though I worried that it might be bigger than I wanted. When it arrived I knew then its the perfect size. It is such a life saver in many ways. It helped my baby girl toilet train because the kiddie ones with a bucket that you have to throw out is just a bit too gross for me. I do not leave the house without it. I thank god every time we are out and my daughter needs to go but we're at a super disgusting public toilet. I grab a bunch of the seat covers, layer them up and slap this on top and she's ready to go. We've used it in my car too for times that a public toilet is not around which is such a life saver. This way I'm not driving 100 mph looking for the next restroom stop and panicking that she might go in her pants. It is very sturdy and easy to clean. I would buy this again in a heartbeat.
B0016KV73W My daughter likes her little \"red potty\".  I keep it in the car for emergencies and when she was toilet training I put it in the stroller for walks too.  I like that the legs can fold flat for storage, and that they click into place to sit.  (It might seem obvious if you know it already, but wasn't obvious to grandma who borrowed it while babysitting.)  The bags are great and perfectly sized to smoothly cover the seat for no mess--expensive, but we don't use them that often.  I've also just set the seat out over grass/dirt and used it sans bag (what can I say, I'm cheap like that).  I've tried a grocery bag, but they are so crinkly and slippery, and the ink flakes off...so I prefer the bag made by Potette.  I like that it has bags b/c clean up is SO EASY!!!  I don't have to rinse out a little potty or find somewhere to rinse it or toss the TP/wipe.  That is by far the biggest plus!  Especially since my 2 yr old likes \"privacy\" so she likes it in the back of the SUV rather than on the ground in the parking lot.  It does sit very low to the ground, so it might be less comfortable for bigger toddlers, but that's a sacrifice for convenience and portability.
B0016KV73W During potty training this has been fantastic.  My daughter learned to potty train in a potty chair, but that meant pleading with her to pee before we left the house, and rushing home before the next &#34;potty.&#34;  Once we got this, it was easy to throw in my (large) purse and off we'd go.  She felt much more secure on large public toilets.  Not only that, you have the capability to turn this into an emergency potty chair by folding the legs down instead of out to the side.  It's great for long car trips because we don't have to race to the next exit to find a gas station.  We're able to put this in the hatchback trunk and just let her go there, in the provided liners (you could also use a plastic shopping bag -without holes!).This is great to even just leave in the trunk.
B0016KV73W I really like this product. I was a bit unsure of it at first because it looked so small. But we have used it in the public restrooms and at people's houses and it works great over a toilet. The arms fold out and click into place creating a sturdy seat. The arms also click into place creating a stool like seat for using without a toilet. We have not had the opportunity to try that out yet. As a travel potty it does fit well into a diaper bad. Surprisingly compact.
B0016KV73W This thing is awesome!  We keep it in the back of the car at all times.  My daughter is very afraid of &#34;big potties&#34; and this is our solution.  We buy the refill bags and it's so convenient.  I originally bought it for use on a trip and even brought it on the airplane. We still use it now.  On outings I just ask her if she needs to go (usually while exiting or entering the car) and I open up the back hatch of my car, she hops in and goes.  I keep a little pack of diaper wipes in the bag with it.  Then before walking into a store (or the park) I just tie up the bag and toss it in the garbage on my way in.  Nothing to clean up and I don't have to hunch over a public bathroom telling my daughter over and over to stop touching everything.  Sometimes we'll bring it to parks near us that don't have bathrooms.  We've been using this for about 10 months now and are only on our second pack of refill packs.  Totally worth it.
B0016KV73W Yes, its not the biggest place for a bottom to rest BUT proof is in the usage:My 3 year old didn't miss a beat (or the seat) the first time she used it. We keep it in the back of the car ready to go and she just hops on there when needed.  Its little legs were a little difficult to lock into place (and in-lock) the first couple of times but after that it was a cinch.  Once in place it is very stable.  They bags hold everythign well and its easy to get set up and packed away for next time.  Ideal for travel or a trip to the park when the porta potties are a little more aromatic than desired.
B0016KV73W We used this twice. It seriously was much easier to just hold my daughter over a public potty and wash our hands thoroughly than bring this in and take it with us. It's small, yes but it just wasn't fun to lug something else in and out of restaurants, the mall, etc. Plus I felt like we were just carrying germs around with us from one potty to another. It's sort of an unnecessary purchase unless you are using it for camping, the beach, etc. For public potties just use the potty.
B0016KV73W Only use this is a  toilet seat converter for my kiddos.  For this it works well and is nice & compact.  I have a Ju Ju Be Backpack and it fits inside the back zippered change mat section (after taking out the mat which I no longer need) Don't like it as a sit on potty though.  My daughter won't use it as I think it feels unstable to her.  I keep a Cool Gear Travel Potty  in the car for her to use if we can't find a toilet as it's sets up as a sturdy bench seat, it's also higher off the ground than this potette.  Works with the potette bags (or any plastic bag for that matter) so it's a fast disposal just like the pottette.
B0016KV73W Lifesaver for a potty-training 3 year old who is still mostly resistant. This removes the fear of &#34;falling&#34; into the toilet plus the handles keep his tiny hands away from the germ infested seat.  Works great with the Potty Cover or Potty Topper (provides added layer of protection / barrier).  The portability is also a plus. This is a MUST-HAVE for potty training parents.
B0016KV73W We've owned this for a few weeks now and it's simply THE BEST! Every parent with little ones potty training should get one of these! Our girl has used this potty-style in the back of our SUV, in the backseat of our sedan, on the side of the road, at the neighborhood pool, and seated-style on numerous public restrooms. I purchased the disposable bags with these and once I ran out, found a grocery store bag and 2 papertowels folded over works just as well and is more convenient and cheaper than the bags. This potty is comfortable for my girl, easy to transport (comes with a carrying bag), easy to use, easy to clean, convenient, inexpensive and has been invaluable for keeping in the car and using when the moment strikes! Great product! I might consider this my new go-to gift for new parents...even though they'd have to wait a few years until they can use it...it's that wonderful.
B0016KV73W Works great as a portable potty option.  My son is terrified of large public toilets and this makes him feel safe without me having to lug something large around.  The bag is great for keeping it thrown in my diaper bag.  The front is a little lower than his other one which has led to some unintentional spraying!  I have yet to try it as a travel potty.
B0016KV73W Our son hated kiddie potties.  He just went straight from diapers to the regular toilet.  I'm sure it would come in handy if you camped a lot, or traveled a lot, but it just didn't work for us.
B0016KV73W This potty seat is great! We use it daily in my son's bathroom at home, and it folds easily to take with us out of the house. It has fit every toilet seat we've put it on, with no problems. No touching germy public toilets! I can't say anything about using it as a portable potty since we've never tried it that way. But it was a great purchase, worth every penny!
B0016KV73W I bought this more to use on public toilets, and the ocassional stand along use.  My son isn't comfortable using it on the big toilet AT ALL.  I don't like that it sits on the very back of the toilet.  When his pants are pulled to the ankles, his legs then have to sit out straight, making sitting very awkward.  And I also can't tell whether he is 'pointed down' because his legs are in the way of me seeing.Perhaps this would be better to use in the back of a minivan or something during a long trip.  But I don't have a huge car, and I don't find it very useful for everyday shopping, errands, etc.
B0016KV73W Simply one of the best baby / kid products around. Folds and unfolds easily and works great as a stand-alone potty or an adaptor for a regular toilet. Lightweight and inexpensive, too.
B0016KV73W This is the perfect little potty for our uses: emergencies and on long car trips. I love that it can be used as a seat on a big potty, if you have that option, or on it's own with the bags. I have bought the liners that this company makes to go along with this potty because I like the ease of knowing there won't be spills or leaks if I were to use my own. I also like the ease of not having to carry around both grocery bags and something to put in the bottom of them (although that's a great idea in case I ever find myself without one of Kalencom's liner bags!).We are using this as an emergency potty for our kids ages 9, 6, and 2, although the 9 and 6 year old are able to hold it until we find an actual bathroom better than the 2 year old.
B0016KV73W After a week of potty training at home I knew I had to venture out and have my son sit on a public toilet. The potette fits perfectly on all the public toilets I've tried it on but it does require some getting used to. My son just turned 2 and is small for his age but he fits fine on it but it took a few tries to get him seated properly so he doesn't pee all over the place. I thought I would use the seat as a travel potty for the car as well but I tried sitting my son on it as a toilet and he fell right through to the floor. Since he has been trained on a real toilet with a potty seat he just wasn't used to sitting so low to the ground with nothing to hold on to.While it has been a life saver in public places, it is a pain in the butt to carry around. We rarely use a stroller so it's not an option to throw it in the basket underneath. And I was trying to get away from using a diaper bag anymore since my son is now potty trained. But this potty is just too large to fit in any purse that I own. So it's back to carrying a diaper bag for now and hopefully I can teach my son to pee standing up soon :)
B0016KV73W Pros:-has a raised upper lip so i'm not as scared of my boy peeing all over the place-sturdy ring that does not fold, so no worries about it caving or breaking or pinching-can work both as a potty seat or stand alone potty. we haven't tried the latter feature yet, but basically there are 2 folding legs on each side that fold in when not in use; fold out all the way like wings so that you can place on a toilet seat; & can fold legs 90 degrees to the potty seat itself so that it can be standingCons:-on the smaller side, but works fine for my little guy, who is on the smaller side**It's inevitable that whatever potty set you get, the yucky public toilet will be exposed to your child. So, our system is to bring a travel pack of sanitizing wipes and wipe the toilet seat and anything icky and tempting for toddler to touch (like flusher, sanitary napkin box, etc) and then place potty seat on top. Works great!
B0016KV73W It works as intended. We keep it in the car for our daughter and it can be used in public restrooms. There has been a few emergencies while she's been in the car seat. It's easy to pull over to a private spot, set up the Potette, and let her go. It's definately saved us from car accidents. Some people have complained that the legs fly out from under the seat. I have not found this to be an issue at all. The instructions show that when the legs are pulled out they need to be pushed up to \"click\" into the seat. It's solid when pushed into that position.EDIT: 12/2012 -- We still have this in our car. It's been a long time and still have the original one. It works great. No issues at all. Awesome when you are miles from a toilet and the little one says, \"I gotta go!\"
B0016KV73W This thing is awesome!!! it is great for road side emergency potty breaks, fitting onto the toilets when we're out and about, also for at home when my daughter was potty training. I appreciate that it comes in it's own carrying bag so I don't have to store it in one of my own bags. Easy to clean and the bags that it is sold with are perfect.
B0016KV73W Maybe this will be more useful in traveling when my daughter gets older, but it's not working for a toilet topper. It slides around too much and doesn't stay where it needs to stay. Also, it's so thin, it's not very comfortable for my daughter. I really liked the idea of this product though. I hope we can use it in the future.
B0016KV73W I love this one.  I looked at A LOT of portable potty seats when we got ready for potty training, and all of them seemed either too flimsy or too big.  This is the sturdy and relatively portable (depending on the size of your diaper bag).  I love that it can be used with the bags as a true travel potty as well as just a portable potty seat.
B0016KV73W I purchased this potty to prepare for the next step in potty learning, attempting to go outside sans diaper.We aren't there yet but boy howdy what a multi-functioning potty.During potty learning, I know some folks like to have a mobile potty available in every room for their child.  I wasn't keen on this idea.  Nor was my daughter.  When I took her potty out to clean the bathroom floor, she told me that her potty belongs in the potty next to Mommy and Daddy's potty.  We nixed the idea of moving the potty.Then one evening while she was getting ready for bed and giving the 10th excuse to get out of bed, she stated, \"I need to go potty.\"  I didn't want to stop her if she really needed to and felt telling her to go in her overnight would probably be confusing to her.  I also didn't want her to leave the bedroom.I quickly remembered the portable potty!  I grabbed it and opened it up and told her this was her special to go potty.  She loved it and now we keep it in the bedroom for when she has to go during bedtime.The size is just right for us.  It's not too big or small and is compact enough that we can slip it into our travel bag for trips to see family and friends.I love the bags that come with it.  They seem flimsy but do the job well.  Each bag has this square liner that helps absorb liquid.  It's not as absorbent as a diaper but it does the job.  You wipe, drop the wipes in the bag and just take the handles off the sides and tie it up and trash.  The bags have a light but pleasant scent that isn't too overpowering.The portable potty plus also gives you the option to make it a seat on top of a standard toilet.  I haven't tried this option yet but it seems sturdy enough.  Parts are made of rubber that seem to help with stability and no slip.A few tips that I culled from reading the manual and speaking to other parents:1.  If you open it up to be a portable potty, make sure to snap the legs closed so it doesn't collapse on your child.  The easiest way to do this is flip the legs down and put the potty on the ground.  Put your hands on top of the potty seat and apply pressure until you hear the clicking sound.2.  If you use it as a seat over the toilet, make sure the handle bars are also locked so your child's fingers don't get caught in between the seat and the toilet seat.3.  If you use it as a portable potty, you can leave a maximum of three bags on it.  This saves you from having to re-line it every time and the occasional, 'I'm not done yet!' and plop back onto the seat after you pulled the dirty bag off move.This potty is not for the very young or for those that cannot sit upright for long periods of time.  It is a portable potty so it only has the seat and does not provide any back support.  I only state this as some folks have early potty learners.  We started potty learning early, mainly so that Mommy didn't have to use the bathroom with a baby on her lap.  Because of such, we also have a backed Bjorn potty in the bathroom.  We started using the Bjorn at age 15 months as a chair.  We started using the portable potty at age 2.Hope this helps.
B0016KV73W I was so excited to try this little potty for an upcoming trip!  The only problem is that our little one doesn't like it.  She is a very petite (21 pounds, 32 inches) 19 month old and the ring is too big for her.  She looks very uncomfortable on it like she feels she is going to fall through.  It also sits too low to the ground for her.  We will keep it around and hope that maybe she will grow into it and it will be a our \"go-to\" travel potty.  But for now we will search for something else.
B0016KV73W This is okay.  I thought it would look a little more like a toilet, but it's working for my husband's half attempts at &#34;elimination communication.&#34;  He hates diaper changes and saw this as a way of training a four-month old to pee in a toilet.  I think it will likely be helpful when we really take on toilet training--especially for trips.
B0016KV73W This is a great little travel potty and we have also used it as a portable toilet seat for public restrooms.There are a couple of things that could improve it though.  The legs are so short that even a 34 inch child does not look comfortable sitting on it.  Also, do not allow children to fold the chair back together.  It is easy to pinch your fingers if you are not careful.The Kalencom PLUS works as a toilet seat too for public restrooms and it does the job.  However, I do not like this seat as a portable toilet seat for three reasons. With boys the pee can hit the wrong spot and splatter; the seat is lumpy; and it slips a bit on the toilet.  This product is best used as just a travel potty and it is good for that.  It is nice you can put three of the disposable bags on it in advance and be ready for emergency potty stops.
B0016KV73W This is GREAT for our newly potty training son. Fits great on a regular toilet lid for out and about, and easy to use for stand alone times (saved us at the beach from having to stand in a long line for the restroom for him). I love it and can't say enough great things about it. My only wish (and this is being super nit picky) is that the splash gaurd would be bigger (for boys). But that is just being super pic
B0016KV73W I love this thing. It was well worth the money spent. We use it all the time. It will adjust to fit any toilet and my daughter feels safe and secure using it. I hate using public restrooms, but this thing makes the whole process a little more palatable. I leave it in my car in a small bag (along with a little container of antibacterial wipes) and it goes into the stroller when we are the zoo, mall, church, etc. One of my favorite features---and one that you definitely can't tell from the image shown---is that when it is folded out, there are little handles for the kid to hold onto. My daughter loves that and I love it that she isn't gripping a public toilet. We haven't had to use it in the &#34;stand-alone&#34; position yet. Circumstances just haven't required it. But someone said that you can make your own bags for it by cuttting a sanitary pad in half, sticking it in a plastic grocery sack. The pad absorbs liquid and you just tie it up and toss. Sounds fine to me. I have a couple in my car in a little pouch for the time when that happens. Very happy with this purchase.
B0016KV73W I got this for my 2 year old who we'd just potty trained. I didn't want to get caught short in the car away from the bathroom, but I also didn't want a great big potty in the trunk of the car. This is great, it folds small. To use it as a travel potty, you click the legs, add the bag and away they pee (you can buy 'special bags' but a diaper bag with a bit of paper towel in the bottom would work as well.) I read some reviews that it collapses when the kids are on it, but if you click the legs in properly, it does not.To use on the toilet just extend the legs like the wings on a airplane, pop it on the seat and them on top.It folds small enough for the diaper bag too!
B0016KV73W I can't explain how impressed and happy i am with this product. I bought it for my 2 year old for a camping trip but we had an emergency and we travelled in the philippines. It made our life a lot easier because we don't have to rush and stop somewhere when my daughter needs to potty. We used it when we are out and i don't feel comfortable about my daughter using the public toilets and we even use it inside the car ( i just sit her in the back) .. This product was worth every penny, i highly recommend it if you travel a lot and good for those who are starting potty training
B0016KV73W I bought this product for my twin girls who are almost 2 and a half and we've been using it for almost 2 months now. It's the best travel potty ever! Folds very easily and can fit in a medium-sized bag. Super easy to use. Nice color. We tried another potty before this one and one of my little girls kept saying &#34;it hurts, mommy&#34;. We never had such a problem with this potty. We've traveled with it the whole summer and it's been a lifesaver on so many occasions! I can't imagine traveling without it! I do think that the liners are overpriced but that's not too big an issue -- You can always use this potty with other small plastic bags. Highly recommended.
B0016KV73W My two year old just started potty training and I knew we would need something we could use when we are out of the house. I love that it can be used as a stand alone potty or as a seat on a regular toilet. This potty usually gets used as a stand alone with the bag inserts, which I really like and are biodegradable. We haven't used it for long so I don't know how durable it will be but it does seem to be pretty good quality plastic and will hopefully last through two kids. It's sturdy when the legs are locked in place and pretty small when folded down. Our toddler seems to feel secure on it as it gets used frequently. I'm really glad we bought this and for the price you can't beat it.
B0016KV73W Bought for traveling with twin 2-year-olds.  When placed on a regular toilet, this seat bends a bit at the seams when the kids sit on it.  This makes them feel unsteady.  They rejected it completely at first.  On a second trip, they were a bit more willing to try, but still not as comfortable as the Bjorn seats we use at home.  Very small when in the stand-alone position.  Might work better once they're actually potty trained instead of just starting.
B0016KV73W We kept this in the back of the car and used it several times.  It works great, and is so easy to clean up.  Love it!
B0016KV73W This potty is great for my two year-old.  It's a potty seat when the legs are folded out and a travel potty when the legs are down (and a baggie is inserted).  As a potty seat, I like that it creates a barrier between my daughter and that toilet seat gap most public toilets have.  It's also stable enough (on most toilets) for me to stand back and let her go on her own (per her request) without slipping or sliding about.  We've also had to use it three times as an emergency travel potty and it's been great.  My only complaint is that my daughter likes going on it so much that one of those frantic stops was a total fake; she just wanted sit on it.It fits in my diaper bag and doesn't add that much bulk or weight.  Although it's always with me, I find that I only use it as a potty seat now when the toilet is particularly icky.One last thing -- it comes in a travel bag that is just a thick, white plastic bag with a drawstring top.
B0016KV73W We use this potty often, and although the seat is small it seems to serve its purpose. My son adapted to it easily and never had any issues. My only complaint is buying the bags. They can be costly when you use it as often as we do. And any new child learning to potty train will need to go before entering the store, and when coming out of the store! I also only have 1 store nearby that carries these bags, and once there shelves are empty I am out of luck until they get more in. I have used a shopping bag in a pinch, but be forwarned they are not usually leak proof. I have also used small garbage bags with a maxi pad which served its purpose but can also be a disaster as the bag would stick to my sons bottom as he would stand, and also while out in public it looked ridiculas. Wish they made some type of adapter or someway to use diaper diaposal bags as this would be more cost effective and easier. 
B0016KV73W I was so excited to find this potty. It was exactly what we needed for being on the go, as my son doesn't like to use toilets yet. The major drawback though is that when my son goes pee, the pee goes everywhere since there isn't an effective splash guard. Otherwise, this is great for #2. We haven't yet tried it over the big toilet since my son prefers a potty and is a bit fearful of toilets, even with this over the seat.
B0016KV73W We have loved this potty - it's easily portable and works great at home too.  It's our all around potty for our 2 1/2 yr old.  Some reviewers said the seat was small - we haven't found that to be the case but he does seem less comfortable on it than he is on his little potty that has a foam/rubber ring for comfort (he squirms a little on this seat).  However, now that he's not sitting on the potty just waiting to go, he does just fine on this seat for the length of time it takes him to potty.  I would have given this 5 starts if it seemed a little more comfortable for him.  
B0016KV73W Haven't used it a lot yet but so far this is great.  Has been sturdy and comfortable on toilet.  Haven't used it alone but when snapped in properly seems it will be fine.  Bought another to keep in each car.
B0016KV73W I keep this in the back of my car for those emergency situations where my little one can't get to a potty. So handy to have this! It has saved me several times.
B0016KV73W I have one in each of our cars and one in the stroller. Our nanny hates going to public restroom in the part because a lot of homeless people go there so she will use the potette every day letting our daughter do her business in the park. The bags are a bit expensive but grocery bags so often have holes I'd rather be safe than sorry. I have also used it in restaurants when they have no seat liner and I still put some toilet paper on the toilet seat towards the front that the potette doesn't cover. Many times we have pulled over or exit freeway to find a parking lot where my daughter can go potty. One times she did it inside our car but she bent her leg too high and the pee kinda squirt out of the potette so I make sure she straighten her legs when she as to pee. Overall it is a great product. You do have to make sure the legs snap in place when using as a chair. IMO, even if I only use it once it is totally worth the money so my daughter doesn't have to touch any dirty toilet seat or when she needs to go while we are driving somewhere.
B0016KV73W We do not go anywhere without the potette in our car!  We have been using the same one for about 2 years now and it is fantastic.  It is small enough to fit in your diaper bag (really, smaller and lighter than you would think) and incredibly sturdy.  Those who commented that it is not sturdy are not properly snapping it into place.  I had this problem initially, but once I got the hang of it, it is sturdy enough for even a very desperate adult ;)  We usually don't bother with the bags - we just find a nice patch of grass on the side of the road (we live in the country) and let the pee hit the grass - works like a charm!
B0016KV73W Caution for boys - the splash guard is a little too short to stop spray from coming out under splash guard and back up onto their pants when used on an adult toilet, and if bag liner isn't on just right - and definitely if you try without any liner.  The reusable liner has saved us lots of trouble and made this a good park/travel potty.  Second Caution is that you have to really make sure to click the legs into place just right or it collapses and pinches small fingers when set up as stand-alone travel potty.  Even after reading directions and thinking I was doing it correctly, it took a friend with the same potty to show me how to really get the legs all the way clicked into place before we stopped having trouble.  We now love it for taking out and about as a small potty.
B0016KV73W I keep this thing in my car, and make sure I take it on every trip. Because as you know, as soon as you leave the gas station....somebody has to go potty right there and then!!! I like that the legs fold, it doesn't take up space! and then you tie the bags and you throw them away! Super clean!
B0016KV73W fantastic product! I recently brought it along to our 2 week trip to China. It was so handy I cant say enough good things about it! Product works perfectly and so convenient. In the hotel room it works perfectly as the toilet seat. When we were out, I have had to use the bag a couple of times when my son had to poo and pee. Toilets were hard to find, CLEAN toilets were very rare, so needless to say, it was a lifesaver! It was however kind of short for my 4 year old son. Even when set up, it was quite short and he was a little uncomfortable but he just had to do his thing and he was off. Still a 5 star for me. If they would make it a little more comfy for the little one would be amazing. Highly recommended for parents with toilet going kids!
B0016KV73W This is a great seat to use with the liners and to have in your car. But when put on a toilet it is a very large opening and no splash guard and not very comfortable. Since the opening is wide, it was difficult for my 2year old to sit for any long period of time. We took it on our vacation but probably won't be doing that again. It's going to live in my car and used for roadtrips and emergencies. On vacation I'd still take another more comfy seat that will stay in the hotel or the fold up kind to use in my diaper bag. The liners are great tho!! Nothing else out there like this seat plus liners.
B0016KV73W I wanted to love this potty. I read all of the reviews and was so impressed by how many people raved about it. I think it would work great for a young two year old. However, I bought this when my son had just turned three. My son is very slim at only 50th percentile for weight yet he complains that the potty is too small and uncomfortable to use. He also complains that it is too low to the ground and he feels like he will fall off of it. So, this travel potty is going in storage until my daughter turns two, when I will try it out on her.I do like the design of the potty. It is very compact and folds up nicely to fit in a diaper bag for easy travel. I did find the legs to be a bit tricky to get to pop out (to set up the seat for use) and back in (for storage). I havent used the potty that much though so maybe with increased use I will get better at popping the legs of the potty in and out.I also have to pass on a trick that has worked well for us when we are away from a toilet with my 3 year old son. If you take a large sized zip loc bag and let him pee in there it works rather well. You just seal it up or pour it out and dispose of it. Obviously, this only works well 1) for a boy and 2) for peeing only.So, in sum, because it is so small and low to the ground be mindful of this if you are buying it for a 3 year old or for a larger sized two year old. And even if your child fits on the seat, if they are used to sitting higher up on other potty chairs, such as the bjorn potty, they may feel awkward or like they are going to fall off when they sit on this low to the ground seat and they may refuse to use it. From my experience with this travel potty thus far, I probably wouldn't buy it again, but since I have it I am going to hang onto it and give it another try when my daughter turns two.
B0016KV73W This was a lifesaver at the beach while my daughter was potty training. I highly recommend it. Works great on its own or as a potty seat on an adult toilet. Great purchase.
B0016KV73W Potty training is not an easy process. This 2 in 1 potty/seat helps a lot with the process. I take it everywhere with me. I mostly use it as a seat but there were a few times where I used it as a potty and it worked perfect (During a picnic, in the car once when parked..)The bags are expensive but I bought them anyway. You never know when you will need them. It's been a year and I still plenty of them left just because I use this product as a seat more often then a potty (As a potty in emergencies or places with no restrooms or with really filthy ones!!)Great buy :))
B0016KV73W My 3 year old is very afraid of going to a loud public bathroom. This has come in handy every time we go out. I do t buy the bags and found if I just use a plastic bag (like target thick bags) with some paper towels it works perfectly. I highly recommend this to everyone with a toddler
B0016KV73W We keep one of these in the back of our SUV.  It's a perfect solution to when you LO needs to go and you don't have a toilet to use or for potty training.  It's small enough to fit in a diaper bag, pool bag, beach bag.  Goes everywhere with us!  And the liners are a must have.  They make it super clean and easy!
B0016KV73W we are about a week into potty training and so far this is my son's preferred potty seat.  we also have a little frog potty and a seat that sits on a regular toilet, but I guess this is the one he finds most comfortable.  I bought the reusable liner and I definitely recommend it if you plan on using this seat as more than just a travel toilet.Cons: I haven't tried using this as a travel option yet.  It seems like it would be kind of difficult at first, as it takes a minute to set up, too long for a newly trained child in my opinion.  I'm not thrilled with it as a seat on a regular toilet.  My son kind of sinks into it and the hard plastic leaves red marks.  Also, it doesn't work with a potty hook and we only have one small bathroom so I need something that saves space.Overall, if my son likes it then it's a winner and I like that it has three functions.btw grocery store plastic bags work well too
B0016KV73W This portable toilet is GREAT!! It is easy to set up, thoguh I never use it on adult public toilets, it feels gross. I can set it up in any corner, even at the mall and no one knows. The bags are biodegradable which is also great. They have absorbent pads in them to hold the pee too. It is small and has a bag to carry. Really a must for any one with small kids!
B0016KV73W Legs wont click into place and keeps falling down when my little 25lb daughter sits on it. It squeezed her fingers as it fell down and now my daughter refuses to use it. Its a great idea but if the legs don't stay in place and falls, its useless. This is going right back to amazon. I am disappointed as I really think its a good concept. Hopefully I just got a lemon.
B0016KV73W We keep this in the bottom of the stroller and it has saved us many times.Early on in potty training, it came in quite handy when our toddler had the sudden need to go to the bathroom and there was no restroom.  This quickly opens and solves that problem.We also use it often on public toilets.  Not only is it more hygienic, but also much less scary for our toddler than using some strange new toilet in a strange public restroom.It is a bit frustrating to pay for the extra bags.  They look just like plastic shopping bags with a swatch of paper towel inside.  However, the difference is that these bags never have any holes.  When you are carrying a bag full of urine to the trash can, you'll be happy it is the Kalencom bag that never leaks.
B0016KV73W This portable potty is wonderful -- it fits on every toilet we've tried (very old, small, round toilets can be a bit of an issue, but then you can fit it on the bowl instead of on the seat and it still works just fine), and it works as a portable stand-alone potty as well. It folds up small enough that it isn't annoying to bring it everywhere -- even on airplanes -- and is very sturdy!And with the high weight limit (96lbs), I have no worries about my son (30lbs at 22mos) outgrowing the seat before he's done potty-training.
B0016KV73W My toddler trained early (22 months) and is a little on the short side. Doing our business while we're out and about has been challenging because pulic toilets are so big. AND, I think not having an option for I'm while we're out was sending him mixed messages. I bought this today and we stopped for lunch- he announced he needed to go and he used it right away- no hesitation. In fact, he was even excited because it was just his size. It's small enough to fit in my bag and I'm going to carry it everywhere. I'm not sure how it will be for bigger kids but for my dude it was perfect.
B0016KV73W We always tell my son to &#34;point down&#34; when he pees, but it still will spray out of this. There is a gap between the set cover and the actual seat so I wish it would go down further to prevent sprays. Overall it is a decent product and good for quick trips to the potty, and taking in public.
B0016KV73W My son is on the small side for a twenty month old boy.  I purchased this product after I realized that he would not use the big potty at his sister's swim practice, and he was refusing to wear anything but his big boy pants... They sell this product at a major toy store for very little money so I bought it there.  For putting it on a big potty it works WONDERFUL.  No issues there at all.  The size is great for carrying with you, and the bag that comes with it is a nice touch.  My only issue is that when I set it up as a stand alone potty and my son promplty sat down on it, it collapsed.  I tried it again, same thing (much more reluctant child though).  I was not able to get it to click into place, which is apparently the problem... I do think its worth the money though, especially if you get one that will click into place.  Sure its small, but this is for babies as young as 15 months.. bigger toddlers/pre schoolers will likely need something else.
B0016KV73W This was a potty training piece of awesomeness. Flexible for traveling, and easy for our 20 month old to sit on. During her 3 day potty training weekend we kept this handy, carrying from room to room, for &#34;pit stops.&#34; It saved our floors from a lot of extra scrubbing. I call it our porta-potty as it goes everywhere with us for potty time emergencies (we've used it by the side of the road, in a park, in the back of our SUV...) and also as her toilet ring seat in public restrooms. It folds up and fits in its own carrying bag along with a spare set of training pants and small pack of flushable wipes. That kit in turn fits in my tote bag or beneath the stroller. Regular grocery bags work fine, just make sure they don't have any little holes in them!
B0016KV73W I was skeptical about this one but, as soon as the UPS man delivered it my 2  year old boy wanted to go on it.  I let him go 1 time inside but, told him after that it was an outside only potty.  We have used it at least 6 times in 2 days and I'm mostly very pleased with it.  Setup is very easy (just make sure you hear the click when locking the legs in place) but, the built in deflector is somewhat small.  Until he learns to \"hold it down\" we are going to have to take off his pants and training pants so his legs sit wide enough that \"it\" points down automatically (you Mothers of boys know what I'm talking about).  Also unlocking/folding the legs was a little hard the first couple of times but, it seams to get easier every time.  I looked at a couple different portable potty chairs before deciding on this one.  The other 2 options were both bulky and 1 didn't have a deflector and the other sealed so you had to carry the \"waste\" home and clean it out.  Overall, I am very pleased with this seat.
B0016KV73W This is the best $10 I have ever spent!One week after my son turned 2, he decided that he was going to use the toilet and no more diapers.  While I applauded his desire and determination, I had a feeling the &#34;ability&#34; might take a bit of time to perfect.  So, after seeing the &#34;special potties for using on the go&#34; in one of his potty books, I took to Amazon to find out what these on the go potties are.  For $10, I decided to try the potette plus--and have now purchased 3 potette plus-es!These things are A-M-A-Z-I-N-G! They are little folding 'potties' that can be set up as a small potty OR (bonus!) placed upon a full sized adult toilet seat to make it child sized.  The legs easily snap into place to set the potette up as a potty and easily extend out to use as a child's seat on the adult toilet.  It is the PERFECT size for the &#34;mommy, I have to potty&#34;, as soon as you make your turn onto a busy street--you can easily pull off into the closest parking lot or parking space, set up the potty on the car seat, floor, hatchback, folded down seat, what have you, so that junior can make his pee pee, after telling you for the 5000th time before you left the house 1 minute earlier that he did not have to go.Pros:  Fits perfectly in the diaper bag where we used to keep the changing padEasy to set up and use; for a portable potty, stick in one of the included liners (replacements are available for a reasonable price too--they look like plastic grocery bags with an absorbent pad at the bottom), and prop up the potty for junior to use (we keep it set up in the car--we fold down the front passenger seat and let junior sit on his throne on the folded seat.  It's saved us many a time from an 'unforeseen car seat incident' as grandpa would call it.  Also perfect for bathroom-less parks, the beach, or anyplace else that your little one has to go while &#34;on the go&#34;.  Once junior does his business in the disposable liner, you remove the bag, tie up the handles, toss it in the trash and go about your day.Easy to use on the adult potty.  My little guy was public restroom (or any restroom that was not at home) a-phobic.  He REFUSED to use toilets that were not his own, which made leaving the house while potty training extra fun.  After we got the potette, every toilet seat looks alike! (because the potette is nicely propped on top and that is all the little one sees).The legs/handles keep junior from grabbing those germ infested toilet seats in public restrooms to hold on--he can just hang on to the legs/handles of the potette plus and keep his precious hands free from public toilet yucks.Cons:  We didn't realize that the legs snapped up into the potette to stabilize it when used as a potty.  We learned that after a couple of wobbly attempts.  Make sure that you snap the legs in place when using as a free standing potty.Overall, it has made potty training a breeze.  We never had to spend those long dreaded weekends at home because junior was learning to use the toilet.  We just bring the potette plus with us and he's good to go &#34;on the go&#34;.  We keep 1 in each car and 1 in the diaper bag.  It seems like nothing brings on the urge to potty like getting strapped into the car seat and pulling out of the neighborhood.
B0016KV73W I carried this potty in my purse (it barely fit) while my daughter was potty training. I hardly had to use it, but it was good to have. I carried plastic grocery bags and napkins to put at the bottom of the bag to absorb pee.Negatives:- It takes more than a few seconds to set-up, so if she really needs to go, she might not make it, and you're breaking a sweat.- She has to be okay with sitting down on plastic, because the plastic bag wraps around the seat.- The folding out and collapsing of the legs could improve in designPositives:- portable- pink- can use grocery bags and then throw away immediately
B0016KV73W This is a very good product for girls.  It's easy to use, fits well inside the toilet and my daughter has something to hold on to.
B0016KV73W This seat is perfect.  After looking at all of the travel potty seat options, I chose to buy this seat for my three-year old for our recent road trip.  It couldn't have worked better.  It has fit on every public and home toilet that we have found.  My daughter feels safe on it and really likes it.  She always asks if I have it, even if we are just going out to the park or store.  Plus, she is most comfortable holding on to it while using it, which means her hands stay away from the public potty.We have also used it once in its free-standing mode.  It worked great!  As long as you clip the legs in properly, it is very secure.  Anyone who has had problems with it collapsing must not have had it clicked in right.The only drawback is that you have to buy their bags, if you are going to use it without a toilet.  But their bags are great -- they have a pad for absorbing pee, and are super easy to attach and detach.  When we run out, I will probably try to use regular plastic bags in an attempt to save money, but will probably eventually cave into buying more of their bags because they are so easy and mess-free.  Plus, since it fits on every toilet we've found, I doubt I will use it in its free-standing mode very often.Bottom line -- WELL worth the money.  Great product.
B0016KV73W I love the idea, and while my 3 year is not opposed to using it when we are out it is SO low to the ground.  I have to help him squat down so far and it looks so uncomfortable.  He has missed it comepletely and made huge messes in the back of my car.  I wish the legs could extend somehow.  Great for smaller kids I guess.
B0016KV73W This product is amazing. It gives me piece of mind that my kids (and I!) will always have where to go. Is true that you gotta make sure that the legs of the potty SNAP securely before your child sits on it (I forgot to do this the very first time and the potty collapsed on one side), so make sure it snaps in place. I attached a picture of how the potty looks on a public toilet. It is sturdy for my 2 year old... even tho I still put some toilet paper on the toilet UNDER my potette just in case LOL. Fits my diaper bag, which is normal size... I love this thing.
B0016KV73W Just got it for my potty training daugther, who usually needs to go like now.  We now take it everywhere.  We liked the bags, but ended doing what I read in a review, which is just using regular bags with paper towel on them and it works like a charm (make sure the bag doesn't have any holes like many of them sometimes do).  It has saved us from having to put our daughter to pee under a tree, having to stop and look for a restaurant or something, and things like that.
B0016KV73W Yeah, it's a great idea.  Now, does it work?  Yes!  When it comes down to it, people are talking about two things about this seat.  ONE, there might be a issue for boys because the ring is on the small side; TWO, PUSH IN THE LEGS for the stand alone position.  My daughter wobbled over the first time; so I checked everyones' comments, and now it's great.  Bottom line, great for the occasional emergency.  We all have been there in the dirty gas station thinking we will burn EVERYTHING when we get home.  Great alternative.
B0016KV73W LOVE LOVE LOVE!! My daughter is sort of leery of new things. So I was prepared to fight for her to use this. Boy was I wrong&#8230; She wanted to replace the potty seat we have in the house with this one that I bought for the car :)It is very sturdy. My daughter is 32lbs and not sure of the stat but very tall for her ago (almost 3 years) and she uses it just fine!
B0016KV73W I love this potty seat, it's small and convenient.  My daughter does not hesitate to get up on it in a public restroom.  It fits on the toilet and does not move around, I have found this true on all shapes of toilets.  The rubber handles holds it in place.  I have not used it on the &#34;go&#34; where it stands on his own but it seems sturdy enough if it had to be used that way.  It's small enough that it fits in a small diaper bag.  The rubber handles fold up into the seat to make it smaller.
B0016KV73W After using this for a few months in my house for my 3yr 2mo old granddaughter, I put it away to use only for trips to the park, beach etc. and bought anotherArm & Hammer Secure Comfort Potty Seat, Colors May Varyfor my second bathroom that she uses. Here's why:1. The portability of this product is great for use outside the home. It folds easily and compactly. It also can be used as a standalone toilet when nothing else is available.2. So what's the problem with home use? When the legs are pushed up and locked into place, this just isn't stable on the toilet seat. My granddaughter has complained that sometimes it \"pops up\", which is absolutely true. Unless your child sits perfectly in the center of the seat when sitting down, and also gets up without shifting weight to one side, this seat will indeed pop up. That problem doesn't exist when using this as a standalone potty since the legs are facing down.Bottom line: This is a very handy item for day trips, but not something I recommend as a regular potty seat at home.Update April 28, 2014: I've been taking this along when we go out to different places to eat. It's relatively compact to bring, and since I don't let my granddaughter go into a public bathroom alone (unlike when she uses the bathroom in my house), I just hold it in place so it doesn't pop up when she uses it.
B0016KV73W We keep this potty in the car. My daughter is 2, and she loves it. You can just use a grocery bag and a paper towel, but I would double the plastic bag.
B0016KV73W This doesn't fold up as compactly as some seats, but this isn't only for placing on top of a toilet like most are. My DD absolutely REFUSES to go on public toilets, so this has been a wonderful solution for us. And, when she is finally ready for them, this will give her the comfort of being the same thing she's used to going on. It doesn't fold up very well if you have the reusable liner on it, but the disposable ones let it collapse completely as it should. However, my DD will only use the reusable liner (the crinkly plastic of the disposable ones bug her), so I can say that if you do fold the seat with the reusable liner on it, the liner takes the abuse of the legs folding into it well without damage. (The reusable is so easy to clean that I've yet to use a disposable liner, so I don't know how well those work). Also, in potty chair formation, it is low to the ground, but this makes going &#34;#2&#34; a lot easier for the child and encourages them to make that step of potty training (or it did for my DD who wouldn't until we got this).The folding mechanism takes some getting used to, but is quick once you do. It is very important that you make sure that the legs are fully clicked into the seat before use though or it will be unstable -- properly clicked, it's fine. We've not used it as a seat on top of a toilet, so I can't speak to that much except that it's so wide when in that formation it won't worry me that the seat will shift and fall into the toilet like some seats do (shift, probably, but not fall).
B0016KV73W Took this on a trip to Asia with our 2 1/2 year old daughter and it was a lifesaver when only squat toilets were available.  Was really surprised at the size - it really did fit in my purse (kind of a medium-sized purse); takes up about as much room as the plastic fold-into-quarters potty seat that we use in public in the US.  Bought the liners as didn't want to be figuring out yet one more thing at the moment of truth.  We normally use public facilities at home but will now carry this as a back-up in the event that we aren't near a rest-stop, or that they are dirty.  Very easy to set up and use - little one wanted to try it as soon as I took it out of the box from Amazon.  Would recommend this to anyone who plans long road trips; trips to other countries where facilities are different styles; or who would like another option when regular facilities are just too foul.
B0016KV73W Okay, I realize that I am putting up a review on a potty seat. Never thought I'd do that but here I am.This is an awesome product. My girls (4.5 and 2.5) love using it when we are out and about because it doesn't move around once it's places on a toilet. I had another foldable potty seat that I used to carry around and I have now chucked it. This one is small enough to be carried in my diaper bag and I like that it comes with a pouch. It's easy to wipe clean and has nice handles they can hold on to while they are using it. All in all, very happy with this purchase and I will definitely be recommending it to other friends.
B0016KV73W Bought this product based on all of the positive reviews and it's a life saver.  We used it everywhere.  Great toilet seat minimizer and very sturdy portable potty.  Makes traveling with a little one so much easier but helpful for being out and about too.  I don't buy the special bags, just use the regular grocery bags.
B0016KV73W My child is scared of &#34;big potties&#34;. When we are on the road or out shopping, this is the lifesaver for &#34;I have to pee now daddy!&#34;. We love it.
B0016KV73W I bought it for my two years old girl. We used it in an airplane, in restaurants rest rooms, in a back of our car, on a toilets anywhere we go and it is always with us. Very small and comfortable to care in a bag. I purchased a waterproof diaper bag for this potty so I fill very comfortable to care it around.
B0016KV73W What a great concept and easy to use.  I have a potty training 3-year-old and a long commute each day.  My daughter goes to daycare in my office building, so unfortunately she must endure the 45 minute commute each way.  Sometimes she can't make it until we get to our destination, so having this travel potty stashed in the back of the SUV has been a lifesaver.  Not only does she think it's fun to use, but even if I don't have easy access to a trash can, the liners do an excellent job on containing the urine until I can safely throw the bag away.  Some people have suggested the use of plastic grocery bags instead of buying the liners.  Unfortunately, I find grocery bags often have small unseen holes in them and do not have the wonderful absorbent pad inside.  Spend the few extra dollars to get the liners that are intended to be used with the potty - you will thank me later!  I also like the fact that the potty comes in a nice storage bag - it keeps it clean while sitting in the back of the SUV and is a great place to store the extra liners.  We don't go anywhere without this potty.  No matter how hard you try to get your toddler to use the potty before you leave somewhere that has a toilet, we all know that it will be only 5-10 minutes later when they actually decide they have to go.
B0016KV73W This saved us from having to find a place for our toddler to go potty in the middle of a family friendly Mardi Grass parade! My girl is also scared of public toilets that have seats that are open at the front edge (which is almost every public toilet seat) so we have had a hard time using public toilets until we got this seat :) Super compact, it will fit inside our backpack! and leave plenty of space for the rest of the things my newborn needs! It comes with a plastic bag so I can just wipe it clean and put it in the bag and it won't touch anything else inside the backpack! We also bought the reusable rubber liner and with both of them we are set to go anywhere! We use this for our adventures out and about and it gives me peace of mind knowing that my baby's buns and little hands won't touch any nasty public restroom toilet seat.
B0016KV73W I have twin toddlers and have several potties/seats at my house.  I LOVE this little seat.  It was the last one that I bought, but it is definitely worth the investment!  For portable potties, I also own:Fisher-Price Potty On-the-GoGinsey Dora Folding Travel Potty SeatIf I had to pick one, the Potette 2-in-1 would probably be it - mainly for its versatility.  This potty can stand alone and be used with the bags that come with it, or, you can use shopping/trash bags (I just use a roll of 4 gallon bags purchased at Target or a \"dollar\" store).  You can also use this potty on top of a real potty by opening the legs.  One of my girls is not a fan of public restrooms and will not use a big potty, but, I can offer her her own (potette) potty, and she'll use that one.  Her sister is willing to use the public potty, and I can use this same potty by putting it on the big potty.  This potty is small enough that it will fit in your purse, backpack, or diaper bag.  The \"carry bag\" that comes with it is just a small plastic bag - nothing fancy.  I have girls, but the front/back of the potette seat has higher edges to act as a spray-shield.  The seat can fit either direction.  The only \"negatives\" I have found is that it fits funny on elongated seats (works but sometimes you have to set the seat all the way to the front or back) and sometimes you have to fiddle with the legs to get them to pop in to the right place (when locking or unlocking).  If you lock the legs properly, the seat is stable (at least for my 30 pounders).The Fisher Price potty is very hard to find, but you can find it online if you search (for a reasonable price).  This potty is VERY stable and has a much larger seat.  We take this with us on trips in addition to the potette but leave it in the truck and carry the Potette in our bag.  I use the same 4 gallon bags.  This potty comes with a really nice shoulder carry bag that includes pockets for \"urine pads\" and bags.  The legs are super easy to pop in to place and to close.  The only negative is that it doesn't work on big potties (it wasn't designed to - but just thought I'd mention it in comparison).The Ginsey folding seats are just too flimsey and they slide all over the place.  Sure, it folds up nice and small, but for a few bucks more, I think the Potette is a better investment.I also own:Baby Bjorn Potty Chair,BABYBJ&Ouml;RN Toilet Trainer - White/Black, BRU potty/seat, two seats like these:Ginsey Dora Soft Potty SeatHint - just use nursing pads in the bottom of the bag to soak up the urine.
B0016KV73W My 2 year old Weighs about 30 lbs and can use this easily! Very portable and light weight! He has learned how to pee standing up thanks to his daddy so when we are in public restrooms, I find the lowest toilet seat then use this as a stepping stool for him and he can go. I'm holding on to him the entire time since his pants are down to his knees amd he can't balance well that way but it does the trick. We will be using this for the beach this summer!Another note, the storage bag that it comes in is plastic so I would recommend buying a medium wetbag (the type you use to put wet cloth diapers in) to use as a permanent storage in diaper bag instead.Great and sturdy!
B0016KV73W My 7 month old happily sits on this potty and does his business.  It fits nicely on any regular toilet making clean up a breeze - just flush!
B0016KV73W I bought this to potty train my daughter before she turned two. Because I was able to be consistent even when we were away from home, she was daytime potty trained in 3 weeks. We liked this so much that we keep one in the car at all times, ready to go, for those really inconvenient \"Potty-potty!\" calls on the road. We travel with this one also. Imagine a full restroom in Disneyland and not having to wait for a stall because you have this. If I had to wait for a stall, we would have had a mess to clean up. I just put down some paper towels on the ground in a corner of the restroom, pull out the Potette, let her sit on it to do her thing. There was some mommy-envy from moms in line for a stall. They asked me where I got it. My 21month old son is nearly daytime potty trained after two weeks. I must say that this is best for 18-24month olds because of its height. For boys especially, one has to be very careful to aim downward or a stream of urine could easily arch up & out.Buy this and you will not regret it when your little one is in big kid underwear and you can be fearless about getting to the potty \"in time\"!
B0016KV73W Once my son was potty trained in the house and we started to go on outings without pull-ups, I knew we were going to need to have an easy-access potty in the car  I actually traveled with the bijorn potty a few times (not a great idea.)  One day I saw a mom friend pull out a Potette for her daughter during a stroller workout at the park.  It was so compact and easy, I knew I had to get one.  So far it hasn't failed me (except the first time I used it without reading the instructions first and didn't \"click\" the legs in place and it collapsed as soon as my son sat on it.  Whoops...user error...)We've used this for long road trips, birthday parties hosted at parks where the bathrooms were far away or just plain filthy dirty, going on a hike, and at the beach.  It lives in our car, tucked in it's baggy, and behind a box of Kleenex.  I seriously don't know why anyone with young children wouldn't have one of these!***Seems like a lot of the negative reviews are from those who failed to lock the legs into the seat.  This takes a little finesse:  You need quite a bit of pressure to pop the legs in, and just the right amount of pressure to \"unlock\" and fold back in.  If you pull too hard, the legs just come detached. Best advice is to practice set-up and take-down a few times before needing to use it.***
B0016KV73W You can't beat the price for this Use-it-anywhere product!  Seriously... I am a first-time and one-time Mom to a beautiful little girl.  I also get squeamish/freaked-out with the thought of her using public bathrooms and the porta-john at the local park.  I'm not a full fledged germaphobe, but the thought of her sitting and holding onto these toilets is beyond gross!This product can be used as a potty seat over any toilet we've encountered AND... here's the best part:  this potty seat can also stand alone and be used as a portable potty chair with a fantastic bag-insert with a biodegradable gel pack to absorb urine.  I've used this for sudden announcements from the back seat declaring, &#34;I gotta make potty right now Mommy!&#34;  We pulled off the highway and found a safe spot to park the car (an office park with lots of trees and a few sparsely parked cars), I assembled the potty chair within seconds and Her Nibs was doing her &#34;business&#34; with comfort and a bit of pride (early in potty training).  We've used it as a stand alone, at the park, and the beach.  just set it up and sit her down... a little blanket or towel for privacy is a nice courtesy for everyone involved as well.  When she's finished we do a quick wipe, up with the pull-up, and I simply tie the bag handles in a knot and toss in the trash.  It's that easy.  I am now going to give this potty seat as a baby shower gift in the future (there are neutral colors).BOTTOM LINE:  Best value for the multiple-setting-use and money.  Super Easy to use.  Sturdy and Safe.  Portable:  fits in my back pack and diaper bag and comes with a plastic drawstring storage bag for hygienic storage.  A must-have item for parents and kiddos who are potty training and are on the go.
B0016KV73W I bought the Potette Plus (green seat with blue legs) at my local Babies R Us about 6 months ago.  At first, I didn't think it was that great.  My main complaint being the seat ring was far too big for a little hiney and my daughter's hiney kept falling INTO it.  Another reviewer made the comparison to it being like the rim of a toilet without the seat - fairly accurate description.  I just measured the hole and it's 6 inches wide by 7 inches long.  Compare that to the Fisher Price On the Go Potty (love that too) which has a hole measuring 4 1/2 inches wide by 6 inches long and it makes a huge difference.  I still believe the hole is much too big, especially since the potty is so low to the ground (only 4 inches tall in it's snapped together standing position!), making it a little hard for younger toddlers to position themselves correctly on it.  I am not sure how the kids in the product pictures are sitting on it with their legs out in front of them - my daughter has to straddle it.  I really believe the ring/seat of this potty could have been made a little smaller (even an inch all around would make a difference), and then it would be absolutely perfect and even easier to tote around.  So those are the only two negatives I have found with this seat.On to the good stuff.  It's small and when folded, can easily fit into a large purse or backpack, and it's lightweight enough to hang it (in a bag of some sort) over a stroller handle.  I used to keep the Fisher Price On the Go potty in my van, but now I only have this one in the van since it's so much smaller, lighter, and I can grab it and put it into a large purse for excursions.My daughter doesn't like to sit on the plastic bag that's supposed to go over the seat, so we had to figure out a way to make that work until she gets used to sitting on the plastic bag.  We cut down a 1 gallon ice cream pail so it would fit under the potty and we use the bags in the bucket, then put the potette over that.  Works great.  For now, I just keep the potty in it's standing position in the van and since it's small enough, it's no big deal.  I found that it fits in a drawstring backpack in it's standing position (even with the cut down bucket, lol), so we don't use the plastic carry bag it came with.  4 gallon trash bags work very well too.I've never used it as a toilet reducer, but I did just place it on both of my different toilet seats at home (one is molded wood, the other is plastic and picky when it comes to toilet reducers).  This seat clicks into flat position and is very sturdy.  There are little grippies on the inside of the legs to help it grab the toilet seat a little and it does help slightly.  Sturdy when on both toilet seats - even when pushed on by me.  On the molded wood seat, the potette fit very nicely, almost center on the toilet seat.  On the plastic seat, I had to push the potette back a little further for it to fit the best.  It would still wiggle a bit with a wiggly toddler.  I didn't buy it for this purpose though so I don't anticipate using it in this position, though it is nice to have the option.
B0016KV73W If you want to go anywhere for more than 30 minutes when potty training, you need something like this.  The things I didn't like about this particular device:  it is too low to the ground and the seat is small, the feet don't stay put unless you snap them in which isn't easy to do (my daughter tipped over twice before I realized how to do it), it requires buying refill bags, I'm not sure we're inserting the bags correctly, and it isn't clear which direction the kids should sit.  While small, it is too big for our older model Valco stroller basket so we have to hang it from the handlebar.  I may try another kind of travel potty, but until then we'll continue to take this on walks and in the car.  It gets the job done.
B0016KV73W We were somewhat nervous about how to go about a day with our toddler, as we are on the go quite a bit in busy New York City.This has made the transition to diaper free so easy, especially as I have a phobia of public toilets. I use it with regular plastic bags (the type you get at grocery stores) and it works well.  Folds easily, and we've used it both for travel and on the go. Well made.
B0016KV73W While potty training is one of the least enjoyable experiences of toddlerdom, this potty is a great addition to the process.  We purchased 3 different ones and she uses this one the most.  We use it at home on our regular toilet with a step stool and when we travel.  It's sturdy, light, and obvious portable and works really well.  Out little almost always chooses this one over the other two we have.
B0016KV73W **Edit. I lost it in a public bathroom and I'm more heartbroken than I should be. I loved this toilet. It made life easy. Mess free.I went and purchased some... crappy kushie folding toilet seat cover and... I hate it. It's nothing like this one.I know it's just a potty, but I really miss it.I think it only adds to my review that I miss this thing so much. It fit 99.9% of every toilet I ran into, minus one that it was a tad too big for.. but the rubber grips still held it on there.There isn't another potty out there like this one and the sooner I get a replacement [it's been two months. -sigh.-] The better.-SIIIGH.-**I didn't buy mine from Amazon because I was too cheap to pay shipping so I found mine on Craigslist instead. Why these parents didn't like this seat I have NO clue!! It's amazing. I bought 10 bags from an ebay seller for 9 bucks thinking I was buying the potty seat before I found it on Craigslist. Got an e-mail a few days later saying they'd accidentally sent me 90. Oh no, what is a girl to do? Now I have a ton of lined bags which is GREAT for when we're out. Parks, deserted parts of the mall if we're a long walk away from a bathroom. I just love it. I threaten my mum and my son's father about ever losing it and what I'll do to both of them if either of them leaves it somewhere. x3 so far they've been very careful.I would recommend this for any parent who's starting their child on the road to potty training young. The bonuses of this seat are;1. It folds up VERY small. Perfect for in the stroller or over night bag.2. It assembles very, very quickly. Even when getting the bag on which can be a bit loud/annoying to do depending on where you are or what time it is. [3am, I don't want to hear a crinkley bag and taking my son to the regular toilet wakes him up too much. I'll be buying a potty special for my bedroom quickly. One that doesn't depend on bags to be a free standing potty]3. Great for younger children just starting to potty train. The hole itself iiiis a bit small, I admit. Nothing to little for my 1.5 year old. I started him on the potty at 14 months and found I was never making it to the bathroom in time when we were out. This has helped me calm down and know that even if I can't find a bathroom I can pull this baby out, pop a bag in and not need to worry about changing a diaper.=D \"this is definately a buy.\" - Fruit Gushers review kid.
B0016KV73W This thing is AMAZING. We literally use it every day when we are out. we use it at restaurants, parks, the back of my car.. EVERYWHERE. Highly recommend.
B0016KV73W We have only had this little potty for a short while, and it has been a lifesaver, and so easy to use. You DO have to push the legs up into the seat until it clicks when you have it in \"seat\" position, not seat-topper position, to get it to be sturdy. There are no instructions on the package, so other reviews are the only reason I know this. Once set up, it is very stable, although short. But the shortness is what makes it so compact and easy to travel with, which is just fine with me. Of course, the ring is small, but I have a 2 year old the size of a three year old and she fits great. The vinyl bag it comes in it very handy to keep it contained when not in use. Some people have said they throw in in their purse, but it really is way too big to fit in a normal-sized diaper bag if you want anything else to fit in there. The vinyl bag is large enough to leave extra bags and wipes in there. The potty fits regular sized grocery sacks, so you can just put one of those on with a paper towel in the bottom and save a ton of money on the overpriced refills. I love this little potty- don't hesitate to buy it if you are on the fence about it!!
B0016KZZG2 After months of dry carpet and adventures in the car, I am finally able to rate this product.  It fits our Nestl&eacute; waters and other bottles along the way.  My rough and tumble boy has only stepped on it once to squirt the water, and in all other cases it has not leaked and gave me peace of mind not using the water fountain. No more water logged shirts and scrambles for a clean cup while in public.  I really like this product.  Please note your child will make teeth marks on the nozzle.  My only complaint is that there are 2 nozzles but only one top (as the picture shows).  Why not provide a top for each nozzle?  We make it work though, and it was still worth it.
B0016KZZG2 This item works great, doesn't leak, semi-hard-to-clean, but still ok. The only real problem I have with this is not the product itself, its the fact that my son LOVES to squeeze the water bottle so the water spouts out way up in the air and then all over everything. If your child doesn't do that, I'd say yes, buy it. But beware the squeezer!! Not a good fit with that one! :)
B0016KZZG2 I bought these spouts based on great reviews but got extremely disappointed when I start using them. They leak badly may be because a lot of water bottles were changed for the past year or so. I wish I got other toppers instead.
B0016KZZG2 We purchased this spout for our 2 year old and are wishing we would have purchased it earlier.Pros:- Non leak spout- 2 year old can use it easilyCons:- larger than expected, but doesn't harm its effectiveness.
B0016KZZG2 Works as described!  And it does create a kind of vacuum so the bottle will collapse as you drink, but still-- just pop the cap off and back on again and that solves that problem.
B0016KZZG2 This is a good spill proof top as long as the one using it doesn't squeeze the bottle. It does leak if the bottle is squeezed. I wouldn't recommend for use with anything but water, because water doesn't stain.
B0016KZZG2 Air gets trapped and the bottle caves in. Would not recommend these. Good concept but doesn't really work well.  Waste of money.
B0016KZZG2 These are great for babies and toddlers. My twins love water. So I send them to preschool with mini water bottles & these lids. (plus my one year old can use them too) The teachers send them home with the twins at the end of the day. All my friends love them when they come to visit because their kids won't make a mess in the house when running around with their drink. I would suggest it to anyone.
B0016LVB4Q So worth the buy - super soft, great quality and washes well... get two so you always have one on hand! Again 'Carters rocks'!
B0016LVB4Q Nothing wrong with the product itself, but after purchasing and using for a couple weeks with my newborn, I realized that changing pad covers are NOT worth the trouble (and someone please tell me why I thought brown would be an appropriate color... It hides the poo?). After throwing one away because it simply wasn't salvageable, the second one was neatly folded in a closet where, 10 months later, it remains.
B0016LVB4Q Durable cover--it's held up well with multiple washings so far (3 months) and stains come out well (using Bac-Out and sometimes OxiClean). Currently using it over an IKEA blow-up changing pad, so it's a generous fit; but it fits our other change pad. The cute \"bumps\" on the fabric are going away on the area that gets the most wear--the side where my baby's bottom/back lay while changing--which is disappointing. Doesn't look as nice now, so I give it only 4 stars.
B0016LVB4Q So So So SOFT!!! Love this item so much, i purchased another one! Great quality and my little boy seems to like the softness.
B0016LVB4Q I absolutely love this changing pad cover. It is very, very soft and fit very well and brown is a really good choice for obvious reasons :) It is really cozy and comfortable. I would recommend getting two (in brown) so that you always have one ready while the other is being washed. Definitely worth the money.
B0016LVB4Q I really like this changing pad cover. its very soft and is easy to get on and off the changing pad. only problem is that sometimes while changing my daughter she likes to pee and this doesn't absorb any moisture and it runs off onto the floor.
B0016LVB4Q I bought this for my son's changing pad.  We had some ugly yellow ones we got at a consignment sale so I was ready to get something that went with his decor a little bit more.This is perfect!  It washes up soft and didn't come apart.  The bumps give texture for him to feel while I am changing him.  You really can't go wrong with this cover!
B0016LVB4Q I love how soft this is! The color is great, the bumps really aren't a problem and it is easy to put on and take off.
B0016LVB4Q I love these covers so much that I bought 3 of them - they will get spit up on and peed on so be sure to have at least 1 extra to put on when the other is being washed. I got 3 for this purpose. They are SO soft and add a great touch of texture and color to the room.
B0016LVB4Q So there's really not a lot to say about this pad cover. It's very soft and seems to be well made. We've washed it a couple times now and it's holding up well.I guess the only thing I worry about is that it's a really nice cover for a place we're changing diapers. While we've only had one accident on it so far it does seem likely to get ruined pretty easily and quickly. Especially since our daughter loves to squirm while having her diaper changed and the pad belt doesn't really do the trick when it comes to holding her still. It just keeps her from sitting up.To top it off when we took the cover off to wash it she really didn't seem to notice the difference, which made me think that the cover is more of a novelty than a necessity.I will say that it is really soft and snuggly. If she notices the difference at all (or cares) then it is a nice cover.My wife did point out that without the cover when she did have her accident the changing pad is water resistant so it would've gone everywhere and run off the pad. But since the cover soaked it up... disaster averted.That said I think it was a pretty good buy but I think a regular cotton cover would've been just as effective.As I mentioned, it's a bit over the top but it is nice.UPDATESo it's been awhile since we got this and as I mentioned my biggest concern was it getting ruined.Well it's still in great condition. It's been drawn on with some markers and we've had some accidents, it's been washed more times than I can count and it is still soft and white.We use charlies soap which is pretty gentle on clothes to begin with so that may be part of it but I have to admit I'm pretty impressed with the cover.It's comfortable and durable. The same can be said for most all the Carters brand stuff we've bought for my daughter.
B0016LVB4Q love this changing pad cover. decided to buy the carters brand after purchasing a major retail store brand cover, which was not soft at all. carters is the best for all things baby. love it, baby loves it too. its not rough on her skin, for when she rolls to the side as i change her. i would def. recommend , and would guy again.
B0016LVB4Q We've been using this pad (in Ecru) for nearly a year and it's held up really well. It's soft and the ecru is a nice color that seems to wash pretty well. I always keep it covered with one of theseCarters Keep Me Dry Flannel Bassinet Pad, Ecrupads on top of it. Makes messes very easy to clean up. I also got a similar BOPPY cover in sage. I prefer the Carter's Ecru one though.
B0016LVB4Q This is the best diaper changing cover.  They wash up great as well.  I actually use them over the mini co-sleeper as well - they fit it perfectly.
B0016LVB4Q Changing pad cover is great.  We have 2 so we can wash one and have one on the changing pad.
B0016LVB4Q Love the softness of this cover. Nothing much else to say since it's all in the description, but I'd definitely buy again. And of course I'd buy at amazon a million times over babies-r-us; they are such a rip off. Free shipping with prime and no tax with amazon, you can't beat that!Also, fits mySimmons Kids Contour Dressing Table Pad with Non-Skid Bottomand any other standard changing pad. Just don't buy that changing pad for the non-skid (because there is no non skid!!!!)
B0016LVB4Q I love how soft this changing pad is!  It also holds up well to multiple washings and dryings.  It's very pretty addition to my nursery.
B0016LVB4Q Love the mute color and dots! Super soft and it is going to look great with my crib bedding, neutral and pristine.
B0016LVB4Q The green color is very pretty. Sort of a silvery green. Gender neutral.  The material is soft and silky.  I Love it!! Have washed it 3-4 times with no issues at all. Fits both of my changing pads (standard ones) perfectly.  If it were a bit less expensive I'd buy 5 of them in all different colors!
B0016LVB4Q This fits well over the Summer Infant Contoured Changing Pad that we ordered, and is really nice and soft without being too plush. I haven't washed it a lot, but seems like the quality will hold up through multiple washings. The color was a nice neutral, not too pink or yellow as some Ecrus tend to get. Good product for the price.
B0016LVB4Q We have this in fuschia too.  It's so soft, really nice to put your baby on.  The chocolate is a deep, rich color which has not faded with washing (I was this in cold with our dark clothes).  It looks nice and serves its function.  I'd love one in lime green, Carter's {:-)
B0016LVB4Q So soft and fits the changing pad well, even has cut outs for the changing pad straps. Only wish I would have got more than one.
B0016LVB4Q This changing pad cover is super soft and super cute! I washed the pad cover and kept its softness and fits my chaning pad cover great. I love the light pink color. I would def. order more covers from Carters.
B0016LVB4Q Another quality product from Carter's. These hold up well in the wash, and are super soft. They fit all standard changing pads very well. I would also suggest using a changing pad liner over this cover - so if your baby has a blow-out you are cleaning up, you don't have to change this cover every time!
B0016LVB4Q This changing pad cover is super soft and washes really well.  We have three of these and wash them all the time and after 9 months they still look new and actually seem even softer (and they were soft to begin with).  We have it in off white.
B0016LVB4Q This is the best changing pad ever. It is super soft and durable. Easy to wash and holds up great. Haven't had any problems with it so far.
B0016LVB4Q great quality, great color.  no complaints on this one!  I like the velour type covers for changing table over other stuff.
B0016LVB4Q I really like this changing pad cover; it fits perfectly and snugly, it looks nice, and it is really, really soft (and it's brown, so it does hide stains.  Unfortunately, I would also say that this is one of the least useful baby-related purchases I made - I never use it.  I did use it at first, but it got pooped and peed on constantly and I quickly realized that it was stupid to cover up the plastic, wipe-able changing pad with something I needed to wash every time.
B0016LVB4Q This fit our summer infant changing pad. Very soft cover and easy to put on and take off. Looks sharp in our nursery with the soft dots.
B0016LVB4Q This showed up exactly as I expected and as pictured.  It is soft and durable.  I would definitely reccomend this item to other moms.
B0016LVB4Q Very happy with the cover! It looks great in the room and it is just so darn soft!
B0016LVB4Q This changing pad cover is soft, durable, and fits the changing pad great! If it's anything like Carter's sheets, it's going to hold up for a LONG time as well! Great product. Very happy!
B0016LVB4Q I have no complaints about this cover. It fits well and is soft. There is really nothing special about it. I might like it better if it didn't get soaked so easily.
B0016LVB4Q Its great, baby loves it, contoured sides give secure feeling to squirmy baby. Fits LA Baby 4 sided changing pad 32&#34;. I bought &#34;pink&#34; ;-)
B0016LVB4Q I am pleasantly suprised by this purchase.  The cover is very soft for the baby and (possibly more important) not cheesy looking like many others I've seen.  It blends right in with our decor.
B0016LVB4Q I agree with the other reviewers:  this is a superb cover in terms of softness, fit, quality, etc.  However, if you are on the fence about what kind of changing pad cover to get, hold off.  Ours spends more time in the washing machine because of spit up and other wonders of baby changing, so we end up using receiving blankets and cloth diapers over our changing pad a lot of the time.  If you have the money, get two.  If you would rather save some money, this is one of those items that you can scratch off of your list.  I love this particular cover, just not the impracticality of covers in general.
B0016LVB4Q Super SoftEasy to care forDoesn't shrinkNice Calm sage color (goes well in our nursery)Hasn't changed over time and I've washed mine enough timesI only bought one and it's been fine.
B0016LVB4Q I purchased this cover in Chocolate for a Serta changing pad. It is so soft, my baby loves to be put down on it. She gets all smiley and just loves the feeling. The elasticized edges fit the Serta pad perfectly. I decided to buy a back up cover in Sage and was very pleased at how the cover didn't stain. I was afraid with a lighter color that spit up and accidents might leave stains but my worries were unfounded. Great cover, I'll probably buy another soon!
B0016LVB4Q This changing pad cover is so ridiculously soft, I love it!!!  The chocolate color looks slightly washed out, but I love the way it feels!!!  I am definitely buying a couple more to keep on hand so that I will always have a clean one handy, but decided to go with the baby blue color.  I am thinking that my espresso colored baby furniture may have something to do with my not liking the chocolate color. . . it's all too dark.  I know baby will be so comfy during his diaper changes.  Also fits our infant summer contoured changing pad perfectly.  Couldn't be happier with this product.
B0016LVB4Q We couldn't ask for anything softer. This is an excellent changing pad cover and it holds up very well wash after wash.
B0016LVB4Q I have had these covers for over a year, and I still love them.Pros:They are soft.They match the jungle theme in my baby's nurseryThey do not show a single stain after over a year of useThey wash and dry very well. No pilling and still very soft.They are affordable.Cons:They are not organic.Overall, I am super pleased with this purchase and it is one of the few items I bought for the nursery I would buy again.
B0016LVB4Q This is the perfect changing pad cover. It washes well and is super soft for my babies skin. The cover does not fit too tight so it is easy to take off and put back on my changing pad. Plus the brown color matches my son's room perfectly. Would change nothing about this product.
B0016LVB4Q I bought this cover to use with the  Summer Infant Contoured Changing Pad, also purchased on Amazon.  I was very impressed with both products being decent value and high quality.  This is the softest material changing pad and is soo adorable to add to our nursery.  Glad I found this!
B0016LVB4Q This changing pad cover is super soft and cleans up well.  I recommend getting waterproof lap pads to put under baby's bottom otherwise you may be washing the cover more than you want (especially with newborns who will often continue their diaper destruction with the diaper off!).  We also have the Ecru and are pleased with both colors.  Would buy again.
B0016LVB4Q We have this changing pad cover in 3 colors. It is very soft, and holds up well in the wash: messes come out without special treatment, and after 3 months of being laundered several times a week is still as soft as the first day we used it. It fits our changing pad well, has elastic all the way around (not just the corners), and has slots for the changing pad's safety harness.
B0016LVB4Q I love this changing table cover, it is so soft and comfortable. It has been washed numerous times already and still looks great. It stretches perfectly to fit over the pad and stays snug enough to not move excessively. The color is great too since it doesn't show stains like light colors.
B0016LVB4Q This changing pad cover is so soft, I'm sure my baby will love snuggling into it.  Can't wait for him to use it.
B0016LVB4Q We purchased this to cover the Summer Infant changing pad. It fit perfectly, super soft, easy to wash and still in great shape a year and a half later.
B0016LVB4Q It is a perfect fit, just like people were saying in the other reviews. I actually ordered two so we have an extra.
B0016LVB4Q This changing pad cover is so soft and fits the changing pad perfectly!  I would definitely recommend this product.  I might order an extra one for when this one is being washed.
B0016LVB4Q I love the fabric and how soft it feels, just right for a baby. I haven't had my baby yet so I don't know how will it turn out to be after several washes, although my mom just washed it for the first use and nothing happened to the fabric yet. Hope its a good buy so that I can buy more of these things in future. I think amazon has the best price too, so thanks :)
B0016LVB4Q We used this to cover our summer infant bassinet pad, that we use in our Graco mini pack and play.  These sheets fit perfectly.  We also use them in rotation on our changed pad on the changing table.
B0016LVB4Q Love it! Super soft, looks great and fits changing pad perfectly! I washed it many times on hot/cold and the color seems to hold.
B0016LVB4Q Love these changing pad covers! I had one of these, and one of another brand. I liked this one so much, I went and bought a second, and discarded the other one I had. They're cute, soft, and have held up great so far. We have a contour pad with 3 raised sides, and they fit perfectly. My son is 10 months old, and we've used these covers since birth.
B0016LVB4Q I love the super soft fabric. We use this withLA Baby 4 Sided Changing Pad 32\", Whiteand it fits perfect!
B0016LVB4Q These changing pads are exactly as described.  They are super soft, and wick away moisture easily. I also like the ecru color as it blends easily with any decor.
B0016LVB4Q As it says this product is very soft.  Went on very easily and looks great in the nursery, happy with my purchase.
B0016LVB4Q We've used this cover 6 1/2 months.  So glad we spent the extra few dollars for this nicer-looking cover.  It's color looks like the picture, it's durable--have washed it half a dozen times.  We use a waterproof pad liner on top of it, but it seems it would hold up well regardless.  We have the Diaper Genie changing pad and its wide straps do not fit through the strap holes in this cover.  Also, the holes are so near the cover's edge that the holes are underneath the pad.  And the Diaper Genie straps come out the side of the pad.  So we just ended up not using the holes.  Eventually I'll get around to sewing a new hole where it should be for our pad.
B0016LVB4Q Love this cover...so I bought two more to keep on hand.  It is so soft and fits my pad nicely.  Highly recommend, especially ove regular cotton covers.
B0016LVB4Q This is so soft it is so nice for my baby. It is always warm which is great for the baby. Washes great, washed mine at least 10 times and still looks brand new. Love the color, doesnt show any stains inbetween washes.
B0016LVB4Q Nice changing pad, super soft!  Well, I can tell you with 100% accuracy that this washes very well and it is still super-soft even after all these washings.  Fits well on the changing pad and easy to put on/take off. Glad we have some of these!
B0016LVB4Q These are very soft and durable and fit my contoured changing pad perfectly (I thought all covers would, but that's not true - I bought another one from a big name store that did not work at all!). Unfortunately, I haven't used mine a great deal - my little one likes to mess all over the changing pad the minute we take her diaper off and I got tired of washing the covers all the time! Lol! But when she gets a little bigger and a little more predictable, they will definitely go back on...
B0016LVB4Q We love love this! super soft, easy to wash & come on brown is perfect. Bought 2 but I think I'm going to get a third
B0016LVB4Q This is a great changing pad cover. It's incredibly soft and washes really well. I have bought a lot of Carter's velour stuff and have been happy every time with it! Their velour crib sheets are also amazing.
B0016LVB4Q We are pleased with this product, though it is quite expensive, if I must say so. I think it's going to work out nicely with our changing pad. We got a large, 4-sided changing pad, and it fits pretty well. I mean, it doesn't hug it like a glove, but we are okay with that. It is going to provide the function that it was designed for quite nicely. I would probably not recommend this for smaller changing pads, as it may be too loose on them. I can see a baby grabbing on and pulling it right off in the middle of a changing, which might spell a messy disaster...
B0016LVB4Q This is sooo soft! And it's adorable, washable, and comfy. I highly recommend to anyone to buy this product. It is wonderful
B0016LVB4Q THe cover is soft, easy to clean and has lasted two years and is still going strong with baby number two!
B0016LVB4Q This is a must have (in any color) for a baby nursery.  These covers are soft and comfortable and they hold up to lots of washes!
B0016LVB4Q We own two of this changing pad cover in the \"chocolate\" color.  (My goal was to always have one clean, in case the other got dirty during a changing.)  They are incredibly soft.Despite dozens of washings, they look pretty much new.  No fading, no thinning of the material.Highly recommended.
B0016LVB4Q Super soft and cute!! Seems very durable and color is true to description. I was concerned about it not conforming to the changing pad I have as  it has raised edges but no issues.
B0016LVB4Q These changing pad covers are wonderful.  I currently have two changing pads,Summer Infant 4-Sided Changing PadandSummer Infant Contoured Changing Pad.  This cover fits both perfectly.Before I purchased these, my baby hated to have her diaper changed.  She never complained about having her diaper changed again after I started using the Carters' Super Soft Dot Changing Pad Cover.They are amazingly soft and have not been damaged by the washing machine (on gentle cycle) or the dryer.  I would recommend these changing pad covers to anyone.
B0016LVB4Q Love this, own it in a variety of colors. These are SO soft, look great in the nurery, and still look and feel wonderful after many washes. They fit my long changing pad quite nicely. You can find cheaper pads, but to me this is worth the price, I feel it is very comfortable for my baby and it's holding up nicely.
B0016LVB4Q This comes exactly as shown a bright brown and super soft to the touch. My 4 month old loves to run his hands along the &#34;bumps&#34; in the material!
B0016LVB4Q This changing pad cover fits securely and is very soft. Perfect for the babies room. Very delicate to the touch.
B0016LVB4Q This has held up well over the last year. Washed tons of times and still as soft and cute as ever!
B0016LVB4Q This changing pad cover is fantastic.  It is so soft and feels great to the touch while the raised dots give it just the right amount of texture.  Baby is sure to love it! The pink is a beautiful color that is sure to complement the decor of just about any girl's room.
B0016LVB4Q This cover is great. it is soft and plush. it goes great with the colors of our nursery. its chocolate color that you see in the picture is true to the color that it really is. you should always have 2 covers and i would order two of this cover in a heartbeat.
B0016LVB4Q We love this changing pad cover. We got 2. It is so plush and comfy for baby. Very soft and makes the room look nice. Looks much more expensive than others on the market. I have zero complaints and would absolutely buy this again. I've washed it over and over the last 5 months and no signs of wear.
B0016LVB4Q The pink cover was very close to the color pictured. I has remained baby soft even after repeated washing and air drying. I also purchased the same cover in off white at a local store and they both are holding up extremely well. Extremely pleased with this product!
B0016LVB4Q This changing pad cover is super soft and the size is perfect for fitting over a 16\" x 32\" pad.  Great to have an extra on hand for when one is being washed.
B0016LVB4Q i will not return because its a bit of a hassle, this looks nice its a very pale pink!the fabric feels a bit thin, not sure how long it will last...worth the money tho if u don't want to spend a whole lot
B0016LVB4Q Fits over my summer infant changing pad perfectly even after multiple washes & drys in hot.  It's very soft and the dots add a nice texture.  The brown is a rich deep color.  Looks great with my espresso crib!
B0016LVB4Q We have 3 of these in different colors/styles.  Like some other reviewers, we also use the keep-me-dry lap pads on top of the changing cover to catch accidents.  Have washed these many times and they still look great - very easy to care for and a reasonable price.  They are also super, super soft, which we love for our Little One.
B0016LVB4Q Doesn't soak through, cleans up well, still looks great & fits great even after a handfull of accidents and washes.  Plus it's cute.
B0016LVB4Q Very soft and comfy, better than others out there- buy several as tehy get dirty frequently! a must have for baby
B0016LVB4Q This changing cover is the perfect shade of pale pink for our nursery. I really didn't want anything too bright as we've used all pastel colors. It seems very soft and fits our old changing pad from pottery barn kids. Will be ordering a couple more to have back ups.
B0016LVB4Q My daughter really likes this changing cover. It is soft and warm for her many diaper changes. It washes nicely and doesn't require any special instructions. I think I am going to get it in another color too.
B0016LVB4Q I had hoped that this cover would be nice, and I am not let down. Very soft, and it fits the changing pad mattress perfectly. Thank you!Edit: I ordered the Graco Travel Lite Crib (more like a cross between a small pack n play & bassinet though) for our baby & someone suggested using this Super Soft Dot Cover to cover the Summer Infant Bassinet Pad that I got to go inside it. I was not let down! It not only fits the pad perfectly, it is so super soft against baby's skin too! I love it so much that I ordered another one to switch them out when one is being washed. I now own the chocolate, ecru, and sage colored ones, and am contemplating getting the pink one too. These are so perfect for both changing table pad cover & bassinet pad cover alike!!!!! All of the above mentioned can be found here on Amazon.
B0016LVB4Q My baby loves laying on his changing pad, even when not being changed because this is so soft and comfy! It fits our changing pad just right (elastic around the whole bottom). The color is nice and neutral, but just make sure to wash it with like colors or it will slightly change colors.
B0016LVB4Q I love the \"minky\" fabric that this changing cover is made with. It is super soft, a great soft pink color, and it washes well. I even put it in the dryer and it didn't shrink or change the fabric at all. Very nice cover for the price.
B0016LVB4Q We have 1 sage & 1 pink cover that we've been using for a little over 13 months and they are still in PERFECT condition.We have twin girls which means twice the diaper changes which means twice the chance of these getting soiled & needing washed. Especially when they were newborns they liked to pee all over once we got their diapers off. These have been washed a TON of times, both on delicate & regular cycle & then on regular in the dryer and they show no signs of wear, still look like new, still have the raised dots and are still super soft! They also slip easily over our changing pad.If you have twins or more, I definately recommend getting at least 2 of these, maybe more. Also, you can get the mini water resistant pads(quite a few) and put that under babys bottom when you change them...then if they pee or if they're being really honery and poo, you just have to change the soiled pad & not this cover. You can also buy the water resistant pads meant for a crib and cut them small enough to use for the changing pad.
B0016LVB4Q Soft.  Nice color.  Fits great.  The dots are dots.  Nothing special about them.  What else can I say, it works.
B0016LVB4Q All of my Carter's textiles have done the same exact thing within a year's time.  The elastic gives out.  This changing pad cover does not even have the slightest bit of stretch left, so I have to tuck it under the pad, and it comes off all the time.  I do not wash them abnormally frequently--only when very soiled, with is not often.  I think it averages out to washing each cover once every 6 weeks.I really cannot understand how this gets a 5-star rating.  I would give it 0 stars if I could.  And since I have multiple other Carter bedding items and they have all done the same thing, I know I don't have a \"fluke.\"  My other branded textiles have not done this, as they are still stretchy after 3 years of continual use.Invest in higher quality if you need it to last over a year.  I know this is the only negative review so far, but please know that I am being as honest and accurate as I can.
B0016LVB4Q Love it!  This changing pad cover is so soft and plush feeling.  I have had this for several months now and it has not shrunk and still looks new.  I have espresso finish for the crib set in my babies room and this matches with the furniture so well.  Highly recommend!
B0016LVB4Q Nice color, soft sheets, appears to be a quality product. However, took forever to receive. Got these to match Carson's chocolate velour crib sheets, and its a perfect match.
B0016LVB4Q True color (it's a pale sage green).  Very soft and fit the standard changing pad perfect.  We are very happy with the purchase.
B0016LVB4Q This is a soft cover and I love the texture. It washes well and I dryed on low to avoid shrinkage.
B0016LVB4Q This changing pad cover is super soft!  It's comfortable for the baby and is nice looking.  This pad holds up extremely well in the washing machine.  The material seems to be of high quality and like it will last for some time.  I will say if you get some stains on it get to them quickly because they will set into this pad.
B0016LVB4Q Very soft and fits my changing pad perfectly.  This changing pad also washes well without shrinkage or pilling of fabric.
B0016LVB4Q I bought this to match the crib bumpers. Just like the bumper the fabric is super soft. I do not have a contoured changing pad but rather a flat one and this fits perfectly.
B0016LVB4Q I love these!  I bought two (one for the changing station, and one for her bassinet) They're soft and easy to wash.
B0016LVB4Q Great changing pad cover. It is super soft, easy to wash, pretty, and durable. There is nothing more you can really want from a cover. It has holdes for the straps, which we don't use, but they are there if you need them.My baby loves the texture on them and likes to run her hands over the little soft bumps as I change her. Good to have something else distract her so I have an extra few seconds for the diapers change.Most importantly, it has lasted many many many washes.There are plenty of colors. We have sage and pink and like them both (good tones, not too bright, match with everything we have).
B0016LVB4Q Pros:-Soft... in fact, still as soft as the day we opened it and it has been through the washer/dryer 8 times now!-It does not hold a stain! We bought this in the Ecru, and it has been covered in bright yellow baby poop about 4 times now, and each time it comes out of the washer as clean and stain-less as can be! I was sure we ruined it after the first \"explosive baby poop\" fiasco, but it does not have a SINGLE stain on it.-It still looks brand new and like I said, it has been through the wash 8 times! Normally fuzzy fabrics like this don't hold up in the washer/dryer.
B0016LVB4Q Really like this pad cover for the following reasons:- it's soft and baby likes it- it's easy to wash- lasted for 3+ yrs and 2 kids and it looks/feels exactly the same; also does not shrinkgood buy.
B0016LVB4Q It fits the changing pad well, has slits for the safety straps, and cleans up easily in the washing machine.  No weird smells or itchy bits.
B0016LVB4Q Love the feel of this. Much better than the rough terry fabric seen on most changing pad covers. My baby notices the difference.
B0016LVB4Q this is so soft and they make crib sheets in the same fabric and its so soft. best cover i've found yet.
B0016LVB4Q I love this changing pad it's sooooo soft and comfy. My baby is very comfortable resting when I'm changing her diaper. Would recommend this product especially for winter. I order several because they can be used as bassinet sheets!!!!
B0016LVB4Q Love love love this! I need to buy more so when I wash this one I have another to replace it (hello blowouts). So soft be my baby loves laying on her changer. If I left her there all day I'm sure she'd love it. Ha!
B0016LVB4Q I really like this cover, wish I could buy sheets for the crib just as this one. It looks and feels great.
B0016LVB4Q The fabric is very soft, and I haven't had a problem getting stains out of it. I had bought a rather large changing pad and was afraid this wouldn't fit, but in fact it fits quite well. The photo of the sage color is a little misleading; I would describe it as more of a forest-y green.
B0016LVB4Q These are so wonderfully soft and easy to put on and take off because lord knows you will wash it elevnty billion times before its all said and done.  We liked it so much we bought the same one when we bought another diaper change station.
B0016LVB4Q This cover has worked really well on our changing pad. It's ultra soft (our cat likes to use it as a napping spot) and it soaks up leaks quickly without letting them get all over everything. It also has held up well so far to our washing machine (we've used it for about a month). Plus, the chocolate color is great and the raised dots are cute. It goes on and off our changing pad with ease, and stays on well. I recommend having two pad covers so that you can wash one cover and still have another one to use.
B0016LVB4Q The fabric color and texture is great. Fits my changing table pad perfectly and is easy to remove to clean!
B0016LVB4Q This cover is just what I was looking for, attractive and soft. I would have given it 5 stars, but I have not had it very long and I have no idea how durable it is. So far, so good!
B0016LVB4Q this is not only soft and beautiful but it washes well and holds up well over time.  My baby is now 6 months old and the covers all still look brand new after 6 months of washing and drying
B0016LVB4Q For my first son I only used the terrycloth covers, but decided to try this out for my second son: I love them!  They looks nice after being washed (on hot) and after going through the dryer (on medium heat) and they fit my 4-sided changing pad very well.  Will buy more of these for sure!
B0016LVB4Q This changing pad is super soft but it stained so easily! Every time it got a little bit of diaper cream on it, the spot of diaper cream turned gray in the wash. After a few months it looked so terrible that I threw it out. I bought a yellow one and the same thing happened. My son is 10 months old and very squirmy so it's nearly impossible to prevent diaper cream from getting on the changing pad. I have 2 terry cloth changing pad covers (1 white, 1 blue) that do not get the same gray stains. I definitely recommend terry cloth over this material.ProsGood Size And FitNice PatternSoftConsStains Easily
B0016LVB4Q I did not think I was going to like this and only bought it because it was recommended to go with the changing pad I bought. But I was pleasantly surprised at how soft it is. Looks good and feels well made. Have not washed it as yet but I hope the color does not fade.
B0016LVB4Q I love these- soft, well made, pretty sage color.  I bought two with our first child.  Bought a third with our second.  Two would probably do, as I use the changing table less- and the living room floor more!  But, don't mind, as these are great.  Durable, too, with all the washing, and will be able to pass long to my sister when she has kids.
B0016LVB4Q I own three of these since I'm constantly changing them out. They're very soft and fit my changing pad great. I wish that they had a better selection of colors though.
B0016LVB4Q Easy to wash, and super fluffy. Our 2 month old loves it! I would strongly recommend to anyone in search of a new changing pad cover.
B0016LVB4Q Super soft and has a nice snug fit over the changing pad. If this is your first child, make sure you have three changing pad covers. We started with two, but I quickly found that three made things easier and I didn't feel like I was always having to do a load of laundry because the changing pad covers were dirty.
B0016LVB4Q This changing pad cover is SUPER soft and fits perfectly on my changing pad (Summer Infant Contoured Changing Pad). It even has slits so the buckles can come through. I've used it for a year and washed several times and have had no problems. This is a great quality pad.
B0016LVB4Q I was mostly worried about this shedding in the wash. So far, it has held up amazingly well, even washing in hot water with diapers. When I worked in a daycare, we just used a bare changing pad, and wiped down after every change. While that works in an institutional setting, I wanted something a little cozier for my own baby. This is super soft and works in cold and warm temperature to keep baby comfortable on the changing pad. We do a lot on our changing table besides just diaper changes. Giving vitamins, cleaning ears and nose, washing hands and face, singing songs, learning about body parts, even baby massage. The changing table is a bonding place for me and my baby. So it's worth it to me to have such a nice surface for baby to lay on. On the practical side, it does a decent job of repelling minor &#34;spills&#34; so in the event of an accident, I can get baby off the table and pull the cover off before anything undesirable soaks through to the pad, giving me a bigger mess to clean up. The cover goes right in the laundry, a quick wipedown of the pad, and I'm ready to put a new cover on. In fact, I bought two, so my changing pad never goes &#34;naked&#34; while one is in the wash.
B0016LVB4Q I love this changing pad cover. It's soft and cozy so my daughter doesn't mind lying on it while I change her. It's easy to wash and has held up nicely for me so far.
B0016LVB4Q This is such a soft changing pad cover. I love minky anything and this is no different. It matches the nursery decor perfectly
B0016LVB4Q This was a great product at a great price. I like how it is less bulky than the fleece ones sold at Target so it is easy to store. It is soft and has held up well in the 7 months we've used it.
B0016LVB4Q This is a very nice changing pad cover. It's soft, pretty colored, and thick and luxurious feeling. My only word of advice is to check out the harder-to-find on Amazon Carter's giraffe printed one before buying this one. We got both to have a spare, but really only needed one. The giraffe one is truly awesome.
B0016LVB4Q You cannot go wrong with this brand, the texture is soft, the color is perfect for a little girls room and fits all standard changing pads.
B0016LVB4Q I love this cover!  It adds some softness and warmth to the cold, plastic and waterproof changing pad.  I've washed it many times over the last year and it has held up well.  I love the little slits in the side to thread the safety belt through!  I didn't notice those until a few months ago and thought I'd mention it in case others hadn't noticed either!
B0016LVB4Q The material on this changing pad is SOFT. We've only been using it for a short time but it gets washed frequently. There has been no degradation after all the times it's been through the washer and dryer. I'd highly recommend this over a generic brand, it'll last.
B0016M10C8 I got these so my son wouldn't have his bare back on the cold plastic changing pad when we change him. My changing pad doesn't have a belt, so the slits are useless to me but they don't bother me or get in the way. These are nice and they wash well. We always have one on the pad and if he wets through it then we can quickly swap it out for the second one while the first is washing. I like these much better than the plastic thin Boppy brand ones I got at my baby shower.
B0016M10C8 I washed the changing pad covers according to the directions, and they turned rough and fuzzy.  REALLY fuzzy on the back of it, and kind of fuzzy on the top.  It is also impossible to get poop stains out of it...and with a new baby, poop will be everywhere!  We have just started to lay a hand towel down on the changing table.  It is bigger than these crummy pads and stains come out much better!
B0016M10C8 These pads are of great quality. I gave it 4 stars because its not what i thought it was. i was looking for changing pads only, not changing table pads. I want to put them in my diaper bag to use when we're out and i need to change the  baby. I don't want to use them on the changing table, which is what its intended for.  I will keep them because they are really nice and thick and soft and i can still use them in my diaper bag.
B0016M10C8 These are awful. They do not stay put. They are too small to cover vinyl completely. Should have some sort of slidproofing on back.
B0016M10C8 I thought these changing pad covers would fit the entire changing pad... but they only cover the flat middle part (on our Graco pack'n play it's the part that is tan in the middle) which is ok, but our little guy is getting bigger and bigger everyday and his entire body doesn't even fit on it (he is only 3 months old). I like using the pad covers because they keep him from laying on the cold changing pad, but with these his feet still hang off. He hasn't seemed to mind, so I give the product a 4 instead of something lower, but I was a little dissapointed that they didn't cover the entire changer!
B0016M10C8 I knew before purchasing this item that it was small. I knew that it would only cover the bottom of the pack n play changing pad to offer protection from the hard cold plastic. I have not used them yet as they were a shower gift, but they have washed well and will fit perfectly in the bottom of the changing pad and provide protection which is all I need it to do. My friends who own these say they hold up well and are a must buy.
B0016N3SF4 My daughter loves this in the bath with her.  They are very cute and a fun toy that we also gave as a gift and that child loved as well.
B0016N3SF4 I like this bath set, it was a cute change from yellow ducks. drawback is the plastic rings deflated days later, but the frogs are durable
B0016N3SF4 My son is still too young to play with these but I love them at bathtime.  I use them to distract him (2.5 mo old) while his dad washes him down.  Not sure how long these will keep his attention but they're so cute.  I was concerned about how long the air would last in the rings but after 1 mo in the tub they are still filled and buoyant.
B0016N3SF4 super cute and just love the floaties.  great price, made a perfect baby shower gift, gender neutral makes it an easy pick
B0016N3SF4 I play with it as much as a baby does. Very nicely done. Idea of floating rings with frogs on them is just unbelievable. Would recommend for any age.
B0016N3SF4 We used this as a diaper cake topper for my sisters baby shower. Her theme obviously rubber duckies. Perfect decor and baby bath toy after. Very happy.
B0016N3SF4 Looks very elegant. The classic rubber duck!  Baby loves it and it just beautifies he bath. Good material - seems durable. Lovely colors.
B0016N3SF4 From the moment I saw these froggies on my friends baby's pictures I fell in love with them. I ordered this toy, and loved it even more after seeing it in person. My 9 months old daughter loves to play with baby frogs, and to chew on the floaties. She even snuck one of the floaties to her crib a couple of times. A very cute, well-made, functional toy.
B0016N7IJ6 I am a huge fan of these placemats.  They are not smelly and plasticky and do the job.  They seem to hold up well with lots of food smeared all over them.  I would love the stickem to be a bit more tacky but we make it work.  They are also biodegradeable and affordable.
B0016N7IJ6 We've used these several times when going out to restaurants with the kids. They work really well and keep the kids occupied while we wait for the food. The only thing I don't really like is that if the kids put their food on the placemat, they can sometimes get crayon in their food! But it's either that or they put their food directly on the table, which may or may not be clean. The adhesive stays put during the meal and comes off easily. They're priced well and worth the time to use. I'd recommend them!
B0016N7IJ6 We picked some of these up at Babies R Us and we love them.  My son is now 2 years old but we've been using these since he started eating solid food.  Their biggest advantage is that (unlike Table Toppers) they are meant to color on and they are big.  I also like that they are made of paper and not plastic.Previously we had usedNeat Solutions Baby Einstein Biodegradable Table Topper Disposable Stick-on Placemat 30-Count.  These Classy Kid placemats are much better than the Table Toppers for a number of reasons.These placemate are wonderful because they:-  have adhesive on all four sides of the placemat (Table Topper only has adhesive on top and bottom sides).-  are big and cover a nice size area; pretty much all the area a young toddler can reach from his high chair.-  are made to go over the edge of the table.  So if your kids likes to play with the edge of the table or even tries to chew on the edge of the table these placemats have you covered.-  Best of all these are made to color on.  They come with a pack of triangular crayons.  My son loves to color these.  It has saved us a lot of trouble when food is taking a long time to come out.-  have different settings with either farm animals, or jungle animals, or undersea creatures on them.  It gives you lots to talk about with your toddler and lots to color!We will continue to use these placemats as long as my son continues to eat food off the table.  He's getting better at using a plate but still.  We really have not found anything better than these.  Although they are a bit hard to find you can either buy them online or at Babies R Us.
B0016N7IJ6 If you take your kids to eat out you have to get these placemats! They are the best out there.Pros:They are huge! They cover every part of the table your child will touch including the side of the table!The pictures they have to color are fun and entertain my daughterThey come with crayons! Which is great into its self but not only that they are triangle shaped crayons so they don't roll off the tableThey also are easy to store in my diaper bagCons:The only con is that the bottom part that is supposed to stick on the table is not as sticky as it could be. The rest sticks fine but the bottom one you have to press very firmly to begin with and also during the meal depending on how long we stay we end up pressing two more times but its not that big of a deal because most placemats out there don't even have the option to cover the side of the table. Anyways I highly recommend this product.
B0016N7IJ6 I love these placemats. It's easy to peel off adhesives and stick these to a table. The adhesive sticks fairly well. When very determined my little one can pull up the adhesive, but it actually re-sticks pretty well. I appreciate that these are are disposable and biodegradeable. We don't use these at home, but do use them when eating out to allow our little one to eat off the table without worrying about germs! My older daughter no longer needs these, but sometimes asks to use them to color on, which can be a welcomed distractions. These are one of my favorite kid products!
B0016N7IJ6 This has been one of the few 'convenience' baby items that has really lived up to expectations. They are so easy to keep in the diaper bag (unlike some non-disposable place mats that inevitably get taken out because they take up so much room) and unfold into a nice big rectangle.They are very waterproof - we are always pleased to find that when we peel up the place mat and it doesn't show any signs of falling apart or leaking through. However, even though they may get covered in water and other liquids, we were surprised to find that we were still able to color on them. Even though my son is not yet 16 months, we can keep him entertained for at least a couple of minutes with coloring on the mats and talking about the different animals and plants depicted on them. The crayons that come with the mats are triangular shaped so that they do not roll off the table - another bonus. Ours included a red, blue, green and yellow crayon. They do have a bit of a waxy feel to them, but we haven't tried our Crayola crayons on the mats yet to see if they are more or less compatible with them. I will update the review if we get around to it.As an extra bonus, I don't feel the guilt that I would if I purchased the plastic place mats because they are biodegradable.If there was any kids of negative, it would be that sometimes the adhesive backing strips on the bottom may be the teeniest tiniest hard to peel off. Just a warning if you have terrible hand dexterity or hand-eye coordination... Once peeled off and placed down, the mat has always stayed down - even covering the table edge (which my man sometimes still likes to bite down on at times.)Fabulous product!
B0016N7IJ6 They're huge, they glue down on all four sides, the images give me and my daughter something to talk about during lunches out, and they're biodegradable. What more can you ask for?
B0016NHN82 quality is not good, it had a little hole on it and I just unpacked in the the bathroom and use it right it way there.
B0016NHN82 My baby loves this inflatable tub!  When she was able to sit up, we started using it.  She sits more securely in it without sliding all over the whole bathtub. I love how it has a little loop holder on the back side of the tub for hanging. I use a shower curtain hook to hook through the loop holder on the inflatable tub and hang it on the towel rack in my shower. Convenient!  It's sturdy material and has remained inflated with no leaking.  I wish this tub had been available years ago when my other children were babies!  Overall - one of the best essential buys I've made for my baby.
B0016NHN82 Those plastic newborn tubs just won't cut it around the 6 month mark. Filling up a full-sized tub on a nightly basis is a waste of water. The Safety 1st Kirby Inflatable Tub is a perfect in-between. It allows for a deep bathing experience without using much water. It is a tight fit in the bathtub, but not unworkable. Blowing it up is a pain in the neck, but once it is blow up you only need to top it off every so often. I could care less about how it is decorated, so if esthetics is important to you hopefully another review can fill that need. This is a great tub and should be a registry essential.
B0016NHN82 Love this tub. It fits perfectly in my shower stall (since I don't have a bath tub) and my 7 month old LOVES it. The bottom gets kind of slippery so he slips backwards but if you had a foam pad it would work perfectly in the bottom. I have no issues with this at all.
B0016NHN82 I purchased this item to put in our camper.  We only have a shower in there and I needed a way to bathe my child when she was a baby.  We used it from the time she was 4 months old to the time she was 20 months old.  She got too big for it them and was used to being in the shower with me by then.  This tub stored very easily for travel, was easy to clean, easy to fill with water and was easy to drain.  My child loved using this tub.  She had room to play when she was smaller.  Toward the end, she didn't have room for her boats in there with her, but it served the purpose we bought it for.  We will certainly be saving it to use with our next child.
B0016NHN82 I have a 6 month old daughter who can sit up pretty well but still needs some support once in a while. She didn't seem to really enjoy the infant tub anymore because she doesn't like to recline long, and sitting up in her infant tub was kind of awkward for us to bathe her. We had started bathing her in the big tub with one of us in the tub with her, but it was a pain to fill the whole tub (even if it was shallow) every time, and to get in with her. This inflatable tub is the perfect in-between tub for us! It hardly takes any water to fill, but still stays warmer longer than the infant tub because it holds more water. It fits in the big tub with room for us to sit behind them in the tub or on the edge if we wanted without getting wet in the tub with her. It's soft for if she starts to topple over. And it's got a slight texture so it's not just slippery plastic. A bonus for her is that her bath toys can't get too far away from her. =) The one thing is something I had read in another review: because of the width of the walls, about half the water from the tub faucet ends up going down the drain when filling unless you use a cup or something to divert the water into the small tub. I'm currently looking for a faucet extender like thePrince Lionheart 2 Count Faucet Extender, Gray/PinkorAqueduck Faucet Extender, Aquaextenders that would work for a tub faucet (with a spout cover) instead of a normal sink faucet, but in the meantime, I found that using one of the cups we use to rinse her off does well to divert the water into the tub. Luckily, the tub fills so fast, I'm not sitting there holding the cup for long. =)
B0016NHN82 We love this baby bath! Our daughter is 8 months old and was starting to get too big for the hard plastic baby bath and yet not quite big enough or steady enough to go right into the bathtub, so this inflatable tub is the perfect transition! She absolutely loves it, it is fully enclosed and has a plug in the bottom and a hook that you can hang it up to dry inside the bath with! Couldn't have asked for anything better.
B0016NHN82 We used this tub for both our boys. I really liked how cushioned it was, and it was quite durable. The first one lasted about a year, and then we purchased another because we liked it so much. It wasn't the easiest to blow up, however.
B0016NHN82 We've been using this little tub for the past few months.  My son is now 9 months old and he still fits in it just fine.  I love it mainly because I don't have to worry about his bumping his head against the sides of the bathtub, and because it uses little water, I don't have to fill the whole bath tub with water and it's comfortable for him.  I would strongly recommend it to anyone with an infant that can sit up.
B0016NHN82 I use this for my 3 month old, we have been traveling a lot so the bulky infant tubs are not an option for us. We use this and it's great b/c it packs up in a suitcase easily and my son can lay in it with a little water. He enjoys it!
B0016NHN82 This is a very durable, high quality tub. I would definitely recommend this fine product as it's worth the price.
B0016NHN82 My 1-yr-old daughter HATED the regular tub when we tried to stop using the plastic infant tub.  Cried through every bath.  We bought this and she loves it.  We inflated it and let her play in it in the kitchen first (no water) and she climbed in and out over and over.  Once she was in the tub and in water, she splashed and played and just loved her bath again.  What a relief!  It's not very slippery on the bottom, either.  She suddenly got up on her hands and feet twice to turn herself around and didn't slip at all.
B0016NHN82 This is fabulous we have bought others in the past and none has lived up to our expectations other than this and I would recommend to anyone we bought for travel and it is so handy !
B0016NHN82 I chose this tub because the reviews said it was non-slip. They were absolutely true!!! My baby is starting to move around a lot and she has never slipped! I'm glad I bought this tub and didn't transition to adult tub from infant tub because she cried a little when i first put her in, but she got used to this tub fast. I don't ever deflate it. Ijust flip it over when done bathing to dry off.
B0016NMIOG We used this on a trip with our 11 month old daughter when we went overseas and it was exceptionally useful. The container is great and keeps things clean when you're traveling. We used these for a while even after our trip was over. At first Amazon or the company that sold it to us--by mistake sent us disposable spoons by accident but after notifying them of the mistake, either amazon or the company that sold the spoons sent us the correct product. Easy as pie and great service. Now that our daughter is 15ish month old she can't really use them anymore since it isn't deep enough to spoon a lot of food, but its ok...we still found these great when she was the appropriate age to use it.
B0016NMIOG Wasn't sure if I'd actually use these, but we find ourselves out and about and randomly stopping at restaurants or eating at friends' houses frequently, so I figured I'd try it.  Have to say, it is GREAT to just keep in the diaper bag and have handy for that.  Our toddler isn't quite old enough to be able to handle standard sized silverware yet, but these are small like the ones he uses at daycare.  Perfect to have at the ready, easy to clean, and the container keeps them clean and makes them easy to find in the diaper bag.  Every time I have whipped these out, I have received comments from friends that they have never seen anything like this and that it's such a great idea.  We originally bought because we'll be travelling to see family w/ no kids, and this will be perfect for that too.  Highly recommended as a diaper bag staple.
B0016NMIOG This travel set is helpful to keep in a diaper bag for a young kid who is just learning to use forks and spoons.  The flatware is a great size for kids' fingers, while the travel case keeps it handy and easy to find.  Then, as your child gets older, the case is the perfect size for a child's toothbrush and travel size toothpaste!
B0016NMIOG We have bought 5-6 different kinds of flatware for our toddler and the Take and Toss is our favorite.  I tend to buy the more expensive product thinking it will be superior.  For once, that is not the case.  The Take and Toss has no sharp metal so toddlers don't poke themselves while learning to maneuver their forks.  They are also the perfect size for a toddler's mouth.  It surprises me how wide some of the other flatware out there is.This travel set is my favorite!  It is on my list of must-have's and I add it to all by baby/shower gifts.  This lives in our diaper bag.  Not only is it handy to have when eating away from home, but it doubles as a toy until the food arrives.  My little guy loves shaking it and taking the utensils out and putting them back in, over and over.  It's small, cleans up easily, and is cheap to replace when a spoon accidentally gets buried under a pile of wet wipes.  Highly recommended!
B0016NMIOG i like all the dishes or silverware come with cases to keep clean for my son. it is convient for travelling or go out.
B0016NMIOG Got these for a recent family vacation. I love that the container keeps them contained - clean or dirty. When we came home these became a staple in our diaper bag.
B0016NMIOG I always carry these in my diaper bag when we go out for outings to the park or to eat out, and they come in very handy! The container is compact and holds just enough utensils, and keeps the utensil from soiling other items in your purse after use. The utensils are easy for my toddler to use, and I always wash and reuse them instead of tossing them. Because they are so inexpensive, it's not as much as a loss when I lose one of the utensils (which inevitably happens when you have a toddler). I boughtThe First Years Take & Toss Toddler Flatware, 16 Pieceas spare utensils to use at home and replace in the container.
B0016NMIOG Love these!  My 22 month old son loves to feed himself,and these are the perfect size for him.  I never toss them, just wash them in the dishwasher.  I love the carrying case, we put it in the diaper bag.
B0016NMIOG I bought this to keep in my diaper bag so I have child size silverware when we go somewhere. I love the case that it has. It beats having them in a plastic bag all the time! I've even pulled it out to entertain my child with. It can be used as a make shift rattle and my son loves to take the top on and off. Overall a great product!
B0016NP0ZA This thing held up GREAT... for like a week then it would never, ever stay stuck to the wall anymore. Which is a shame because the lady bug toy holder looked so cute and neat on the wall... but i refuse to drill holes. I WISH this would work like it says... but my lady bug just sits on the tub floor now after use.
B0016NP0ZA The Boon Bug Pod is a complete scam. I ordered the Boon Bug because I thought it was so cute, but when I finally got it, the only way to attach it to my tub was to drill into the wall. So I had to make another purchase of the suction cup bracket so make it work. What a rip off.
B0016NP0ZA I've used this on two different walls now. A fiberglass tub wall and a porcelain subway tile wall. It's worked great both times by following the instructions. I think one of the mistakes that people make is wetting the suction cups. I've done that too and it slides. The instructions say to use alcohol on the wall to make sure it is bone dry. It also says the suction cups need to be dry. When all surfaces are dry and flat it seems to work very well.
B0016NP0ZA I bought this at the same time as the lady bug toy holder because I knew I did not want to use adhesive.  The suction cups work great.  Follow the directions, clean them and the wall with alcohol, and make sure you get the cups fully on the tile not bridging any grout lines and you should be fine.  It would be nice if this were included in the main product, but at least it is offered as an option and I think worth the extra few bucks.
B0016NP0ZA We got the Boon Pod, Ladybug and wanted it above our tub, without having to use adhesive to hang it. This is perfect. Followed the instructions to clean and let dry the surface on which it will hang. Works great.
B0016NP0ZA I had the taped bracket and it fell so decided to give this one a try. It has fallen once but that may be my fault (too much weight). It is great because even if it does fall you can just put it back up without having to purchase replacement tabs like the other one. I also like because we plan to move soon and I don't have to worry about getting this out of the bathroom. Would definitely recommend.
B0016RSDYG Really beautiful, modern design. I was worried it did not work together with my mattress (nook pure) but it fits nicely. As other reviews pointed out, the paint chips easily. I attached a mobile to one side of the crib and it got damaged, but I would not complain about quality either. Happy with it. Would recommend.
B0016RSDYG We received this crib several days ago and it was a cinch to put together.  It looks great and half the price of the oeuf baby cribs.
B0016RSDYG I did extensive research into a modern-looking and sturdy crib that won't cost me an arm and a leg. This Babyletto Modo 3 in 1 crib fits the bill. Setup was easy and the whole thing definitely feels solid. Much better than some of those flimsy looking entry lines - including the $200 Ikea cribs.I did also consider the Babyletto Mercer 3 in 1, but ultimately went with the Modo because there is enough clearance under the Modo 3 in 1 for my Roomba to move in and out. With the Mercer, just be aware that the bottom of the drawer almost touches the ground, so you won't be able to either vacuum or sweep the area underneath the crib - and that area ends up becoming a dust landfill.
B0016RSDYG I have had my son sleeping in this crib for over 3 months and am very happy with it.  I put it together by myself in about an hour and a half.  I took my time and moved a little slower knowing it was made of soft wood.  There were a few steps that would have been easier to complete with two people.  The wood is a little soft and I did make one ding in the wood on the inside, but this would have been avoided had I waited for my husband to get home to help.  Very sturdy once assembled.
B0016RSDYG I don't think you can find better quality for the money if you're looking for a modern crib.  Love this crib.  Our daughter's nursery is mid-century modern-ish and this works perfectly in it.
B0016RSDYG My wife and I are having twins and we recently purchased two of these cribs.  We put both together last night and I have to say it was very easy to assemble and seems to be very sturdy.  Probably took us 45 minutes to put each one together at the most.  The materials seem to be very good quality and the crib actually looks better than cribs that are much more expensive.  One thing to note is that both cribs we received already meet the new CPSC standard for full size cribs even though that standard doesn't go into effect until June 28, 2011.  Babyletto (MDB \"Million Dollar Baby is the parent company) were great about responding to my email and confirming that the cribs we had conform to this new standard.  Overall we are extremely happy with this crib.Update:  We have now had our twins for just over two weeks and the cribs seem to be very comfortable for them.  They actually sleep better in the cribs than most other places, i.e. bouncy chairs, etc.  The cribs are solidly built and have worked great with no loose parts or creaks/rattles.  Overall still very satisfied.
B0016RSDYG This crib is beautiful, and I love it. It wasn't too difficult to put together and it looks great in our nursery. Amazon really does have it for the best price (I looked everywhere), plus free shipping on such a large item was wonderful. It came undamaged and well packed.
B0016RSDYG I've used this crib for my daughter who is now 7 months and we've had no issues with it what so ever. That being said she's not standing up in it yet so I'm yet to lower the mattress yet. I like the style of the crib and it fit our criteria cause we were looking for a crib that didn't convert into a twin bed cause we didn't care for the look of the head and foot board when used as a crib. Plus you can 'float' this crib in the center of the room which looks great.
B0016RSDYG We received this crib quickly and the packaging was intact.  No dents, bumps, scratches in the crib pieces when we opened the box and everything was packed neatly and efficiently.  I was 5 months pregnant when the box came and I assembled the crib mostly by myself in less than an hour.  Needed my husband to help me hold a few things in place, but only because I'm somewhat clumsy!  Assembly was very easy and I love that the fasteners are placed discreetly so you don't see a bunch of shinly metal screws all over.We love the simple, more modern design of the crib and the finish is beautiful.  Very pleased with the aesthetics.  I did bump into it with the vacuum (I said I was clumsy!) the other day and leave a little ding, but I figure it's furniture for a kids room and it's going to get a little beat up.  I had read reviews that the wood was a little soft and dings easily so I was not surprised to see that my vacuum bump left a mark, but I guess I just expect that any baby/kid furniture is going to get beat up over time so that was really not a huge issue to me.As I write this I am 6 months pregnant, so we have no little one using the crib yet and I cannot review based on usage.  But based on packaging, shipping, assembly, and appearance we are very pleased!
B0016RSDYG I bought this crib for my 2nd baby, who is on the way.  The first time around, I spent WAY too much money on my DS's nursery furniture, buying all the conversion rails (from crib to toddler bed to a full-sized bed), etc.  At the time, it seemed so wise, but honestly, I don't think I want to keep the crib until my son is fully grown and ready for a full-sized bed.  But since we spent so much $ on it, I feel like I have to keep it longer than I would otherwise have wanted.  With the Babyletto Modo, the price is great.  It is very en trend with the espresso and white combination, and I don't feel like I have to keep it for more than a few years.  It is just as sturdy as my son's pricey crib, and seems like it will be durable enough to handle our next child, at least through the toddler bed stage.  I also like that it is low enough for me to be able to put a sleeping child into it even when we eventually will have to lower the mattress.
B0016RSDYG I love this crib.  It's made with solid wood (no toxic particle board) and has a lower profile, which makes it a bit easier to put the baby in when its set to the lowest setting.  It's a no frills crib, which is what we wanted, so it takes up less real estate in my son's nursery.  The wood is quite soft, and we have accidentally dinged the edges with the vacuum, which I am really bummed about.  It set up very easily and is also pretty light, so you can move it around if necessary.  Fits standard crib mattresses.
B0016RSDYG I love this crib! When I was looking for a crib I wanted a white one and a more modern one. I looked at many many cribs and most of my ideal cribs were way out of my price range. I kept coming back to this one, so finally took the plunge and made the purchase and am not disappointed!It came from Amazon in perfect condition. The step up was super easy. The directions were easy to read and follow. My husband put it together in no time at all. It is a bit lightweight, but I didn't expect it to be heavy with the price we paid.This is our first baby so I don't have any experience with other cribs but I am 5'1&#34; and this crib is a great height. I don't imagine having any problems with putting baby in/ getting baby out.
B0016RSDYG Purchased a second one for my second child. Great modern look and doesn't take over the whole room. highly recommend
B0016RSDYG This is one sleek looking crib that has a decent price tag for it's design. It's well made and pretty easy to assemble. You will find that once you convert it to the toddler bed, it looks even more attractive! It fits a regular sized crib mattress and has no moving parts (which can be tough for short moms who have to lower sleeping babies.If you'd like a complete crib buying guide, visit the website, AllMomsArePerfect.com and look under 'baby gear essentials'. You'll find great tips on where you can save money, a stroller shopping guide, and how to prepare for the hospital delivery.Good luck!
B0016RSDYG This is a great crib -- streamline, compact, sturdy, strong, etc. We had it as a crib for almost two years and had no problems whatsoever with it.However, when we transferred it to a toddler bed, we found that the side rail doesn't fit in flush. See the pictures and you'll know what I'm talking about. There is a big gap and shows the mattress under the rail. Furthermore, it shows screw holes that are no longer in use. We were extremely disappointed because it looks like a piece of junk now.I would recommend this bed for anyone wanting just a crib. Skip it if your plan is to convert it to the toddler bed with rail. Or even without the rail as you'll still see all the screw holes on the bottom and the mattress will slide.
B0016RSDYG I ordered this through Amazon and it came within 2 days.  My husband and I spent about an hour putting it together.  The instructions were ok, could be better but we figured everything out.  We had enough hardware and there were no damaged pieces.  Whew!  Everything looks really good and sturdy but I haven't officially used it since the baby is not here.  However, the assembly was good and the wood wasn't as cheap as I read in other reviews. I'm happy with it so far and love the color, finish and look.  I ordered the Willow Natural Coconut Palm Crib Mattress to go with this crib and it fits perfectly!  One of the reasons i picked this crib was because it is geared towards shorter women like myself and the price point was good for me.  I'm still debating on the dresser as I heard really bad reviews.
B0016RSEG8 This is a great portacrib mattress. I bought it because there have been some studies which suggest that SIDS deaths may be related to fire retardant chemicals in infant bedding and the lack of some newborns to process it well. This pad is firesafe through the use of a different, not so chemically laden process. In terms of what buyers said about the pad's thinness, newborns do not need the kind of thick mattresses that adults think of as more comfortable. (In fact, I once heard it put very well: In terms of SIDS safety, \"If the mattress looks like it would be comfortable for you, no newborn should be going anywhere near it!\") The comfort comes in whatever soft, lovely, tight-fitting material you lay over it. I used the chenille sheets by American Baby Company - although for said reasons, I wished I could find something truly organic (not just an organic surface as I saw with some products). I was impressed with the pad - it looks and feels very well made, and I don't know how on earth they got an all-cotton surface to be waterproof, but it feels remarkably impermeable without sacrificing comfort. The pad is very firm, more so than many other baby matress thingies - the other reviewer should have nothing to fear. The only concern I think people should have with the thickness of the mattress is that you need to make sure your sheets - which may be designed with a thicker mattress in mind - don't bunch up and become a crumply surface the baby could slide around in too much. If you run into such a problem, safety pin the corners of the sheet's underside together to make it tighter on top.
B0016RSEG8 This mattress fit perfectly in ourDelta Children's Products Riley Mini Crib - Dark Cherry. If you are looking for sheets and waterproof pad, I highly recommend theNaturepedic Organic Cotton Portable Crib Fitted Sheet, Ivoryand theNaturepedic Waterproof Flat Portacrib Pad, 24x38. They all fit together. The mattress, waterproof pad, and fitted sheet are all that we use in the crib and it works nicely and comfortably for our little one. It was difficult at first to find a smaller crib and all the appropriately sized crib items while also meeting or exceeding all the safety recommendations, so to find this combo was a relief.
B0016RSEG8 I want everything to be healthy for the little one!  I bought for my grandson as a gift for his new mini crib.  He likes it and enjoys to stand on it inside his crib!
B0016RSEG8 It fits out portable crib very tightly and is of a high quality...I would recommend it again. Just as described.
B0016RSEG8 I got a replacement for my original one because I felt it was too soft and had too much &#34;give.&#34; My baby is a belly sleeper and she sinks into this to the point that her face looks like it's in the mattress.  The replacement had the same issue.  They indicated it's because I was using in a Graco and the support is not intended for this, but it has the same issue even on a hard floor.  I have their full-size mattress which I absolutely love.  I would only recommend this mattress for babies who are over 6 months of age and are NOT belly sleepers. Then I would think it would be fine. I wish there was a similar option in terms of organic but the only other option is not as natural as this one is.  I felt others should know about this possibility with this  mattress because I feel it is a safety issue.
B0016RSEG8 Spent a long time trying to find an organic mattress that I thought I would be happy with. This one fits our Alpha Mini Rocking Crib very well. Snug, but not hard to get the sheets on. Wipes down easily. Seems very firm enough. Very very light so it's easy to pull out and put a new sheet on. Went with American Baby Company SheetsAmerican Baby Company Organic Cotton Interlock Portable Fitted Crib Sheet, NaturalandAmerican Baby Company Organic Fitted Cotton Velour Porta-Crib Sheet, Natural. Not please with the Naturepedic waterproof pad. Too hard to get it to sit flat under the sheet while putting the sheet on. Also skipped the padded quilted organic waterproof mattress pad since I thought it made the bedding too soft. Am just going to use sheets and maybe flannel waterproof protectors over them if the kids end up needing them.
B0016RSEG8 I own a full-size Naturpedic crib mattress and love it.  It fits tightly in the crib, isn't toxic so there's no issue with off-gassing as with traditional mattresses, is lightweight enough for me to handle it easily, and is rock hard so there is absolutely no question about its safety.  When I needed a portable crib mattress I decided to try Naturpedic, despite the steep price, because I expected the same.  I was somewhat disappointed when the product arrived.  On the positive side, it fits snugly around the edges, leaving no gaps in the portable crib.  Also, it is the firmest portable crib mattress that I could find, and I tried several from Dream on Me, LA Baby, Colgate, and even Mamadoo.  Naturpedic uses the same Air-Core technology as it does in the full-sized crib mattress.  However, the problem lies in the waterproof organic cotton cover which does not fit tightly to the core of the mattress as it does with the full-size mattress.  The cover has a rippling effect and tends to bubble when the baby is placed on it.  I use it with the Grayson portable crib made by Babyletto.  The mattress dimensions match the portable crib dimensions perfectly, so that's not the issue.  The rippling issue caused me a great deal of stress when I received the product because my baby has just started rolling over onto his belly at night and I was concerned that this would create a suffocation hazard.  Because we've been staying in a hotel for a month (our home was majorly damaged and had to be repaired), I was forced to use this mattress as it was the best one that I could find, despite its flaws.  It has caused me many sleepless nights (but no scares).  There isn't a portable crib mattress that I have found that I could wholeheartedly recommend.  I still believe this is the best portable crib mattress out there.  Use this if you absolutely must use a portable crib.  Another tip, only use a tight fitting fitted sheet, preferably NOT one made of jersey, as the jersey sheets tend to stretch and, in my opinion, become a loose bedding suffocation hazard.  Instead, use the Naturpedic organic portable crib sheet or any traditional cotton sheet that matches the dimensions of the mattress, fits tightly, and has all around elastic.  And DON\"T use a mattress pad cover with it as it makes the mattress softer.  If you have the choice, stick with a traditional, full-size mattress in a full-size crib once your baby is rolling over.
B0016RSEG8 I have this mattress for the crib and bought the same one for our porta crib/pack and play.  I love the Naturpedic line and the product they sell.  I was so happy to find a mattress to fit the pack and play from them too.  It's nice and thick, super comfy for my twin boys.  They have slept in this from the time I brought them home until they stopped late day naps at 7 months old.  Now at 10 months the mattress is the bottom of the pack and play and as they are pulling up and standing and then dropping back down to sitting, they land on something soft and comfy instead of hard.  They get in and play and are able to stand up on the mattress since it's nice and firm.  Would recommend this for anywhere between newborn age to any age still using a porta crib for sleep or playtime.
B0016RSEG8 After searching for a natural organic bed for our expecting baby, I decided to take a chance on this one after purchasing the Da Vinci Crest 50 Coil mattress which was made with PVC toxic material. Even though the previous mattress fits perfectly with our Da Vinci Mini crib, when it was a sunny day and the nursery got a bit warm, there were obvious fumes coming from the mattress since it's had PVC. I didn't want to chance it so we decided to buy this one. This pad was extremely firm and doesn't have a smell. After placing the same brand mattress pad and sheets on, it was slightly snug for the crib but still works.
B0016RSEG8 This mattress seems comfortable and it wipes cleans well. It fit nicely in our portable crib.  Happy with this purchase.
B0016RSEG8 We bought a full size Naturepedic organic mattress for our toddler's crib when he was born almost 2 years ago, and it's been the best purchase.  So when shopping for a mattress for the mini-crib his sister will be sleeping in, I knew I wanted another Naturepedic.  So many other organic mattresses are more expensive because they are made with wool and latex - 2 things I happen to be allergic to.  I liked that this one is made from something I feel is safe for my baby to sleep on, and I feel the price is fair after actually seeing how well it works in our crib.This portacrib pad/mattress fits the DaVinci/Baby Mod mini cribs perfectly.  Our  mini crib came with a mattress that was horrible (although the cribs are great), it had gaps between the side and the mattress, and the mattress itself was flimsy and covered in vinyl.  This Naturepedic mattress fits great, with a nice tight fit, and it's firm enough for a newborn.  It's much sturdier and even half an inch thicker than the mattress provided by our crib manufacturer.  I know some reviewers were worried that it's only 2 inches thick, and it's labeled as a \"pad\", but it is a mattress, and very high quality.I highly recommend this mattress, and in case you're wondering, we've found that the Carter's Portacrib Sheets fit it perfectly.
B0016RSEG8 This mattress is thin and is firm and I wouldn't want to sleep on it but my baby loves it. It is made of cotton so I can see that some of them may have bunches because sometimes that happens with these organic products. If you were to get one of those, I would exchange it because ours was even throughout the mattress.-Firm and safe, fits in my davinci mini crib tight and perfect-Water proof and easy to wipe off-It is just about all my 2 month old will sleep on (now 13.5 lbs and 24 in long)-Yes it works as a mattress alone, it may seem thin but it may be because we as adults would see it as very uncomfortable
B0016RVLZY I loved this product when I first opened it... no foul odor and it was much more substantial than the mattress that came with my bassinet. After a single usages by my 8lb baby, there was a huge indent which was dissapointing. I've continued to use the mattress, I just rotate it and try to fix the indentations every night!
B0016RVLZY I was disappointed to learn that the core of Naturepedic bassinet pads are made of \"30% polyethylene foam.\" I thought they were only coated with polyethylene. I would much prefer a mattress or pad with a natural rubber core. The Naturepedic representative said the Naturepedic crib mattresses also contain this same polyethylene foam, although I'm not sure how much. I just do not feel comfortable putting my baby on their mattresses.
B0016RVLZY When I purchased a bassinet for my daughter, I did not like the flimsy mattress that came with the bassinet. I began to look for a new mattress for the bassinet and found this. Make sure you measure the bassinet before ordering this item. I did and it fits well. A friend of mine didn't and it doesn't fit her bassinet.After 2 1/2 months of continuous use, the mattress is still holding up well. It is starting to take on my daughter's impression. It would be nice to \"flip it\" to even out the wear and tear on it but it does not appear that that will work. Hence the four stars.The price has gone down since I purchased my bassinet too.All in all this is a good mattress for the price and is a much better option than the standard flimsy mattress that usually comes with a bassinet.
B0016RVLZY Thick, firm and organic - love it. I purchased this to replace the mattress in the Summer Infant By Your Side Sleeper. It fits but could be about 1 inch longer. However, the mattress that the Sleeper comes with actually does not fit in tight to the ends, so I don't think that there is much difference. However, rolling up a prefold diaper and wedging it in to cover the 1-2 inch space (at baby's feet) actually makes it a really tight fit at the top and sides - tighter than the mattress it came with. I think it will be great for every night and during the day use. It's not ideal for traveling, as the sleeper won't close up as well so in those cases I will use the mattress it came with. I purchased Kushies organic bassinet sheet and it fits great after washing!
B0016RVLZY We bought the oval bassinet mattress to replace the plastic mattress that came with a cosleeper nest. It's fine, but there's not anything to it and the price is just ridiculous. We have the reversible crib/toddler mattress from the same company and that was something like $250. It's fantastic quality, so it seems ridiculous that this flimsy little mattress that is less than 1/20 the size of the crib mattress is almost $70.She didn't use this much because she wouldn't sleep apart from me very well, but we still had issues with the mattress dipping where she lay on it, even though she was teeny tiny (less than 6 pounds) when she used it.There aren't many options for organic bassinet mattresses, so for that reason alone (if you are like us and insist on organic bedding) it may be worth getting, but the price is still ridiculous.
B0016RVM4O Yes, it seems to be comfy, and I feel better about using this than a plastic/vinyl sheet for all of the obvious reasons. But I don't really consider it waterproof. Fortunately in my daughter's first year we've had very few leakage problems at night, but the first time her diaper did fail her, I removed her sheet only to discover this \"waterproof\" pad was wet through. There wasn't a huge leak, either, my daughter's cloth diaper had just slipped out above its cover and wicked moisture up, through her jammies, and onto the sheet. But the pad still did not prevent the mattress from getting wet. Maybe it helps for minor things, drool and whatnot simply by providing bulk between sheet and mattress, but I wouldn't count on it for anything major. Really wish I had better things to say about it.
B0016RVM4O This is a great crib protector pad. (Pee pad)  It is flat which makes it easier to change.  The materials are also healthier than any other waterproof crib pad I have found.  I have a non-waterproof crib mattress so just in case, I have the fitted one and then this flat one on top of that.  I keep the fitted one on at all times and I only change the flat one.  I have 2 flat ones, one to use and one to wash.  We haven't had any leaks so the fitted one is still clean.  It does take a while to dry but that doesn't bother me.  I just put it on low heat and set my dryer for 50 minutes.  A longer drying time is well worth the benefits of having healthier bedding materials. Use low heat to make sure you don't damage the waterproof membrane.
B0016RVM4O We received the item, but the item itself does not seem waterproof. The underside does not seem to have any type of sealed backing and it looks that any type of liquid would nonetheless seep through the pad.I wouldn't recommend it.
B0016RVM4O I bought this to put over our Naturepedic Lightweight Classic 2 Stage mattress for extra protection. It seems like it's made of heavy duty canvas so am sure it will hold up to any messes. The only reason why I gave it 4 stars (vs. 5 for all our other Naturepedic items - crib mattress, changing pad, cradle mattress) is because this is probably overkill if you have a naturepedic mattress already.  It's very thick and I got this instead of the FITTED crib pad because those reviews made it seem like the fitted pad took a long time to dry.  Either way, it's still great quality and would be great if you don't have a waterproof mattress to begin with.
B0016RVM4O Need to return it as it is -way- bigger than its size and we cant fit it on the crib without it bunching and causing a hazard. Just measured it - it is 31x54.
B0016RVM4O We have not had a severe leak yet so i can't speak to that yet.  but minor leaks and spit up it does great.  the fit is a bit big but when we put the fitted sheet on top we dont have any issues.  would definitely recommend this one!
B0016RVM4O I am so glad I purchased two of these crib pads.  I love that they are not fitted and it makes the crib easier to make.  I took another reviewers suggestion and  make the crib with a crib pad, sheet, crib pad and sheet.  This way if an accident occurs in the night, I can just pull off the top set.  It is also good to know that they are breathable and not vinyl.  They wash and dry well too.  I can see these passed along through a lot of babies when I am done with them.
B001708AS6 I bought these for my daughters nursery and they look great. They are a perfect pink! Buy at least two of them (depending on window size maybe more) to get the bunched look.
B001708AS6 I purchased this valance for our nursery and they look perfect!  I didn't want anything that was too pink.  This valance is light and airy .
B001708AS6 I was so looking forward to putting this window valance in the nursery but was disappointed when it arrived. The color was not that really pretty pink that was pictured but rather more of a pink-purple. Also the tulle looked very cheap and nothing like the picture.
B001708AS6 I ordered two valances and a matching tadpoles crib skirt... all three items were a different shade of pink. It would look terrible near each other so I had to return them. What a shame!
B001708AS6 I wouldn't be surprised if every baby girl room has this! It is the cutest thing in existence. Just barely pink, it looks great with any style...sleek and modern, or antique/vintage. I'm not a fan of pastel, but on this i was sold. it's whimsical, inexpensive and well-made.
B00173DN6M perfectly fit to mini crib DaVinci. neutral color and very fun to have. good quality ))) I love it and hope to my baby will love it too
B00173DN6M This is very cute and very good quality!!  It fits our Port-a-crib perfectly!!  I bought a nice crib at a resale shop and ordered a new mattress, mattress cover and this set.  I wanted gender neutral so we can use if for years to come.  Very pleased with the product.
B00173DN6M Very Gender neutral great size for the mini crib and adorable on the mini crib I love it. Highly Recommend.
B00173DN6M It is a really cute set, nice design and neutral colors but unfortunately the sheet does not fit out mini crib mattress, it is too small. I can use it for pack and play but not regular crib. Wish I could use the whole set together.
B00173DN6M We got this for our son, and it's really adorable! We use it in our mini crib, and it's a perfect fit! The bumper doesn't stick-up a ton, so it's not as dangerous as some bumpers can be.
B00175ROGU KNOBBY TEXTURE CHEWY TUBE GREEN  very small, but baby likes to hold it, I usually give it while feed her
B00175ROGU She doesn't pay too much attention to it, but every kid is different I guess.  The product is fine, she just isn't into it.  Which is weird, because they had one at daycare she was totally into which is why I purchased the exact same thing!  But now she's not.  Go figure.
B00175ROGU I give this to my four year old in stressful moments. He doesn't look for it - so no &#34;binky&#34; issues - but I like to have it on hand. This was Christmas vacation so I used it a LOT because he was off-schedule and had a hard time going to sleep. This really helped a lot.
B00175ROGU Durable and fun for my 23m son. He has oral motor issues and suspected SPD and this has been great. We trace the outline of his mouth around his lips which reflexively works his facial muscles, and he loves the nubby texture on his tongue. The only improvements I'd make:*Something to attach it to his shirt safely (he likes to chew shirt buttons and sleeves)*I wish it weren't hollow. This is often used as a whistle, and his drool comes shooting out the hollow end, which is pretty gross.
B00175ROGU My son has some chewing issues and this product helps him a lot. Instead of chewing on clothes and other items he grabs this. The size is great and he likes the color and texture.
B00175ROGU Always great to add to our chewy tube collection.  My daughter uses these a lot at therapy and sometimes I put her baby food on this to try to get her to eat.
B00175YU7G This has been my baby's very favorite teether. She absolutely loves it! We started using at about 2 1/2-3 months. It's soft and easy for her to hold. The reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because the ears are a bit long for a teether. My baby has gagged on them numerous times.
B00175YU7G I thought this would be a nice, soft rattle for our baby... but it's the only one we have that she couldn't care less about.  Maybe it's too \"boring\" looking for her?  She'll reach for it when handed to her, but she quickly drops it in search of something else.  Also, I personally wish I had noted it was made in China before purchasing.
B00175YU7G I got this for some friends who are trying to be eco-friendly parents.  They were thrilled with this rattle/teether.  Their little one has really taken to it.  He got it at about 1 1/2 mo and loves chewing on it.  It's easy to wash and is shaped well for tiny hands.  They always bring it whenever they take the baby out somewhere.
B00175YU7G My son liked this teether a lot, especially as an older baby.  I like the soft knit over the firm body which gives more resistance when gnawing on it.  I wouldn't change a thing about it!
B00175YU7G We received one as a gift and tje little one played with it since newborn. Not sure how to wash it as it was heavily chewed on during teething episodes so we tossed it into the washer and dryer one day and had no problem. Since then, we had washed it monthly for a uear now and it retains its shape and color.Every time I go to a baby shower, I always include one as part of the gift!
B00175YU7G Cute natural toy.  I love that it is washable and made of natural materials.  It has a nice little rattle to it.
B00175YU7G This rattle is so cute. It took awhile for my child to get excited about it (9 months) but now it soothes her. I wash it in my washing machine without any problems.
B00175YU7G I thought this would be a fun toy for my 6 month old, but he is not interested in it. It's durable and cute, but the rattle noise is extremely soft... not enough to hold my son's attention. And it is not something he is interested in teething on; although he's interested in teething on most everything else he can get his hands on. It's a nice toy, just not for us.
B00175YU7G I loved the idea of an organic teether for my son, so I purchased this bear. However, since day one of introducing it to him, he has showed little to no interest in it at all. It is rather stiff and doesn't have the best rattle. He used to suck on the hands occasionally, but now has completely lost interest in this toy altogether. For the price, I would not purchase this again.
B00175YU7G Our baby irl has been teething since she was only 2 months old. She did not like the cold teethers but the hard ones she would bonk her head with so... we tried this one and she loves it! She is now 6 months old and we have to take the bear with us wherever we go!
B00175YU7G At first my son wasn't fond of this teether... he just never liked it. He puts EVERYTHING in his mouth but I give him the one thing I want him to put in his mouth and he refuses it! BUT, after a few months I tried it again and now it seems to work quite well. With teething it's important to have more than one type because baby gets bored with each relatively quickly.
B00175YU7G This company used to be great and then it was bought by a larger company. Says organic but it is made in China and stuffed with polyester. Not too organic if you ask me.
B0017AE3BO The handle is nice to have and makes it easier to use. The bristles are just like any other standrd shampoo brush. Have never used the soap dispensing function, but I am sure it works fine.
B0017AE3BO What a waste of money. I am so bummed that I threw away the box & can no longer return it even though I only used it once. Seems great in theory but does not work at all! Soap did not dispense and I swear after using the brush it actually GAVE my baby flakes on her scalp! This is totally going in the trash
B0017AE3BO The brush does a good job and serves it purpose.  It's nice that it can pump out a little bit of baby shampoo/wash (whatever you put in it) but it requires a lot of pumps and doesn't really lather or anything like that.  It's really more useful to wash a baby's scalp because of the bristles and not really a necessity for infants but nice to h
B0017AE3BO We purchased this for our newborn and have used it for almost two years now. The dispenser is easy to access for an adult and holds a lot of soap, which means no frequent refills. The brush side was nice to use in her hair when she was little, though her hair is much too thick for it now. The sponge side works okay, but seemed as though it didn't dispense enough soap. You need to be careful how you store it when it is full or the soap will leak out-- there is a printed reminder on the brush that tells you what end is up. It was good for what we needed, but not really necessary.
B0017AE3BO Worked awesome with the Winnie the pooh cradle cap soap! Just 3 days and my 4 mo old cradle cap is 100 gone!
B0017AE3BO Hands down, the gentlest but strongest brush around to prevent cradle cap.The bristles are thick but soft. The sponge part stinks though. You are better off just lathering the baby's head and then just using the bristle part. Sponge is too messy because you have to fill the body of the brush with shampoo to get it to work and it leaks everywhere if you do.
B0017AE3BO I love using this brush/sponge to shampoo my daughter's hair and her little hands and feet. If you rub the sponge too much it starts to peel off--we've already replaced ours once and my baby is only 6 months old. But, we bought it again because I couldn't find anything better, and now I know to be more gentle with it. Good, cheap buy!
B0017AE3BO It is very convenient.  The shampoo dispenser is awesome.  You fon't use a lot of shampoo, and the brush at the end is soft to wash my infant's hair.  The only inconvenience was the dispenser button.  It does not tell the amount of shampoo dispensed;  however, once you start using it, you will know.
B0017AE3BO I got this cause my baby has cradle cap, it really works the brush is just the perfect size and strenght for a baby I was able to used it on the dry hair to loose the flakes first, worked great. I was not worry too much about the dispenser wich it did not work very well with me, but I think is because of the consistency of the special shampoo I used for craddle cap wich is kind of heavy liquid, so it was taking too long for the dispenser to work and with a wet baby in the tub that moves a LOT you want to be quick I just used the shampoo as it is and the brush and I really liked it, I honestly recomend this one cause I also used the little sponge to bath my baby : )
B0017AE3BO I love this brush.  I love that it dispenses shampoo/body wash, I love the shape, I love that it is a sponge and a scrubber all in one.  However, they are not durable at all.  I've gone through 2 in 3 months (I bathe my son every 2 days).  I first thought that maybe I got a lemon, but the same thing happened to the second brush I ordered. The sponge is glued on and starts to slowly detach until the product becomes unusable.  I really wish they would figure out how to make it more durable because having it fall apart after 15-20 uses is unacceptable.
B0017AE3BO The brush I use in the bath, really just because I like to see her hair all brushed and her scalp stimulated, but it is useless otherwise. It is not good for skin, and the sponge side is not maneuverable enough to use in her crevases. I use a washcloth or my hands for most of her bathing. It would probably be more interesting if a baby has a lot of hair.
B0017JB6HY I ended up going to buy one of these after my baby was born. My newborn needed to be swaddled to stay asleep for any length of time. Trying to swaddle with a blanket was too hard. This product has velcro to help keep it snug. I like that the bottom pouch can be undone for diaper changes. I don't think that the Sleep Sack brand swaddlers work any better, so the price difference is a huge factor in my recommending this product. I recently bought the larger size for my daughter now that she's grown out of the small.
B0017JB6HY My daughter was less than 5 pounds when she came home from the hospital and this swaddle wrap was the one that fit her best.  It is very easy to get baby in and out of this wrap and it was much more difficult for her to free her arm from this wrap versus the Halo Sleepsack.  She is now 8 lbs and the wrap is a little tight on her already.  There is no way this swaddle would fit a bigger infant - I would recommend getting a bigger size if your baby is 7.5-8 lbs or more.
B0017JB6HY These swaddles are great because they keep the child secure.  When my child got old enough to start rolling over, we stop swaddling the arms and just swaddle around the chest.  It becomes a routine to wrap them up and put them to bed.  My daughter actually smiles when I get the swaddle out, because she knows when it is time to go to sleep.
B0017JB6HY So many cute prints!  This is much easier to use than to try to swaddle with a regular receiving blanket.  Also can keep baby swaddled without undoing the entire thing.
B0017JB6HY We have 4 of these and they are wonderful!  We swaddle under his arms because I don't like things too close to his head and he pulls his arms out anyway, but these keep him warm and happy!
B0017JB6HY not worth the money for me. I'd rather just wrap my baby in a blanket, like a burrito..she'd get more use out of that anyway. She only used this product about 4x. by the time she was around 2 months old, she was too big for it.
B0017JB6HY it was just ok - either my baby was super strength baby or I just wasn't wrapping her correctly, but she would bust out of it every single time. I did much better with a big swaddling blanket and swaddling her the old school way - i probably only tried to use this a few times and gave up.
B0017JB6HY I absolutely love this product! It's very soft and comfy and it keeps my baby nice and cozy.I love the fact that I do not have to un-swaddle her completely for the diaper change. Also it's very easy to use, even my husband can do it :-)))
B0017LCZEU These are great for creating memories in your home.My wife and I struggled with trying to get our child to put his hand into the print without bending his fingers (trying to grab the clay) but ultimately after trying a few times (rerolling the clay) succeeded. We bought an extra set to produce more so that instead of giving each of them (our set produced 2) to our parents and leaving her with none&#8230; she will now have this precious keepsake as well.Things to keep in mind here&#8230;-clay doesn't dry in 1 o 2 days; ours took probably 5  days and had to be flipped over so that bottom could dry-product cracks slightly depending on how it dries (read instructions carefully)-Ribbon provided is green, yellow and pink so if you have a boy and produce two of these you'll have to use the neutral color as wellGood product.. cost effective for 'imprinting' a moment in the life of your child and yours.
B0017LCZEU So the kit has the ability to make two keepsakes, which is great as it will make Christmas presents for both set of grandparents. Really easy to use. Just have to make sure the clay is soft. Made impressions of my lo's hands then left them out to dry. Once dry, I'll attach the ribbons and wrap for presents. Wonderful idea.Update: they dried really well and truly hard. Both sets of grandparents absolutely loved it and can't wait to display it. So good that I'm buying another set to keep for myself.
B0017LCZEU These were great and just what I had been looking for.  I've seen it since in stores for similar price but I was many, many months pregnant at the time I bought.  Much more convenient to order from Amazon. I was able to get 2 molds from it. Highly recommend.
B0017LCZEU I made two hand print ornaments from this kit.  The dough was easy to roll, and I really liked the final product.  The ornament was a bit boring, so I painted it with glitter and glazed it for shine.
B0017LCZEU These did not turn out good at all even after following all the directions. They dried very cracked as opposed to a smooth surface as pictured. I do not recommend.
B0017LCZEU follow the directions closely and you  shouldn't have any issues.Mine turned out very lovely and i couldn't be happier. i did a bunch of them for christmas gifts too ( you can only make 2 from each box tho, i'm saying i bought more to use as christmas gifts)don't put them near direct heat or direct cold and they will last in better condition.
B0017LCZEU We haven't made these yet... they are going to be Christmas presents for the grandparents. Can't wait to make them with my son! :) (He's 8 weeks)
B0017LCZEU This is another must have, we put her little foot prints up every Christmas, I'm so glad I got this!
B0017LCZEU Skip the round mold and the straw that are included with this kit as they leave rough edges. Best to roll 1/3 - 1/2 of the clay into a ball in your hands with a sprinkle of water then flatten it out, ideally onto something non-stick, by hand or with a smooth bottomed plate that's also been spritzed with water. Immediately press baby's hand or foot into the clay in a gentle but firm rolling motion from heel to toe or palm to fingertips then quickly touch up any edge cracking with moistened finger tips.My disks took about a week to fully cure during dry mid-Winter. Even then they should be very carefully removed from whatever surface they're drying on and the back may still not be entirely smooth. The included ribbon is &#34;meh&#34; in quality and color and you'll need a thin acrylic paint from a craft or art store anyway if you don't want to keep the matte white clay finish. To add ribbon holes I used a low volt power drill with progressively larger drill bits until I got the diameter I wanted.
B0017LCZEU Used these when my baby was 2 weeks old. Very easy to work with, and they turned out great. Definitely recommend!
B0017LCZEU Finally I found one that worked! It was great. There wasn't a strict time limit so if I wasn't able to get a good print, I just started over again until it was right. It dried in a few days and stayed hard. I would do it again.
B0017LCZEU Since I was having my first child, I wanted to do everything. I got these around Christmas and tried them. the first time was a disaster. I followed the directions but the clay kept getting stuck to the cutter. finally I used my head and sprayed pam on the round cutter before cutting into the clay. best idea ever! if you get this, remember what I said. itll come in handy.
B0017LCZEU I loved making keepsakes of my baby's hand and foot. The instructions were clear, and easy to do. There were 3 ribbons to choose from. Pink, blue, and yellow.
B0017LCZEU The clay is easy to use and roll out, but I did not think that they impressions came out too clearly. Overall a good bet due to the fact that they are easy to use and inexpensive, but you sacrifice detail due to the nature of the clay, which almost has a spongy quality to it.
B0017LCZEU This is one of the best ways to preserve your child's hand or footprint.  Easy to mold and shape, dries nicely.  SOOOOOO much better than dealing with plaster!!!!  This material is awesome!
B0017LCZEU This kit makes a great Christmas gift or a way to commemorate baby's itsy-bitsy feet and hands for yourself and loved ones. I purchased the keepsake kit for a memento of my son's hands and feet. It contains a sealed package of the molding clay, three ribbons (pink, yellow, and blue), a pointy straw for making a hole, a dinky little roller that's not up to the task of rolling out the clay efficiently, a large round cardboard cutter, and basic instructions on how to create the ornaments.I strongly advise adding parchment paper to the list, not just to protect your countertops or table, but also for allowing the ornaments to dry. The hardening period takes anywhere from 4 to 7 days, and the parchment paper ensured the back of the clay was not exposed, disturbed, or crumbly. Parchment paper also makes for easy transfer.Making an ornament is straightforward. Roll out the clay to desired thickness, fight with your squirmy baby's reflexes to spontaneously curl his toes or contract her precious little hand into a fist, press down gently for an impression while your newborn honks blue murder, and then examine the results. With some luck, you may have a reasonable impression and an infuriated spouse co-opted into this special form of infantile torment. Didn't know that babies generally refuse to spread their fingers and adorable little toes when asked? Well, now you do. My husband decided to roll out the clay again for a second impression, and a third, at my insistence because the ravenous claw marks scratched over the white surface rather resembled an attack by a very tiny, very persistent velociraptor. Not exactly what I had in mind for enshrining my 8-week-old's most precious extremities.Once you do manage to gain an impression - preferably after a bottle of wine, I'll note, but not if you're the nursing mother - then keep it inside the wooden frame for best results. Drying may be a smidge slower, but without risk of cracking or falling apart by some act of circumstance. We used a large round cookie cutter in addition to the cardboard ornament cutter provided; between the two, the metal cookie cutter worked far better for clean edges and punching through the clay. The cardboard was shorter and flimsier.The results are very attractive though. Note for an average sized 2 month old baby, two plaques is all we managed to eke out without some creative positioning.
B0017LCZEU Product worked exactly as the package stated.  I had plenty of clay to make 2 keepsakes and had a little clay left over.  You do have to press firmly on your child's hand to get the imprint but the clay was moist enough that I could try again if I didn't like results the first time.  Since my daughter is only 6 months old, I had enough room on the edges of my keepsakes to add little christmas buttons for some color.  Fun project.
B0017LCZEU Pros:- Enough clay to do the job- Good parts and instructions- Easy to use- Dries fairly quickly i guess (2 days)Cons:- As it dried it got small visible cracks, nothing chipped off nor did it break, just visible cracks- It's HEAVY.  May have to screw the tree to the ground so it doesn't tip over (haha)We've since bought a \"bake it\" kit and we like the results much better.  It's much lighter, no cracks and seems more sturdy.
B0017LCZEU I bought this and it was so easy to use!  The only hard part was getting my 7 month old to not move her hand when I was trying to make the imprint, though the foot was no problem. I think it would be smarter if next time I did it with a with a sleeping baby!  I was actually able to get four great ornaments out of this set, though I did not make extremely thick ornaments. I made 4, 1/8 inch thick ornaments,  The clay was very easy to use.  I used a bigger straw than the one given as it was much easier to thread the ribbon through.
B0017LCZEU I really enjoyed making my son's handprint and footprint from this kit. I'm glad it is something I can look at every Christmas.
B0017LCZEU It went together easy and even held up to multiple kneading.  My son tended to grab it once we made the impression and so we had to redo it multiple times.  Eventually had to hold him upside down so the his catch reflex triggered and he held his hands out. LOL. But we got it and then it was easy to use the tools to cut it and the hole for the ribbon out and the ribbons were great. We were actually able to make two with one kit.
B0017LCZEU I actually spread the clay out to make 3 ornaments for Christmas. It was easy. It took about 3 days for the clay to dry in a moist climate.
B0017LCZEU This \"kit\" consists of:-A sealed package of molding material-A \"hole punch.\"  It is actually part of a drinking straw.  Literally.  It is the bottom few inches of a flimsy, striped plastic drinking straw.-A \"rolling pin.\"  This is a piece of dowel, about 1/2\" in diameter.-A wooden cookie-cutter.  Adequate for the job but leave sloppy edges.-Three lengths of ribbon: 1 blue, 1 pink, and 1 cream/yellowish in colorThe material is easy to work with and is a good consistency.  I was able to make 2 ornaments with a bit left over.  (I would not have had enough material to make 3.)  So, this kit will definitely provide what you need to make 2 plaques as advertised.  But given what it includes, it's difficult to see what justifies the price.  It's a chunk of synthetic clay plus a few pennies' worth of add-ons.Okay, a couple of tips for use of this product:1.  If you have a round biscuit cutter or cookie-cutter of an appropriate size, definitely use that instead of the cutter they provide - you'll get much cleaner edges!2.  The packaging said that the ornaments would dry in 1-2 days.  I did not find this to be true.  It took nearly a week before mine were fully hardened and dry.  I live in a desert climate, so I do not think humidity was the issue.  So, if you are planning to make these as a gift, DO NOT wait until the last minute -- give yourself plenty of lead time for them to dry!!
B0017LCZEU very cute project. We did this with our one month old. It was very hard to do it with a one month old. came out okay. Had to give it a couple of tries. Dried well. Love the ribbons.
B0017LCZEU Our family loved getting these for Christmas!  They were pretty easy to make, although we didn't like the cutters that they provided because they left the edges really ragged.  We just formed our own little circles.  I would use them early on though because our 4-mo-old's feet were nearly too big for the ornament!
B0017LCZEU I though this clay came with the stand; the picture is misleading. It takes a few tries before you get it right, but works well!
B0017LCZEU the clay molds very well, and the circle cutter and straw work great to create a classy-looking ornament. 4 stars because the circle was too small for my (large) 4.5 month-old's foot! (says it's good for up to two years old) so now I have one really nice hand ornament and one messy looking foot ornament. Overall would buy again though.
B0017LCZEU This kit is very user friendly.  Easy to use.  However, the clay is too hard.  I'm debating whether to purchase another one because I think I need to apply more pressure when doing the hand prints to get deeper better prints.  However, I pushed down on the sleeping baby's hand pretty hard.  The cutter was bad as all the other reviews say, I used a box cutter to cut away the excess left from the circular cutter provided in the kit.  Forget about using the &#34;rolling pin&#34; they provide unless you want weird dents in your clay and uneven clay..I used my own rolling pin.  Given the price and the fact that 2 of the items included in the kit I had to use my own household item or improvise I give it 3 stars majority going towards ease of use.  Note: apply pressure when doing hand prints! Don't hurt your little one though!!
B0017LCZEU The kit itself was easy, getting my newborn to unclinch her fist to make the hand print not so much. The kit had everything I needed and I was actually able to make 4 placques!  My only reserve, was it seemed to crack a little bit when it dried.  It's not extremely noticeable, so I only took off one star.  It could have also been user error.  However, right after I bought and made this I saw a recipe for a handprint mold on pinterest with flour and water.  Might try that next time before I buy another kit.
B0017LCZEU I ordered this kit to make tree ornaments of my baby's hand and foot prints for her first Christmas.  They turned out so well!  I'm not sure why the instructions say to roll it out 3/4 inch thick though.  A half inch would be plenty to leave a print and would be less heavy.  My baby was about 10 months when we did these and was able to fit her hand in the circle provided.  I just rolled out the remaining piece free form for her foot.  There was no mess for the baby and they dried in a few days.
B0017LCZEU You could probably make your own salt dough and save some money instead of buying this product. I was not impressed.
B0017LCZEU I don't recommend making 3 keepsakes out of one package but you can split in half and soften half at a time and it's a perfect amount.  I used everything provided in the package and they turned out great.  I made one of baby's hand and one of his foot.  Some of the reviewers were talking about putting a lot of pressure on baby's hand to make a good imprint but I found that to be untrue, i did not have to hurt a baby to make an imprint LOL.  Just make sure you soften it better and it's very soft.
B0017LCZEU We used this to make ornaments for our family members and it worked out great. If you roll the clay flat enough, you can actually get 3 hand prints. I used a glitter paint and added a touch of shine to it. Looks beautiful on our tree and we'll have it as a keepsake for years to come.
B0017LCZEU This clay works really well and is the old school type clay that captures every groove and fingerprint. I also used the pearhead kit but liked this one way better. Faster drying time and better imprints. I was also able to make 5 ornaments out of one kit!
B0017LCZEU Amazing ornaments.. Took about a week to complete.. But if you take the time to dry, sand edges, spray paint,then decorate, you will have amazing results! I glues a picture to the back of mine and decorated. Best time investment! They're only little once. I bought two sets and made 6 ornaments.
B0017LCZEU Cane out perfect could have probably made 3 plaques...very easy to do... Plan to do it again once he's older like school age
B0017LCZEU Very easy to use and you don't have to bake them!  Very please with this purchase.  I gave them out as gifts
B0017LCZEU It did the job, the only con is it's a bit heavy when dry which only concerns me because I'm using it as Christmas ornament.  I was able to imprint both the hand and foot of my 4 month old baby.
B0017LCZEU Easy to use and enough to do the twins hands as well as leftover for a dog paw! It came with three ribbons so it worked out perfect! Takes awhile to dry but no biggie.
B0017LCZEU These were a pain to make and did not turn out well at all.  I didn't realize how awful the material was until I had opened the container, so it was too late to return.  I found this to be a total waste of money.
B0017LCZEU Was able to make three keepsakes out of this and it was pretty easy to do!  The hard part was figuring out when to do it since mine are 9 months old and it's hard keeping them still.  I tried to do their feet, but they were far too big now for that, I'd recommend that for a newborn if you're going to do it.  The issue is, they tend to move their hands a lot.  So mine weren't perfect, but really, that in itself was nice to have captured.
B0017LCZEU Clear instructions, extra clay, added ribbons. Everything makes the kit complete. Not too pricey compared to some other similar products.
B0017NC77I This is very handy and I would not buy a big stroller again.  We went to the Rec center and the elevator was broken so I shrugged my shoulders and pulled my kid out, folded it down, and swung it over my shoulder.  This is definitively a great little stroller and very light.  The only thing I miss is being able to have a small diaper bag hanging on the bar while I pill my kid out.  I know you are not supposed to do that!  This will fall over because the stroller is so light.
B0017NC77I This is a fantastic umbrella stroller.  I picked this over the Maclaren Vollo and am extremely pleased.  A few things I love about it:--The sunshade is huge and can extend almost all the way down over the baby.  Also, a flap in the back protects them from the sun in that direction, while making it easy to peek down and check on them when pushing them.--The place where the straps click together has a little flap that velcros down over it.  Probably not necessary, but a nice feature.--The seat insert comes out VERY easily for washing.--The seat insert in a nice meshy type fabric that seems cool for hot weather.--The seat isn't as deep as the Vollo, meaning that smaller babies can ride in this without slumping over as much.  I know, they tell you to wait for 6 months to use these, but I was able to put my 3.5 month in here no problem because of the way the seat is made, its just more supportive than the Vollo.--Unlike the Vollo, this stroller has a built in stand, so that the stroller stands up when folded!  Wheels don't touch the sunshade or anything, so nothing gets dirty.--The fold is easy, although does require two hands.  The unfold can be done with one hand.
B0017NC77I I got this stroller for a international trip back to the USA with my 2 1/2 year old.  I needed a light umbrella stroller but didn't want to give up and get ones of those cheap 10 dollar ones.  I LOVE this stroller.  It is super light. It is really easy to fold up on my own and quickly when I am in line for security. The back basket was SO easy to get to.  I have tried to get into the backs of a Mclaren stroller before it was much harder.  This was a great buy and worth it for our trip. I love that the padding is removable for washing or for hot days.  I have noticed that since my trip my stroller doesn't stand on its own as well either.
B0017NC77I Like many reviewers, I chose the G-Lite narrowly over the MacLaren Volo.  After 3 months of use, I like the stroller quite a 
B0017NC77I I bought this stroller because it's so light and easy on my back!Here are the reasons I love it:-Super light-Easy to maneuver, even with one hand-nice large canopy-removable seat so you can wash easily-decent sized basket-Easy to open and close-Stands up when closed (This is SO nice!)I really have no complaints right now. We use the stroller for either quick trips outside or quick errands. The terrain around my house is pretty rugged, so we use our Vista for neighborhood walks. This is really just for me to be able to pop baby in the stroller if I want to run an errand or shop in a small store. Even though it doesn't recline, we decided it probably wouldn't matter for us since I only use for quick trips.**To address some problems people have had**Before purchasing I read that some people had problems with the basket catching on the closing mechanism, but I haven't had that problem. Also, I'm 5'3\" and haven't had problems kicking the wheels. My Father-in-law is much taller than me and my husband - He's around 6' and did kick the wheels quite a bit.**Money-Saving Tip**...Uppababy usually comes out with an updated line of their strollers every year around February/March I think. Check for sales on the older versions then; there are usually not that many worthy changes to the newer ones (though, sometimes there are). I know one year the only change were the color options, and they still lowered the price!
B0017NC77I The stroller image shown for Jake is for the higher priced g-LUXE model, not g-LITE....this model does not recline, has smaller black wheels, and not fold up footrest for infants. This listing is incorrect, hopefully they will correct it soon to show the actual item you receive.
B0017NC77I I went into a local stroller store with my heart set on buying the Maclaren volo and ended up walking out with this stroller instead.  The reasons I was going to get the Volo were1.  Lightweight--I needed a stroller to take on the subway that I might actually be able to carry up and down the stairs if i had too.  Our other stroller (City Mini) is fantastic but just too heavy for me to do that alone.2.  Mesh sides.  I wanted something that would be cool for summer since often I carry him in a Mei Tai but in the summer it just gets too hot.  I planned on getting a universal seat liner for the winter to insulate hiis back a bit.3.  Easily steerable with one hand.The reasons I ended up with the G Lite are1.  I picked up both strollers and this really did feel lighter--not by much but every bit helps.  Ultimately with all the accessories I2.  This has a cushy seat liner that is meshy and looks cool but is also a little padded.  BUT you can remove it and there is a full mesh only seat underneath, perfect for really hot days.  WIth this I don't need to worry about his butt getting too cold in winter and don't need to buy an extra piece (which only adds to the price) and I can have it be even cooler on very hot days.  Additionally the seat pad is included in the weight so the stroller only gets lighter if you remove it, while the Volo would just get heavier if you added one on.3.  The sun hood is not as big as with the Volo BUT it is pivotable so you can tilt it forward, the Maclaren can't do that.  Because of the way the back apron on the hood is set up it is easier to peek in on your baby in the stroller--I really hated that it was so hard to see him when he was in the Maclaren.  The sun hood doesn't seem like it is water resistant like the Maclaren but since I have to keep the raincover on us all the time for walking around the city it isn't a big deal.4.  I think it is easier to steer and turns more easily.5.  The basket is more accessible, though not quite as deep.6.  It folds so so so so much easier.  I always get really frustrated with Maclarens and folding, I just can't seem to do it easily.7.  I like that this can stand on it's own since our apartment isn't that big.8.  It comes with a cup holder.9.  The rain hood has a mesh panel in front of their face so you can flip the vinyl up there and some fresh air can get in.  I'm not a fan of vinyl stroller covers since you are basically enclosing your child in the very stuff we are trying to keep out of their toys, but they are a necessity.  When it is only lightly raining I always debate about whether to use it or not.  Since this sun hood really isn't water resistant it isn't really a debate with this stroller, but the lift up flap makes me feel like there is a little more ventilation going on in there.  There are also holes in the rain hood which I think are odd and I'm guessing are going to be annoying in a rain storm, but my son isn't made of sugar and I'd rather him get some fresh air and get a little damp from time to time.10.  The rain hood is lighter weight than the Volo's and since I carry it on the stroller all the time this makes the stroller even lighter still.11.  Price.  At my local store this stroller was 99 dollars and the rain hood 20 so all together it was $120.  The Maclaren is then $10 more (it came with a rain hood, but not all do).  But since I also was planning on buying a seat liner for winter it is actually a more significant amount.12.  construction.  After looking at the Uppa Baby the MAclaren fabric seems kind of cheap or flimsier.  On an old Volo that we inherited and were replacing (because it was falling apart) the seat fabric was falling off the hooks that attach it to the frame.  I would hook it back on and find it falling off again an hour or so later.  The Uppa Baby seat wraps around the frame so it seems sturdier.13.  Posture.  In the G Lite the baby sits more forward in the stroller than in the Maclaren.  But in the Maclaren he seemed more slouchy and hunched over.  His posture was better in this stroller and it seems to have better support.14.  The brakes.  I hate engaging the Maclaren brakes, these are much easier.  That is a much more safer option since I use them more frequently when it isn't a pain.And then as I pushed it home I discovered15.  Because the frame is structured so the babies weight is more toward the front of the stroller it doesn't seem to tip backward as easily.  The diaper bag I had on the handle bars stayed easily with my son in the stroller and there was no threatening to tip.  In our old Volo that was absolutely not true.  As I was pushing it I could feel it was back heavy and might tip if I let go.  I don't really recommend putting a diaper bag that heavy on the handlebars but it is nice to know this can accommodate a little more weight.Weighing the stroller with the sun cover, rain cover, cup holder, seat liner, and maclaren organizer it weighs 10 pounds.  The Volo with all these things would weigh at least 11.Everyone is different and will feel differently about these two very similar strollers, so I really recommend checking them out in person--you might change your mind too!
B0017NC77I I have an UppaBaby Vista for everyday and love it, so I got the G-Lite for shorter trips, mainly travel.  I love how light it is, and easy to carry with the carry-strap.  It's easy to fold and carry up and down stairs.  However, we've realized that we now need to buy another stroller for travel, because the G-Lite doesn't have recline.The 7 lb weight is simply amazing, but the stroller doesn't look cheap. It looks high-tech with its aluminum frame and bright colors.  The sunshade is great, really covering the baby.  And the fold, while two handed, is easy to do while holding the baby on my hip.  Also, thank you, Uppa, for adding a cupholder to this model.This stroller, however, sacrifices some features for its lightness.  You will not have a tray (not a problem for us), or any cushy strap-covers or pillows.  Also, for us, the big problem is that it doesn't recline.  We should have thought more about the G-Luxe, but we figured we'd use the Vista for day-long journeys.  Rather, when you travel and can't pack the Vista (or don't want to lug it in and out of the subway), the G-Luxe would have been a better choice.  Also, like all umbrella strollers, you shouldn't take your child out while the diaper bag is slung on the handles, as it will fall over.You see, we just took the G-Lite to NYC for the day.  It was great, with its kickstand, to fold up on the subway.  Slung over my shoulder, it was easy to carry up the narrow stairs at some of the stations.  We could fold it up at restaurants.  The underside basket is a little small but we were able to store a small bag down there.  However, the problem came in that my child could not nap in this stroller.  We had him all around Germany in a Teutonia, which reclines all the way like a bed, and he just took naps in it.  So we thought we'd have no problem on vacation in New York.  But with this stroller, he either lolled forward, or his head lay on the folding mechanism.  He slept very poorly and was in a terrible mood as a result.  We are now looking at other umbrella strollers with recline, like the Mac Quest and Uppa G-Luxe for our travel stroller.  Meanwhile, we will definitely keep the G-Lite in our trunks for quick mall jaunts.
B0017NC77I We love this stroller.  It is well worth the extra money.  It is light, attractive, has a bit of storage, and folds easily.  It has a great shoulder strap for carrying -- I carry it up and down 3 flights of stairs, daily, while I'm holding my one-year old and a diaper bag.  Unlike the UPPAbaby vista, which we also have, this one has a foot lock that is easy to work.  The harness is very easy to use.  My only complaint:  the cup holder broke off of mine.  But to be fair, I dropped the stroller on its side (without the baby in it!)  I highly recommend this stroller.
B0017NC77I This stroller is brilliant. It's very easy to set up, within a couple minutes you're ready to roll. The wheels turn on a dime. The handles are long enough for both my husband (6' and me 5'5\") and I to push without kicking the wheels. My daughter is 3 and loves riding in it. It's ability to stand up on it's own when folded makes it easy to take to restaurants or sports games and put it aside. The net underneath is big enough to store a kids backpack and your purse. It's great for travel, goes anywhere easily. We also have a quinny, that while I love it, this one is so much better for everyday use. It has all the benefits but is so much smaller and lightweight.Nevermind a one hand fold, this has a one finger fold. You pull the tab and it collapses, the safety keeps you from pulling the tab while anyone is in it. There's no cons for the stroller, I can't believe it's only $107!
B0017NC77I I purchased this in preparation of our up-coming airline and Disney trip and like it thus far.  Three things that really make this stroller stand out are: 1) Lightweight 2) Nice/functional sun canopy 3) Useable/accessible basket (I got rid of my Maclaren over the pathetic basket). This stroller is easy to fold and re-open and the stand up feature and shoulder carry strap are a plus.  The fold on this stroller doesn't achieve a complete flat fold like a Maclaren, but it is not far off.  My husband is 6'5\" and I am 5'5\" and we both find it easy to push without kicking the back wheels too.  This didn't happen for my husband with my former Maclaren Techo.  This stroller doesn't recline, but I am okay with that since my kids have never slept in a stroller.  Overall, I am happy with my purchase and my up-coming trip will really put it to the test.  My only wishes would be 1) built to handle more weight than 40 pound child 2)Optional snap on and tilt to one side so child could exit snack tray. 3)larger wheels to handle all terrain.Update --- stroller handled airline travel well and was great at Disney.  I had the stroller basket packed with snacks, clothes and towels and it did great!  One signficant problem I had was the seat fabric bunching up and getting trapped around the locking mechanism when folding the stroller which resulted in ripping the top and bottom of the seat in addition to putting a hold dead center where the locking mechanism was.  I called UppaBaby customer service and they were FANTASTIC! I took pictures of the damage and scanned my stroller receipt and emailed it to them.  I had a replacement stroller in three days!  Now that is customer service!
B0017NNSRQ This was to match the nursery theme in our new grandson's room! Just precious! I was very impressed at how well it was made. Stitching was close and tight and just perfect for a baby!!! It was quite a bit larger than I expected it to be and just adorable. Now he's almost a year old and he loves it too!!!
B0017NNSRQ I'm not so sure what all the hype is over this monkey. When I got him he felt very stiff to the touch, not soft and cuddly like stuffed animals should be. He's cute but not what I expected in a baby/toddler toy. I sent him back and had to pay about as much for shipping as the toy cost, so no refund there!
B0017NNSRQ This is a darling stuffed monkey and perfect for a young one if you take the ribbon off.  He is cute, soft and great for a young one because the face is stiched and painted on.  I bought it for my daughter who is decorating the babies room with a zoo theme.
B0017NNSRQ I bought this for my newborn daughter, though she's far too small (and unaware) for it yet. My 2-year-old son saw it, and loves it! So I may be buying a 2nd one for his little sister. Seems well-made and doesn't seem like it will fall apart quickly. As someone else noted, it has an un-removable \"necklace\" that says NoJo all the way around. Frustrating, but the animal itself is very good.Good animal, minus stupid necklace = 4 stars
B0017NNSRQ This monkey was pretty big and you cant take off the neck thing it has. Hes a cute monkey, but my kid didnt really seem to care for him.
B0017OAGHU I use this all the time for my mattress when a diaper leaks. It leaves my mattress smelling clean (a little strong-smelling, but I can live with that) and neutralizes the urine smell. No idea why it isn't carried in stores.
B0017OAGHU This is the best stain remover. Sometimes you have to scrub or soak it for a while but it gets out stains that I had trouble getting out with bleach even! I've found it in stores at Meijer, and Babies r us, and I think Walmart. Great product, I recommend it to all new moms!
B0017OAGHU I used it on a mattress. Followed instructions on bottle. Stains are still barely there, but absolutely no order left behind.I also use it on clothes.
B0017OAGHU Works well but its a little expensive. dawn dish soap works a little better and is a much cheaper option.
B0017OAGHU What i love about this is that you DO NOT have to let the remover soak and sit on it. You can JUST SPRAY IT & THROW IT RIGHT IN THE WASH! NO worries, Ive actually gotten to the point where after its done washing i wont even look to see if the stain is gone, i just know its vanished! LIKE MAGIC!
B0017OAGHU Does not get those tough stains out. Great for a toddler who doesnt spill/play in dirt but if your kids are like mine, they are filthy by the end of the day and this just wont cut it.
B0017P3LQW I bought this despite the bad reviews and I wanted to wait until I had really used it before I wrote a review to see how well it would hold up.  Now that winter is coming to an end, I have to say that I wouldn't have wanted to go through the winter without the 212 blanket.  Walking and subway are my primary form of transportation and my 1yr old son and I walk about one mile home together from daycare every evening so there is no way to avoid my son being out in some cold and windy weather.  I've used the 212 Blanket every day for the last 3 months and I've been very happy with it.  I did have a minor issue with the quality (there is a pacifier strap on the inside and the snap broke the first time I tried to use it) but other than that the Blanket is still like new.  I have a lighter weight stroller blanket (JJ Cole Urban Toddler Bundle Me - Stealth) for the spring and fall but I needed something more substantial that would stand up to a New England winter.  With the 212 Blanket my son is always warm no matter how cold or windy it is.  It also does a great job of keeping him dry if there's light snow.  The convenience factor of this product is huge.  When I pick my son up from daycare I don't have to worry about getting him to sit still long enough to wrangle him into a snow suit.  I put him in the stroller and zip up the blanket 212.  If it's really windy or cold then I'll also add a hat.  If I did a coat too it would be too warm most of the time, although I have added a coat once or twice when the weather was extreme.  If it's especially windy, I find my son will pull up the blanket to cover more of his face but most of the time we walk around and all you see is a little baby's face poking out of the stroller.  I like that it's an adjustable size so I can keep him warmer by keeping it snug.  The straps are very adjustable so I imagine it would fit most strollers well.  There are extra velcro attachments on the underside to help it stay put on the stroller.  I use it with my BOB Revolution and the only \"fit\" problem is that the sunshield on the stroller sometimes gets in the way of the hood of the blanket when I'm putting my son in or taking him out.  I could probably get around that if I unzipped and re-zipped the hood while putting my son in the stroller, but it's not irritating enough to warrant the extra effort.  In the next several weeks I'll probably be putting the blanket 212 into storage.  I can't imagine having gone through this winter without our blanket 212 and I look forward to using it again next winter.
B0017P3LQW We have had this product for about a month now in NYC, and it keeps my son very  warm and also seems to improve the quality of his stroller naps when we move him from one location to another.  They don't provide instructions on how to install this anywhere, which I find kind of annoying, so you just have to try to figure it out yourself.  Hence the 4 stars.
B0017P3LQW Great product - just what we needed for our daily walks in the city.  It fits the stroller great (we have a baby jogger mini and regular size too) and it keeps our 15 month old toddler nice and cozy.  It's machine washable, and adjustable so when we're ready we can lenghen it.  You can also zip open the hood and roll each side back, so it's nice to have that option.  We expect to use it for several winters.  Highly recommend this product.
B0017P3LQW Now that it served my son for almost four months, I can say that I like just about everything about this product - the look, the quality, the level of warmth it provides.  Highly recommend!
B0017P3LQW worked great in my bugaboo chameleon, almost too warm, a little big for a newborn. like that it's grows with my child.
B0017P3LQW I walk a lot with my family and we would not be as active during the cold weather without this bunting. It has been invaluable to me and my little ones during the winter.  It is very warm; perfect for children who dislike layers. Prior to owning the Blanket 212 I used aJJ Cole Urban Bundleme, Stealth, Infant. When my child outgrew the JJ Cole bunting I knew I needed something more substantial, I found this and I am glad I purchased it. Here is my list of pros and cons:Pros:- Very warm.- Doesn't slide down the seat when getting my child in and out.- Adjustable length and width- Looks great- Useful front pocket- Washable- Easily converts from toddler to baby sizeThe B212 has served us well for one child through 2 winters but now that I have a second baby I wanted to use this again and I have run into a few problems.Cons:- Not very durable. The bunting has begun to unravel at the seams of the hood and where the harness straps thread through the body of the bunting.- Hood isn't removable. This is important to me because my baby gets very hot while sleeping and sweats a lot from her head and neck.- Doesn't fit all of the strollers I own. Fits the City Mini and Mountain Buggy Urban but does not fit the UPPAbaby Vista or Cosatto umbrella strollers well.- When shortened to accommodate a baby the bottom is drafty.I still believe this item deserves 4 stars and I wouldn't hesitate to purchase this again. I used this with my first child from 18 months to 3 years and sparingly for my now 7 month old. I did contact 7A.M customer service about the seams unraveling and while they were unable to repair or replace the bunting the response was fairly quick and very cordial.
B0017S2S86 I've been using this mattress for six months and it's great.  There are no dents or impressions in it.  I am looking forward to being able to still use this when she is a toddler.
B0017S2S86 Really like this crib Mattress. Especially the 2 sidesInfant & toddler sides with different firmness.Got 1st mattress as a gift for daughter #1 & bought second one for baby#2!
B0017S2S86 DaVinci Emily II 2-in-1 6\" 242 Coil MattressI bought this mattress as a replacement of an older 2-in-1 mattress that my toddler used from birth (a Sealy from Babies R Us).  When it came time to purchase a new one, the Sealys were all sold out on Amazon, so I picked out this model as a \"next-best\" without remembering exactly how much I spent on the previous one.  The price seemed a little steep, but once I saw how much comparable models go for in stores, I felt a little better.It isn't as heavy as the previous mattress, and is actually a bit softer in the springs.  I am not sure what the coil count is for the other mattress.  I couldn't really detect any major difference in \"bounce\" from the infant to toddler side for either mattress.One thing I wish I'd looked into is whether it had a handle on the sides, which makes it easier for lifting in and out of the crib when you're changing the sheet.  This particular model does not, but it is still fairly easy to manage.So I guess I'd say this mattress is okay for quality, but you're probably just as well off buying a single sided mattress from the store and save your money.  There's rarely a huge difference on any of the 2-sided mattresses, and your toddler isn't likely to notice anyway.
B0017S2S86 I'm giving this product 3.5 stars. I received this along with the DaVinci Emily 4-in-1 Convertible Crib as part of my baby registry. I specifically wanted this mattress because of the value and fit to the DaVinci Emily crib. After reading existing reviews on multiple mattresses, I was concerned about the mattress fit in the crib since last thing I want are mishaps happening to my child. So after much research again and countless hours of reading consumer reports, I figured I can't go wrong with the fit if the mattress is also by the same manufacturer as the crib. I even measure the mattress area of the crib to make sure I got the exact measurements to that of what's published on the product description!The Emily 2 Sided Mattress was exactly what I had measured in the crib BUT when it arrived and I applied it into the Emily crib,the measurements are off from what's listed on Amazon's product details and the product box that it came in by a few centimeters on all 4 sides. Most parents might be fine with this considering how many other mattresses out there are off by inches rather than centimeters but considering baby safety, I was a bit concern of her fingers or toes getting stuck between the mattress and crib rails. So in the end, did I keep this product?I did - with some reinforcements to those centimeter gaps. I took up another reviewer's advice from another DaVinci mattress and stuck some towels on the side facing the wall, which worked perfectly and kept the mattress amazingly snugged in the crib with absolutely no gaps anywhere; and with the crib bumpers, you can't even tell there were towels involved!The big plus of this mattress I must add is 
B0017S2S86 After 4-month use, it is already sagging in middle. Fortunately, I am moving and so I will have to buy a new one, of course, a different one.
B0017S2S86 I got this mattress to match my Emily crib, figuring if I ordered the two products from the same manufacturer, there won't be any guess work with sizing issues (I read some reviews in which the mattress didn't fit the crib and didn't want to run into that problem). BUT...after about a month of using the crib, I noticed one day that there was a GAP between this mattress and my Emily crib, about a 1.5 inch gap if you pushed the mattress to either the right or left! I had to stick 3 rolled up receiving blankets in the gap so as to make the crib safer. I contacted Million Dollar Baby and submitted to them copies of pictures illustrating the gap and they're sending me a new crib altogether. I don't know if its the mattress or the crib not fitting. There should not be a gap. Besides the gap, the mattress seems to have \"memorized\" my son's body as there's a slight dent in the mattress where he sleeps. I'm not sure if that's normal or not. If I rotate the mattress I'm sure that problem will be solved. He sleeps on the Infant side of the mattress. Not sure if I would recommend this mattress because of the gap issue that I have (it could be the crib! But the crib looks properly assembled.)
B0017S2S86 We purchased this mattress for our Davinci Kalani crib.  It is a perfect tight fit in the crib.  The mattress seems firm and sturdy.  We have not used the mattress yet due to our daughter not being due for a few months.  I am happy with the purchase so far.  We will see how our daughter likes it when she is born...
B0017S2S86 This mattress was purchased for my grandson to be and fit my daughter's Lauren crib perfectly.  Delivery was quick but since baby is due any day we won't know much more until he arrives!
B0017S2S86 I did a lot of research before buying this baby mattress since our baby would spend a lot of time in it. This was the best choice for our budget. If you compare it to other mattresses that cost about 100 dlls you can see how this is on the top, others are a joke. The difference in the firmness, yet soft enough for baby, the 2 sided feature is definitely a plus, great coil count and it has the borderwire which is important for the life of the mattress and safety. It had everything I was looking for at a great price. Of course you could spend more and get a more natural or organic mattress but that was out of our budget, and this mattress is working just great.
B0017S2S86 One year later, this mattress has fared quite well. It looks and feels the same as when we bought it for our daughter, and she has had zero issues sleeping on it. We'll be flipping it to the other side in the near future. Couldn't be happier, especially for the price.
B0017S2S86 We were concerned about getting a mattress that would fit our crib just right, but this mattress fits our DaVinci Emily crib perfectly.  It seems firm and we look forward to using it with our child.
B0017S2S86 I bought this for my new DaVinci Emily Convertible Baby Crib. I was afraid that it will not fit since many reviews mentioned problems with mattresses. It fit perfectly. There is no gap. It was clean and in good condition when it came. It was wrapped in a plastic bag and it was in a box. It is very firm. I will update this review when my baby is born and we use it. So far so good.
B0017S2S86 Easy to clean, and the baby sleeps nicely upon a sheet upon a mattress protector upon the mattress.  No complaints.
B0017S2S86 This fits the Davinci Kalani crib perfectly.  So far this item has held up as expected.  Infant side is hard, as it should be.  I really can't complain about this item.  Looks waterproof, but it is worth it to put a water proof cover on it just in case.I would prefer a little more padding on the toddler side, but if it turns out to be a problem, I will put my own mattress pad on top when we flip it.  Who knows, our future toddler may prefer a firm mattress, we will have to see.
B0017T2RYU Would not purchase these again.  They had a loud buzz that came out of nowhere. We often ran into the room to find that there was nothing that trigger the sound.
B0017T2RYU Our nursery is on the top floor, and we have a receiver on the first floor and in the basement. The basement receiver seems to beep a lot but that can always be fixed by changing a setting on the switch or adjusting it's placement slightly. Both work well as long as we have them on a solid surface (placing them on end tables seems to work best) and these do the job exactly as intended. Would buy again.
B0017T2RYU Le me tell you this, if you buying this, you are buying a STATIC monitor, constantly buzzing and static ALL THE TIME!!! PIECE OF CRAP ever been made
B0017T2RYU After a lot of research, I chose this one because of the dual receivers and the rechargeable batteries. I love that the monitor and receivers plug in so I don't have to have a ton of batteries on hand.I keep one receiver down stairs and 1 in my bedroom. The sound quality is crystal clear and I haven't had any interference problems with my iPhone. I can even hear my son breathing most times, which is great for an anxious mom! I don't have a very large house, so I haven't had any problems with the range. I even took it out on the deck in my backyard and it still worked. I have been using this monitor for abour 2 months now and I am very happy with it.
B0017T2RYU We purchased these, and have found that they pop and crackle very loudly in the evening, to the point I have to just turn them off.  They worked well enough in the first year, but after 12 months, their speakers must have blown out.  We can't use these anymore.
B0017T2RYU Solid product.  Moniters work well.  Not \"perfect\"... like any other moniter.  But,very happy.
B0017T2RYU I love these monitors, and what a great price!  The voice activation is so cool, and they are so clear.  The work all over the house.  Because we live in the country, I am curious to see how far they will go on our yard.  I haven't had a chance to try it yet since it's winter here now, very cold and lots of snow.  But I am very impressed so far.  We had a very bad experience with a fisher price monitor set.
B0017T2RYU We've been using this for over two years and have been very happy.  We get good coverage all over our house (2 story + basement).  I can also take them outside in our yard and still stay within range.Some of my favorite features are that they have rechargeable batteries and an alarm to indicate if you are out of range.If you are having trouble with signal quality, spend some time with the various channel selections.  This made a difference for us.Also these will work along side the Fisher Price Sounds and Lights monitor without interference.Fisher-Price Sounds 'N Lights Monitor With Dual ReceiversThose are good monitors as well, but I prefer the Sony Baby C
B0017T2RYU This monitor has many of the features that I was looking for.  Rechargeable, dual hand sets and many channels.  The rechargeable handsets are great!  I'm saving so much money on batteries.  The dual hand set is fantastic because I don;t have to constantly carry it from bedroom to living room, although the snazzy belt clip works great!The problem is the reception.  It doesn't matter if you have this many channels if it's still fuzzy.  It gets fuzzy just from me walking around the room.  I'll roll over in bed at night and it gets fuzzy and the range alarm will go off.  The A/C comes on it gets fuzzy.  It has the same reception as the $20 monitor I used to have.  When I upgraded to a $65 version I was expecting better than this.  It remind me a lot of when I was a kid and we had rabbit ears on the TV.  Mom & Dad would make us stand in weird positions holding them so they could see.  My monitor is exactly like that.In the end I wish I had paid the extra $30 to get the kind that seamlessly changes channels so you never have any interference.  All the bells and whistles aren't worth it if I can't hear my baby.  That is the whole point after all.
B0017T2RYU Buy another monitor. I can't suggest one, because I reuse to spend another $60 on a heap of crap, but this set is worthless. This thing loses signal ALL THE TIME and has the most loud and annoying static and/or beeps constanly. We have lived in three homes while using this monitor, from a 1590 sqft townhouse to a 3,000 old farmhouse, and this monitor has been annoying and bothersome the entire time. Sure, I can hear my kid, but that's when the stupid thing isn't beeping or screaming static at me.  I could not in good conscience recommend this thing to anyone.
B0017T2RYU Bottom line this is not worth the money - the interference and feedback is way too much - even in a house with no other houses nearby.  Also it has a noise alert but no sensitivity function - so every time the baby makes a peep in turns on - which anyone who has a newborn will tell you means its going on every 10 seconds.  The bottom line is you want a monitor that lets you decide what you want to hear this does not let you do that.  Buy the Avent instead its has a great sensitivity function for only slightly more money.
B0017T2RYU It has button that is  off - voice activated - on.  On is continuous and voice activated is only when your baby is making noise.  Sometimes it picks up on the space heater in our baby's room and that will come through when the voice activated is on.  It will interfer with other signals - if my cell phone is close it will make awful sound.  We haven't had troubles with microwave interfering like other reviewer said.  I would say keep other items that emit signal about 4 feet away and it shouldn't interfere.We have great range at all levels of our house.  Works from basement to 2nd floor without range issues.  It will beep at you if it can't pick up on monitor.  Slide buttons on bottom let you choose different channels.  I love the battery and plug in options of this unit.  The stationary unit with baby isn't battery operated which is a huge downside - you must keep monitor away from crib at least 3 feet for this reason.  The cord can be a choking hazard (I know one more thing to worry about).
B0017T2RYU I have to keep buying new ones because the wires are very sensitive to toddler wear. But this is the biggest bang for your buck! They work fantastic, sensitive, but very reliable.
B0017T2RYU These serve their purpose, yes, but almost every night, every 5-15 minutes, ours picks up some static signal and just blips a loud static noise in the middle of the night. I've gotten used to it, but it's still annoying. They have two settings on them, one that is constant stream so that you can hear every little noise that goes on in your baby's room, or you can set it to voice activation where only noises up to a certain volume level make the monitor turn on, which is what we have it set on. The sudden bursts of loud static occur regardless of which setting it is on, and it has 3 channels to switch back and forth between if your signal sucks. These do have a really great range! A friend of ours has the same ones, (she also has the static problem) but when she had a pool party at her home for one of her daughter' birthdays, her younger daughter and my son took naps in the middle bedroom of her home, and we took turns clipping the speakers to our belts and going outside to see the rest of the party. These picked up the signal all over my friend's very large backyard, and they have a clip on the back of them so you can strap it on to your pants while you keep busy. Here is my recommendation to save money for many people: Don't do what we did and automatically assume that you need to purchase the larger set with the two speakers in it. We live in a 2 bed/2 bath one story condo that is just about 1200 square feet. It is a very open layout, but a split floorplan, so our room and my son's rooms are the furthest points in the home. We assumed that we would keep of course the receiver in my son's room, one speaker in our room, and the other speaker in the living room/kitchen area, but with the static problem, we didnt want a speaker right by where we were sleeping. Everytime it spazzed out, we woke up, so we put away one of the speakers and just have the one speaker on the bar in the middle of our home, right inbetween the kitchen and living room, and not too far away from our bedroom door, same volume we had before. We can hear our son JUST FINE. I considered not even using these at all, because I can actually hear my son quite well just from his room to mine, but I am scared I will sleep through it having gotten used to that amplified \"fuss\" from the monitor. For people living in small, or compact floor plans, save a little money and just purchase the smaller set of this with one speaker. This one would be perfect for someone with a 2-story home, one for each level. Infact, my mom bought these same ones for when my son stays at her house, and her home is a 2-story. Oh, and the battery life is quite good too. It lasts for several nights without needing to be charged.Overview: These work, therefore I trust them and would use them, but I don't like whatever ours are picking up. This problem may not be the same for everyone, as we may be picking up some weird signal around our home, but I did fine it interesting that a friend of ours who lives 30 miles away had the same issue with the exact same set. The range is great, battery life is good, but really think about which set fits your needs for your living situation.UPDATE: I figured out the static issue. If you have the monitor on while it is plugged in and charging, it makes this terrible static sound the entire time. Charge it before you have to use it, and then unplug it and the battery will last 3-4 nights, static only about 5% of the time compared to 50% before! I'm raising it one star. : ]
B0017T2RYU When we had our first child 6 years ago, we had no money and bought the cheapest monitor they had at the store, which I believe was a parent's brand monitor. I had no issues with it (aside from a low steady static buzz when it's on, which never bothered me because I sleep with a fan anyway). Fast forward five years. We have our second child and decide to buy a new one. We buy the sony one thinking it will be a high quality unit. Wrong.I couldn't even get through the first night before turning the thing off and deciding to take it back. A lot of reviews I've read have mentioned a lot of beeping. I never heard the beeping, I imagine because we didn't have it long enough to hear beeping. All I heard was a lot of random clicks and pops that originated from the machine itself. It also amplifies every last noise in my house. Crickets. The house settling. The air conditioning switching on. A car alarm down the block. The baby sighing. Noises that are so faint that I would barely hear them without the monitor are amplified greatly. All I want to hear is the baby, and not the little noises, I need to hear her crying loudly. Between the monitor amplifying too much noise and creating it's own noise, it's impossible to get any sleep.We ended up digging out the old monitor and using it. It lasted about another year before it finally gave out. We couldn't find the same one, so we bought the cheapest one we could find at walmart and it works okay. I don't know if they still make the parents brand monitor, but it was a good basic model and we had barely any issues with it.But I don't recommend the Sony monitor. I couldn't even make a single night with it before taking it back and I had to fight the urge to smash it to bits.
B0017T2RYU This is the best baby monitor ever! I tell everyone I know that this is the one to buy. Now using it for my second child and it is still working great. It is also really nice to have 2 receivers so I don't have to move them from room to room. No complaints whatsoever, this is a fabulous product!
B0017T2RYU I am really disappointed with this monitor and wish I had retained the box so that a return could be made.  I have been using it now for about four months in our relatively small home, but the range is terrible.  The initial receiver is located in the living area (only a few feet from the baby's room) and that location has good reception.  However, the second receiver is in our room about 20 feet further away and through one wall.  There are no other devices located near this receiver and yet it gets almost no reception.  We have tried moving it around the room (as close as is possible to the babies unit) nothing works.  Also, there is no apparent failure pattern which would help us determine the cause of the problem.  It simply works for a little while and then for no discernible reason begins to sound the out of range signal.  My advice is to pass this one by.
B0017T2RYU This monitor was okay, but it gets a lot of feedback (buzzing, loud clicks, and a lot of static) that it shouldn't get. It is very sensitive, which is good and bad, because I can hear my baby yawning and sometimes breathing, but it also picks up the dogs (several houses) away barking at night. It does it's job, but I wish I could return it for a different one. We've tried several different settings, and nothing works. I think my cell phone also interferes with it, so I have to put it away from the phone. I think the worst part is having to immediately turn it off, before opening the door to my baby's room, if I leave the monitor on, it starts making a loud high pitched tone and doesn't stop till I turn it off. Our rooms are across a very short hallway from each other, so I don't think it's good for small places. I need the monitor though because I am a very heavy sleeper once I manage to pass out. Very disappointing after reading good reviews on this product.
B0017T2RYU After our three year old Philips Avent died, we decided to buy a cheaper baby monitor. After much research, I found that every monitor available has a wide range of high and low star ratings. It seemed that none was an excellent choice, but the 'Sony 900 MHz BabyCall Nursery Monitor with Receivers' and the 'Graco Secure Coverage Digital Monitor - 2 Parent Units' were the two we tried out. Both were appealing because they include two receivers and both had generally high ratings from a large number of reviewers. Sadly, the reality is that the Philips Avent DECT technology is the only monitor that offers zero interference and crystal clear sound. It's a bummer, but in this case you do get what you pat for. The Sony and the Graco both produced continual (and very annoying) interference noise and both beeped and changed channels a lot. Our son slept beautifully, but we were woken up throughout the night from the monitors. The sound on the Avent is so clear that I can hear my son breathing and turning/moving in his bed. I never have to worry when I'm not in the room and I always hear him when he calls for me at night. The only downside to the Philips is the battery life off the charger is ~3hrs, other than that it's excellent.
B0017T2RYU I absolutely LOVE this monitor set! I have used it with my twin boys since birth. It is very sensitive to sound which is perfect for hearing baby. We use 'white noise' (a fan and vaccum cleaner noise CD) in the room they sleep in and it doesn't interfere with the signal or sound quality. I have dropped the monitor too many times to count and it still works perfect!! There is a range alarm on the monitor that tells you when you're getting out of range, but I've never had it alarm (signals with a beeping noise and red light). I've took the monitor to my neighbors house which is 40-50 ft away and it never alarmed. I like that it is rechargable and doesn't use batteries! Saves tons of money in the long run since we are constantly putting batteries in toys.It has 3 setting on the side: Off, On, and voice activated. We only use the voice activated. It also comes with 3 channels if for some reason you do experience interference. Also there is a volume control that lets you turn it up if so needed.I would HIGHLY recommend this product! We live in a very noisy household with t.v's, cell phones, microwave, etc.. and we have NEVER had a problem!! The sound quality is absolutely perfect as well... I can hear my baby turn over as well as when he sucks his pacifier! A must have with little ones!
B0017T2RYU We have been using this baby monitor for almost 8 months.  At first we thought it was going to be a good fit for us.  It seemed almost too sensitive to noises, the red lights would flash when the baby rolled in her crib.  But the \"out of range\" light would flash and it would intermittently beep.  It wouldn't beep consistently though, seemingly only at night.  The clicks, pops and crackles are horrendous and wake us up frequently.  With the baby sleeping through the night we often resort to turning off the monitor at night, completely defeating the purpose.  Almost 8 months of use and it is now not picking up the babies noises very well.  I can hear the baby through the wall before the monitor picks up her sounds.  We have tried multiple channels to try and get rid of any interference but nothing seems to help.  About to chuck this monitor and replace it with something that will work.  Don't waste your money on this, read reviews carefully and go for something else.
B0017T2RYU We've been using this monitor about 22 months now and have found it to be way more frustrating than useful. Sometimes it will work at long range, but most times it loses signal even IN THE NEXT ROOM. Like it becomes easier just to listen unassisted for the baby crying than to put up with all the beeping and static and clicking from this dumb monitor. Our house is fairly new, so our walls are just drywall, not anything that would occlude a decent signal. Definitely going to toss this and get something else for the next kid.
B0017T2RYU This monitor is just okay. Its does the very basic which is let you hear when your baby is crying. But I wasn't expecting all the other noises this thing made. At very random times this monitor will have a very loud \"clicking\" sound, loud enough wake me up, but I am a light sleeper, even still, its loud. And the range isn't all that great, but we never go very far anyway. I've not used it very much cause our baby still sleeps with us and doesn't really take naps unless its on me, but I've heard the clicking enough to know that its not the best out there, and you should probably invest elsewhere.
B0017T2RYU After owning a defective more expensive monitor, I was skeptical about this one.  The reviews were a bit mixed and had me worried about interference and the range alarm going off.  We have had this for 2 months now and use it mutiple times every day.  It works great!  I especially like the convenience of having 2 receivers, with a multi-level home, this is a must!  And the long range is amazing!  We were even able to hear our baby whimper in her crib from our neighbor's, 3 houses away!  I have often walked right outside her door while holding a receiver and the alarm has never gone off.  And I have had no interference with this either; it is often sitting right next to my cell phone and right below our microwave with no problems.  Great monitor, don't hesitate on buying this one!
B0017T2RYU Ok, the voice setting on this makes it all worth it.  We have a problem like some of the other reviewers - we get static and beeping out of range in a 2500 sq ft house.  But the voice setting is awesome - no more static!  We had some crappy fisher price lights/sounds monitor that crackled all day long, this is silence until the baby starts talking/crying.  love it!
B0017T2RYU I did not buy this monitor from Amazon.  We purchased this in 2008 and for no reason at all it stopped picking up the stations. It did not last a year.  I just had another baby in April and I pulled this thing out trying to see if I could get it to work. I tried all kinds of color combinations with no luck.  I am now looking for another monitor...looks like Vtech may be the one. I just don't know how this thing is supposed to work when you can't get a channel no matter where its placed in the house. It was never dropped or anything...never again...Sony in my opinion failed with this one.
B0017T2RYU I moved my son to his crib around 3 months, and with this monitor, I can hear everything in the room including his breathing and the clock ticking. I sleep much better at night because it's been most reliable.It's true that you can get interference from other electronic devices, so I don't charge my cell phone next to the monitor on my nightstand. With a little experience, you can figure out what causes interference and make the necessary adjustments. After I did, I rarely have issues with interference. (I live in a house in a rural town so I can't speculate on how it would work in a condo, apartment complex, or densely populated neighborhood.)I haven't tried other monitors, but I'd rather have something that monitors closely, has good battery life, etc. than have something that can't help me know exactly what's happening in the nursery.
B0017T2RYU initially we had static problems, but the monitor was too close to the cordless phone. when I moved it a few feet away, we were fine.sometimes there is a little bit of static when receiver is close to something electronic, so i just move it farther away
B0017T2RYU We bought this monitor because its Sony and I figured it would be good. Its driving me crazy. It has bursts of static on every channel! We've tried moving the monitor, moving the receiver, nothing helps. It happens on all 27 channels! Its driving me crazy! I can't get any sleep!!One of the other reviews said do not buy if you live in an apartment. For the record, we live in an apartment building too. Not sure if it would do the same thing in a house.... but I'd pick a different monitor!
B0017T2RYU Overall, good product if you don't want a video monitor.  Looking back, I wish we bought a video monitor as our 9 month old is very active in his bed and I would prefer to see what he's up to on a video monitor rather than walking into his room every time.
B0017T2RYU After buying and returning three different monitors we tried the Sony BabyCall.  A couple friends recommended it and we were running out of options.  The sound on this monitor was pretty good for an analog signal.  The problem is that the out of range alarm (a really loud, annoying beeping) kept randomly going off as we walked around our house.  We have a single floor home that isn't huge.  There is no way the receivers were actually out of range.  We tried exchanging our Sony BabyCall for another unit hoping we had gotten a faulty one, but the second one was even worse than the first!  I couldn't even leave the receivers on because they beeped non-stop.  It could be that we have too many devices operating on the analog signal for this to work for us, but other analog monitors did not have this problem.  Don't bother with the Sony BabyCall.
B0017T2RYU This is my second monitor purchase of this product. It picks up movement and sounds well and clear. Other than the occasional beeps we never really had any problems with it until about a year and half of use.  The receiver started making more static and also popping sounds around other electrical sources such as in the kitchen. A few months later it wouldn't work with just battery power only. I ordered a new battery but that didn't fix the problem. This time we ordered this set with 2 receivers which I definitely recommend. Depending on where you live and the environment of your home, any monitor can have issues and may or may not be the best one for you. We have been pretty happy with this monitor.
B0017T2RYU While there are some superficial flaws with this product (especially that the loop on top of the receivers is actually the antenna, and you can't use it to hang from your belt loops or anything convenient like that), it seems to work very well. We get crystal-clear reception everywhere in the house, even the basement.Unfortunately, the proximity alarm sounds if we're any farther than about 20 feet from the baby's room. If i'm going to stay that close, i don't need a monitor to hear what's going on in there. What good is a baby monitor that lets me go out of earshot of the baby long enough to be productive if it's constantly beeping at me?
B0017T2RYU When I picked out this monitor, I expected high quality because of the Sony name and higher price.  I liked this one because it had two receivers and we wanted to put one in our basement and one in our upstairs master rather than always trying to keep track of the receiver.  We are replacing it after 6 months.THE MAJOR DISAPPOINTMENTS:- Constant interference.  No matter what channel we set it to, it seems like the slightest noise may cause interference.  This is annoying because every time the receiver loses its signal for a millisecond it beeps at you.  This can be a lot of beeping when you are trying to sleep -- something any new parent doesn't want to lose because of technology.  The monitor beeps at least once 5-6 days a week in the middle of the night and wakes us up.- Volume sensitivity.  The volume is very sensitive.  We try not to ever adjust it because it is very difficult to get it adjusted so that it is low enough that you can't hear the baby breathing, the clock ticking... things you don't need to hear and that are distracting when you are trying to sleep.  If someone adjusts the volume even once it is at least a week before we get it tweaked just right.  Twice we have woken up to see the red visual lights on full blast and we can hear the baby screaming through the floor.Thanks Sony for putting a worthless product on the market.  I only wish we'd have packed this up after the first few days and returned it.  We just kept thinking another channel would solve the interference problems but it never did.
B0017T2RYU We have never had a problem determining if the baby is awake with this monitor.  The sound is clear and loud with minimal static.
B0017T2RYU Purchased this from EZ something or other.  The shipping was very fast.  Anyway, I can hear my baby's breathing with this monitor.  And the volume isn't turned way up.  The nursery is approx 10' x 10'.  The transmitter is in a corner of the room diagonally opposite the crib where baby's head is. We have had it for 10.5 mths.  Now he turns on his side and I can't hear the regular breathing but deep breaths do come across.  There is no static.We have a 2 story house so this works great.  Have unplugged one monitor and forgotten to plug it back in for 24 hrs and the battery does not drain.  Outside of the house, the range seems to be ~ 40ft or so.  No interference with TV or cell or other devices.  I have taken a receiver into the basement frequently and it works well there (while taking a shower).  Transmitter is on the 2nd floor.  Shower is on opposite side of the house ~ 26 ft away.There is a voice activated mode so that if you have a fan or humidifier in the room, it filters out the background sound.  I wanted to hear everything so haven't used that mode much.  The regular mode did pick up a drip problem with a humidifier that wasn't seated correctly.I love this monitor and it's one of the top baby products I've purchased if not the best.
B0017T2RYU This is the worst monitor ever! It beeps, clicks, and makes all kinds of noise. It is actually doing it right now while my daughter naps and once again i am going to have to get up and reposition it! Read all the bad reviews and trust them. Dont take a chance on this one! Its crap. I would give it zero stars but it is making me choose one to rate it, so i picked one star.
B0017T2RYU It was okay.  Would have loud feedback everytime it got within proximity of a cell phone.  Could hear the tick of the second hand clock with this device so it was fairly sensitive.  The automatic sound activation was always kind of questionable.  However, one of the receivers suddenly stopped working at 11 months - there was no warning or anything to indicate that it had stopped working as all the indicator lights were still on.  The fact that it could stop working so suddenly is kind of disturbing, potentially dangerous.
B0017T2RYU This monitor works for us just like it's supposed to, and I'm comfortable enough using it that I no longer feel like I have to be with my sleeping baby every second.  The voice recognition feature works well, so you don't have to listen to background noise all the time (though you don't have to use the voice recognition mode if you do want to hear all of the background noises).  While there are, of course, monitors out there with more features, this one has everything we needed, works well, and is a very good value for the price.  I think the design is cute, too, and like the rechargeable batteries.  Also, we were able to get the receivers to pick up the transmitter's signal on the second setting we tried, and there are 27 settings, so no problem there.
B0017T4PXG we bought this product to keep our baby food cold while flying. this worked fantastic. i would definitely recommend it.
B0017T4PXG We love this tote for the diaper bag. You can customize the inside to hold 2 (4 oz bottles) and 2 jars of baby food, 2 (8 oz) bottles, or 6 jars of baby food. Each of the dividers comes out. And, later on, the middle divider will lay flat so you can use the whole tote.
B0017T4PXG Love it! It is so versatile that all of my baby's feeding bottles and food tupperwares fits in there. Most important, does the job of keeping temperature for several hours.
B0017T4PXG This is one of the best presents we recieved at our shower.  I love that you can remove the dividers to make different size bottles fit.  I would highly reccomend purchasing this product.
B0017T4PXG I like the functionality of the cooler bag. I plan to use it for bringing expressed milk back home from work, as well as when my baby starts on solids, I can bring home-made baby food out.The dividers materials just seems to be a bit poorly made. Also the one I got the left side seemed a bit asymmetrical.It's okay for the price.
B0017T4PXG I used this one a lot for traveling, very convenient. However, I didn't get to use it for as long as I though I would. My girl is 18 months now, and she prefers fresh fruit and veggies, so we cannot go for jars bought at the store. Still this tote was awesome for many of our trips.
B0017T4PXG The bag is nice for holding different size bottles and compact enough to take around with you.  I don't feel it keeps things super cold.  If you are planning on using it more than 2 hours at a time, then this probably is not the bag for you.
B0017UZZ5C I will admit that I was sorely tempted to buy the original Fisher Price stacker, the one we all had as kids.  It's absolutely a classic and I may still obtain one of them.But I was drawn to this one for my 5-month old because I remember reading somewhere that it is slightly smaller than the classic version with the large plastic hollow donuts.  I thought smaller might work better for the little guy.  Well.  Since this toy has come into the house, not a day has gone by without at least one play session where he selects this toy to play with from among a lot of others.Now 8 months old, he still loves this one.  He tips over the base to let the rings fall free, takes one in each hand, and shakes them like tambourines.  He smacks them together and has a grand old time.  He is not at all interested in re-stacking them on the base, but that's fine with me because it just means the toy will last a while longer while he grows into that phase.The topper on this stacker is the red ring with the little chick.  This part does not rattle, which is a little bit of a shame.  It also wedges kind of tightly onto the top of the base, so baby can't remove it himself, but that's OK.I am very very pleased with this purchase.  I have subsequently looked at some of the other stackers on the market and I am convinced this one is the cream of the crop.UPDATE:  Eddie is now 17 months old and a month or two ago, he started stacking the rings on the stump.  He still needs help deciding the order they should be placed on the stump but he's had a lot of fun trying to get this thing figured out.  Still a hit in our household.UPDATE:  Eddie is turning 4 next week and only today did I pull this one out of the toy basket  :-( .
B0017UZZ5C Baby is 8 months old, and I didn't think she would really be that interested in this toy yet.  I just wanted her to begin to grasp the \"stacking\" concept. But she loves to play with the round stackers. They rattle, and she likes to chew on them. It is one of her favorite toys.  I put it in her crib in the morning, and it keeps her occupied so I can get an extra 10 to 20 minutes of sleep.
B0017UZZ5C My 7 month old loves the rattling sounds from all the rings. They are a little heavier than the other products in the market. My son threw them down on my feet a couple of times and it hurt. The duck on top does not stay on and the rings  can only be fixed in one order coz the stem inside is tapering on the top and thick at the bottom.  This is one of the few toys that my son likes so i still think it was a decent buy.
B0017UZZ5C Got this as a gift for friends' infant.  My wife had seen its popularity in other homes with young children.  It was immediately a hit and the baby loved it. That's what it is all about!
B0017UZZ5C I just wish that for a first stacker the material was a little softer.  My babe is in the phase of banging everything, and she hits herself and me with the rings and it hurts us both.  I just wish the plastic was a little softer.  Otherwise it's cute, the rattles are nice.
B0017UZZ5C i like it its colorful and work as rattle as wellmy 7 month baby likes it and its really nice and good priceloves it
B0017VM2NY I am posting because I disagree with some of the negative reviews I read here. I have no problems with my car seat and other moms frequently comment on how much easier my system looks than the seats they use.1. I love that I can take my sleeping daughter grocery shopping without having to remove her from the car seat and wake her. I rotate the base, release and tilt it and then plop it into the stroller. Easy-peasy--and I'm a 130lb mommy, so I must disagree with reviewers who said it is hard to travel with the base.2. The reviewers who complain about twisted straps make no mention of the Velcro holders. Perhaps they aren't aware of them? When I remove my daughter, I push the straps to either side of the seat and they stick to the Velcro awaiting our return. No twisting or fussing. Perhaps they didn't notice the Velcro dots since they mimic the seat logo?3. Regarding the seat incline, I saw my daughter's head hang once when she was asleep and my inlaws had buckled her in. It turned out they had completely loosened her straps. I always do the finger test when tightening her straps and then her head stays against the back cushions.4. Other mothers complain about the durability or inconvenience of cleaning other brands of car seats, and I think the reviewers don't realize how easy we've got it. Not only do I have peace of mind over safety and toxicity, but I can unzip everything and throw it in the wash in two minutes.I actually keep a counter clicker attached to my stroller and every time someone remarks on how smart the design is, I click it. I'm already in the three hundreds.In one respect, I do share the concern of the one star reviews. I am disappointed that I will eventually be forced to turn the seat, not because my daughter demands it but because the highest shoulder height straps only work forward facing. I find that to be the one flaw of the system, but my daughter is in the 98th percentile for height and I supposed rear-facing until three should be good enough.
B0017VM2NY I am very disappointed. I love orbit but this seat was impossible, no recline and the handle is to stiff to turn it. My son head was in his lap! I returned it and went with the 360 and am very happy.
B0017VM2NY I don't even know where to begin - basically, it is a horrible car seat. I would like to slap myself for ever falling for the bells and whistles of the swivel/dock feature Orbit is so proud of. I recommend you to stay away from Orbit, the toddler car seat in particular. Your wallet will thank you and you will save yourself a headache. If you feel like reading why, go ahead.We have the Orbit Baby G2 travel system (the frame, the base, and the infant car seat) and felt somehow trapped as we thought since we already have the expensive base we should get the Orbit toddler car seat to put it to further use (our 12-month old baby is getting too big for the infant seat). Unfortunately, we were unable to see the toddler car seat in person because no retailer seems to have a floor model of this thing. I was hesitant to order it online so we went to a store hoping we would be able to take it out of the box to further examine its functions because I wasn't sure whether it has a recline function (Orbit website does not mention this function at all). So we went and were told by the shop that they do not have a floor model (surprise) and that the box cannot be opened. So I asked a few questions and was assured and reassured that it does, indeed, recline into a very comfortable position to accommodate babies and small toddlers. We paid almost $400 ($360 + NYC tax) and brought this thing home where we discovered that it DOES NOT RECLINE!!! I was furious because I asked 3 different sales persons and all of them assured me that it does recline. Every other convertible car seat on the market has a reclining function, especially at this price point. And frankly, for almost $600 ($360 seat + $220 base) it should recline automatically when I say \"recline\".  The seat is so upright I do not understand that Orbit says it is designed for babies from 15 pounds! No way. My son was 15 pounds when he was only 3.5 months old. There is absolutely NO WAY a 3-month old baby would ever be comfortable in an upright position when they can't even sit. Actually, they shouldn't be in an upright position this early at all! I tested the seat with my 12-month old son who weighs 22 pounds now and measures 31 inches (BTW, the infant car seat is for babies up to 30 pounds or 32 inches, so he's only 1 inch away, and frankly, he's not very comfortable in it anymore). Do you think my 12-mo/22-lb/31-in baby was comfortable in his new toddler car seat? ... No, he was not. We drove for about half an hour (we couldn't take it longer), he slept and his poor head was literally resting on his chest. It looked horrible and very uncomfortable. For those who think it is normal, let me assure you that it is not. I have used Chicco and Maxi-Cosi convertible car seats in Europe and they all recline, so I have never experienced this problem. I knew instantly I would be returning this seat. Which is exactly what I did.I only owned this seat for 4 days, therefore I didn't get a chance to experience any problems with the belt twisting as reported by other reviewers.Another major con is that this seat has only 4 harness slots to adjust harness height (of which only the lower 2 are allowed for rare facing installation)! That's totally inadequate - other convertible car seats offer more than double (Britax Next Generation: 10 slots, Maxi-Cosi Pria: 11 slots). This important detail (along with the fact that it doesn't recline and that you can't use the swivel base while forward facing) is conveniently not mentioned at the Orbit Baby website. You'll discover this when you take the seat out of the box and read the manual.I contacted Orbit because I am still in shock that such an expensive car seat from a company that claims to be so innovative lacks standard features. I wrote an email which included the following:\"... What is a consumer supposed to do if his/her baby's head is literally resting on its chest while sleeping in the seat - this looks super uncomfortable for the baby and seems unsafe too. Normally, I would recline the seat. But Orbit does not allow me to do that. Why not and what is supposed to be done instead to make the baby comfortable? I tested the toddler car seat with my 12-month old who weighs 22 pounds and measures 31 inches - the toddler car seat is too upright and the poor baby was sleepy and his head was falling on his chest all the time. We have your infant car seat, which has a good angle, but he's outgrowing it and we need a new seat for him. The current seat angle of your toddler seat seems sort of OK for bigger toddlers, maybe around 2 or 3 years, but what am I supposed to do during the \"in-between\" stage from 12 months up to 2 or 3 years, when he's too big for your infant seat, yet too small for your toddler seat due to the non-existing recline...\"Brace yourself for the response and suggestions I received from Orbit...\"We are not aware of any convertible car seats that have a recline position.\" ... Really??? How about Britax, or Maxi-Cosi to name a couple (they have the same safety features like Orbit, such as the EPP foam and side impact protection). Britax, for instance - all of their convertible car seats allow 3-position recline both while rear and forward facing. Maxi-Cosi PRIORI model has 4 recline positions when forward facing. Maxi-Cosi PRIA 70 has 3 recline positions - position 3 (most reclined) and 2 (medium recline) can be used while rear facing. Position 2 (medium recline) must be used while forward facing for children up to 40 pounds. Position 1 (upright) must be used while forward facing for children over 40 pounds. Interestingly, Maxi-Cosi seems to believe (just like me ... or maybe it's just common sense) that toddlers/children up to 40 pounds should be seated in a more reclined position. Their website explains it as follows: These recline positions allow a more reclined riding position for younger children and a more upright position for older children. Not only does this provide an appropriate riding position for different sized children, but the required recline angles also improve crash energy management.On the head falling forward: \"We understand your concerns and see the same phenomenon when our own children nap using the Toddler Car Seat.\" ... Phenomenon?!  More like a poorly designed, overpriced car seat that lacks BASIC features!\"We have never received any information - from pediatricians or otherwise - that when children sleep in these seemingly awkward positions, it is somehow bad for them.\" - Uh, how about just incredibly uncomfortable!?\"There are many general techniques that you can use so that your child is more comfortable. Some include a towel, foam wedge, or pool noodle that can be used to prop the Base.\" - A pool noodle???  Are you kidding me? No, thank you, I will not be sticking any towel or pool noodle under the car seat base. The towel/pool noodle option doesn't seem safe and frankly it is a very sloppy solution for a $600 ensemble and to be honest I am appalled by their suggestion.Rather than a pool noodle, I will get a different car seat. I am extremely disappointed with the Orbit system due to its lack of otherwise standard features. The fact that they are not aware of the reclining function tells me that Orbit is way behind its competitors.FYI: If you think the rotating feature is cool and you are planning to buy it for that reason, please don't. This function does not compensate for the many disadvantages of the seat and frankly, you can only use the rotating function when rear-facing. Once forward facing, the rotation-allowing base cannot be used anymore, nor will you be able to dock the seat into the stroller frame (unless you want to install it over and over again which is beyond annoying). Hence, once forward facing, the famous swivel feature cannot be utilized.And if you think you can just grab the toddler car seat, lift it with your sleeping child in it and dock it into the stroller frame, then trust me, you can't unless you are the Incredible Hulk. The seat is very bulky and heavy (22 pounds), I struggled with it alone, I would never be able to lift it from the back seat (a very awkward angle) with a toddler in it. Never.Update 02/2012 - after an extensive and exhausting 6-month research we finally purchased a Maxi-Cosi Pria 70 Convertible Car Seat in Walnut Brown and we are very pleased with it. In fact, I am so happy with it I gave it 5 stars.
B0017VM2NY We had the Orbit infant car seat system, but my son weighed 21 lbs, 4 oz. at his 6-month appointment, so we had to move up to the toddler seat.The good things:- It works with the same base so long as you have the seat rear facing (since our son is only 7 months old, we'll have him facing backwards a while longer)- I LOVE that you can turn the seat 90 degrees in the base to get him in and out of the car -- I've watched my friends with rear-facing convertable seats contort themselves to get their babies strapped in while I can stand comfortably at the side of the car;- Because the base system still works, we're able to get away with using one car seat for two cars- You can use it with the stroller base (handy when the baby is sleeping and you don't want to wake him up to put him in a stroller)- it has velcro tabs to keep the straps out of the way when getting the baby in and out of the seatThe not so good things:- It is heavy.  I have a really hard time lifting it in and out of the car, especially with the baby in the seat;- You can use it with the stroller, but it looks really strange, plus it is hard to haul in and out of the car;- It is really big and, especially with the sun shade, blocks the side window view;- You can't use the base forward-facing (when our son turns 1, we'll just install this seat permanently in one car and buy a Britax for the other car).Thus, if you already have the infant system and a younger baby that has outgrown the infant car seat, this is a good option.
B0017VM2NY My car seat journey started 11 1/2 years ago. I was told to get a Britax and I stuck with that until  I just got my car seat last week and we love it! We replaced a Britax Advocate. So, the people that have said it is too big should try one of those, it needs it's own zip code!  I am not convinced in the car seat that bigger is better! I sold her Advocate because with 4 in car seats it was just too big. I got a Britax Boulevard but then I saw the Orbit seats and got the infant. Started saving for the Orbit toddler but we were in a very minor fender bender the insurance of the person that hit me paid to replace my seats.  Although they depreciated them even the ones I just bought, I got the Infant seat again, and the Toddler seat in Mocha because the black is not in stock.  Turns out I love the mocha!  Anyway, like all of the Orbit products it is great quality.  I can not see myself getting this thing out to put on the stroller, that said it is a great option for people who fly!What I love:The Cut, Color, Quality!  (Give me a new car seat or stroller over a diamond anyday!)Love how easy it is to get securely fastenedSun Shade is awesome, never thought of a need for one on a full size seat but we have large windows and the sun does beat in even though they have a slight tint!Looks CoolMy daughter loves it, she does not struggle. Her only complaint has been that it doesn't have monkeys, the boys got Cleks!The fabric is comfortable and NON-TOXIC, which I loveI love that I can put it on the stroller if I should ever get the urge!Cons:The Price, although it is not much different than the Advocate it just seems like all of their stuff is high!  I should know I have ALL OF IT X 2.  Except the bassinet, I just have one of those!This is petty but I really don't like the little blue button on the seat. I tried to pull it off before I read the directions.Unexpected Bonus:I love the back cover that holds the instruction book and covers the straps!I would buy again!  Oh wait, I will when my youngest out grows her infant seat!Now if they could just add that monkey, Hmmmm.............P.S. I have posted pictures of my two year old daughter in the seat!
B0017VM2NY sure, it may be safe. but it's also a big pain in the butt.-in my 4-runner, i couldn't see anything out the rear view mirror with my rear-facing toddler car seat. NOTHING.-the only way i could rotate it was to climb into the backseat, grip both sides and pull with all my strength. SO frustrating.-there is no way i could lift my sleeping child, strapped into that thing, out of the car & onto the stroller. NO way.-there is no recline option for your sleeping child. my son weighed 22 lbs at 6 months old & required a toddler car seat. after 2 trips and seeing his poor little head in his lap, i was done.-and the obvious negative, once your child is forward facing, the infamous rotating base is obsolete.i am thrilled with my britax boulevard click safe. for $320 it's a little cheaper, reclines, looks great and is top of the class safety.orbit, i love your infant system. i was your #1 fan. but you've got a loooong way to go on the toddler system as far as i'm concerned.
B0017VM2NY I bought Orbit Baby Toddler Car Seat because I was lured by the swivel base. When my son was rear facing this was heaven sent, but forward facing is a nightmare. Without the base, this product is just an overpriced toddler car seat, also damaged the seat of the car, gave a permanent round dent on leather, it is heavy and bulky with round bottom. It is impossible to install in a short time. I had an emergency that I had to switch cars in the shop and I have never hated this monster car seat more. For months I put up with this because it was very expensive and too late to return (I did love it when I could use it with the base). However, I have suffered enough and finally give in and buy another car seat. I take the loss, because I didn't realize when I chose to buy this, that the swivel base is not supposed to be used forward facing. If I have to do it again, I would not buy this even for rear facing, and WILL NOT recommend this car seat to anyone, whether it's my friends I like or in-laws I don't like. I gave it one star because it does look good, and customer service responded in timely manner when I called to replace the broken clip.
B0017VM2NY I own the Orbit Baby Stroller set and once my little one outgrew his infant carrier, I was hesitant to get the Orbit Baby Toddler Car Seat because of a bit of sticker shock.  In the end, I am glad I bought it.  We keep a car seat in every car so we don't have to switch them around and this is hands down the best.  The AirProtect is second, but by FAR.  We also bought a bargain priced Cosco one and that one is just terrible (I got what I paid for - and will be replacing it soon enough!).This has been so convenient for me, especially when we travel.  I bring my Toddler Car Seat and my Orbit base and voila!  Car Seat and stroller in one!  The fact that it can rotate on the stroller base and seemlessly go from the car to the stroller or even into the house when my little one has fallen asleep is perfect!Please note that once you put the car seat in the front facing position, you will discontinue the use of the rotating base and will then use the brackets (which are nicely packaged and easy to use).  Despite this set back, I still love it.  Everything is cleverly designed, from the \"paparazzi cover\" and where it is stored, to the tiny velcro tabs that keep the straps for the seat open  while your baby is not inside of it.  This is a very well made car seat and I couldn't be happier.I love all my Orbit Baby products!If you're using the toddler car seat as a stroller seat whilst on vacation and you'd like some more shade/coverage (we did when we took our baby to Hawaii!), then simply purchase a $12 Ray Shade and you can attach the top straps to the strap in the back that holds the paparazzi cover and thread the side straps into the upper or lower holes along the tension line for the handles.  You'll easily double or triple your shade this way.  When I use the Ray Shade, It covers all the way to the front of the car seat.  This is an excellent \"hack\".  I don't know if anyone has ever thought about it, but I figured I'd post it here since it's posted on my blog!
B0017VM2NY My little one is 7 months and just outgrowing the infant capsule. We tried her in this the other day but she is still too short and she is comfier in the capsule. I will update it in the future but at the moment this is fantastic and they have thought of everything
B0017VM2NY I am thrilled with my Orbit Baby toddler car seat and want to put to rest some of the issues others have brought up.  Our family has all the other Obit Baby products and with this final addition to the collection, I see all the usual thoughtfulness of design and attention to detail.Our son is 14 months old, around 30\" tall and 24 lbs and absolutely loves his new seat.  We have installed it rear facing in the center seat (on the base) of our CRV.  Though the seat is very tall, it allows for plenty of growth in the future and I can still see out the rear window just fine.  Also, when installed on the base, our son gets a few extra inches of height and he loves to look out the window.I also want to point out that the rear installation on the base makes use of the anti-rebound feature of the base which is RARELY found in any car seat on the market in the US, though very common in Europe.  The base is braced against the rear seat-back and prevents the seat from tipping forward and smashing your kid into the seat back in the event of a crash.  This also protects you child's legs and makes it even safer to keep them rear facing as long as possible.  The only other way to get this kind of protection is to use a tether strap and an anchor in the floor of the car, which most cars do not have.  Britax is the only other manufacturer to address this in rear facing situations.  Kids can sit fine with their legs crossed; lots of safety experts have commented that rear facing as long as possible is the way to go.There is no point in using the base (or any base) forward facing as it is very important to use the top tether to secure the seat tightly against the car's seat-back.  I don't understand why people don't realize this when they purchase ANY seat, yet complain about the lack of forward facing/base coupling with the Orbit.We do not use this car seat on the stroller chassis on a regular basis but have this wonderful feature specifically in mind for when we are traveling, which we do frequently.  Getting through the airport was such a breeze.  Just wheel right up to the plane's doors and then carry the seat on the plane and strap it in.  I can't imagine trying to travel around a city and forgo using a car seat in taxi just because of the hassle and I'd hate using one of those car seat travel adapters where you push/pull your kid around about 5 inches off the ground, nasty!  Almost all cars/taxis these days have the LATCH system so it takes about 30 seconds to get it in and out.  This is what Orbit Baby had in mind, you obviously don't use it as your everyday stroller but as an bonus feature to the Obit list of features.Getting the straps properly adjusted was a cinch, they are on the lowest setting and I have moved the crotch strap forward one.  The gray head protection pillow also moved down to the lowest setting and fits our guy perfectly.  Again, Orbit Baby has made this process very simple.  All of the straps are neatly stored in the back side of the car seat, there is even a place for the sunshade and the manual as well as the extra installation straps for use without the base.  I have no issue what so ever with the straps twisting.  When I take my son out of the seat, we loosen the straps and then use the handy Velcro tabs to keep the straps out of the way.  When I put him back in, the straps are out of the way and just waiting to be secured, piece of cake!UPDATE: 3/30/2012I am looking to by a second toddler seat as we are now on baby number two nearing the one-yea-old stage.  I wasn't nuts about spending another $360 on a big car seat and I noticed the above reviewer had purchased a Maxi Cosi Pria 70.  Amazon had them on sale for near to the two hundred range so I purchased one and thought I'd try it out.  I can't believe the difference in quality and how crappy it was compared to the Orbit.  The Maxi Cosi Pria 70 is exactly the same as the Cosco Senerca which is a popular \"extra\" seat for under fifty bucks.  I couldn't believe that Maxi Cosi (actually Doral group) was charging an extra two hundred bucks for some fancy padding.  Come on people.  Orbit has the highest tech in impact protection with the EPP foam.  The Maxi Cosi is a plastic shell and THAT'S IT!Can't wait for Obit to adjust their line for multi-kid families!
B0017VM2NY Paying this much for a toddler seat had better be worth it, and it almost is.  My only complaint, which I saw going into this deal, is that this thing is way too heavy and physically bulky to really function as part of a travel system.  Sure you can remove it from your car and dock it to the Orbit stroller if you have it, but if you value your back, you're gonna want to securely tether this thing in a semi-permanent fashion to your backseat and never lift it again.  Not to mention, once you're using it forward-facing (meaning you can no longer dock it to and from the Orbit Base), you can't really remove it all that easily.  That's why Orbit has another option available for strolling, lighter and better for moving about.  But you can't use that in the car, and of course it costs extra.This weight problem really prevents you from utilizing this as part of the travel system, which is the main reason say, you would buy an Orbit on top of another brand if you already have the Orbit Infant System.  So they should just sell it as the best-designed and safest toddler car seat out there, because that's what it is.As far as comfort, safety, quality, materials, and workmanship, you are going to be hard-pressed to find a better seat, though.  My daughter loves this, and even sleeps comfortably in it.I do recommend it, but think twice if you're buying it for its \"portability\" and practicality in a travel system... it's none of those things.
B0017VMH5M It is a good bouncer. For a while it the only place my child would sleep in,i can only assume it must have been comfy.
B0017VMH5M This is the Boppy Bounce in Comfort Bouncer, however, the description on Amazon is for the Boppy Cradle in Comfort Bouncer. So, I didn't realise they weren't quite the same thing.I was just sent this package and had put together before I realised that the music/sound component wasn't what I wanted. Aside from the ability to bounce and the softness of this device, the reason I wanted it was the soothing sounds. However, this item only has one selector so all you get is the music. Also, I assume that the music cycles through all 5 tunes that are mentioned on the package? I didn't bother to listen as the first tune was just dire.Bottom line: If you like the idea of soothing sounds, don't buy this product. I have returned mine and indicated to Amazon the incorrect descriptor on the website.Other than this issue, the product looked a good buy for the price. The colour of the material was a bit ho hum but that wouldn't have caused me too much angst. At least it was neutral which was what I wanted.
B0017VMH5M My husband and I LOVE these, we used them more as a seat/bed rather than a bouncer.My twins were both less than 6lbs when they came home from the hospital so these seats were WAY too big for them. We folded a bunch of blankets and layed them on these so they fit a little better. My girls loved laying/sleeping beside eachother and these seats were PERFECT to do that. We could lay the girls in these seats side by side so they were snuggled together and the sides kind of cradled them and made them feel secure. Our daughters slept in their cribs at night but during the day they loved to be in these together.When they were young enough we didn't have to strap them in(but also always watched them) because the shape of the seats are deep and perfect. This was so helpful with twins, especially when watching them alone. For instance, if I was holding Zoey on my lap while Madison was in her seat, if Madison started choking(she did often due to reflux) I could quickly put Zoey in her own seat & pick up Madison. I didn't have to worry about Zoey being strapped in so getting her in her seat was fast & Madison wasn't strapped in so I was able to get her out in a flash. I can not even express how important not having to strap them in when they were newborns was but it made our lives a whole lot easier. These seats were almost like a second set of hands to us.These were also easy to take places or from room to room so we took these everywhere with us.Once my daughters were a little bigger we started putting them in their own seats and they loved watching cartoons or napping, they never did mind being put in these seats. Also, they loved being put in the more upright position when they were older and if they fell asleep I could easily put the seat back into the recline position w/out disturbing them. They never payed much attention to the toys so I never kept that attached.We had 2 other different kinds of bouncers but they were no where near as comfy as these nor would they have been able to nap or lay together in them. Especially if you have twins I would definately recommend getting these.
B0017VMH5M Very basic bouncer which was GREAT! Was nice and 'bouncy' when other baby bouncers seem stiff. It's so incredibly soft! Easy to clean/wash! The toys left something to be desired but my son actually formed an attachment to the bee! Bought this WAY cheaper elsewhere so shop around for better price! Was not disapointed with quality!
B0017VMH5M This was my old review until the baby loved it:Don't buy this!!! First, while putting this together I noticed some little broken plastic pieces in the bag upon delivery.  The pieces of plastic were so small and cheap-looking that I figured it can't be important.  While putting this part together I noticed the bar wouldn't click into place like the other bars did.  I then proceeded to put the back bar on.  I examined it and there were no Right/Left labels, so I figured it didn't matter. Well, it does!  Instead of the top play bar going middle to back, it goes middle to feet now and there is no way of unlocking it once you assemble!  I took apart over 7 screws and still couldn't unlock it!  Due to this, there is no way of getting it back into the box to return! I'm stuck with a $40 piece of crap with no toy bar for the baby!#2  Actually it works fine backwards.  The baby was born with hip dislocation and sleeping flat was painful for her with her harness.  She slept comfortably in this chair (without the toy bar) for 2 months and now still sits in it to watch Elmo at 3.5 months old.  We love it!
B0017WVRM0 The windup part is great - no batteries! - but it only plays for about 3 minutes before it's done.  Alternatively, you can just have the mobile spin with no noise.  I thought that would be good for a slight distraction while easing a little one to sleep, except it spins so fast you'd think they're on a merry-go-round!  It moves far too fast for a 0-3 month old to be able to track.
B0017WVRM0 I love it. Great as the many other baby items I purchased for the new arrival of my grandson. It matches all the other Safari themed items I have got. Great in his room, which has the theme Jungle Safari. Would recommend.
B0017WVRM0 You have to keep winding this which is a big pain for me.  Other than that my little one likes it.
B0017WVRM0 I got a great price on this and themed my sons room after this.  Found an awesome animal print sheet, my cousin made a wreath with similar animals on it and I used the green color from this and cream color for the walls.  Great product.  Works well.  My son loves looking at it when falling asleep.  Would recommend again if still available.  Has a nice way of hooking to the bed without scratching it as well.
B0017WVRM0 This is a classic mobile that matches the Nojo set perfectly. It's adorable and the music is soothing. It definitely mesmorizes my newborn son.However, it is a wind-up mobile and it doesn't play foe that long, so turning it gets annoying... I bought this mobile because it matched the set I bought but I ended up getting the Fisher Price Rainforest mobile because it has batteries and plays on it's own.
B0017WVRM0 Ended up buying another one from Tiny Love that not only was battery operated, but also lasted for 20 min, came with a remote and you can use the music piece after you have to remove the mobile portion. Hoping that I can sell this one and recoup most of the money.
B0017WVRM0 I got this for my baby so he would have something to look at while laying in his crib and trying to get to sleep.  It's really cute and plays music.  I just wish the music played for longer (it plays for only about 30 seconds).
B0017YJ1O4 helps us organize our playroom and can hold a lot of weight with the included parts. we like it so far!
B0017YJ1O4 I pored over all the animal hammocks' reviews on Amazon before deciding on this one, and I'm so glad I did! The netting is super strong and I love the high-quality elastic. This allowed me to position the hammock exactly how I wanted it, and I don't worry about my kids breaking it when they pull an animal down. The hooks and mollies supplied were simple to install. Overall a great product, especially at this price!
B0017YJ1O4 Simple installation, great sized product, serves the intended purpose. I love being able to see all my daughter's dolls and at the same time have them up and off the floor (and away from my dogs' reach, too). Classic product, it is popular for a reason.
B0017YJ1O4 I couldn't find a hammock for my son's stuffed animals anywhere locally, so I ordered this one. It arrived quickly and is exactly as advertised. It was easy to attach to the wall, with the included hardware, and it holds a ton of my son's animals. We put it low to the ground so he can reach in and grab what he wants, as he is never alone in his room (10 mo old).I am very happy with this hammock. It is exactly what I was looking for.
B0017YJ1O4 First, this comes with four hooks and anchors. One of the three positions requires six, just fyi.For me, this was difficult to do alone and one of my walls did not allow me to drill into it and hang this, so I had to improvise and nail the hammock into the wall. Since my daughter is a newborn and this is away from her crib, this is okay. I was also really disappointed this arrived dirty. One section of it looks like it was stomped on and drug through the mud. Gross. I haven't washed it to see if it would come out. I just wanted all my daughters endless amounts of stuffed animals out of her crib so she could sleep in it.It's a good price, but you'll certainly need help hanging this and hope that your walls allow you to drill into them.
B0017YJ1O4 Does hold a lot of stuffed animals, I don't know if it's just the corner I have my hammock in but I feel like a lot of the space is wasted because it would push itself too far out of the wall. Again, might just be the way I have the room set up and that specific corner. I think the price and quality is fair. I'd order again if I had the need.
B0017YJ1O4 My daughters stuffed animal collection was getting severely out of control and this has really helped. Since she now shares a room with her baby sister this also helped keep some of her precious babies away from her sisters slobbery fingers. Works perfectly. Stretches really far. No complaints
B00185RM02 My daughter likes this little toy.  It's such a simple, cute little toy.  She likes to shake it and chew on it's ears.  Very cute.
B00185RM02 Seems like a hit, better-than-average baby toy.  Makes noise, bounces, easy to put in my son's mouth, adds up to a hit for my 7 month old.
B00185RM02 While my daughter was a bit slow to enjoy the rattle aspect of this toy, she loved to look at the sunny smiley face and chew every bit of it. This was WONDERFUL for us --an all-time favorite toy -- from about 5 months to 8 months. I now give them as gifts to everyone having a baby.
B00185RM02 So I guess I am the toy lover. hahaha. Baby plays with it, but it gets lost a lot and I have no idea why.this is the second one I have lost, so perhaps it is being taken by visiting babies. Hmmmm
B00185RM02 My 6 month old granddaughter is at the stage that she squirms around, looking for things to grab, while I'm changing her diapers.  I hand her this rattle during changing time, and she focuses on it and doesn't squirm around.  She likes to chew on the fabric flower petals.  It is one of her favorite rattles, and it surely makes diaper changes easier on Grandma.
B00185RM02 Admittedly there are a LOT of really good rattles, but our son discovered this one at a mommy and me class, and now several months later it is still one of his favorites.  The teether is a little tough to get at but he enjoys trying to put it in his mouth, and the rattle is nice and loud and easy to grasp. We got this for him around 3 months and he is now 6 months and still loves to shake this.  Thumbs up!Also - the Jumpy version of this sold on Amazon was also a huge hit in the mommy and me. I have exhausted our toy budget for the moment and now he is probably moving on to other bigger boy toys, but if you are looking for a gift for a 2-3 month old the Jumpy is one I would definitely recommend.
B00185RM02 Purchased as a small simple toy for my 5 month old.  He rearlly enjoys it.  I will push down on the top and it bounces back up and he thought that was fun.  It is also small enough for his hands.  Seems a lot of toys are really large and bulbous, maybe with the thinking the larger, the easier it is to grab but he prefers the smaller things, like the &#34;legs&#34; of this toy - he can wrap his little hands around it and pick it up.  He still plays with it at 6 months.  It has a rattle also which I didn't realize and he likes rattles.  He also enjoys the face - he seems to love black/white eyes nose mouth on a lot of his little toys.
B00185RM02 This is perfect for tummy time and for encouraging crawling later on! Push down on the head and the toy pops up just a little and rattles! And when they get a hold of it they love to chew the crinkly ears! This is the third I have purchased for grandchildren and they all love it!
B00185RM02 It was my daughter's first Valentine's Day this year, so I wanted to get her something to celebrate. I thought of getting a single rose, but she won't have any use for it. So I searched for \"toy flower\" and \"baby flower\" on Amazon, and had to pass up listings of clothing before I found this.Perfect.It wasn't red and it had that large bulb at the bottom for the rattle, but it was close enough. So I ordered it. My daughter loves it. She's about 6 months right now, so she constantly puts the flower rattle in her mouth. It's great, though, because the petal part is flat and small enough that it fits in her little mouth, and the texture allows her to bite down toothlessly on it hard without bother. It's actually got two layers of petal: one where it's fabric and the paper material inside makes a crinkling sound for her stimulation, and then the firmer portion that's more like a teether.The stem is wide, but not too wide to prevent her from grabbing it with one hand.She likes the sound of the rattle, though I found it kind of annoying. It's a little more high pitched than other rattles we have, but I'll tolerate it if she likes it, which it seems she does. She almost always grabs it when I put it near her.
B00185RM02 I bought this for my daughter when she was an infant and she got far more use out of it than I ever anticipated. Not only was it a great rattle for when she was new and learning to grasp things, but it was a good teether, too (the orange petal part is soft plastic, while the pink petals are crinkly fabric). This was one of her favorite toys when she was an infant, and often other babies would gravitate towards it/play with it when they visited our house. When my daughter got older, it made a great musical instrument. She's nearly 2 now and will still play with it when she comes across it in her toy box. This flower is very colorful and attractive, and durable, too: after years of being shaken, dropped and chewed on, it still looks just as good as it did when I bought it. I liked this product so much I've even given it as a gift to several of my friends for their babies. I certainly recommend this product.
B00185RM02 I've always loved sunflowers which was my main reason for getting it, plus at the time it was on sale for $1 and some change! More importantly, I feel Baby will really enjoy this.  The rattle sound is quite nice and not irritating at all.  Perfect size for little one's hands. I didn't give it 5 stars, just because for some reason it wasn't as cute to me in person as it was online; may be the way the photo is angled, but it's still cute and def worth the price Amazon gave!
B00186YSMQ I love this car seat! It looks and feels sturdier than any other car seat I've seen. I love the extra protection around my baby's head. Love the cushion around the straps. Love the newborn cushion; my baby sat up very well in this seat from day one leaving the hospital (we did use a rolled blanket around his head for the first few weeks, but I think all newborns need extra head support in any car seat). Love that the harness can be adjusted without rethreading. Love that the handle can be pointed down to keep the car seat from rocking when on a hard surface, if needed. The stylish colors are a great plus too (we have tropical)! Highly recommend!ETA: It's March 2014 and I'm coming back to edit my review now that we have used this seat with baby #2 for 4 months. We used it with baby #1 until he was 11 months old (too tall). The fabric held up beautifully and looked like new for baby #2 (granted #1 didn't spit up in it EVER, and wasn't a drooler...unlike kiddo #2. ahem.). The newborn cushion is nice for catching the spit-up that seems to constantly pour forth from my sweet, adorable daughter, and it is easy to remove and wash (and holds up well in the washer and dryer). The buttons on the handles that you have to push in are a bit \"sticky\" now and usually have to be pushed several times before you find that \"sweet spot\" so that they will both go in and you can change the handle position. This wasn't a problem the last time we used it, and I'm not sure why 3 years of storage in our climate-controlled closet would have caused it. Still love the seat, but the finicky buttons this time around are extremely annoying.
B00186YSMQ I decided on this car seat based on my own research and the input of another parent who uses it and likes it.  We do too!  While it is heavy, it is very safe.  Although it is bulky, it is very user friendly.  The latch for the base and the SIP adjustment lever are very easy to use.  The adjustable strap in front of the seat allows you to make certain that the child is very snug and safe.  One note though, when we took this to the hospital to be tested with our child, the nurses did not know how to operate it and told us we had to buy a new one.  After showing them how to operate it they said it was cool and the doctor seat it was a great seat.  Therefore, don't expect this seat to be as simple as cheaper ones but it won't require a degree in rocket science.  Just read the directions.  The SIP cannot be removed from the seat.  Moreover, the fact that this fits with ANY of the Peg Perego strollers sealed the deal for us.  Moreover, our child was born premature and under five pounds and, with the insert provided by the hospital, she fits in it with no problem.  When our daughter was released from the hospital her doctor and nurse said that they wish more parents would have this brand and model of seat upon discharge.  Also, the nurse stated that the base appears to fit tighter than any other car seat base she has seen in her many years at the hospital. Setting the seat up is very easy and the base stays tight and snug with many removals of the seat.  The tightness of the base is achieved by using the Latch system and the seat belt with the seat belt clamp.  The latches for the system are more than just mere clamps found on cheaper seats.  The latch system clamps on this model are similar to seat belt latches allowing for very easy installation and removal of the base.  Our baby rests comfortably and safely in this seat and I am pleased with the purchase.  I gives this seat my highest and strongest recommendation.
B00186YSMQ I am 5'10\" and very strong--no shrinking violet here--but even I had a hard time carrying this around. I would always wonder what a petite woman would do if she had to lug this car seat around with a growing infant sitting in it. Heavy is an understatement. I have since bought a Chicco Keyfit and have been very pleased. It is the safest on the market and about half the price. Do yourself a favor and skip this one!
B00186YSMQ I bought this car seat thinking that it was the absolute safest thing out there and was thus willing to overlook its ridiculous weight. Now, it seems that Consumer Reports has other options (the Chicco KeyFit 30) that have the same (if not better) safety rating and MUCH bet
B00186YSMQ We had a Graco seat for my daughter when she was an infant 5 1/2 years ago.  This time around with my son we initially purchased an Evenflo Serenade 35 and were not happy with it so we searched around and found this carseat at Goore's.  I saw it and tested it out in person and found that it was indeed much heavier than most other infant carseats--one of the drawbacks I've found, but I will say that over the 5 months we've had it I have gotten a workout lugging it around.  A few more complaints--it is sometimes difficult to lift out of the car because of it's weight (and with a 20-lb baby in it it's hefty), so with that said it is being left in the car more often than not for a few weeks now.  Also, I like the side-impact \"wings\" for the safety aspect but I do think they block some of my son's vision which sometimes frustrates him, even at 6 1/2 months old.  I gladly put up with these minor inconveniences to have a safe carseat that is very easy to adjust and seems to be comfortable as well.
B00186YSMQ I was looking for a carseat for my new, and third, baby. I have owned a Combi infant seat and a Graco snugride in the past. I wanted to buy something new and stylish, and this is one of three that are compatible with my 2010 Uppababy Vista. Peg offered numerous stylish fabric varieties, and I was thankful for that. Gracos are everywhere and the Chicco (the third compatible infant seat) has UGLY patterns. So I decided to find a store that sold the Peg to see if the reviews here were right.Let me tell you this- heavy is not the word to describe this seat. I am FIT, and am pretty strong, and when lifting it I could not even imagine ever wanting to carry this around with anymore added weight. It felt like my Graco or Combi felt exactly when I decided to move my kids out of carriers and into toddler seats.For new parents, this is VERY VERY IMPORTANT! Strollers and Snap and Gos cannot be used everywhere, even though they are convenient and easy. There are times you WILL have to carry the seat. Picking something up at someone's house, visiting people, carrying it in and out of your own house, carrying it into church, etcetc...Anyway, I don't want anyone to make a mistake here. I know its heavy because its reinforced, which is nice, but just not practical.
B00186YSMQ So far we love the seat. I'll do a list of pros and cons.Pro:Love the very high quality fabrics and materials on the car seat.Love the consumer reports high crash test rating. The side impact pads are a big bonus.The car seat base attaches quickly and easily to the car using the latch system.The seat straps are very quickly and easily adjustable.Con:It's heavy, but I suppose a 30lb car seat will be heavier.The baby shade awning lines up directly with the carry handle. It makes it tough get your hand under it to pick it up.
B00186YSMQ This is the only infant car seat we have used, but absolutely love it.  It feels like it's well made and our baby looks safe in it.  We have the Tropical (Orange/Brown) color and bought it in 2010.  The color has since been discontinued which is too bad as the color combo is wonderful.  We live in the California desert where the temperatures are hot and have not had an issue with the dark color being too hot for baby...as long as air in car is on, he does fine.  Outside, yes he does tend to sweat in it, but not sure if that's from ventilation issues, color, or whether he would sweat in any car seat just because of the warm temps.What we love:-Vibrant color scheme-Ease of installation in the car and use-Works extremely well with our UppaBaby Vista Stroller - With adapter, easily clicks in place.-Baby is happy in it (We use in car, to maneuver around town, in restaurant high chairs, and shopping carts)...he easily falls asleep in it and seems content.-I can quickly and easily snap baby into the 5 point harness and tighten or loosen.-Helpful user's manualWhat could be better:-As others have said, yes, it can be heavy and awkward when carrying around.  But so far I have managed just fine.-Takes two hands to move the handle into the different positionsWe are quite pleased with this car seat and hope to use with baby #2 when that time comes.  Also looking forward to the May 2011 release of Peg Perego's new convertible seat.  We highly recommend this seat, but it is a personal preference.
B00186ZQUO I like this product because it heats very quickly.  Yes, the beep is quite loud, especially in the middle of the night.  (Fortunately, we didn't have many middle of the night bottles since nursing was an option as long as I was home.)  It does get scale in the bottom, even when using filtered water, but there are cleaning instructions that worked well.  My biggest concern was it sometimes worked too well.  As long as you are responsible and test the food or liquid before giving it to baby, the only problem is waiting for things to cool.The other warning concerns bottles.  Some bottles will melt under the heat of this tool.  ThesePlaytex 3 Pack Baby Drop Ins Nurser Holder 4 Ounce, Colors May Varymelted.  ThesePlaytex Drop-Ins Original BPA Free Nurser Newborn Starter Setdidn't.
B00186ZQUO We have had this bottle warmer for a week or two, and are very pleased with it.  I read other reviews on Amazon before purchasing it, and despite the variability of the reviews, got it and am happy that I did.I don't get overly concerned about how hot versus warm versus \"not cold\" it makes the bottle. We are giving our daughter both pumped breastmilk and formula, and I wanted something faster than microwaving water and the setting the breastmilk in it for 3-5 minutes to warm it and re-suspend the fat of the milk. My goal is that it's not refrigerator cold when I give it to my daughter, although she will take a straight from the fridge bottle of formula when she's really hungry.I selected this warmer to purchase because of all of the ones I looked at, this one was the fastest - shortest time it advertises is 90 seconds, versus 5+ minutes for some other brands.  I purchased it from Amazon because of the great price (and we have Prime so fast & free shipping).As other reviews have said, the beeping is loud.  It doesn't really bother me, nor does it seem to bother her.I have used the pacifier sanitizing feature - I do like that option as my daughter has a talent for spitting her pacifiers pretty far when she is done with them.I will say -- we use the Playtex Ventaire Bottles for formula.  These bottles have a large plastic disk at the bottom (for the air vent) and the disk does get quite hot from the warmer, even when the milk is just warm.  However, since I am wiping the steam off of the bottle with a towel/paper towel anyways, I just avoid handling the very bottom of the bottle and it cools very quickly.  We don't have this issue with the breastmilk in the plastic Medela bottles, as they have plain/normal bottoms.We have not had to descale the warmer yet, but I read the instructions and the vinegar/water rinse seems quite simple.Overall, for what I paid, I got exactly what I expected and I am very happy with the performance of the warmer.
B00186ZQUO This warmer is good.  I don't have anything to compare it to because I don't have any experience with any of the other warmers on the market.  You have to figure out how much water to use for your specific bottle - be it glass or plastic, and how many ounces you are warming up....and how warm/cool the liquid is to begin with.  There are variables to get it just right but it does have a waterproof \"quick reference guide\" that sits in a little slot in the back.I've used this machine for several months now.  I've warmed bottles, baby food and have sterilized nipples, pacifiers and other small bottle parts in it.  It is quite the multi-tasker!  You do need to clean it with vinegar, for limescale/hard water buildup.  But, so far, so good.
B00186ZQUO I have been using this bottle warmer for close to four months now.  I have had no issues.  The insert tells you how much water to put in for the size of the bottle you're warming.  I have never had a problem with it being too hot to give to my son.  The bottom does get brown gunk in it, but it's not terribly hard to clean out and it hasn't effected how the bottle warmer works.We use Dr. Brown's plastic bottles and have no issues.
B00186ZQUO I LOVE this product. The design looks good and it comes with a laminated reference chart that slides in the back of the unit so you know how much water to use each time. It warms my bottles perfectly and I use the NUK 5 oz. and some evenflo's. I've only overheated one bottle and it was my fault (I accidently put double the water in the chamber). The unit does beep when it's ready...but I'm not sure why some reviewers hate that feature so much, It's not the least bit annoying to me.  In fact...I start the bottle, run in for a diaper change, hear the beep, and know it's ready! The unit does build up brown gunk in the bottom after several uses, but as long as you clean it per the directions, it's fine. I highly recommend this product!
B00186ZQUO This warmer is not only easy to use, its small and doesn't take up a lot of room. Its also very fast at heating bottles from the fridge
B00186ZQUO Once I read the directions carefully, it was easy to use. We are past the bottle warming phase right now, but still using pacifiers and chew toys, great for sterilizing.
B00186ZQUO From crazzeto's wife:We had horrible problems with inconsistent warming with this thing, with it either making bottles painfully and dangerously hot or still ice cold about 2/3 of the time. Another pain with this thing was that every time you warm a bottle you have to put in a tablespoon or so of water along with it. But, the measuring container that came with it had water level lines that faded within a week of use so we had to redraw the lines with a sharpie, but that faded too. It was also kind of annoying that the measuring cup was shaped so that it couldn't stand up on its own but had to be slid back in its little docking spot on the front of the contraption. We edned up ditching this thing after a couple of months and getting a much better one from baby pro.
B00186ZQUO Very fast and easy to use! The beep, as per the previous feedbacks, is quite loud but it doesn't bother me as it is in the Kitchen, it doesn't bother the baby either. I am glad I bought it, especially when I need to get the bottle warmed up fast at 3 or 4 in the morning.You do need to clean up the bottom from time to time but it is fast ans easy to do.Great purchase and I will definitely recommend it.
B00186ZQUO We've used this for 3 kids now.  Yes, the beep is loud but so what?  It turns itself off so there's no worry for fire hazards.  The ease of use is excellent, just dump in the water, press the button, put on the bottle.  Wait and pull it out, either at the beep or slightly before (you'll know what your baby prefers quickly enough (how hot the milk should be depends on what baby prefers, of course).  It's easy enough to clean.  The price is great.  I bought an Avent brand bottle warmer while pregnant with this third baby, thinking it would be better since it was new and different.  4 minutes or more to heat a bottle?  Whoever designed that has never held one of my children, especially this one who literally, at 3 months old, will scream and thrash while waiting the 30 seconds for that bottle to warm.  4 minutes and we'd both be done for!  Get this and pat yourself on the back for making one more thing into something easy and manageable for yourself and your baby.  Even when sleep deprived, this one makes life a lot easier.
B00186ZQUO This is a very simple to use warmer/sterilizer. It's fast, and instructions are clear (and I like the quick reference card in the built-in pocket). The one flaw is that the on/off switch is temp sensitive, so if you've recently heated a bottle, you have to wait for the unit to cool off before the machine will heat another one.  A drawback if you've more than one kid on the bottle.
B00186ZQUO Though my Tommee Tippee Bottles did fit in the Warmer, I was unable to secure the &#34;lid&#34; that goes around the bottle.  I would not suggest this warmer for people using these Bottles
B00186ZQUO I really wish I still saved the box. This thing died after 3 weeks- and it now turns itself on without any reason that I can see- completely random. Not great, because in the middle of the night, it'll go off (with no water in it) stink up the room, then beep incredibly loud. It's smelly, hard to clean, over or underheats according to the instructions- has warped my medela bottle, and the beep is ridiculously loud. It wakes up the baby randomly throughout the night now. I'm gonna toss it and get something better. What a shame!
B00186ZQUO You won't realize how much you enjoy these until you visit your inlaws and don't have one! I don't believe there's a better alternative to heating up bottles. We bought 2 for in our home. These heat bottles much faster than boiling water on a stove or running hot water over bottles. We have had ours for almost a year and they are still functioning like new. They do have a build up on the heating plate after using for a long time, but it is easily cleaned off by boiling water in them and wiping the off quickly with a towel. The water container has different levels on it for the size/shape of the bottle you are heating, but you'll learn pretty quickly how much water you need for heating your bottle after doing it so often.Make sure you check the temperature of the bottle before you give it to your baby. These heat bottles so fast that the bottle will continue to heat up if left in the warmer after the beeper goes off.Some other reviewers said that the beeping is too loud. I feel as though the beeping on the 2 that I received is right about where it needs to be. It isn't so loud that it hurts your ears if you're close, and it isn't so quiet that you can't hear it in the next room.These definitely save a lot of time over warming bottles the traditional ways. Just make sure you leave some room around these, because they get extremely hot. I've never had a problem with mine, but would rather be safe than sorry!
B00186ZQUO I've been using this for a little over two months now & don't think I could do without it.It warms bottles very quickly & does so very evenly, no need to worry about hot spots burning your baby.Two things:-I do not follow the instructions on how much water to add.. I just add what I believe looks good & if it seems to be taking a long time, pull it out before it finishes as to not over heat the bottle.-Remember to clean this out every few days. Mine ends up with some brown-ish build up even though I use distilled water in it.
B00186ZQUO We stopped using this thing about 2 weeks after we got it.  No matter what amount of water we used in it, the bottle came out scalding hot every time.  Then you had a 15-minute wait for the bottle to cool down enough to give to baby--which is the very last thing you want when you have an urgently hungry baby on the verge of a meltdown.  We quickly learned that it was faster/safer to just warm the bottle in a container of warm water than to wait for the boiling bottle to cool down to a safe temperature.  We use Dr. Brown glass bottles, and I wondered if that had anything to do with it--but the chart included with the bottle warmer showed necessary water amounts for glass as well as plastic, so no excuses. A worthless lump of plastic on our counter...
B00186ZQUO its not as easy as i would like, and its hard to come up with the right temp, its too hot or cold and hard to navigate.
B00186ZQUO i dont get the bad reviews because this bottle warmer works great for me. i just pour in whatever amount of water ( i dont look at the water/direction chart) and the bottle heats up fine. it does take a little time to get the hang of it but once you do it works great! i just make sure to shake the bottle after heating just incase of hot spots-no bottle warmer is perfect. but i have never had problems with hot spots. the alarm for when it is done is not that loud-it nevers wakes my daughter up. the only reason i gave four stars is because it does get a little gunk from water after multiple uses but i just clean it with a clorox wipe or soak it with vinegar. it is expected to get a little dirty due to constant moist-heat build up. the sterilizer for nipples and pacifiers is awesome-i use it all the time. however-i have used this bottle warmer for only two weeks so i dont know how long it will last but it is great so far! definately would recommend or buy again! fyi-i heat up pumped breat milk if that helps anyone and i use many types of bottles (drop ins, 6 oz-9oz bottles) so it works great with variety
B00186ZQUO this is pretty much garbage.  we had used this for two weeks when the light went out and the beeping stopped-but it still heated the bottles. now it inconsistently heats bottles, which also wouldn't be so bad except that it has a feature that keeps you from turning it on again so it doesn't over heat. it is supposed to be for three minutes according to the manual but it is for anywhere from 3 to 8 minutes.  so here is the common scenario-the baby starts to fuss because he is hungry.  you put the bottle in the warmer, checking it often because there is no light or beeping to indicate it is done.  you check the bottle and it is still cold.  baby starts to cry. you add water to the warmer, alas it turned off.  now you have to wait for it to be restartable.  baby starts to scream.  still waiting, up to 8 minutes.  now you have to restart the warmer and wait another few minutes for the bottle to warm up.  it takes almost as long to heat the bottle as it does to feed him. we are just boiling water now and our son is only 2 months old.it also over heated his pacifiers and made them smell like burnt rubber (sterilization bags never do this).
B00186ZQUO This bottle warmer works great.  Easy to measure water gauge so always use just the right amount of water.  Bottle is warm and not over heated in less than two minutes.
B00186ZQUO I Like this to sterilize a pacifier fast, I can't use this for the bottle warmer as the bottles we use are the Playtex Nursers with the liners and it heats way too hot even on the lowest setting. Very easy to use my 6 and 8 year old have no problems helping me out with the sterilizing and I look forward to using it as a food warmer.
B00186ZQUO I read the bad reviews and wish I had listened to them but there were enough good reviews to think maybe I might be lucky. I was wrong! This creates this nasty brown, smelly film in the bottom of the warmer. It also smells like it's burning the bottle. Just use a coffee mug and water- it works better and smells better too!
B00186ZQUO I got this for my daughter but lost it while moving.... it heats evenly and fast.. so I bought another for my son..
B00186ZQUO My original munchkin warmer had green accents and beeped when finished.  I bought another and took my original one to the babysitter.  The newer model (the one pictured) doesn't beep when it's finished.  I really liked that feature, highly disappointed the newer model doesn't have it.  Besides that it heats well and quick.  All bottle warmers are the same there is really no need to spend a ton of money on one.  You can also find this much cheaper than what it's listed for on amazon.
B00186ZQUO When I bought this product, I was expecting the same one my daughter bought recently.  I was informed that mine was a newer, better version of what my daughter purchased.  I haven't used the food warmer yet or the pacifier cleaning basket so I cannot comment on how well they work.  My only complaint with this item is that it does not beep when the bottle is warmed like my daughter's.  The light turns off but if I'm in another room, I can't see that.  The &#34;no beep&#34; is not a deal breaker for me because the warmer does what it's supposed to.  I just needed to alter the multitasking I did when I could hear the beep instead of see the light turn off.
B00186ZQUO After reading all the reviews, I decided to try the product anyway. The sound of the beep doesn't bother me at all, but then again my bedroom is fairly removed from the kitchen. The problem I have with this product is that it really overheats the bottle! Even though I followed the guidelines and instructions, the milk was always waaay too hot, and I ended up needing to cool it on ice.  In other words, it would have taken just as much time to just float the bottle in a thermos of hot water. I wouldn't recommend this product to anyone.
B00186ZQUO Overall, we are pretty happy with this bottle warmer, especially at this price point.PROS: heats quickly and pretty evenly.  The beep is loud (could be a con, though our baby doesn't care) so you can't miss it.  Comes with a sanitizing bucket, though it's a bit small to do more than pacifiers or nipples.  Compact and cute design.CONS: the stupid adapter ring...  This unit is designed to heat both normal and wide-bodied bottles, and if you use normal width bottles (like we do, with Dr. Brown bottles), you should use the green ring collar that makes the opening narrower, ensuring better heating.  The problem is the ring doesn't snap into place, it simply rests on the unit.  This means that it rattles and falls off every time you take out a bottle or move the unit.  Bad design, solved with a simple fix- make it snap into place!  Another con, as others have noted, is the gunk that accumulates at the bottom of the unit, though that's not all that bad.  The heating guide (the unit is steam powered) is somewhat inaccurate, and it can be tricky to measure exactly the right amount of water to put into the tiny little measuring cup (especially at 3am in the dark!).Overall, I recommend the unit, but with the aforementioned reservations.
B00186ZQUO It does indeed have a very loud beep/alert, fortunately my baby is not sensitive to noises and this doesn't bother him.  (probably bothers my sleepy husband more).  We like the item because it's easy to use, quick, and does what it says!one note: not sure if we are just bleary eyed sleepy hazed first time parents, but it took us a couple days to figure out the cord is wrapped and tucked underneath the warmer.  My husband cursed the short cord on this warmer for days until I finally inspected it and turned it over. ha.
B00186ZQUO I bought this bottle warmer as you can fit different brands of bottles in it.  I use the Tommee Tippee bottles with the anti-colic.  The bottles have a temperature sensor in them, blue is warm, pink too hot.  The only bad thing is that after using the bottle warmer, the sensor is always pink, showing too hot in the bottle, but when I test the milk it isn't too warm.  It is fast for sure which is nice when you have a hungry, screaming baby on your hands!
B00186ZQUO Works good but like everyone stated its a little bit LOUD scared the crud out of all of us I though the house was burning down! Lol also the brown stuff is pretty gross but cleanable and some time diffrent bottles are hard to heat even with the info card. Would recommend but also recommend taking more advice from other moms too probably a better bottle warmer for the same price I don't know about.
B00186ZQUO This bottle warmer does exactly what it's meant to do.  I've had mine for over a year now and just passed it on to the next baby mama in my family...  Still works for her.  I loved that it shut off automatically and I never had problems with the milk getting too hot.  You do have to clean it though.  I used to pour vinegar in the warming chamber twice a week for an hour or so, and that seemed to take care of it.
B00186ZQUO Pretty good.We use this product daily and it helps a lot in warming the milk. Really helpful. Thank you!
B00186ZQUO This is a late night life saver. Our little one goes from zero to 100 in no time flat when it comes to wanting to eat. I love how convenient and easy to use this bottle warmer is. I have used it with Dr. Brown, Medela, and Tommee Tippee bottles with no issue. Works great!!
B00186ZQUO We switched from a traditional bath warmer that heats up a plate to this turbo warmer. It's true it makes a loud beep but we avoided the other issue of the smell by using water filtered from a ProPur water filter. This warmer is so handy when your son is acting as if he does not get that bottle in 1 minute he's going to perish for lack of sustenance. Seriously though, maybe 90 seconds it takes....priceless when the world is crumbling around you at 2a.m.
B00186ZQUO I like it but wish you could use it back to back.  It takes a few minutes to reset so you can't use it if you didn't warm the bottle properly or have to warm multiple bottles.  Works fast though.
B00186ZQUO this product did not work for us i was very disappointed we are using the adiri bottles and it didnt even make the bottle warm i tried every thing.
B00186ZQUO You're better of adding a few more $$$ and getting a really good one, like Dr. Browns warmer, wich I should have done since I use that brand of bottles, etc. I made the mistake of buying this and one month later I had to get a Dr. Browns one, is like they say you get what you pay for, that's exactly what happens with this warmer wich is not consistent, forms a nasty build up very difficult to remove not even vinager and the beeping is so loud! no worth even try, I got this one cause I love a few things of this brand, the bottle cooler wich is amazing I must say, the drying rack, the containers for powder formula on the go, the wipes warmer I think the best one, etc. but with the bottle warmer they need to improve a lot. Other than that the pacifier sterilizer is pretty good idea.
B00186ZQUO I absolutely love this bottle warmer, it is simple to use and very fast! I have three of these, one at home, one at work and another at our summer cabin. As a user of ready to feed formula, this makes heating up refrigerated formula a snap. Sure the alarm is loud but it doesn't bother me at all. If I'm awake and using the warmer, you can bet that my baby is awake too. The little sanitizing basket is a great addition and fits two pacifiers with no problem. As a warning, this thing generates a lot of steam. Do not make the mistake of sticking your hand into the steam before the alarm beeps or you will get burned. It's a common sense thing that is easy to forget when you're dead tired and warming up formula half asleep in the middle of the night :)
B00186ZQUO Definitely worth it. You do not have o boil water in a pot or microwave. Only negative is after water boils out, there is often residue on the bottom. Also be careful not too burn hands when lifting out bottle. There are no instruction for a 2 ounce bottle. The nipple ring gets hotter than the rest of the bottle.
B00186ZQUO This bottle warmer is OK.  For the money, I was expecting something better, but I was obviously expecting too much.  I would call the temperature barely warm at best when heating just a few ounces.  My son is only eating 3 ounces right now and I can't imagine how long it is going to take to warm an entire bottle.  This is even with filling the premeasured cup past what is suggested.  I end up adding a little more water just to get it to warm.  The other significant drawback is the super loud beeping signal to tell you the process is finished.  My house is not that big and I am always crossing my fingers in the middle of the night that my 3 year old doesn't wake up to the long and loud beeps.  I wish there was a way to turn off the beeps!
B00186ZQUO I used a Tommee Tippee bottle warmer (kinda pricey) for the first 5 months. It would take about a minute per ounce of room temperature formula...parents know this can result in a crankier baby while we wait for the bottle to heat up. As our baby's intake has increased, we found we were having to warm her bottle 1/2 way through her feed so started looking for a 2nd warmer to keep in the nursery for convenience. This Munchkin Deluxe Bottle & Food Warmer was one of the cheapest I could find. It uses steam instead of water like the Tommee Tippee and is SOOOOOOO FAST! It takes 1-2 minutes for a 4-6 ounce bottle. And we've found the little measuring cup (A-E for levels of water to add depending on size, temp & type of bottle) to be right on.We use Avent bottles & the times are right on target--perfect temps! I wish I would've been using this one all along!The only downside is that it is hard to do a slight warm-up of a bottle w/this one. The Tommee Tippee is good for that, but this has become our primary bottle warmer! And the little measuring cup that hooks on to the warmer is pretty easy to use. I just refill as soon as I start a bottle for the next one & it's ready to go :-)
B00186ZQUO This item works inconsistently.When i first got it i tested the water setting to see what i needed for my bottles.It warmed properly 2 times after that, but then the 3rd time did not heat all the way up.I increased the amount of water used to \"Steam\" the bottle.  It worked about 2 more times then again, then did not heat the bottle.This pattern kept going until i needed more then the \"measuring\" container held to heat a 3 oz bottle.  I don't want to know what it would take to heat an 8 oz bottle!Baby is waiting to eat impatiently while i steam and re steam a bottle, never knowing how much water to put in because it changes / increases with use of the product.This is a problem because the safety feature on the product does not allow you to steam a 2nd time without the unit first cooling down, which takes at least 4-5 minutes.I do not recommend.
B00186ZQUO We use this at our Childcare Center in the Infant Room. We now have three of them and we really like them. heating bottles is a breeze with this product, and the pacifier basket is very handy.
B00186ZQUO Ive had mine for a year now & stil using it & loving it. Fast & easy way to thaw frozen milk & chilled milk.
B00186ZQUO i've had this bottle warmer for about 9 months now, and it hasn't broken down yet :)  initially i followed the instructions regarding how much water to put in to heat up certain amount of milk, and that worked fine when I was heating up 2 ounces earlier on.  As the volume increases, I find that I just had to add more water than usual to heat the milk up.  Nowadays i just use the entire water container to heat up 4 oz of milk.  my nanny uses it to heat up water too.  i haven't had any bottles that melt in it yet.  there was one time i forgot to put the basket back in and stuck a medela bottle in there by mistake and that caused some marring on the bottom of the bottle.  if you use the dr. brown bottles, just remember to take out the vent reservoir or the milk will travel up and leak out.the other thing is this thing collects hard water stains and calcium deposits on the bottle, so it kind of look dirty and brown.  i wipe it down from time to time, but i haven't had the time to completely get rid of it.  in all, for the price that i paid, i think it's worked pretty well.
B0018760PI Pad came wrapped in cellophane, but was dried up. I inked my baby's foot multiple times to apply more ink and each time the print was a light gray. Will not buy this again.
B0018760PI I use this to have my baby &#34;sign&#34; cards.  I do either a foot or a hand.  It's easy, doesn't smear, is a good size, doesn't stink or stain and washes right off.
B0018760PI When we use it to do the print of our daughter's hands and feet we were a little bit worried because the ink did not go away easily!Beside that it's a good product!
B0018760PI I saw other posts about them being dried up but I took my chance and it was rather dried up but I added some water and got adequate hand prints for thank you cards.
B0018760PI I like the fact that this product is baby safe but it didn't really work out for us.  It kind of bleeds a bit and you don't get a really clear print. We were using it to take foot prints of our daughter.  We tried several types of paper and it still didn't look right. Mabye someone else will have better luck with it.
B0018760PI This was just what I was looking for! I used this to put my daughter's hand and foot prints in her baby book.  The ink went on easily, and also removed easily with a baby wipe!
B0018760PI I read to do prints while babies are asleep. Worked well but does not come off easily. Took a few days to completely go away. :)
B0018760PI I ordered the black ink pad. When I first got it, I didn't think it was going to be a very good ink pad. It didn't look very high quality. But I was wrong! I did hand prints and foot prints for the baby book as well as prints on multiple Christmas cards for family. The prints all turned out great and the ink was easy to clean off my son's skin. All in all, it worked well for what I needed it for and now I have it for future use!
B0018760PI color was very light and hard to see on the inside cover of books I placed my grand-daughters hand print.
B0018760PI You would not believe how much this ink means to me. I'm sure I sound crazy. But seriously, this ink was great for capturing my baby's prints for her scrapbook. I caught them while she was sleeping so I wasn't able to apply much pressure when printing. The ink was a little hard to get to rub off at first and felt as though I put a bunch on, but the prints showed up a light gray (that may have happened because I didn't apply much pressure though). Ink came off with ease using baby soap and lukewarm water (I was scared of the mess we might create!). Baby's skin looks safe and sound. I was only planning on making her prints for scrapbooking purposes, but now I am considering greeting cards for family.
B0018760PI I expected a product that was much worse from the reviews on here!The pad wasn't dried out and I successfully made a few dark prints of my 3mo's foot. The prints were clear, if slightly grainy (the ink seems to be a bit thick). Holding my son's foot steadily and preventing smearing ink all over seemed to be the greatest challenge with this product, and that's not the product's fault!Clean-up was a breeze.
B0018760PI I bought this for my baby book i am making and every month i do her hand and foot print. i put it in a ziplock bag which seems to keep it fresh. comes of babys hands with a baby wipe and doesn't seem to leave any rash :)
B0018760PI Just as other reviewers said- it's pretty dried out.  I couldn't press my baby's hand or foot into it and get enough ink to stamp.  I rubbed her feet and hands on it for a while and got enough, and the print was OK.  It does wash off easy.
B0018760PI I purchased this item despite the other negative reviewer, who seemed to have just received the wrong color.  I ordered a black ink pad and received black.  The ink works great!  We took a footprint and handprint for our baby book (my daughter is 6 weeks old).  I will probably add footprints to personalized items for Christmas.  The ink works fantastic, and the best thing is I wiped it right off my daughter's hand and foot with a diaper wipe!  No mess.  Very easy to use and the memories of her tiny hands and feet will be priceless.
B0018760PI I purchased this ink pad in order to put my 7 week-old's hand prints and footprints in his baby book and on a wall hanging given to me as a gift. It worked like a charm with just the right amount of ink on his little hands and feet, and the ink washed off easily with soap and water. The pad was a little smaller than the size of the baby's feet and hands, so we had to press the ink pad to the rest of him a few times but it worked fine. A quality product!
B0018760PI I read lot of negative reviews about this product but I just wanted to use it once to take foot and handprints of my infant. All  other options were too expensive so I decided to give it a shot. I am very happy with my purchase. The ink was wet and I was able to get good prints. Also it came off easily.
B0018760PI I decided to go against all of the bad reviews of this product and give it a try any way.  I wish I hadn't.  I'm not having to ship it back to Amazon because my pad would not do any good print.  It feels wet but barely any ink will stick and definitely does not allow you to make any usable prints.  I ended up going to JoAnn and got a much bigger washable ink pad for much cheaper.
B0018760PI I got the black ink and was reluctant to purchase since some of the reviews mentioned that the ink was dry or dried too quickly. I didn't have either of those problems.  My 11 month year old baby used it as a \"signature\" on a few cards and it worked perfectly.  Although she is quite fidgety I was able to stamp her hand well, press it well on paper, and it easily washed off. It wasn't a perfect picture of her hand, but I just wanted to get a simple hand print to indicate her size and not a true FBI finger print match.  If your going to use it for more than a few projects I wouldn't recommend it since I do think the ink dries quickly for an ink pad after the package is opened, but for a simple hand print for a few projects I think it works fine.
B0018760PI i would have been better off getting some type of roller, my 3 mo old doesn't cooperate much when it comes to his hands. the ink doesn't come out very easily so it takes a while to get enough on his hands while fighting him to open his hands, but it works.
B0018760PI dried out a little but they sent me a replacement.  I was able to use it again by rewetting it w a little bit of water later on.
B0018760PI I took a chance with this product despite negative reviews because it's the cheapest baby pad on Amazon.  It's as others have mentioned, really dry and faint.  I was able to get a pair of light but somewhat acceptable footprints on my baby book.Some tips: 1) add some water to rehydrate the pad, 2) kind of drag your baby's foot on the pad rather than just trying to press it down harder.  Bonus tip: 3) if you mess up the print on your baby book (my daughter stepped her right heel down twice), take a soft white eraser, use it on paper first to make sure it's clean and not smudgy, and you should be able to lighten your mistake.
B0018760PI I completely regret purchasing this item. It was completely dried out when I opened the seal, and it ruined my opportunity to get my daughter's feet and hand prints into her baby book. I would NOT get this, and I would not recommend anyone to purchase this item.
B0018760PI I was looking for ink to make hand and foot prints of my baby for cards to relatives.  Despite the negative reviews, I decided to try it, figure I could return it if there was a problem.  The ink pad did arrive dry like a lot of reviewers noted.  However, I just added a few drops of water to the ink pad and it has been working great.  We have made a lot of cute hand and foot prints, and the ink wipes off easily with a wet wipe or just water.  It even came out of the carpet without too much hassle.
B0018760PI The good thing about this ink is the color. I should have used washable marker. This stuff smears very easy I couldnt get a good print and wont come off ANYTHING, clothes or hands. I would think twice before using this again.
B0018760PI I've used this for numerous hand and foot prints of my 3 month old twins.  The case does not snap or click closed, so you'll want to be careful to make sure it's closed when you're done with it.  I am able to easily wipe the ink off their hands/feet with a baby wipe.
B0018760PI Unfortunately I didn't listen to the reviews. I ordered a black ink pad and it was completely dried out. I returned it and exchanged it for a new one and that was dried out too. Quite disappointing because we can't find a baby-safe ink pad at any of the stores in our area.Do not order this ink pad!
B0018760PI The ink pad was dry.  My husband and I tried different things to get ink out of it (water, baby oil, etc.) and nothing worked.  Very disappointed.  I should have listened to the reviews.
B0018760PI I was able to use is for my own finger printWithout problem. Not super high quality but it work. But never was able to do my newborn's hands. There was not enough ink and we had to keep her hand on the paper way to long for it to work.
B0018760PI The ink is so faint and equivalent to a dried-up ink pad.  Had to wipe baby's feet on it many times to transfer the ink and even then the print was so light.  Not sure how it will hold up for archival purposes in a baby memory book.
B0018760PI I should have listened to the previous reviews but I was desperate for some prints by Mother's day and couldn't find anything else. The prints look like dirt smudges. You can't even tell they are hand prints. I spoke with a an older friend and she said use tempura paints not ink pads. Hindsight is 20/20.
B0018760PI This is exactly what we needed for keeping track of our son's growth! We love this product! It was easy to use and safe for him, so we're happy!
B0018760PI It was fine for its purpose but it didn't make an even coating. It was difficult to get a good stamp unless I repetitively whipped across her feet and hands. It was a good product for the value.I give it 4 stars because we got what we needed.
B0018760PI Arrived dry and useless. I had also sent for the Baby Safe Ink Print Kit and it was great, with the pad just like they use in the hospital. Save you money and get it instead, as they are only that tiny once!
B0018760PI The ink pad was big enough for my infants hands and feet - looked good on the paper, only problem was getting the baby to stretch out her hand and not wiggle!
B0018760PI Seems like a hit or miss with this product, but half the reviews seem to say it arrived dried up. Mine did too. Otherwise i'd be writing a good review. It's only ink after all. Must just be bad quality control and/or storage.
B0018760PI Maybe it was me but I could hardly get the ink on my child. And my son was rather large at birth and the pad was rather small compared to him.
B0018760PI My baby hands and feet are bigger than this pad .by the time the ink was on his hands and feet he was all fussy . When bought the pad ink is dry and clumpy you have to sprinkle the pad with water and spread the water across to activate the pad .
B0018760PI Ink pad was very dry. Prints came out light grey at best. I would recommend looking around for another item.
B0018760PI I purchased this product thinking I could use it to ink my 3 month old son's hands and feet to save his baby prints. The ink pad is actually really tiny, which made it hard to get the ink onto my son's hands and feet, since I had to keep turning it in different directions and at different angles to get the ink on him (though I think more ink ended up on me and the table). If the pad was larger, it would have been so easy to just press his foot on it, then onto a paper. Sigh.I haven't tried it again because it was such a hassel. But, while ink did get all over, it washed off fairly easily - which is a plus. I'd recommend this for small stamps, or if you have something to roll on it, then onto your baby's hands or feet.
B0018760PI This ink pad arrived in a plastic bag, and was also wrapped in cellophane, but even with these precautions, it was completely dried out - I couldn't even get a smudge of ink to show up on my finger. I tried adding a little bit of water to the pad to re-wet the ink, which didn't work. This was really a complete waste of money and I will be asking for my money back.
B0018760PI I'm so upset that this didn't come as explained in the description. I bought when my newborn was 2 weeks old so we can get his early prints. When they arrived, the ink pad was all dried out and could not get a print at all. Its worth it to spend a few extra bucks to get a better quality ink.
B0018760PI The ink pad was dry and unusable. I should have known better with the price. It was a waste of the couple $ spent.
B0018760PI The ink ran out after 2 very hard to see footprints.  With a squirmy baby, you probably will need to take a couple of attempts before getting a good one and there's not enough ink to get it done.  Couldn't even attempt the hands.  I ended up using a water based non toxic paint that I had on hand. I shouldn't have wasted my money on this one.
B0018760PI Ours dried up a bit but we just kept adding a drop or two of water. I used it for my son's baby book & then again for my dog so I could get his print for a tattoo I've been wanting :)
B0018760PI We were able to get our daughters prints with this no problem.  We found that if I held a piece of paper on top of a book that was what worked best.  I did get the ink all over myself and her clothes but it all came out no problem.  We used a wipe to get it off of her hands.  I would recommend trying to do it while your baby is sleeping.  It didn't even really wake her up.
B0018760PI Works like it should... you just need a bit of elbow grease to clean your kid up with the pink ink... or she'll be walking around with pink feet.  Seems strange but it was easier to clean the black ink off her feet than the pink ink.  We used baby wipes.
B0018760PI I was very skeptical about this product bc all the bad reviews but, it worked perfectly for me. Other thing was that t was quite tricky open my baby's hand. Good product if you know how to use it.
B0018760PI This ink pad was good enough to get my baby's hand and foot prints done.  I had no issue with the pad being dried out.  Yes the prints look a bit smudged, and may come out light if not enough ink is applied. however that is also attributed to the parents guidance of the infants hands.  It gets the job done and the best part was that it was EASY to WIPE OFF.
B0018760PI not dark enough ink and came a bit dried out and slightly ripped packaging. was not quite what i expected.
B0018760PI paint works better and it really wasnt all that dark the first time then it dryed up better for feet than hands in my opinon
B0018760PI Was excited to use this but it was dried up when it arrived so was unusable.  Very bummed.  Good idea but does not deliver as promised.
B0018760PI We bought this ink when we couldn't find any no mess pads like they have at the hospital. I still would have preferred the no mess ones, but this washed off prettying easily and got the job done.
B0018760PI The ink pad was dried out when it arrived, but dabbing water onto it did the trick. It worked fine and wiped off baby's foot easily with a wipe.
B0018760PI Worked well for what I needed it to do.  The shade was dark enough.  It did dry out like others said.
B0018760PI I purchased this ink andBaby Safe Ink Print Kit - Basic. This product is the usual sponge ink pad while the latter is pure gel ink on a plastic plate. This ink was easy to apply to baby's hands, but the pad was very dry when we received it, and I had to moisten it to get sufficient ink coverage. The impression was a mid-grey, rather than black, and it looks like it would wear relatively quickly. On the plus side, it was very easy to remove from my baby's hands, unlike the other ink. If you're looking for a forever keepsake, go with the other ink print kit. If you're looking for ink for a craft project, this would work nicely (after a little water doctoring).
B00188VFNY The jungle tales crib bedding set from NoJo is really adorable. It's soft and well made. If you select the same bedding set for your baby, you'll also want to pick up an extra sheet for when those late night \"accidents\" happen. This sheet is sturdy, fits standard crib mattresses perfectly, with elastic gathering all the way around that wraps the sheet all the way under the mattress so it won't come undone. The multicolored polka dots are just charming!
B00188VFNY We got the whole Jungle Tales set and I just wanted a back-up sheet.  I love the colorful dots in this sheet!
B00188VFNY Mine was included with the set I purchased. The sheet is as soft as some of the others that I have purchased, also it doesn't fit my mattress very well. It is a bit too tight, and it can't be my mattress, because the others fit perfectly.
B00188VFNY This sheet is a cute print and matches my nursery decor, but - most importantly - it also has full elastic (all the way around the sheet), which creates a nice, snug fit. Also washed well.
B00188VFNY We've been using the nojo jungle tails crib bedding for almost a year and half now.  I love this crib sheet more than any others I've purchased.  It washes up really well and fits the crib mattress perfectly.  It's nice and tight on the crib mattress but you don't have to struggle to get it on - like you do with so many other crib sheets!
B00188XW26 My son has loved this toy so much we have bought one for the car, his nursery and the living room. He is now 8 months, but has been crazy about it since we introduced the O-ball at about 4 months. The only thing you should beware of - when you order this from the Amazon site you can easily get any color. We ended up with a pink one for our son (I just regifted ;) I have bought an additional 3 as baby gifts for other people. We're not AS crazy about the Big version of the ball, tho...
B00188XW26 The Oball looks like alot of fun.  Very light and can be easily picked up by your little ones.  However, I will not be giving this toy to my 4 month old baby.  Those pockets of rattles are glued in and they are poorly done.  You can see glues slabbed all over.  They advertised as PVC free, PHTHALATES free, lead free, even safe to put in steamer.  All that is useless if you got dried glue all over.  I can't imagine any babies playing with this toy since they always put things in their mouth!!  Totally unacceptable as an infant toy.Another reviewer had also mentioned this, I thought it might be a fluke but looks like Rhino Toys have some quality control issue.  I will be returning the product.
B00188XW26 If you're in the market for the perfect baby shower gift, look no further - this is hands-down the best present we received ...and I'm not not just saying that because my mother gave it to me. :)My son has loved this toy since he was about a month old. At first he enjoyed just being able to  hold it and shake it (the design is perfect for little fingers), then it helped him learn how to transfer things from hand-to-hand (since it's so easy to grip), and now he loves trying to chew on it (very hilariously, I might add - it's impossible). The Oball always keeps him occupied, and is easy to attach  to a stroller/car seat/high chair with a few links (not included) so the adults don't try to steal it.Important note: Product page states this toy is for 3 years+, but packaging confirms that it's fine for infants (0 months+).
B00188XW26 This rattling ball is a great baby toy because it is easy to grasp and roll.  It also has a quiet rattle.  It is small, so it doesn't interest my older girls who are 3 and 4, but my 1-year-old is fascinated by it.  It is a lot like the Baby Einstein Bendy Ball but lighter and with a quieter rattle.
B00188XW26 This ball is perfect for babies just learning how to crawl, roll or grab for things they want.  My 5 month old can easily grab this & for the time being loves to try & chew on it & pass it from hand to hand to get it to rattle.  Our neighbor's son is a bit older & has started rolling & everytime he's over he rolls around trying to get it.  They are ordering one too.  Ours came in green.
B00188XW26 I got this for our 2 month old and it's the only toy he really &#34;plays&#34; with.  It's the perfect shape/size for his tiny hands to grasp.
B00188XW26 Fun toy for an infant, ages 3 months to crawling. I actually brought this toy for my son to play with at a 2 year olds party and he was just as interested in playing with it. I purchased the toy online, only to find it at a local retailer much cheaper. Bummer.
B00188XW26 I bought this when my daughter was about 6 months and this quickly became one of her favorite toys. She was able to grab it easily and played with it all the time. She is 1 now and still plays with it often. The little balls in the ball are great because she loves to shake it. If you want a cheap and fun toy to keep your little one busy this is a great option!!
B00188XW26 We bought this for my infant daughter on the recommendation from an infant specialist for development. It is great since little hands can grasp it so easily. I also like that you can clip it with the plastic links or other straps so it is always within baby's reach, even if they throw or drop it. I only have the versions with the rattle beads since my daughter loves to make extra noise shaking it. My husband and I have even had fun playing catch/roll/pass between the three of us with it. One of my go to presents for babies now.
B00188XW26 This is one of my sons favorite toys. My brother got it for my son when he was a month old but we didn't start giving it to my baby until he was about 3 months old. And he loves it! It is the first toy that he transferred from one hand to another. It is a great toy to get babies motor skills going. My son is now 4.5 months old and if this toy is anywhere near him he will reach for it and grab it with both hands and bring it to his mouth to chew. He has even tossed this ball a couple times. It is so great to see him holding it with both hands and learning how to grasp with this toy.This is a great toy to get to help your little one with their development skills. I am even thinking about getting another one in a different color. Right now we have just a red one. He even like to play with this toy during tummy time. It is soft and easy to grasp with a lot of hand holds on it. Plus the little balls in it rattle getting his attention as well.
B00188XW26 My Son loves this ball. He loves to throw it. He loves to bang it.  It is soft on his little fingers. Doesn't hurt when he gets another kid. And I can attach rings to it when he is in the stroller. Get the ones with the rattle. Worth every penny!
B00188XW26 This rattle is a wonderful idea. The ball itself is fabulous and the added rattles make it all the more fun without hindering the natural flexibility of the ball. My daughter loves shaking it and passing it from hand to hand. Because it is easy to grab and hold, I find it is a great toy to store in the diaper bags for trips in the car and restaurant entertainment - although it is not impervious to the occasional catapult across the room.
B00188XW26 This was one of the first toys that my son could easily grab and hold onto for any length of time.  Now he likes to fling it!  We bought it at a local toy store.
B00188XW26 This was our baby's first toy.  It was light and easy to grab for little hands learning to pick things up.
B00188XW26 Baby loves to grab. We got green.  Hes just mad because he cant really get it into his mouth to chew on it.
B00188XW26 Our 5 month old loves this (and our 2 and 3 year olds like to mess around with it, too). Excellent quality - will hold up to toddlers abuse for quite some time. All of the holes are great because it makes it so easy for tiny hands to grab on to it. We have the &#34;big oball&#34; too for our toddlers - again the holes make it so much easier for them to catch and throw the ball.
B00188XW26 This is a great toy for my 4 month old granddaughter.  It is easy to hold onto and she likes to look at the beads.
B00188XW26 I got my Oball from a baby boutique, and it is solid. I don't think my rough and tough kids could pull it apart. It's one of their favorite toys (my baby and my 3 year old). You can get Oball-like balls from the dollar or discount section at department stores, but the rattle on this is an added bonus.Since these are so easy to find in stores, I wouldn't recommend ordering online. In stores you can choose the color and see if it's covered in glue (like some reviewers said).If you're worried about choking parts, I recommend the Bright Starts Rattle & Shake Barbell Rattle for a rattle that is easy for kids to grab onto, or the Manhattan Toy Winkel for a fun, easy to grab teether.
B00188XW26 My 6 month old got an Oball rattle for Christmas and he loves it.  It's so easy for him to hold onto and handle.  It's light enough that if he bonks himself in the head with it, it doesn't hurt.  We also got a mini version with tether for his stroller.  I have the feeling that one of these balls will be going everywhere with us for awhile!
B00188XW26 I used to give Manhattan Toy's Winkel as my default toy gift for babies but I think I'll switch to the O-Ball Rattle from now on. Babies can grab it, squish it, chew on it, rattle it, roll it, look at it, hear it and just play with it in sooo many ways from the youngest age. And because it's a ball, it really holds up as a toy through any age. For that matter, I'm 33 and I love looking at the little rainbow balls in the plastic pockets throughout the ball. An absolutely ideal toy for infants.
B00188XW26 Purchased this for my little guy he's in the grabbing stage 3-4 mth old and he loves chewing on it. Would buy it again!
B00188XW26 Its a nice ball and rattle. My baby girl at about 5 months till present 9.5 months was lukewarm with it. Not her favorite. Foud this much cheaper at Target about 4 bucks, got it at amazon at almost 9 bucks!
B00188XW26 I bought this for my 3 month old for christmas. He was just starting to learn to use his hands. Now he is a liitle over 4 months and he loves it! He shakes it all around and just stares at it. I keeps him pretty occupied. I love it.
B00188XW26 Perfect toy for my 3 month old son. He tries to put it in his mouth, which is amusing, but he can easily grab on to this by himself which is really helpful.
B00188XW26 We bought this for our little one's Easter basket. This is by far the best toy my 4 month old has out of all her rattles, teethers, balls, etc. Ours arrived in the color green. The oball is collapsible, it's a rattle, it can be chewed on, it's easy to wipe clean (I use pacifier wipes, when on the go), it's so easy for her to grab a hold of unlike other things, and it also has a bit of a bounce to it. This is the one toy she has right now that can keep her entertained and engaged for several minutes, while I am otherwise occupied, or when changing her diaper. One of the things she likes about it is when we bounce it off the palm of our hands or off the back of the chair. So many different possibilities with this cheap toy. I think it will be a favorite of hers for months to come. Great baby gift! I highly recommend this toy!
B00188XW26 My daughter loves this ball. She has been gravitating towards it and loves grabbing it and now putting it in her mouth. This is my go to when she seems bored.
B00188XW26 This rattle is definitely one of my daughter's favorite toys. She is four months now and has been playing with it since she was about 10 weeks old. I bought this toy because it was recommended by another mom and I'm glad I did. It is easy for my daughter to grab and hold onto, unlike some of her other rattles, so she actually shows interest in it for a good amount of time. It is also a ball, so you can roll it around and bounce it, which is why I think she will continue to enjoy this toy for months to come. I also love that it is easy to clean!
B00188XW26 My daughter LOVES this ball.  It really helps with their grasp and with learning to pass things from hand to hand.  I strap it on to her carseat with one of the toy straps and she plays with it forever.
B00188XW26 My almost 3 month old daughter has shown almost no interest in toys unless they dangle over her head until she received an O-Ball.  The openings are the perfect size for her little fingers to grasp and the rattling keeps her entertained.  I was very doubtful on whether she would find it fun, especially since I was looking at it from an adult standpoint that it made no noises/lights/etc... but she loves it.  We now take her o-ball everywhere with us.  And the more she plays with it the better she has become at grasping other items.  A must have for babies!
B00188XW26 As soon as I put this in front of my baby girl, 4 months old, she immediately got so excited and grabbed and put it straight to her mouth, followed by shaking it a ton. It's only been a few days, but it's already her absolute favorite thing in the world... helpful too since she just got her 4 month vaccines and this toy helps cheer her up a lot!I haven't noticed the glue issue another reviewer noticed (although that WAS a few years ago after all) and to me it seems pretty sturdy but she only plays with it supervised anyway.Best $8 I've ever spent :)
B00188XW26 I loved that my daughter could hold it but it wasn't as good for teething as I had hoped. I am glad we bought it to play with.
B00188XW26 I was wary about this item.  My son is 4 months old, and yes - the rattle parts appear to be a choking hazard.  At first, I bought him the O-Ball Football (no rattle).  It's a little heavier and firmer, and he didn't really enjoy it as much.  So I bit the bullet and  bought him the O-Ball Rattle.  He LOVES it!Please note, I did NOT purchase this online - I picked it up for $5 at Target - it was there that I was able to completely inspect each ball and choose the one that looked the best.  He absolutely loves to hold this in his hand and transfer it from hand to hand and bang it around.  He doesn't try to put it in his mouth, but I am always with him when he's playing with it - I never give it to him unless I am with him.  If you're concerned about the rattle parts, there is a regular O-Ball without the rattle available.We actually have 2 of these (one for home and one for the grandparents' house) and the football.  Seriously - he loves this thing.... the best $5 I've ever spent!
B00188XW26 We bought this for our daughter before she was born not realizing it's versatility. She still uses it to this day, and she is now 10 months old. It's easy to grip and just loud enough to get her excited. This toy is invaluable because it can be clipped with hoops, it's not easy to drop, and it's actually a great crib toy. I would highly recommend this toy to new parents!
B00188XW26 These balls are great for babies since they can actually grab onto them.  The rattle makes it fun for them as they shake the ball.  The color is great and I bought several for my friends.  However, since they are smaller than the regular oball, it's easier for them to roll under the bed, couch etc.
B00188XW26 My baby loves this balls.  Easy for him to hold on to. Also easy to clean when he spits up on it.
B00188XW26 I noticed my son becomes interested in toys that make make noise and is able to shake. I have bought many rattles for his tiny hands and it was impossible to keep a grip on them. I found this Oball here on Amazon and when it arrived it became my sons instant favorite. The only problem is he likes to trow it! So I used one of those pacifier clips to keep it close to him. I clip one side to his onesie and the other velcros to the ball. Easy fix. I can also use the pacifier clip to attach it to his activity center or his stroller. Perfect little toy for his 5 month hands.
B00188XW26 This was the first toy my daughter picked up consistently at 3 months and is still her favorite.  It's easy to grasp, to pass from one hand to another (important for development) and she loves the rattling sound it makes.  I like that it's easy to keep clean and because it's soft I can jam it in the diaper bag despite it's round shape.
B00188XW26 I love this ball!  It is BPA free, lightweight, makes a rattling sound and easy for the baby to grasp.  Helps baby transfer objects from one hand to another.  Good for changing table, won't hurt if baby drops ball on face.  It is bouncy, you can spin it on the floor, play catch, roll for baby to crawl. It is the best!!  Compared to theBaby Einstein Bendy Ballit wins hands down!  The other ball is way to heavy and questionable if it is BPA free.  I couldn't find any information so I assume that it is not.  You can get this ball for $4.99 at Target.
B00188XW26 I first came across this when a friend told me her son's OT recommended it as one of the best toys to get your kid. Now I'm sold. My little one loves it because it's light and easy to hold for her. It's also great for when you have another slightly older toddler with a love of throwing things as hard as he can and a new baby in the house :) (in other words - it's soft/flexible)
B00188XW26 Love this toy. It is lightweight and very easy to grasp. The rattle helps capture and hold attention. When baby is a bit older I expect this to to remain fun because we'll be able to roll or toss it back and forth. Glad I picked this one up.
B00188XW26 It is good in the sense my daughter can hold it with her hands and she feels happy that she can do it, she is not able to put it in her mouth : it is too big....it keeps rolling away so connected it to the links I bought and hang it from her jungle gym for her to hold or bat....
B00188XW26 My baby is 3 months old and this is the first toy she picked up on her own. It makes her giggle when we shake it and come close and close to her with it. she reaches for it and it is one of the only toys she can hold for a long period of time without dropping. I would absolutely buy this again. We play with it every day.Update:This was the first toy that my baby could play with on her own. This was the transitional toy to her playing with things herself instead of me just shaking things around in front of her. Now at over 8 months she still enjoys it. It is one of the best infant toys I have purchased and I would recommend it to everyone.
B00188XW26 My 4-month old son loves this toy over others.  It's easy to grip and chew and it keeps him happy.
B00188XW26 I read an article on best toys for baby's development and this ball was on the list. It's great because they can learn to grab it so early on, and it makes a fun rattle noise. Later they can roll it around and use it as an actual ball (no bouncing though). For the money it's a great little toy. I use plastic rings and attach it to her car seat, her play gym, etc. or just give it to her to play with in her pack and play. She loves if.
B00188XW26 We have several of these.  They never get old.  They have been chewed, smashed and otherwise loved.  Totally durable, totally fun.
B00188XW26 My son was able to grasp this ball at 2 months and now at 5 months, still loves it. So easy for him to hold onto, so light he can't hurt himself when flinging it around his face, great rattle sound. Definitely one of his favorite toys - highly recommend!
B00188XW26 We have had the Oball since my son's birth.  Before he was able to grab or hold toys on his own, it was nice that we could attach it to his baby gym so he could easily stare or bat at it.  At a little under 3 months old, it was the first toy he grabbed onto and held on his own.This seemingly simple toy has entertained my baby in so many different ways over the months since then.  For a while, he just liked to stare at it and try to shove the whole thing in his mouth (it didn't work).  Then he discovered that he could shake it to make a sound.  For the past couple of months, he's been fascinated by anything that rolls and amused by rolling it across the floor.  And just recently, he's realized it will bounce if he drops it, which he finds hilarious.Add to that the fact that it can also be smushed, and it's really quite a lot of fun.  I assume one could also use it as, you know, a ball as well.  On occasion, my son and I have played catch by rolling it across the floor to each other.At 11 months old, my son still plays with this toy sometimes.  It was a good purchase and worth the 7 or 8 bucks it cost.
B00188XW26 This is a great toy for babies.  My baby loves it and I know many others who do too!  It's perfect for little fingers to grab.  The rattle just adds another dimension of interest/fun to it.  It is great to take anywhere since it's so durable and easy to clean.
B00188XW26 This is easy for my son's little hands to grab and hold on to.  He likes the rattle and it's very lightweight.
B00188XW26 This is a great baby rattle. The Oball part is jelly-like so it is saferfor my son than hard plastic (though the clear plastic that holds in therattle beads is hard). I also like that my son loves chewing on it and Idon't worry as it is BPA-free, phalate-free, etc. I got this instead of thesimilar Baby Einstein rattle and am VERY happy with my choice! At 3 monthsthis is one of the first toys he will hold on his own, the structure makesit very easy for little fingers to grip. Highly recommended!
B00188XW26 I bought this for my daugter when she was 4 months old. She loved this thing. It's great for tiny hands to hold. She not too much into the rattle part 
B00188XW26 I bought this for my son because they have similar ones at his day care that he loves to play with.  This one is even better though, because it also rattles!  It's so easy for him to hold and play with.  A great toy!
B00188XW26 I don't have much new to add, besides another 5 star review. It has been my son's favorite since he first got it at 4 months and now still at 9 months. It's easy to grab, it's soft (which got us through the period when he would inadvertently hit himself in the face with everything he grabbed), it makes a nice gentle rattling noise, and it bounces (convenient for when he is in an enclosed space and it can bounce back to him). He enjoys tossing the ball to us.
B00188XW26 My 8 m/o twins did not get too excited about this toy. However, I think that it's a nice addition to our toy box and hopefully they will grow to love playing with it. Perhaps the ball will be more fun when they start crawling and can follow it as it rolls away. I like that this toy has no PVC, Latex, Phthalates, or BPA. It confirms to safety standards ASTM F963-03. Made by Rhino Toys, Inc., manufactured in China.Update: it did become one of the toys to fight for - it rattles, it rolls, is easy to grab, and even can jump if thrown against the floor. Not sure why there is a warning about small parts - the little rattling balls seem to be safely encased in the transparent plastic windows.
B00188XW26 My daughter enjoys this toy, but appears to want to eat it so when she can't eat it, she doesn't enjoy it too much.  Yes, I know it sounds a little funny, but she'll shake it around and throw it on the ground, pick it up and then try to stick it in her mouth.  Once she can't do it, she moves on.  It's well built, durable and easily cleanable (is that even a word?) and entertains her for a few minutes at a time.  I would have given it 5 stars, but it doesn't entertain enough.
B001890IPE I got these for my 5 1/2 month old daughter for Christmas and she absolutely loves them. They are a good size with bright colors and different textures. The only reason I gave them 4 instead of 5 stars is that when you take them out the box they are attached together with a piece of string. Assuming that the string would break, I tried pulling them apart and wound up ripping one corner of one of the blocks leaving the string still in tact and attached to the other 3 blocks. I guess that was just user error but I still don't understand why that string is necessary...anyways just be sure to CUT the string and not pull it.
B001890IPE Sent to nephew's 4 month old and he loves them! Big hit with parent as well as they are very particular about who makes the product and quality. Thank you for quick service and great product!
B001890IPE These blocks were perfect for my son when he was about 4 months old (when I bought them). He LOVED the textures, sounds, bright colors and 'activities' they presented. I liked them because they were soft and easy for him to grasp and play with. These are not machine washable - which would be nice, but spot cleaned well.
B001890IPE My kids loved these! It was a great sensory toy and also great toy for teething! My daughter is 2 1/2 and still likes to bring them out and throw them around.
B001890IPE When I purcased these soft blocks, I was looking forward to playing with these and stacking them with my son. However, when I received them I quickly realized that my son was more interested in the \"add-ons\" for each of these blocks.There is a banana, an airplane, a key and a lid that attracted my baby's curiosity and attention.I also disregarded the washing instruction and washed mine in a pillow sheet (warm) in the washing machine and so far these toys have handled it pretty well. Just beware that after being machine washed, they won't be as \"square\" as they were when new.
B001890ITK I got this at 3-4 months and my baby didn't seem interested but at 6 months it was a whole new world. He also has reflux so lots of things he couldn't focus on until he truly outgrew it (well here's to hoping). He loves the crinkly side best. I got it on sale also and agree with other reviewers, I wouldn't pay $30 for it but he does play with it everyday. It's so hard to pick toys because some they love and some they don't care about, depends on the child.
B001890ITK This is an excellent activity center.  It comes complete with teethers, a mirror which babies always love, and various textures for baby to explore.  Kids can enjoy playing with the little fish that come with it and putting them into the mesh \"bowl\" and taking them out again.  The mirror is excellent for helping kids start to recognize themselves.
B001890ITK I had originally purchased this for my son to encourage more tummy time. The toy was definitely not what I expected.The construction is thin cardboard with fabric covering. It had a weird stench to it when it arrived and the colors were very...retro. Many of the features in the photos were absent, including the teethers, fish food rattle and one of the fish.The top is made of velcro so it somewhat folds up, but the things attached make it too bulky to completely fold.The flimsy construction means my son folded it inside out more often than not. He likes the birds because he can eat them and the crinkles on the leaves, but for tummy time, it's useless.
B001890ITK Very cute and interesting toy. My baby plays with it from time to time. She actually loves the side with the bugs.
B001890ITK My older one loved his tummy time, so I was surprised when my younger one hated it.  Hated it, that is, until I got this awesome tummy time master!!  From the time that I put this in front of her she did not stop cooing.  SO sweet!  There are some things such as the detachable fish that she can't use yet, but I like the fact that this will still keep her interest even when the tummy time is a thing of the past.  I recommend whole heartedly!!!
B001890ITK This was ok. I used it during tummy time and she liked looking at it and her attempts to touch it
B001890ITK My son is 3 months and HATED tummy time!  I was searching for something to catch his eye to help him enjoy it a bit more.  I found this and was willing to try anything to help - plus this had a multi surface and multi age feature. We used this (in conjunction with a Boppy) to see if this would help him stay on his tummy longer and SURE enough it did!! It was so great to see him looking in the mirror and smiling and playing with the goldfish.  The other plus is that when tummy time is over and he starts sitting up he can play with the birds and the peek-a-boo sides as well. I also love the fact that it can fold up and go where we go without being big and bulky. Overall I love this and feel it was a great purchase for a desperate Mom during tummy time!
B001890ITK You have been warned. The version advertised is not what you get. I got what I guess is the older model with no teether & instead of a fish-food rattle, the fish itself is the rattle & you only get to birds not 3. I can easily add my own teethers in front of the mirror but the discrepancy would make this item worth no more than $20. I'm sorry I paid $25 for it.
B00189GSA8 I bought this blanket for my daughter in December of 2010 and it is still like new! I have not had any issues with piling. In fact, it is just as soft as the day I bought it. I used it during the cooler months as a blanket to cover her car seat, during nap time, and also to just cuddle with. It was so nice and soft I bought one as a gift and it was well received.I was folding it today and came back here to see how long I have had it and can't believe how well it has held up. I wash in cold water with dye free detergent and fabric softener. I then use fragrance free dryer sheets on a low setting. It keeps it like new!
B00189GSA8 This blanket is super cuddly and soft. After wash it is still soft and warm for baby. I would recommend this as a good buy. The length is great too!
B00189GSA8 Bought one of these antd I loveeeee it. The size is great and the quality. I got exactly what was in the pic. It is very soft but I thought it would have been a bit thicker, but that's okay, this can work for me. I wished they had different colours with the same bear so I can order more. I will be ordering my rest of blankets in the future from Cater Brand
B00189GSA8 I ordered this for my six-month old, and he absolutely loves being wrapped up in it. It's as soft as anything you've ever felt, and it's also just the right thickness.
B00189GSA8 I received this blanket as a gift for my daughter. It is super soft and cuddly. It is nice and warm to snuggle her with. It washes well.I am very pleased that we received this item as a gift.
B00189GSA8 I love this blanket because it is so soft and plush. It has not held up to repeated washings though- it pills very badly and the little fuzzies get stuck to everything it touches. luckily I purchased 2 when they were $11.99 on amazon...  I'm going to try washing the other one separate from my other \"gentle cycle\" laundry to see if it pills less. update 9/10/2012 it did not pill any less when washed on it's own. they both went in the trash- they weren't even salvageable as dog blankets!
B00189GSA8 Blanket is soft. Baby likes the way the edges feel bI don't much like the color it seems \"muddier\" in person
B00189GSA8 One of the best blankets my baby owns, do not hesitate on buying it, its a nice size for babies, the material is really nice, just a must have and the price is very very good!
B00189GSA8 Supper soft and comfy!  I love it and my boy loves it too.  Found a minor defect(pulled stitch) but wouldn't stop me from liking it.
B00189GSA8 What an adorable baby blanket.  So soft and cute.  Can't wait to see the new baby wrapped up in this warm blanket.  This price was too good to pass up for a lovely baby shower gift.
B00189GSA8 I agree with the other reviewers that this blanket is cute and very soft, but it washes horribly!  To say it pills is an understatement.  I've taken a sweater stone to the two I purchased, and a week later I was right back where I started.  This blankets leave lint all over my boys' clothing and their shoes - not fun.  Wish I'd heeded the pilling reviews and looked for other blankets for day care.
B00189GSA8 The blanket is super soft.  Instead of purchasing a \"bed in a bag\", we are purchasing plush blankets and matching sheets instead.  Can also be used for swaddling and strollers.  Can't wait to use!
B00189GSA8 Great gender neutral blanket that is soft and cuddly! The little ears pop out and is sooo cute! It is also a very good size blanket, basically shawl sized. Good value for the price I paid.
B00189GSA8 So soft and cuddly, I send this blanket to daycare every other week, and it has been washed many times!  Holds up really well!!
B00189GSA8 I purchased this blanket for my son quite a few months ago.  It is so soft and continues to be soft after many many washes.  It is neutral for boy or girl.  The face is embroidered so it won't fade and the ears give little one something soft and safe to chew on.
B00189GSA8 I have been using this blanket almost daily for 5 months, it washes well. It's thicker than most of the blankets I looked at.
B00189GSA8 Love this blanket. It is very soft and warm and keeps the baby very comfortable. Excellent buy! We are happy with the purchase.
B00189GSA8 I will be buying more of these blankets, for the price the quality is absolutely amazing. I would easily pay twice as much for this and still be satisfied!You won't be dissapointed if you get one, thats all I can say! It is very soft, and adorable ;)
B00189GSA8 This blanket is perfect for fall/winter/spring. It is incredibly soft and a decent size. The color is a little darker than shown, it's more of a tan color than beige, but I think it looks better!Great buy and you can't beat the price.
B00189GSA8 I had a bunch of babies coupons to use on amazon and we needed new blankets for our 16 month old daughter and for the baby due late summer.  I bought several carter blankets and they all have been fablous! They are so soft, so cuddly and warm. My daughter just loves them. I ordered some in pink and the rest in gender neutral because I don't know the gender of our second baby yet.
B00189GSA8 Been shedding no matter how many times I wash it. Now the one side is completely covered in lint balls.
B00189GSA8 I bought this Bear blanket for a baby shower and it's beautiful and excellent product like all Carters Brand. I'll buy more very soon.
B00189GSA8 Soft and comfortable blanket, however if you are looking for something that also looks very cute than you should not get this blanket, as it looks quite simple!
B00189GSA8 i do not know why some leave bad reviews but i was soo happy i bought the first one for 6.99 then i felt unhappy when the price went up, i bought my second one last week and it arrived within 2-3 days very fast shipping no prime.about blanket: this blanket is only loses its fur when it is in contact with evenflo car seat... so i do not use it when i am out and about i use carter boa blanket. both me and my mother in law love this blanket because it is not thick like the sweet baby its thick and we can hardly wrap the baby with it...we love this cause it is think but it keeps the baby warm no matter how cold it is outside, when i touh the baby he is always warm when i touch him especially since we have to put him in the sun and our downstair is always cold about 67 degrees witht his blanket he was able to keep warm. i wished they have it in different colors. it took me a while to buy the second one was not because i am second guessing, i really love this blanket more than the sweet baby blanket that other reviwers left on this reviews, because when it arrived it smelled like gasoline even though it is thick but i can not wrap the baby around and it'stoo long the dimension is not equal it makes the blanket looks wierd. i was really happy when i bought the second one because i was patient enough for it to go on sale again at 6.99 next time if it goes on sale again i mite buy it again even though my child already have 6 baby blankets xUPDATE:: I washed this blankets many times now, its soft. and afforadable when i bought this for 6.99, its soft and thin but its really warm
B00189KKXE I purchased this blanket and washed it before using.  I washed it with other baby clothes.  It did not wash well at all, it has littleballs all over it.  I would not purchase this again.  It's beautiful before washing.
B00189KKXE This blanket is very soft and ideal for colder months of the year.  It is fuzzy and easy to snuggle with.
B00189KKXE This is the second blanket i have. its a backup for the originally my daughter loves it. its very soft and good price
B00189KKXE Super cute, super soft, definitely thick..but not overly thick so that it's awkward. Big. Just as pictured. Haven't washed mine yet but sure looks as though there wouldn't be a problem
B00189KKXE Everything the reviewer \"J. Lehman\" was true.We bought my son this blanket when he was about 8 months. He immediately snuggle with the blanket, and now he sleeps with it around his arm every night. He loves it so much, we also bought him the green frog one also.I'm thinking about picking up a third one... it's that good!
B00189KKXE These are wonderful.  They are the pefrect size for cribs and pack n plays and are super soft.  My 17 month old carries hers everywhere.
B00189KKXE this blanket is so.. so soft . its beautiful. have not washed it yet.
B00189KKXE this is incredibly soft and the perfect size to sunggle my baby boy in! As long as the price stays low (under $8) I will be buying more of these for baby shower gifts! snoozysung blankets alsom somes in a monkey, bunny and somehting else i believe! im glad i bought it!
B00189KKXE We received so many baby blankets, but the problem I have with most is that they shed and attract fuzzies from anything else you washed or dried the blanket with.  I spend a lot of time checking my baby's hands and removing all the lint and fuzzues that accumulated from him touching or grabbing the blanket.  This Snoozysnug blanket is the only blanket so far that hasn't done so.  It is so soft and my baby loves it!  It's also nice and thick unlike most baby blankets.  Seems like this blanket will be used even in his toddler years.  I bought it in sage since I had received the yellow monkey one as a gift.  I think I'll buy more to have as backups!
B00189KKXE I bought this blanket as a gift. This blanket is so soft and cute. I can't say I know how it washes up since I bought it for a gift, but I'd definitely buy this again.
B00189KKXE I bought this for a baby girl gift.  This is a wonderful blanket and it looks beautiful in the crib.  All the Carter's products are my favorite.
B00189KKXE For the price, the size is about right. but i wish it was more of a square than a rectangle :( but it is super soft i just recieved this today and washed it with something that had lint but when i put it in the dryer it seems to remove those nasty lint! very safe for the baby !! can't wait til my baby can use it this october
B0018B7NSM This is a great swaddler and sleep blanket.  They are well made, hold up in the wash, and work well as swaddlers (disassemble before washing though).  However, for what you are getting, it should cost half of what it does, in my opinion.  If it was more affordable I would give it 5 stars.  I have only found it less expensive here than in other places though.
B0018B7NSM I received the newborn set at my baby shower.  There was a noticeable difference in my son's sleeping when we started using these, probably when he was 2-3 weeks old.  The swaddle feature stayed secure all night, and we knew he was warm and cozy.  When his little arms started escaping around 4 months, we still used the sack, and bought bigger ones as he grew.  I think we stopped using them around 13-14 months, when he could cover himself with his blankie.  I wish they were a little cheaper--I ended up using my sewing prowess to lengthen one that was too short for him so I wouldn't have to spend $20 on one.  Cheapskate or thrifty???  Judge me all ya want, but it worked for us!
B0018B7NSM I love Halo sleepsacks. I am very concerned about keeping a safe sleep space for our daughter. I love the material and the breathable cotton. These are awesome, but to be blunt, the swaddle sucks. We used it at first and it really helped our daughter get to sleep because she startled herself with her arms and woke herself up. However, the swaddle rode up near her mouth throughout the night. We ended up getting less sleep because we kept having to get up and adjust the swaddle. Even if you follow the directions perfect the swaddle rides up over the face. I'm surprised it has not been recalled. I am giving this 3 stars because we took the swaddle wings off and just used the blanket sleeper, which we really like. Just be wary of this swaddle. It is not safe. It is also a pain to wash. I like this set because you get 2 sizes, which is nice.
B0018B7NSM I really like this Halo sleep sack. It has been working great for us during nights. Our baby sleeps very well when she's swaddled in it. I ordered the second sack, because my husband just loves the fact that our baby can't get out of it at night. The only thing I'm not crazy about is velcro on the actual swaddling part. If you undo it, but leave the \"wings\" on, your baby can scratch herself. So you have to completely remove it, and then put it back for the next night, and it's not very easy to remove it when the sleep sack is still on your baby. I feel that other similar products did a better job by putting the velcro on the tabs that can be closed just by themselves, so the baby is still in the sack, but can't scratch herself.
B0018B7NSM Our son sleeps better when swaddled, but at 2am I'm way too bleary-eyed to tangle with a square swaddle blanket, and he easily wriggles out of blankets anyway, so this is a good alternative.Pros:*It is so simple: put on the sack like a vest, zip it up, wrap the flaps, and velcro.  I can handle that even at 2am.*The zipper ends at the feet, so you can change a diaper without unswaddling baby.*It's safer than a blanket--no worries he'll wriggle out of it, get it over his face, and be unable to breathe.Cons:*The velcro is just poor quality.  After about 6 weeks of using it nightly the velcro isn't sticking well, particularly the little tabs at the bottom of the wings.*This pack comes with two sleep sacks but only one has the swaddle wings.  The wings are removable, so I assumed I could attach them to either blanket, but the larger sleep sack doesn't have the velcro to attach it.  We tried just wrapping our son in the wings one night, but woke up to find that since it wasn't secured to his back he'd wriggled it up around his neck.  Dangerous!*It takes surprisingly long to dry in the drier, which isn't a huge deal but can be frustrating if you're waiting for it to dry so baby can go to bed*I wish it was a more lightweight fabric.  Because this is two pieces (the sack and the swaddle wings) baby ends up with three layers over his chest (there is also a satin lining with printed instructions on the back of the wings).  It's summertime now and our son wakes up pretty hot sometimes.*I wish the wings weren't detachable.  It has two large velcro squares on the back and then little tabs on the sack that you thread through holes at the bottom sides of the wings to keep it from creeping up.  I wish it was just one piece sewn together instead of messing with all this velcro.*It would be great if this had a slit where you could thread a harness between the legs.  When we put baby in his swing in this we have to unzip it and pull one leg out in order to fasten the harness between his legs.As you can see, I have more to say about its cons than its pros, but the simplicity and security of this compared to a blanket keeps me using it anyway.  If they'd made it of better materials and sewed it as one piece I'd give it five stars.  In spite of the cons, if you baby sleeps better swaddled it's worth it.
B0018BY2EU I was breastfeeding exclusively until I went back to work at 3 months.  She was fed with Dr Brown bottles but it would take almost an hour to get her to drink the bottle.  It was so difficult for the nanny to feed her and frustrating for me since she ended up throwing out a lot of my precious milk.  I found this on Amazon and she took it without a fight!  It's so amazing how this bottle changed the way she eats and how much more she can eat now.  If your baby is having a hard time switching to the bottle from breast, I highly recommend this product!
B0018BY2EU I was looking forward to using these bottles but when we tried them my baby did not like them. I also tried the first years breastflow bottles and she didn't like them either. I finally tried the Dr.Browns bottles and she took them right away, now I hope she wont reject nursing, we will see.
B0018BY2EU I love these if used as directed they are perfect my infant took right to them the soft nipples are like breast.
B0018BY2EU Love the short nipple, it's soft and easy for my daughter to latch onto. She was exclusively breastfed until 6 months when she got one bottle a morning of breastmilk while i was in class. This was the 4th bottle we tried and she loves it. Definitely the best for breastfed babies.
B0018BY2EU These bottles are the best for babys  al the way to toddlers! My one year old need a fast bottle and the stage 2 and 3 really works for her milk and juice bottle!  And the nipple is soft and good for teething!The design of the bottle is great! I love the fact that I don't have to buy nipples!! With my first child all I did as run to the store to get new nipples constantly. It was terrible!I would never use another bottle !Please let me know if my review was helpful in your inquiry or purchase ! Thanks
B0018BY2EU Before we found out our baby was tongue tied we went through so many bottles trying to get him to eat.  This was the ONLY one that worked!  The reason being that he could lightly suck (which was all he could do) and milk would come out easily but not like a flowing faucet.  He also couldn't have any nipple too long or it would gag him. There are two things I don't like about this bottle, hence the 4 stars: Leaking and hard to warm milk.  There are measures you can take to make sure it doesn't leak (keep nipple and lid COMPLETELY dry before they meet so they seal AND screw the bottom on nice and tight), but at 3 in the morning it is hard to get everything just right and leaks definitely happen on occasion.  The other thing, warming the bottle is not fast.  I always warm my milk in a bag first then transfer it into the bottle.  That is a bit of a hassle.*1/23/13 update:Bad idea for tongue tie baby if you want them to learn how to latch properly after tongue tie release to return to nursing. Because this bottle let the milk out so easy without proper suction my baby forgot how to latch and could not understand how to nurse. Had to change to a bottle with a longer nipple that would stimulate the back of his tongue, he then starting keeping suction and a seal and a latch.In short, this was good to give him milk in desperate times (or for a baby who has no suction issues) but not good to learn to suck properly after the issue was resolved.Also, I have decided I hate the upside down/clear measuring label. Hard to tell how much you have.Overall I have found the bottle is more of a hassle than it is worth, but I am glad I had it when nothing else worked.
B0018BY2EU There is definitely a trick to using these bottles, but once we got it sorted out, they were awesome.  My son took to this and switched back and forth between breast and bottle with no problems.  The best way we found to use them was to skip the cap entirely.  We'd warm the milk in the pump bottles, then hold this bottle upside down with a finger over the nipple, pour in the milk, and screw on the bottom.  We had no leaking problems at all doing it that way.  Plus, it doesn't get any easier to clean!  I tossed all my Dr. Brown's because I hated standing there with a tiny brush scrubbing each little component, only to still end up with mold.  These bottles I could quickly handwash or toss in the dishwasher and they always came perfectly clean.
B0018BY2EU I wanted to try this bottle, and the comotomo, and wanted to compare how well my baby would do between then two. (After trying tommee tippee, Dr.Brown's, NUK, Similac, Medela with NUK Ortho nipples).First of all, with the comotomo, she would drink like 3oz. With the Adiri, she drank 2oz first, played for a bit, and drank a total of 4.5oz in the end until the very last drop!The nipple is a bit shorter than other bottles, but if that resembles the mother's more, then your baby will probably do better with this one.I have also noticed the leaking issue, but have figured out why:-You actually have to push down really tightly onto the cap before turning the bottle over. If it's not tight enough it will leak-When you push the bottom of the bottle (with the bottom cap on), don't use your palm, because your palm can create a suction and then break the seal, causing leak. If I used my fingers to push it down, it does not happen.Overall I like it, but I would like to see some comparision between this one and the new NxGen version!
B0018BY2EU My son would only take the Adiri stage 1 bottle after exclusively breastfeeding for his first 3 months. I thought these would be as good as the stage 1. They were not!!! I was so disappointed. The milk would leak and spill out from the bottom. I really feel the design needs to be reworked. These could be a lot better.
B0018BY2EU I am exclusively breastfeeding my baby and he refused allbottles. I mean he would scream and cry when given a bottle. However this bottle is our saving grace. Finally I habe found in the adiri a bottle my baby will take. Its pretty simple with only 3 parts. Only thing is you cannot heat it  up but that is a small issue. I am so happy to have found these. Now I can go back to work and know that he will eat and not be stressed while doing so. He has taken this bottle 4 times in the last few days. That neer happened with the other nottles. We would have to stop trying since I cannot listen to him cry stressed out when I can fix the problem.  The other bottles we tried were Born Free, Mimijumi, Playtex Nurser, and Medela.ETA (8/6/13): This bottle is still a favorite for my baby but it leaks, just as other reviewers had stated. I didn't think that was an issue for us until I noticed in the water in the pot on the stove my mom uses to warm the bottle, since you cannot use the bottle in a warmer, that the water was cloudy. When I asked her she said it wasn't like that prior to putting the bottle in there so we tried it again and sure enough, the bottle contents leak. It's just a little but still so. I was disappointed that was happening. I order the Adiri NexGen recently and that is not any better and was way too much trouble to use. Great concept but poor design.
B0018CMX9U I only gave it 4 out of 5 stars so far, because we haven't used this travel system yet.  I will be giving an updated review when our newest addition arrives.Received this item very fast!  We already have the car seat installed.  My husband and I have been waiting a long time for our 2nd addition to come.  We were given the date of Jan. 26, but our OB/GYN has told us that he might be here as soon as Jan. 15th, so we're getting everything ready in advance.  We have been through this process before with our now 3 yr old son, but it seems more overwhelming with a second one, who is a boy too.  We love the colors and the reviews that were given on this travel system.
B0018CMX9U This is a perfectly fine travel system.  There is nothing really special about it, but nothing really wrong with it either.  Unfortunately, the stroller didn't fit in our car, so we ended up using a Snap & Go with the carseat.  We did use the stroller around town and it is pretty nice, except the steering is really clunky.  It is really hard to turn the stroller at slow speeds or from a full stop, you have to back up and kind of get a bit of a running start.I don't really recommend or not recommend this one, it is totally average and adequate.
B0018CMX9U On child #4, this is the fourth travel system I've owned and the worst by far. The ONLY things I like about it are the handle on the car seat with the \"wiggle\" in it which is why we went Evenflo in the first place and the print. Otherwise my list of complaints is endless, but here are a few of my least favorite things....1. The fabric is not soft by any means2. The straps are absolutely impossible to adjust (seriously, we cannot adjust them), making it dangerous because they're never quite tight enough3. The sun shade is a joke as you can only pull it forward about 4 inches, we end up putting a blanket over it4. The stroller is impossible to unfold one handed without hurting yourself5. The stroller does not completely recline flat, so no diaper changing in it6. The stroller straps are weird and barely fit my 4 month old7. The tray has somehow managed to already break without any helpWe had a very similar set for child #3, born in 2007 which we were reasonably happy with for the price. I expected that the product would have improved but apparently that's not the case. Had I bought this in a store instead of online I would have returned it. Unfortunately, we could not find an Evenflo travel system in our area and now we're stuck with it. Totally bummed, buy something else!
B0018CMX9U Overall this is a good buy, especially for the price, but it's big and bulky, as most travel systems are, and didn't fit well in my Mazda 3.Pros: I'm tall and don't have to bend to use the stroller; manuevers well; handy cup holder; nice print; convenient to use stroller with infant seat; Z-shaped handle on seatCons: According to the manual, infant seat handle has to be 1 in. from back of seat in front of it and in the down position. Most infant seats allow for the handle to be up in the car--not this one! Therefore there was not enough room to fit this seat in my Mazda 3 safely. It failed the car seat inspection; Stroller is big to fit in the trunk and heavy to lift in; Wheels shake a little.As this is my first child, I am quickly learning how fast they grow out of the infant seat, making the bulky stroller a little unneccessary. If I had to do it again, I would buy a stroller frame to put my infant seat in and get a good lightweight stroller to use in a recline position and for sitting upright as my child grows.
B0018CMX9U Stylish and functional.  Folds down easily and isn't too heavy.  The handle height on the stroller is perfect, works for 5'3\" me and 6' tall hubby.  The handle of the infant carrier/car seat is comfortable as well.
B0018CMX9U loved this combo. my son fit perfect in it and it was very easy to push with the seat connected.
B0018CMX9U We've had this stroller/car seat for almost two years now. We absolutely love it. I have absolutely nothing bad to say about this combo. We used it for our daughter so the blue isn't &#34;too boyish&#34; in my eyes at least!
B0018EFGGU Just as good as the original that came w/ the cups. My ~1-yr-old daughter stuck her finger in the spouts, making a huge hole to spill the water out. Simple solution--cheaper than buying new cups.
B0018EFGGU This replacement spout fit perfectly but understand what you are buying as there are two different spouts (older and newer).  The cup that my grandson likes best is good as new again.  Just check to be sure you are purchasing the correct replacement spout for your cup.
B0018EFGGU These spouts worked with my Nuby sippy cups and were a good price.  I'm sure my boy will bite through them just like the originals, but I won't complain that this is a quality issue, just a bad habit from the baby!
B0018EFGGU I bought these spouts a few months ago.. i love this spout it doesn't tear easily unlike the older ones..however thwe one problem i noticed is you have to rinse them out immmediately after use..or won't clean well if you just wash them in dishwasher
B0018EFGGU This is exactly what it says.  Replacement tops for the nubys. Fit great no complaints. Will probably order more since my son likes to chew on the top part. It does take a lot of chewing to break the seal.
B0018EFGGU Fit his cups perfectly and helped save me money since he likes to chew on them.
B0018EFGGU So we are still buying this brand of sippy because I still think it's the best soft-spout out there, but we do have to replace these spouts often - they are too fun to chew and then the inside of the spout break and they leak EVERY WHERE.  However, while they aren't broken, they work perfectly.
B0018EFGGU work good to replace on nuby cups works ok on munckins.  but nothing else that i have found.  they do not leak unless pressed on something like a stroller.
B0018EFGGU These spouts break easily with a teething toddler, but it's nice to be able to replace them and not have to waste the whole cup. The soft spouts were great for a beginning sippy cup user, but now that my son can drink from the harder spout, we'll buy those type of cups instead.
B0018EFGGU We have been using these for nearly 3 years now so I feel pretty comfortable reviewing this...The good:The spouts are easy to clean and can be thrown in a pot of boiling water to sanitize (they are silicone).They are quick and easy to take apart and put back together.Really are spill proof as long as the holes are lined up right.The bad:My daughter is a chewer, which would wear on ANY sippy, but over time her teeth will break through the silicone. It's not like she rips it off or anything. As I'm washing them I inspect for little tears and toss what is no longer good.If the holes just aren't lined up (happens every so often) it will drip. This is an easy fix, thankfully. Just massage the sides of the spout and it will go back together.Overall these have been our favorite sippy and as our son will soon be ready for a training cup I plan on using these with him as well... depending of course on prices. The price for these replacements have jumped nearly $2.
B0018EFGGU It works, it seems like Nuby has two different top sizes so I was nervous ordering it, and was happy that I got the correct size.  This works, but if your baby/toddler has teeth and likes to bite, this is NOT good for you.  The spout will pretty easily get punctured and/or ripped.  My toddler went through this spout so fast.  Also, the original spout that was with the cup didn't do this, but this replacement spout seems to vent poorly.  She sucks on the milk and after a little bit the top caves in because it's not venting properly and building pressure, then she can't get anything out and gets frustrated.  I will be sticking with the Gerber/Nuk cups from now on.
B0018EFGGU it is does exactly what it is supposed to do and that in itself is something wonderful as any parent with small children would know.
B0018EFGGU Two of my little kids like  this Replacement Silicone Spouts but the other, (one of my twins), nop. Every kid is different.
B0018EFGGU But a real pain in the you-know-what to clean. However, like I said, this was the only alternative to a bottle out of which we were able to get our kids to drink their formula. For that, I am very thankful!
B0018EFGGU I purchased this Nuby nipple replacement for a bottle that I never used. I'm not sure if it works but assume it works just fine.
B0018EFGGU These are great. They are leak free and although they do crack when bitten too much, I find that all silicone nipples and spouts do the same. These are the exact same as the original ones that come with the cups.
B0018EFGGU These always work.  I never have anything wrong.  Come two in a pack and securely packaged.  My son likes to chew on the spout so the leak proof seal gets destroyed.  So, I replace it...no biggie.
B0018EFGGU The new spouts are NOT like the old spouts, I just bought new cups and they don't let enough air into the cup, so the nipple inverts into the cup when the child is sucking liquid from it.  So every few seconds, the lid has to be removed to allow air back in, the nipple returns to normal position and then lid put back on.  My son doesn't really like them anymore because it is too hard for him.  I compared his old with his new and they changed them, WHY?!?!?!?! They were great before.
B0018EFGGU I love these replacement nipples. My daughter ate through the first cup I bought after 6 months. They last awhile even with a biter, and a good way to ween from bottles to cups.
B0018EFGGU I ordered extra spouts b/c my teething 15 month old likes to chew on them to help the pains in her teeth and I discovered real fast that she was wearing them out real fast. At least you don't have to buy a whole new cup!
B0018EFGGU Everything came as I ordered and expected it, in proper packaging and in good shape. The spouts themselves are fairly easy for my 2 year old to bite through, but until she does, they work great and never drip.
B0018EHTH4 A neighbor suggested this when we told him our son was teething.  We bought a two pack at Buy Buy Baby (a competitor to Babies R Us) while we we were there for something else. We never heard of this useful item before.  The price for two was less than buying two individual here.  Also helpful, and we did not know this until now, was replacement netting is available.The good - helps out when your baby is uncomfortable.  We've cut up cucumbers, pears and apples.  We've also used ice cubes.  The handle is very easy for our 9 month old to grip and insert the netting into his mouth.The bad - as another reviewer said, is it's hard to clean sometimes.Great idea for a baby shower or a just because gift.
B0018EHTH4 We have 2 of these.  I like that it's hard for our little one to get open- he just can't.  I have no problem with it, just push in on the texture part and twist.  It seems pretty sturdy with no small parts.  The problem I have with it is the netting is so long he just holds that instead of the handle, so he's covered in whatever food is in the netting.  Avocado, not such a big deal, but apples are sticky and he was a mess.  Maybe another brand has a shorter netting but I haven't checked.
B0018EHTH4 If you enjoy causing yourself pain in order to feed your baby, this is the product for you!  If not, go with the Sassy model.  Opening and closing this is extremely difficult.
B0018EHTH4 Hated this one. Impossible to open and the handle is too thick.  They are all a pain to clean, but this one is worse because opening it is so hard to do. Not a fan.
B0018EHTH4 My 8 month old girl loves this thing! she loves frozen fruit in it.  I bought a munchkin first but didnt find any replacement sets for it so it didnt work at all.  Saw this nuby one and love it! big enough for her small hands to hold.  Replacement nets are a lil bit difficult to clean but if put in water just after use, this will help.  I will definately recommend.
B0018EHTH4 The description said the baby wouldn't be able to open this and that is true because I have a hard time. I like the single stick-type handle and the net comes completely detatched for cleaning. But, it's a pain in the neck to open and close it.
B0018FGDFC Another item which I can't understand why I waited so long to buy these.  Dr. Brown's bottles leak horribly and it used to drive me crazy how everything in my bag would get wet.  Just place these on top of the tan inserts and the bottles don't leak.  Perfection!
B0018FGDFC Good deal for the money.  I borrowed these bottles from my sister for my LO.  I like the disks because you can put it on the bottle and not worry about formula spilling out.  I had to buy these because I had lost a couple and needed to replace them.  I'm glad you can buy the parts needed and not have to buy the whole bottle again!
B0018FGDFC I used these to store breast milk in the freezer that I had been pumping.  I used evenflo bottles because they are cheap and fit on the pump perfectly, and used these disks to seal the tops of the evenflo bottles.  A cheap and effective breastmilk storage solution.
B0018FGDFC For months we tried getting away without using these stoppers in our daughters bottles, but the milk would spill something awful.  These little things do the job perfectly, and have prevented spilling in her daycare bag.
B0018FGDFC When placed under the nipple in the nipple collar these are supposed to prevent leakage and they do a little bit, but not to the degree that I would use them to take liquid bottles with me.  I use these for when I premake a bottle with just the premeasured powder formula in it and don't add the water yet.  I put the premeasured water in another bottle and use the travel caps for the liquid.  Do not buy these unless you plan on using them like I do.
B0018FGDFC These discs are necessary for us to transport our daughter's bottles daily.  They get lost at daycare all the time, so this replacement pack is exactly what we needed.
B0018FGDFC as others have said, they work on our evenflo glass bottles as well as my medela pump bottles, as well as our ameda bottles for daycare.
B0018FGDFC These are a must have if you are sending bottles to the daycare/sitter etc. - I wasn't using them and then a bottle tipped over at the nanny's house in their fridge and all of my breastmilk was spilled so she had no bottle - I started using these and now no worries if the bottle tips over.
B0018FGDFC I lost all of the original disk for my Dr. Brown's bottles.  I knew exactly what they did before I purchase.  Nothing to critique.
B0018FGDFC Fit great in my cheap Evenflo glass bottles, even though the brand is different.  These are much cheaper than buying Evenflo specific, if you can even find them!
B0018FGDFC Just note that if you are getting these for your nuke bottles they won't work.  I don't want to give a low rating when I'm sure they are fine, I'm annoyed that I can't find these for the nuke bottles I have, but that is not the manufacturers fault, I took a chance...
B0018FGDFC Dr. Brown's products had great ratings and after a lot of research this is what I decided to purchase.  Great product!
B0018JWAF0 With our first son, he could eat from basically any bottle and be fine, but with our second having reflux and a little colic, this was the best bottle!  He doesn't spit up or fuss as much with these bottles.  I would highly recommend these to anyone who has to deal with reflux, colic, or gassiness!
B0018JWAF0 My babies never suffered from colics.  Once they start to crawl you won't need to burt them again, they are great.Not the easiest to clean but worth buying them anyway.
B0018JWAF0 Our Newborn has very bad spit-up, every feed she is a volcano.  Her spit up is dramatically reduced when using Dr. Brown's bottle as compared to directly from the breast or using Tommy Tippee bottles.  As others have said, there are a lot of parts of the bottles, but washing them is not an issue.  The bottles come with a mini-brush, and are dishwasher safe - thus making washing them take the same amount of time as any other bottle.  My favorite part of these bottles are that they fit with the Medela Pump in Style breast pump. I attach these to my pump and pump directly into the bottles, to avoid extra dishes. Highly recommend these.
B0018JWAF0 We totally bought into the whole Dr. Brown's thing for my daughter - bottles, dishwasher baskets (2) and formula pitcher.  We have been using them since she was bout 2 months, and she's now 15 months.  For our next baby, though, I plan to use Advent or anther brand.  I used to be annoyed with how many parts there are, but I'm used to it now - the dishwasher baskets made by dr. browns helps with that.  The reason I'm throwing them all out when my daughter is done with them (and buying something different the next time I'm preggers) is that the bottle insert (tan thing - you can't see in these pics) grows mold. So, every few months, I have to buy 9 new bottle inserts (3.50 for a 3 pack).  There's a little dimple type thing in the middle of the insert that you can't clean under, and it becomes gross.  If you only have a few bottles, and wash them right away, you're probably fine.  However, my husband and I both work, so we have 9 bottles total, and we wait until they are all dirty to run the dishwasher.  I didn't realize it was mold at first, and was so horrified with myself once I realized it.  Note: now that my daughter is on milk (not formula) I haven't seen any mold grow.  I also might try a wide mouth bottle the next time so they get cleaner in the dishwasher... we are not the wash by hand type!
B0018JWAF0 The only real down side I can see on these bottles is all the parts.  takes a long time to wash.  I've tried other bottles with our baby and she does the best with these.  I think she likes the nipple best on these.  the flow is good.  I've never had any trouble with leaks.
B0018JWAF0 After trying about 6 different styles of bottles, our 1 week old decided on these.  I find she is less gassy and fussy after feedings since we've started using these bottles.  Other bottle's vents would put air bubbles into the formula, Avent, being one of them.  These don't add any air to the formula or breastmilk at all.  I've read other's reviews about them leaking.  I haven't had any of the 9 bottles I have ever leak, so maybe their bottles are defective.  I don't really find the parts to be difficult to clean at all. Right after a feeding I take the bottle apart and run them all under hot water, then they go into Munchkin dishwashser baskets and thats it.  I don't use the pipe cleaner that comes with it b/c rinsing them right after feeding,cleans all the holes out.  These bottles are great.
B0018JWAF0 I used these bottles for both of my babies when they were newborns. The only reason I bothered with these bottles was because they were the only ones I could find that had preemie size nipples, otherwise I would have just stuck with the NUK drop in bottles.PROS:-preemie nippleCONS:-WAY too many parts to wash and store. Nipple, nipple ring, cap, inner seal, inner tube, bottle, ugh! Who has time to wash greasy breastmilk off all those parts?!-Did not help with gas as claims-Too tall to fit into my bottle cooler, even the smaller 4 oz bottles.-Horribly leaky, even just on its side-Expensive
B0018JWAF0 Love these bottles.  Many claim they are horrible to clean but not having a dishwasher, they really aren't any different for me or more time consuming than every other bottle.  Sure there are a few more pieces but you run what is essentially a pipe cleaner through them after they soak in hot soapy water and rinse!Definitely eliminate a lot of air and help my baby with her gas.
B0018JWAF0 I would highly recommend these bottles.  They work great and do not leak.  Have been very pleased with them.  Will be getting more if these ever stop working.
B0018JWAF0 As a certified professional nanny, I have used this bottle with three different babies.PROS:-venting system seams to work well-Measurements are easy to read-despite the number of pieces, it is fairly easy to put together and take apart (you do need two hands though)CONS:-Slow flow is way to fast for newborns or breastfed babies. We switched toPlaytex Baby VentAire ADVANCED Standard Bottle 6 OZ - 3 Pack: Boy Colorsfor that baby-milk gets caught in the blue air release valve, which means that you have to pull the bottle out of baby's mouth towards the end of feeding and drain out the valve before giving it back to baby. Plus this makes the venting system not work well-There is always a little milk left in the bottle, no matter what you do-5 pieces to clean takes twice as long as it does to clean a 3pc bottle.EDIT:I foundDr. Brown's 2 Pack Natural Flow Preemie Standard Nipple, which I assume would have worked for the breastfed baby if she weren't 9mo old now.
B0018JWAF0 These bottles do come with extra parts that suck to wash but they're great bottles.
B0018JWAF0 I purchased these bottle for one reason only - MADE IN THE USA!  My son was breastfed for about 8 months, but I had difficulties and had to supplement with formula and now he is bottle fed.  I have used the 4 oz and 8 oz bottles.  Since these are the only bottles I have ever used, I am not sure if they help with spit up.  My son spit up a lot for the first few months and now he hardly ever does.  I think spit up is pretty common in very young babies, regardless of what bottle you use.In regard to some other reviews:LEAKING: I think a bottle may have leaked 2 or 3 times but if I disassembled & reassembled it, it didn't leak again.CLEANING: In my view, there are only 2 ADDITIONAL pieces (Vent System) to clean and it comes with a cleaning brush so it takes about 10 seconds longer.  When people are saying \"7 pieces\" that includes the bottle, nipple and ring (you would have to clean these anyway) and the cap and travel disc which I don't think you will be using every time.  I use thePrince Lionheart Complete Dishwasher Basket Systemso cleaning is not a big deal.MARKINGS/PAINT: I have no problem seeing the measurements on the bottle and I have not had any paint come off.Overall, I would recommend these bottles.
B0018JWAF0 these bottles definitely seemed to help with my daughter's colic, but they drive us nuts.First, the measurements are tiny and extremely difficult to read - as are the nipple flow indicators.  I have twins on different flows and they are hard to tell apart - especially in the middle of the night.Second, these bottles leak so badly.  I have followed all of the instructions and have several of the bottles, but each of them drip terribly.  You need to wash your hands and arms after feeding the kid, and they don't travel well, even with the little disks they provide to stop leakage.Lastly, with the caps the bottles are longer than standard bottles, so you can forget about fitting them in any bottle holders, coolers, or standard diaper bag bottle pockets.I actually don't mind all of the parts; some other bottles out there are worse.
B0018JWAF0 I wish I had bought these in the beginning because they are awesome at preventing spit-up and gas. Being a parent is a lot of work so washing a few extra parts is not a good enough reason to not purchase this product.
B0018JWAF0 I wish we used these from the beginning of bottle feeding. We unfortunately had to switch to formula because of health reasons and after trying 3 different types of bottles this is the one. The nipple is perfect for her. You do have to clean the multiple parts good but it comes with a little brush for the small parts. Long story short it is completely worth it and I am now hooked on all things Dr. Brown!
B0018JWAF0 It is a great pack, I order 3 boxes of this so I can leave one in my mothers house, another with my mother in law and other at my house, and they are great !! the only thing is that I have to bought apart some nipples level 2, because this bottles came with level 1.
B0018JWAF0 I can't really explain it, but these are the bottles that came out ahead of all the rest.  My daughter rejected Born Free and used Playtex Ventair for a while, but always preferred the Dr. Brown's.  It seems like she sucks the milk down easier, even with the level 1 nipple.  And she did have gas problems when she was young so I think these bottles helped.  They are a little bit of a pain to clean, but not that big of a deal.  Definitely worth it.
B0018JWAF0 I used these and the avent bottles primarily.  While Dr. Brown's bottles do require more cleaning I like the bottles.  My son didn't have problems with colic so I don't know whether it's due to the bottles or not.  I don't know about the labeling coming off in the dishwasher since I usually wash my bottles by hand.  I do like the slenderness of the 4 oz. especially.  They are easy for my son to hold.  The 8oz. is thicker and a little more of a handful for my son but he manages.
B0018JWAF0 Our baby had some major gas pain issues, so we tried these bottles.  The venting system really helps, and they are his favorite bottles to use.  There are more parts to wash (the blue vent, the cream vent-top, the white collar, the nipple, the lid, and the bottle itself), but it's worth the extra time.  They also come with a bottle brush that is dual ended, to easily scrub the bottles and the nipples.  We have already purchased 4 more to use.
B0018JWAF0 slow flow great for newborns.  good for feeding, but bottles leak when on the go so you'll need the travel caps.
B0018JWAF0 We started with the playtex drop in bottles and they worked well. We didn't have any trouble with leaking like some others have mentioned. But our daughter had pretty severe reflux and someone recommended we switch to Dr. Brown bottles. They are a little expensive and there are so many parts that we were very hesitant to make the switch. But sure enough, after the first day using them our daughter ate more ounces of formula than she did with the playtex drop ins! Since she is under weight, every extra ounce matters so we were thrilled. I think the playtex do a good job of keeping the air out, but squeezing the air out is a pain.I don't like washing the Dr. Brown bottles (compared to easy to clean playtex drop ins) but it is ok. We did find that a different brand bottle brush works much better with these bottles (The First Years Bottle Nipple Brush). It is slightly smaller so it slides in very easy. I highly recommend that brush for these bottles.Also, the doc brown bottle warmer is WONDERFUL!!! Drop it in, hit start and walk away. We tried heating water in the microwave, an electric kettle and a crockpot. Bottle warmer is worth every penny and then some.
B0018JWAF0 we had brought several different types of bottle. We went strait to this one and never tried the others. Works great and baby loves them.
B0018JWAF0 The first few times we used these bottles our son didn't like them. However, they work perfect now! He is 10 weeks and we are already using Dr. Sears level 2 nipples. They are a little long and narrow but it just takes getting used to if you are usetod the short, wide bottles. They are easier to clean then the Born Free air vents too. All and in all a good purchase and arrived quickly.
B0018JWAF0 Marvelous and safe for babies and toddlers.
B0018JWAF0 Overall it's great. The flow is good. Baby has less gas when using these. The only downfall is the extra pieces you have to wash.
B0018JWAF0 After I read the great reviews about these bottles and from my girlfriend, I went out and purchased 2 sets of these bottles and all new level 2 nipples and the rack set - I thought I was set.  Boy, did I regret it.  I never thought these bottles would be made in China - I don't know, with all the news about the high levels of lead found in baby products manufactured there, it made me wonder why Dr. Browns would even produce them there.  But I'll stick to the review of these bottles, they were a pain to CLEAN, ASSEMBLE and DISASSEMBLE - and because of all the little parts, you really needed to buy the big and bulky Dr. Brown Rack (so keep this in mind if you don't have storage space).  Most importantly, my daughter hated these bottles.  Nonetheless, I switched to Avent.  BTW, in case you were wondering, my girlfriend who told me these were great bottles later confessed and said she hated them because of all the time it took to clean them, but was stuck using them because her kids were used to them.
B0018JWAF0 These bottles with their inserts definitely reduce the amount of air the baby swallows. Fewer stomach cramps from gas makes for a happier baby. They also have the four ounce size that work the same way but has a shorter insert.
B0018JWAF0 Dr browns is the way to go for bottles period. Our child had horrible colic the first 3 mo and feedings on me were miserable for him- we had to switch to bottle feedings and these bottles made all the difference in the world. Yes their pricey but you can't put a price tag on helping your child feel better!
B0018JWAF0 Dr. Brown's bottles really do help with gas but I am not certain if these are original Dr. Brown's or an imitation.  The writing on the bottle differs slightly from my other Dr. Brown's bottles and these don't come with any leaflet unlike my original Dr. Brown's bottles. Packaging didn't look like Dr. Brown's either.  I am using these anyway since it's the same shape as my original Dr. Brown's but even the flow insert is a cheaper look and different shade of blue as my original.
B0018JWAF0 These bottles are my favorite! It is a bummer cleaning all of the pieces; but other than that they are great quality; no issues with spit up and are easy to clean. Worth every penny!
B0018JWAF0 We got these after trying avent, medela, nuk, breastflow and a few others. I thought I found the answer to my son's excessive gas/acid reflux in these bottles as it seemed he reacted right away by burping less during feedings. However, after a week or so- I noticed leaking. A LOT of leaking. This includes the glass bottles and the plastic. I tried taking them apart, reassembling, making sure the nipple was pressed in all the way, unscrewing the lid, tightening the lid, switching parts... Nothing. I pump exclusively and fill these bottles. After all that work pumping, cleaning of those parts then cleaning and setting up of all these dr brown parts- the last bs I want to deal with is leaking! It leaks so much we have to wrap a towel around the bottles while feeding! I'm NOT happy I've spent over $25 on dr brown's bottles for this to happen. I JUST threw away the packaging, of course! I wish I could return them and get my money back. I do however, LOVE the warmer by dr brown. That is an excellent product. By the way, if you're baby has \"COLIC\" look into acid reflux. 1 out of 5 babies have it- and supposedly drs now think colic is actually stomach acid burning the baby's esophagus. Does the baby arch his/her back and get fussy after meals or when you lay them down on their backs? You can DO something about their pain. There is no such thing as \"colic.\"
B0018JWAF0 We love these, and so does our little one.  They seem to work very well in preventing gas and tummy troubles...though some of that could be that our baby has a very chill, happy temprament.  I use them to store breastmilk in the fridge as well, and have had no troubles.  They do leak if overfilled, but the line is marked on the bottle so that can be avoided. The ounce markers can be a bit difficult to see as they are clear and raised only.  They also leak if they tip over, which is sad if its expressed breast milk...but that's life!
B0018JWAF0 My only complaint about these bottles are that the 8 oz comes with the #1 size nipple. They should come with the #2 as the babies using them are older. Also note that if you put more than the maximum amount in the Dr Brown bottles, ei 4 oz or 8 oz, they will likely leak. It says that on the bottle too above the oz measures.
B0018JWAF0 These are probably not necessary for every baby, but for mine they were a lifesaver!  My 5 week old formula fed son was having a terrible time with spit-up and gas.  Actually, I think it would be more accurate to say he was vomiting up ALL of his formula pretty much every time he was fed.  I was using Playtex Drop-ins and following all the advice I could get (using special formula, keeping his head elevated after feeding, feeding fewer ounces more often, burping often...) but the vomiting was getting worse.  The pediatrician assured me that he was in good health, just a \"spit-up baby,\" but after a particularly bad night where he accumulated well over a basket full of laundry I had enough.  The next morning I purchased 10 of the Dr. Brown's bottles (one to try and three sets to use if I liked it).  This bottle made all the difference in the world!  He much prefers the nipple on this bottle so he feeds more quickly and enthusiastically, and amazingly the food actually stays in his belly.  Since we started using these he has only spit up one time, and it was just a small amount.  I have noticed that he rarely has to burp with these bottles...just a small one every now and then but nothing like before.  The best part is that he is so content.  After a night feeding he easily drifts off to sleep, with no stomach pains at all.  Yes, there are a lot of parts to wash and figure out how to use.  But I was willing to do anything to help with my baby's stomach issues!  My advice on these would be to try the \"simpler\" bottles first, but keep these in mind if your baby has gas, spit-up, or colic.I also wanted to add some tips on using these that I learned from trial and error.1.  I prefer the Munchkin Deluxe dishwasher basket to the Dr. Brown's one.  It takes up much less space because you only put the parts in it, not the bottle itself.  I put the vent reservoirs in the straw holders, the vent inserts and nipples in the top section, and the collars, caps, and discs in the bottom section. Then we just make sure to put the basket on the top rack. I have 10 bottles so I got two of these baskets to hold parts for 8 bottles at a time (4 bottles per basket). You could probably fit more but I like to give everything enough space to get clean!  We have a two story house so I bring one basket and cleaning brush upstairs each night. That way I can rinse the parts right after they are used and put them right in the basket. I fill up the second basket the next day and then run the dishwasher that afternoon/evening.2.  I think it would be a good idea to hand wash all the parts with the brush every few days or so, even if you use the dishwasher.3.  I see no need for most of the \"accessories\" you can buy to go with these bottles.  The exception is the formula mixing pitcher!  It makes it much easier to make bottles ahead of time without shaking them and introducing more air.4.  These will fit in most bottle warmers.  Just make sure you remove the disc first (oops...).  Mine is The First Years BabyPro Nursery Warmer.  I do have to take the nipple and cap off to make them fit in the cooler section, though.  This is not really a big deal because I have the discs to seal the top.5.  If you assemble everything as the directions say and screw the collar on tight, these should not leak.  So far I haven't had one leak yet.
B0018JWAF0 Don't buy this product!I have twins and have intimate experience with this product and would not recommend it to anyone.Overview:They don't decrease the need to burp due to less air intake during feeding.10 parts to clean per bottle and you have to hand wash all parts (dishwashing will not get parts clean)!!!!!!!Cloudy bottles with raised not colored markers: meaning you can't read the measuring markers even in good light.Here is the deal... the primary advantage of this brand/bottle are they are supposed to cut down on air intake and thus decrease the need to burp... really? With my experience they have failed.One bottle/feeding, whether it be a feeding when the babies weighed 5 LB's or now that they weigh 20 LB's still requires that we stop and burp them often (three times or more a bottle), which they eagerly and loudly burp (like Barney on the Simpson's \"bbbbbbuuurrrrp!\") or else the gas gets caught and they throw up formula when they do finally expel the gas. Seems the same as any other bottle and those other brands don't have the other draw backs these have...Cleaning is a pain in the butt!!!!!!!!NEVER dish wash these things. DON'T buy those stupid little plastic cages that carry all the parts as all these pieces won't get cleaned properly. There is no being lazy with this system, you HAVE TO HAND WASH every piece. Okay, there are 7 pieces to the system (this includes the cap and travel disc), two of the everyday 7 pieces require you clean them with a pipe cleaner (3 parts to clean with a pipe cleaner and a  dish washer is NOT going to get those holes clean). So you add the 7 pieces and the time it takes to clean the 3 holes with a pipe cleaner and I have a count of 10 PIECES TO WASH PER BOTTLE EVERYDAY!!! That is freaking INSANE! So lets do the math... 10 pieces to clean per bottle x's 20 bottles, cleaned once or more a day... you do the math. Yup, you did the math right, that is 200 pieces to clean per bottle per day! Stupid isn't it? All this for a product that is terribly ineffective.Lastly the annoyance factor, and this was HUGE for me!Time for a brief history to validate that I know what I am talking about: I am a  father of twins that were born premature. Which means we had to continually monitor food intake to ensure the twins ate the appropriate amount of calories. So every feeding, which was every three hours, 24 hours a day for the first four months, had to have a specific amount of fluid in each bottle, then we had to record how much they ate so we could track daily calorie intake. Ya, LOL, THAT is a lot of feeding and a LOT of experience with these bottles.Before I get into this next segment a quick note: on this listing, at the top left hand side are the option to view four photos of he product, the only photo that clearly and truly represents the cloudy nature of this product is the fourth image by \"Mike\" of a girl drinking from a bottle. Look at the product that the girl is using and you will note how truly cloudy the bottles are. Okay, onto my last issue with the bottle....As the twins got older and eating more we migrated from the few glass bottles we had to 8 oz BPA free plastic bottles (since we needed 21 of these bottles we went with plastic instead of glass as we figures the technology was the mechanism and not the container). So now we are using the cloudy PBA free plastic, we still need to monitor the twins intake and record the amount of fluid/food they consume to monitor calories but here is the deal... with these cloudy BPA free plastic bottles it is all but impossible to read the measuring markers. Whether I am trying to read the markers in the well lit kitchen or in the twins room via a night light, I'll say it again, it is all but IMPOSSIBLE TO READ THE MEASURE MARKERS on these bottles.Imagine, there you are feeding your baby at 3 AM, you are exhausted, your baby has been eating for 15 minutes so you look at the bottle to see if he had eaten the minimum amount as the baby is getting tired but you can't read the markers. So you twist to position yourself near the nightlight so you can view the marker, you still can't make out the marker readings. Now the baby is getting restless and waking up so you settle down, and use your thumb to try and count the raised markers via brail... you are not sure but you think the baby should eat one more once before putting them down again. Okay, repeat this over and over andover  again. if you can envision what I am talking about please trust me and know that you will want to throw these ill conceived pieces of crap in the trash immediately!!  Not just once but and time and time again... but you don't as you have a good investment in these things! So you think twice. Then you think to warn others....I even wrote to the maker/manufacturer and complained about the fact they have a design flaw in that the often-used-and-critical-measuring-markers are near impossible to read in any light (since the level indicators are raised, like brail, I literally have to feel for the level indictors then count by touch to know the level remaining in the bottle). A flaw that is an insult to me, a user AND a customer, and that they need to correct. Their pathetic and insulting reply? They could not make the ink stick to the bottles so they went with the raised no colored solution. This is all because of the fact the bottles are PBA free (before they switched to PBA free the bottles had colored markers and clear bottles which were SUPER easy to read).  I cry BS to their reply!!!!!  Their pretty little logo with all the fine lines and intricate detail sure has not lost a single pixel of paint/color/detail from our daily washing, therefore any color they could have added to the measure markers would have stayed true too. I just hate lazy, lying corporate structures that won't do right by their customer.So in closing:They don't decrease the need to burp due to less air intake during feeding.10 parts to clean per bottle and you have to hand wash all parts (dishwashing will not get parts clean).Can't read the measuring markers even in good light (I have 20-20 vision)Lying lazy corporation.There, I think that covers it. :-)  Look for another solution. Despite what others may say, you have been warned.
B0018JWAF0 We have used these bottles with our first child after trying for months to get her to take the Playtex drop-ins without leaking half of it down her face.  Switched to these and she did great and did not have tummy trouble.  Now baby # 2 has been a trial to get to take a bottle.  He refused for quite awhile and we tried SEVERAL different bottles.  Again I was really hoping for the ease of Playtex and again I am back to the Dr. Browns.  He does a great job with them and does not get gassy.I wish they were \"cuter\" and not so tall.  They are a pain to wash and I am not too sure about putting them in the dishwasher.  So, aethetics and ease of washing are all that bring my rating down from 5 stars.  Not sure about some people's counting abilities:  if you use the cap (which I don't need that often) there are 6 parts to wash: bottle, nipple, collar, cap, resvour, and the tan piece - can't remember what that is called.) They are very utilitarian but they have been great with both of my children.  I have a collection of several other brands because I really didn't want to mess with these but these again are the winner.Hello dish-pan hands - here I come.
B0018JWAF0 The bottles arrived quickly and in good condition.  We like that they are bpa free and have the special air removal system.  Although people talk about how many parts there are, they seem simpler than the bottles we tried with vents in the bottom and are supposed to do a much better job at keeping air out of the milk.We just wish the polypropylene, bpa-free version came in the wide-mouth as well as the standard size bottle.
B0018JWAF0 Our son (6 weeks) has been exclusively formula fed since he was about 2 weeks when we accepted that breast feeding just wasn't going to happen like we'd hoped. So, since then, we've been searching for the perfect bottle. So far, Avent is our favorite (we've also tried Born Free, Tommee Tippee, and Similac), but we're still dealing with a LOT of swallowed air (which means upset tummy and LOTS of painful gas) and formula squirting out the sides of his mouth throughout his feedings.We have a couple friends who swear by the Dr. Brown bottles, so I thought I'd give them a try. I was a bit underwhelmed by them. The idea behind the system is genius, and I don't doubt that it works for a lot of babies out there, but so far we haven't noticed any difference - in fact, I think he's been spitting up more and he continues to have very painful gas. I don't like that the bottles are tall and skinny (makes feeding awkward - I like to cuddle him close during feedings) and the bottle doesn't fit well in the bottle holder on the side of our diaper bag. The measurements aren't painted onto the bottle, just raised in the plastic, and they're VERY hard to read (especially during those night-time feedings when I don't want to turn on all the lights and wake him up even more). I'm not a fan of the skinny nipple, and neither is my son. He seems to have to swallow it to get a good latch - I'm curious to try the wide neck variety to see if they're easier for him to latch onto. And lastly, I'm not crazy about the extra parts to clean. It's not necessarily a deal breaker, but when I'm less than impressed with so much about the bottle already, it's just one more thing to make these bottles not worth it.
B0018JWAF0 The wife and I tried multiple bottle brands and this is the only one that virtually eliminated spit-up episodes with our daughter.  If we have any additional children, these will be the bottles that we use..............highly recommended!
B0018JWAF0 While my son wasn't really \"colicky\", he definitely had terrble reflux and gas. I switched him to these bottles when he was 3 weeks old, and his spitting up is definitely less! What I most love about these bottles is that the nipple doesn't collapse because of the straw system! Love that its BPA free also. The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because its a HUGE pain to clean all the parts of the bottle 8 times a day, especially the straw part.
B0018JWAF0 we bought these a while ago now and are still using them. they help ease gas with the aid of these strange mechanisms within the bottle. cleaning is not too difficult, just takes a little more time but worth it. the nipples offer excellent flow.
B0018JWAF0 For 7 weeks I had an EXTREMELY gassy/colicky baby.  I opted to purchase glass bottles in the beginning and not use the plastic drop-ins because I was concerned about BPA.  Being a new/inexperienced mother I did not realize just how much of a difference the right bottle could make in preventing air in the tummy.  I actually thought that the formula was the problem... and my pediatrician never mentioned anything about these bottles (she only mentioned the plastic BPA drop ins which made me kind of mad!).  My mother did research on colic and found reviews on these Dr. Browns Natural Flow bottles and thought it was worth a try.  I ran out to purchase them (needed them right away, could not wait for Amazon) and used them on the next feeding.  It worked!  I noticed immediate results... my daughter wasn't arching her back, wriggling all over the place, crying or being fussy after her feeding, etc.  She also didn't need to be burped as often.I gave this product 4 stars because the bottles are not leak proof and there are a few extra parts to clean which can be a pain when washing by hand.  Still, these bottles have been a life saver and I would recommend them to any new parent as the FIRST CHOICE when their newborn arrives!
B0018JWAF0 The only bottles my baby used. I tried like 6 different brands before I got these bottles and my baby loves them.
B0018JWAF0 My daughter had severe acid reflux and would vomit everything up after she ate.  Our doc put her on meds and said these bottle would help.  Oh was she right!!!  My daughter still spit up (rarely), but it was nothing like what she used to do.  I'm pregnant with our second and will use these from the start this time.  As for the extra parts, buy a diswasher basket and put them in there and they all get clean at the same time!  I did buy a drying rack because all the pieces don't come out dry, but I will never use another type of bottle again!
B0018JWAF0 Dr. Brown's bottles are my first choice.  After 7 children, and hundreds of bottle failures, I decided to review these to share my experience.#1 Do these bottles cure colic?  No.  Colic/Reflux is a mechanical issue located in the baby's esophagus and upper stomach.  However, the Dr Brown's bottle provides a steady flow with zero nipple collapse, and yes I believe the baby's sucking force and ear pressure build-up is reduced.#2 Yes, these are a pain to clean, especially after 11 months of cleaning them for twins, but I would rather use these that worry with collapsing nipples.#3  I do not like the nipples that come with these bottles.  With the exception of the Preemie flow.  The preemie flow is awesome for breastmilk!  The nipples are long and narrow and tended to choke my babies so I use the PLAYTEX VENT AIRE nipples with the Dr Brown's bottles.  I'll review the vent aire nipples in another review, but those nipples are hands down the best.#4 You can put cereal in these bottles with no problems.  I used cereal for my reflux babies.  If you use the FAST FLOW playtex vent aire nipple or the size 3 or 4 Dr Brown's nipple you do not have to cut a hole in the nipple.  The y cut nipple from Dr Browns is very fast unless you use more cereal.  I use 1 (formula) scoop or cereal per 4 ounces, and the flow is perfect.#5  You can mix 8 oz of water, 4 scoops of formula, and 2-3 scoops of cereal in the 8 oz Dr Brown's bottle with no problem!  This is great if you use powder and make bottles as you need them.  Other bottles don't have enough space to mix this way.#6 These bottles are straight and easy to prop, if you think you'll never prop a bottle when you have twins you're very wrong, there's never enough hands!Mom of 7, and RN
B0018JWAF0 These are the only bottles (besides the enfmail standard nipples that go on the ready to feed travel pack bottles) that my preemie will use. We tried so many different kinds of bottles, and he gagged and dropped his oxygen sats on most of them, except for these.  Order extra caps, they tend to get lost.  These bottles have held up well so far.
B0018JWAF0 I stupidly went out and bought a bunch of these bottles before our baby was born, after a few people recommended them...should have just bought a 2-pack and tried it out before making such an investment. I thought the large amount of parts due to the vent system would be annoying, but that actually turned out not to be much of an issue, since the bottles come apart really easily. The main problem with these bottles is that they LEAK CONSTANTLY, no matter what you do. Literally, I would fill a bottle (not past the max fill line), start to feed my baby, see it leaking like crazy from under the bottle rim...and after wiping up my son, I'd go to pick up the bottle again and literally see streams of milk continuing to leak out from under the rim while the thing was standing up vertically. Tried tightening the bottle rim, and when that failed, tried loosening it - nothing worked. At least I can say with certainty that it was not a defective issue with one pack of bottles, since we had at least 15 of them and they ALL did it. In addition, the plastic is soft and they'd leak even more if you squeezed the bottle at all by accident...and they're too tall to fit in many sterilizers. Just plain annoying from every angle. We finally chucked them and switched to Born Free bottles, which are 100% awesome. I seriously don't understand all the hype about Dr. Brown's bottles - I don't think their \"special vent system\" is any better than any other bottle's, and I actually think the vent system is what causes the leaking. Don't waste your money!
B0018JWAF0 My baby likes these bottles.  My main complaint is that he still manages to gulp lots of air while eating, so he still gets uncomfortable from burps.  There are also a lots of parts to wash, but I'm used to that now.  On the positive side, the parts can be purchased separately, which was great to replace some worn pieces on our older bottles.
B0018JWAF0 I first tried tommee tippee because it was suppose to be the most similar to breastfeeding. However he had difficulties because of the flow of the nipple. The slow flow nipples were too fast. He fought the bottle because of it and I needed to find a solution since I was going back to work. He usually nurses for 40 mins and he was finishing the bottle in 10 mins. He never seemed satisfied after the bottle either. So I tried Dr Brown with the preemie flow nipples (the slowest flow nipple I can find). That has worked for us. He can now handle the flow and the bottle now takes 25 to 30 mins, more similar to nursing. I highly recommend these if you are breastfeeding and need to bottle feed while at work! Yes more parts to clean with the Dr Brown but worth it! He also had less gas with these!
B0018JWAF0 They seem to help limit the air our baby gets while eating. There are numerous parts but with the Dr. Brown dishwasher baskets, washing is easy!
B0018JWAF0 I have 9 of these bottles that I use with breast milk for my son while at daycare. The bottles are excellent and not difficult to use. My comments:1) Yes, the markings are not colored (just raised plastic) so it takes an extra second to measure how much liquid is in the bottle. However, correctly reading those markers requires that you're eye level with the bottle anyway, so this isn't an issue to me. If you're preparing a bottle in the dark having bold markings isn't going to help anyway.2) There are a lot of parts to clean, but it's not a big deal. I toss everything into the dishwasher (and use Cascade dishwasher pouches and white vinegar or Jet Dry in the rinse compartment; the detergent and rinses were approved by my pediatrician). I dry everything on a Munchkin drying rack. Some bottles take a little longer than overnight to dry, but it's not a big deal.3) Yes, the bottles will leak if you turn them over without the circular insert in place. I don't use the insert because I don't want anyone opening the bottle and getting any dirt into the milk. I just put the bottles upright into a Playtex bottle cooler with some ice packs and I haven't had any leaking problems going to or from daycare. I don't think I would take these to Disneyland or on an adventure where they might sit upside down for a while. However, these are perfect for daily use.4) This is by far the most used and liked type of bottle in daycare. I think 10 of the 12 infants there are using these bottles. I use the self-laminating stickers on Amazon to put my son's name on the bottles and a washable food label for the date.I do love these bottles and I'm very happy with them. I won't be bothering with another type of bottle unless I plan on traveling with a full bottle.
B0018JWAF0 For a baby with acid reflux like mine, I found that these won't eliminate the spit up problem but they will help reduce babies discomfort and crankiness that accompany acid reflux. Also prevented my baby from chugging her food down the way she was with other bottles I tried. The argument that it is too cumbersome to wash these is ridiculous. . I hate doing dishes, but I throw these in the dishwasher most of the time so it's not a big deal at all. If I do wash by hand. it's 30 seconds more than most other bottles, which is no reason to shy away from them.My only complaint, I went out and bought about 24 bottles total only to discover new PINK bottles at BRU the other day. I was so mad!!! They have cute blue ones now too. Why did I have to stock pile before they came out with the new fun colors???  Still a great bottle though.
B0018JWAF0 Great bottles, my newborn and now 4 month old had no trouble taking the nipple. I use these bottles for my diaper bag bottles because they are tall and thin.. easier to carry around. I do think the plastic is a little cheap but it does the job. My daughter is trying to hold her bottle now and has difficulty with these bottles because they are so long and heavy. She cannot hold it like the others.
B0018JWAF0 love these. the only downside is that there are multiple pieces (I even had to draw a diagram for a babysitter one time ;) But... they work, they don't leak, and they are bpa free. will use these again for any subsequent babies we have!
B0018JWAF0 I can't say that these help with burping/spitting up because these are the only bottles I have ever used with my 2 month old and he still spits up and burps some. I cannot compare them to other bottles, so I cannot say if they are better or worse.
B0018JWAF0 We have both the Dr. Browns and Avent bottles.  We started our baby on Avents when he was born but switched to Dr. Browns as he has some gas issues.  I'm not so sure that the Dr. Browns bottles made any difference, or if there is it might just be psychological.  I'd recommend starting with the Avents or another brand if you can and if your baby does fine with those use them.  If they get gassy try these.  Because even though I don't love the Dr. Browns, all their cons are worth it if they help your baby not be gassy.  But from a use perspective.Pros:1. I'm assuming they reduce gas but have no proof.2. They have been fairly durable, as long as we follow instructions (see cons) they do not leak and we have not had them break or become moldy. On a note, we put our used bottles in a tub of warm soap water within a few hours of ever use and this may not be convenient for everyone.Cons:1. Since the measurements indicators are clear you can't see them in the dark, we ended up marking the spots we needed with a sharpie.  I find it hard to believe they couldn't have colored these as the logo seems to be holding up to repeated rinsing just fine.2. There are way too many parts (and they're oddly shaped) to clean.  With Avents, there are five parts (including the cap).  With Dr. Browns there are seven (including cap and that annoying stopper circle).  I was able to fit all the parts of six Avent bottles on our munchkin sprouts drying rack (which I highly recommend).  With the Dr. Browns it's like playing tetris (not the fun part) with all the parts. You also need a special brush to clean certain parts, which they provide but doesn't last long so you have to buy they're replacement ones.3. They'll leak.  When you transport them the only way to keep them from leaking is to insert a circular piece of plastic between the vent portion and the nipple.  It also means when its time to feed you have to open the bottle to remove it.  This has led to several times when I have either forgotten to put it in leading to a leaks, or forgotten to take it out, which has led to baby sucking on air until I realized what was happening. Again, it's in the instructions, but in the real world, it's easy to forget.  Again the Avents don't need that, just put the cap on and you're good to go.4. Narrow bottles.  Ok so this is clearly a preference thing, but the narrow necks make it harder to clean them.  We use an oxo bottle brush (also highly recommend).  The brush fits you just have to be careful putting it in and pulling it out or you're going to get yourself wet.  Also being narrow tends to make the 8oz size taller than most bottle cooler bags I've seen which makes storing them on the go difficult.Also, formula and breast milk stink.  It's sticky and messy and a pain if it gets all over you or anything.  So imagine all the above with that in mind.
B0018JWAF0 I used Dr. Brown's for my first child. No problems with colic or refulx, so why try anything different with my next one? I fully endorse using Dr. Brown's it works for me and my children. This was so much cheaper to go through Amazon than Target or Walmart. And my child is now 3 months old and everything is still going fine with using these bottles. You do have to wash more parts, but once you do it you get used to it. As long as my kid doesn't get colic, I'll pay anything :)
B0018JWAF0 I read a review of the glass Dr. Brown bottles that complained that the painted-on ounces markings wore off in the dishwasher, so I got two glass bottles and two of these BPA-free PP ones just to see. The big drawback is that the plastic ones hold in smells. I made the mistake of washing them once with Mrs. Meyer's dish soap, and they are basically ruined because they are now permanently honeysuckle scented, which is gross. Even just running them through the dishwasher with scent-free Method dishwasher tabs caused them to retain the scent of hot, washed food. It's really not something I would ever want to make my baby smell while drinking. Get the glass--you can hand wash them (it takes TWO minutes) if you're worried about losing the paint (which hasn't happened to me after 7 months) and they rinse clean, every time.
B0018JWAF0 We bought these bottles for our gassy baby. The design is amazing. It really helped reduced the amount of air she would take it while drinking. But now we've got a major problem. The bottles have been used for 3 months and now they are starting to leak REALLY bad. I guess the plastic has stretched a bit from being reheated or maybe the grooves have worn down a little bit? I have no idea why but every single one of the bottles leak now and it's not just a little drip here and there, it's a stream of formula that leaks from under the cap. After my daughter finishes drinking her bib is soaked. When we shake up up the formula it sprays everywhere. Not to mention the huge amount of formula that is leaking from the bottle is a huge waste of formula. I've contacted Dr. Browns to see if they have a fix for this problem because I don't want to have to buy all new bottles. Bottles are expensive and I'd hate to have to buy new ones when these are ONLY 3 months old!
B0018JWAF0 i bought these because my son was throwing up half his formula, it did help a little i have to say i do like them allot just a pain to clean he still spits up every time he burps. and still has gas but baby farts are cute lol
B0018JWAF0 These are the only bottles I will use for our newborn, I really think they cut down on the amount of gas/ burping my little one has after chugging a bottle. These are really well made bottles too.
B0018JWAF0 These are my favorite bottles for my little guy.  They hold enough liquid and they are easy to handle for both of us.  The only draw back is they do have a lot of pieces with six parts as compared to most bottles four.  We do notice less burping when using these as compared to others.We have noticed that with repeated washing these bottles don't hold ink very well so we have to put the names back on the bottles about once a week for the daycare.  Haven't had any issues with the pre-printed labels on the bottles though.Four stars just because of the extra parts to wash!
B0018JWAF0 I am grateful that my daughter did well with these bottles since she has acid reflux and the only reason I continued to use these bottles were for that reason. The amount of pieces that you have to clean is kind of annoying. I felt like I had to take extra time to clean the smaller pieces to make sure they were clean. Which we know with babies we don't have a lot of extra time.
B0018JWAF0 My baby hasn't been all too fussy, so if he will take a bottle with less parts to clean, I'm going for that one and so should you. You deserve the sleep and less dishes to wash, don't you think??Anyway, I was given great advice before baby was born, and that was to buy 3 different brand bottles before buying a bunch of one kind. You really won't know what baby will want until baby is here! We ended up settling for the Tommee Tippee bottles since there were only 3 parts. Hooray for Tommee Tippee!
B0018JWAF0 When my baby was born I was using first years bottles but my baby was very fussy and upset when he was feeding and wasn't putting on weight. My mum and I figured out it was the bottles. He didn't like the nipples on them. So we went out and bought one of each type of bottle we could find and Dr Brown's bottles were the one that he was most content to use. The bonus is they have helped keep him from getting gassy.I highly recommend these bottles. All the mum's I talk to use them and think they're great.
B0018JWAF0 We used Dr. Brown's for both our girls becuase they both had bad reflux.  We tried all bottles and these work the best.  The nipples have the best flow too - others are too big.  The pieces are a pain but that's true about all bottles these days.
B0018JWAF0 After spending hundreds of dollars on bottles this is the only one she would use.  As long as you use all the parts in the right way it does not leak and I just wish I would of bought this at the beginning.
B0018JWAF0 I have tried the Playtex insert bottles, and they suck. Dr. Brown's are the only ones who actually do what they say - preventing extra gas and fussiness. They're the only bottles I will ever buy.
B0018JWAF0 These are my all time favorite bottles! They do take a little more time to clean, but they are well worth it! They help with air and are very helpful when it comes to colic. I haven't had any problems with my baby since I started her on these bottles. I would recommend these bottles if you're having a problem with fussiness I would give these a try!
B0018JWAF0 Last bottle we tried out of five to help my 3 month old daughter with her gas.  Its a great bottle and I don't mind all the parts to it.  After each use I disassemble the bottle and soak it in warm soapy water and then wash it all at night.Pros: 1) Clearly no bubbles that go into the formula.2 ) The bottle is also made of very good and heavy plastic and not as heavy as the glass.3) Great nipples (super soft) and no dribbles on the side of her mouth (virtually dry bib after feeding)4) Nipple fits my gerber/even flow bottles so when she passes her gassy phase I can use my gerber tops with this bottle. (Less to clean I suppose)5) Dr. Brown travel lid will fit all small neck bottles as well.Cons:1)  Ironically, its hard to fit the Dr. Brown brush into it because of its a smaller neck bottle.2) Formula is hard to get into it, especially in the early morning hrs.3) hard to find a dry rack for all the little parts (i used dishwasher baskets on a regular dish drying tray)For us it didn't stop the gas but I don't think that is the bottle's fault. So many factors go into a baby having gas (her premature stomach, diet/formula, bottles, etc.) I just really like this bottle after all that we tried. To be honest, I don't think a bottle alone is the miracle cure for gas, but as a parent I am sure you'd try anything if you thought it would help your little one feel better.
B0018JWAF0 I purchased both the plastic and glass 4 oz bottles.  They were fine during the first couple of weeks and then the leaks started.  First, the plastic bottles leaked so I called Dr. Brown's customer service and they gave me directions to prevent leakage which I followed but the LEAKS continued.  The glass bottles seemed okay but then they too started leaking!!!!!  I really regret buying these bottles.  Hopefully, the Avent bottles will work better.
B0018JWAF0 We loved these bottles. We heard other people complain that they're a production to assemble, but they're really not. There's 2 extra pieces that a regular bottle doesn't have, but it takes just seconds to assemble these. Our son had noticeably less gas when using these bottles. In fact, I rarely get him to burp at all with these bottles, because he simply doesn't take in much air.I would recommend getting an organizer for your dishwasher to hold all the pieces. We got some at Target that worked perfectly.
B0018JWAF0 These bottles are great; we can see the air bubbles move away from the nipple which makes for less fussy baby. You have to make sure you clean each part of the bottle well. It takes a little bit of time, but it's worth it since the baby spits up less. The cleaning brushes that the set comes with don't last very long, but I picked up OXO Tot Straw and Sippy Cup Top Cleaning Set at TJ Maxx which works extremely well. If you forget the vacuum reservoir inserts and try to feed the baby without it, it will leak. So make sure you pack it! The beige color inserts will wear out after a few months, but they're easily replaceable.We've tried the Avent bottles and Tommee Tippee Closer to Nature bottles, in addition to Dr. Brown's. Both of the nipples of Avent and Tommee Tippee tend to collapse when the baby is feeding; Dr. Brown's doesn't do that.
B0018JWAF0 We love these bottles. The extra pieces to wash aren't really a pain, we either just soak them in hot suds then rinse or put them in the munchkin dishwasher basket and run them in there.
B0018JWAF0 My daughter got the hiccups and was really gassy using regular bottles, when I switched to these ones, she hardly ever gets the hiccups and is a much happier baby!! Love these bottles and would definitely recommend them!
B0018JWAF0 Great bottles! Ignore the reviews that comment on the numbering on the bottles. These bottles have raised numbers which DO NOT wash off. They work very well. Our daughter has colic and reflux, therefore these are the only bottles we'll use!
B0018JWAF0 Gave up all our other brands after trying these.  Great bottle - reduced my son's burping considerably.  It is not a big deal to clean the parts every time.  Really not.  I'd say just get the 8oz.  They outgrow the smaller ones pretty quickly.  Great bottle.
B0018JWAF0 The polypropylene bottles better preserve the good aspects of breast milk. But these bottles leak sometimes (even when not filled above the line indicated) and they have extra parts to wash. My baby seems to move back & forth fairly easily from this nipple to the breast. I don't know if I will buy any more though as I don't notice that he prefers it over the Breastflow, don't notice he has less gas than with Breastflow, and that one doesn't leak.
B0018JWAF0 We wash our bottles in the dishwasher and use the Dr. Brown's baskets so I'm not really too concerned about the number of parts of the bottle. My main concern is the constant black mold that grows on the rubber inserts. Once it starts you have to throw them away and buy new inserts. Washing the inserts with water helps, and soaking with vinegar may also be a help.The only other thing I should mention about the bottles is they will leak if turned on their side...we learned this the hard way in the car. Now when we travel we only use the travel caps and then assemble the bottle when we are ready to feed. Its more work to carry it all separate but it saves a mess.
B0018JWAF0 We started out with Ameda bottles (came with the breast pump), then tried Avent and then Dr. Brown's.  Daughter is now 4-months old and we're still using them.  Be forewarned that these have more parts than a traditional bottle, but just get yourself a good skinny/long brush and you'll be fine.
B0018JWAF0 My son loves these bottles. I started with Playtex drop-ins, but with the slowest flow nipple he would gag. He has had no problems switching back and forth between these bottles and breastfeeding.
B0018JWAF0 My 10-month-old son has had reflux since birth. We switched to these bottles from Avent at about six weeks, and along with a formula change we kept the reflux under control without medication until just recently.  These bottles are a bit tedious to clean by hand, but we started throwing them into the dishwasher and it works like a charm.  We have both the glass and these polypro bottles and both are good.  Daycare prefers the plastic because my son can hold them easier by himself and they can take them outside to play without worrying about breaking them on the cement.  The plastic do seem to have a very slightly bigger opening, which makes it just a tad bit easier to insert a formula scoop without powder going everywhere.  (That was one thing that Avent had going for it, the wide opening.)  The only time I have EVER had any one of my Dr. Brown's bottles leak is when we don't have them assembled properly or the collar was not screwed on tight enough.Before I bought these I read several reviews that mentioned mold on the brown plastic parts.  9 months of dishwasher abuse and still no mold to speak of, only slight discoloration.  The nipples still look like new as well.I have b
B0018JWAF0 I like these skinny bottles far better than the fat Dr. Brown ones.  The fat ones have different nipples (a smaller portion of the nipple fit into the mouth) and my baby didn't like that.
B0018JWAF0 When my daughter was born I used bottles that went with my breast pump and she swallowed so much air you could just hear it being swallowed--so I bought new bottles--Avent.  I think I bought every kind of Avent they sell.  The same gas problems, spitting up, and crying I got to feel bad about. thought maybe it was the nipple, maybe it was the way I was holding her, maybe I waited for her to get too hungry, etc.  I even found myself having to pull the bottle out of her mouth every 10 seconds to let the nipple open back up because she sucked it shut.Finally and luckily, I bought these bottles at Target and I could see a different immediately!  Sometimes she doesn't even burp after eating an ounce or two and she is definitely not sucking in air.  The bottle has a blue straw in it that actually prevents air from entering.  Even if you hold the bottle at a weird angle it won't do it!  The bottles are cheaper on Amazon so I'm buying 3 more so I don't have to keep washing bottles multiple times a day.  : )
B0018JWAF0 I love the Dr Brown brand. The bottles are awesome. My only problem with them is that they leak sometimes. But other than that, it did as it said it was. My daughter did not have a lot of gas and she loves drinking from them. And replacing the nipples for stages is not expensive either! You get 3 bottles and you can get 3 nipples for 2.99-4.99 depending on the vendor. I love it.
B0018JWAF0 I love these SO MUCH I've bought three packs.  They are the only bottles we use since my daughter has some major gas issues. :/  They have definitely made a world of difference, especially used along with the mixing pitcher.
B0018JWAF0 We used Dr. Brown's because everyone else was using them. My advice for anyone who's buying baby bottles is to stick to one type or brand. The caps and nipples would very easily get confused in the wash. We had issues with the paint chipping off on these after about 2 months (I boil the bottles after each use) and the plastic was getting a bit yellowish. I emailed Handi-Craft (they own Dr. Brown's) and they actually told me that it's okay because the paint is not toxic (still I am a bit worried... it gets on the nipples and the blue tube) But the nice thing is that they actually send me some replacement bottles! Now that my baby is a bit older, I stop boiling the baby bottles and just wash them in hot water and soap. I recently switched over to the glass bottles. I like those much better but glass can get very hot when you boil them! The only thing I really don't like about these bottles are the fact it's so much harder to wash them! You really have to clean the tubes with that little brush... Overall, this is a great bottle and very well made. They now sell them in Pink and Blue...
B0018JWAF0 Our baby had colic.  We switched to Dr. Brown's and presto, no more colic.  Great product.  Thank you Dr. Brown's.
B0018JWAF0 These are hands down the best bottles we've ever owned. They're great for a number of reasons:1) The design prevents the baby from taking in extra air, cutting down on gas and burping, which in turn cut down on spit-ups.2) Completely BPA free3) Well made, high quality plastic. They're firm but not inflexible, shatter proof, and easy to hold.4) Great heat transfer for heating up cold bottles (we heat them using hot water and a glass that is a bit wider in circumference than the bottle. Just pour in about half a glass of hot water, put in the bottle, let it sit for a minute or two and you're ready to go. No mess, and if you want the bottle a bit warmer, just repeat with a bit more hot water).5) Exchangeable nipples--you can keep the bottle but swap out the nipple as your baby growsA few thoughts:Those complaining that they are made from too many parts are missing the point: the bottles have the additional parts to cut down on unwanted air intake as your baby drinks their milk. That means that your baby has fewer spit ups. I'll happily wash a few more bottle parts to save having to wash the baby, the floor, or myself (wherever his spit-ups land). It's a time saver in the long run. Bottles are easily washed. Babies and clothing not so much.To those who have experienced leaks: It's likely that either you have not installed the rubber stopper correctly, or that you have a defective stopper. In the first instance, check to make sure your stopper is lined up and inserted according to the instructions. If you're still having leaks, send the bottle(s) back and get replacements. Amazon will happily send you a new one, and if it's outside their window, contact Dr. Brown directly.Conclusions:These are a must buy if you want high quality plastic bottles. We've been more than happy with them.
B0018JWAF0 These bottles were recommended by our Daughter's speech therapist and dietitian to help eliminate some gas and reflux.  They work pretty good for that purpose but they are a pain to clean (they are 6 parts each) and do NOT tip them over!  They leak like crazy.  If we take them anywhere with we have to be constantly making sure the bottle bag is upright at all times or else we have a wet, sticky mess.If they didn't leak I would give them 4 stars (still a pain to clean).
B0018JWAF0 Love these bottles. They don't leak, and I love the different nipples you can buy for them depending on the baby's age. Also I love that they now offer these bottles in pink, purple, and blue ;)
B0018JWAF0 These helped to lessen colic when my baby was 2-3 months. Now, that he's older, I've noticed that they also decrease spit-up.
B0018JWAF0 My daughter and I did extensive research  on what type bottle to use for her new baby - especially as she was nursing and needed to get baby on bottle (pumped breastmilk) before heading back to work.  These bottles have worked perfectly.  She tried the bottles and nipples that came with her Medela Breast Pump but they allowed baby to drink too fast and she had some choking issues.  We did more research and then decided to try the Dr. Brown's 4 oz. bottles first (as she was not eating too much at the time).  The nipples that came with that system were Level 1 and she also seemed to eat too fast, even though less choking.  We read a review here at Amazon.com mentioning the Preemie nipples, so we bought and began using those.  Worked perfectly.  Baby had to eat slower, more sucking needed, seemed more like breastfeeding.We have now upgraded to the 8 oz. bottles as &#34;our&#34; 4 monther + 15 pounder, is doing fantastic and needs more at her feedings than the 4 ounce bottles allow (don't have to refill during feeding).  BTW I babysit her every day while daughter at work so I have first hand experience with these bottles.We do burp her after 4 ounces and try to get a 10 minute break between the first and 2nd 4 ounces (total 8 ounce per feeding) and this works well - most of the time!  Have kept the preemie nipple as she still breastfeeds when mamma not at work.No gas, no colic, no choking.Hope this helps and they work out for your baby too.
B0018JWAF0 These bottles are great. Take a little time to clean. But we've been using them daily for 5 months and they have held up great and baby has had minimal gas/discomfort. Little brush that is enclosed is essential for cleaning smaller parts of these bottles.
B0018JWAF0 These bottles definitely help to reduce colic. The thing I love the most about them is the fact they are BPA free.  It is nice to know you aren't putting unnecessary chemicals in your baby's body.These bottles are great because my son had such bad colic he was screaming when he would eat. The vent system in these bottles virtual eliminates any air from getting to your baby's tummy. The only downfall to these bottles is they are a little more labor intensive to wash and put together. You have one or two more pieces to put together over regular bottles. However, if your baby has any amount of colic it is definitely worth the extra few minutes of assembly for their tummy's sake.One thing to note is at one point they began making these bottles with the ounce markers marked as raised, clear numbers. This made is EXTREMELY difficult to see how full you were filling up the bottle. However, I have since bought some and the markers on them are blue, making it much easier to read the ounces you are making. It is not that big of a deal unless you're doing a 2:30 am feeding and trying to fill the bottle up without being able to see the markings.Overall, these are the best bottles on the market. They truly do help eliminate colic and keep your baby safe and out of harmful chemicals way like BPA.
B0018JWAF0 I love these bottles which is why I'm not giving them a horrendous review. But, this style for whatever reason leaks! I bought the wide-neck ones first and definitely noticed a difference in gas with my little man. So, when I saw they had thinner ones I bought 2 packs. This style's vent system doesn't click in to the bottle like the wide-neck, therefor causing leakage whenever tilted or on it's side. I can't tell you how many times I have found a soaking wet diaper bag and no water to make a bottle for my little guy. I emailed them and am awaiting a response. GO WIDE-NECK, until they fix the problem.
B0018JWAF0 this also was recommended at the hospital while she was at NICU (4oz bottle though). we liked this brand very much, needless to say my daughter. the only problem is it is a bit more expensive compared to other bottles in the market. however after i tried other bottles she had difficulty swalloing and got tired...had little milk...so we bought this. surprizingly, now she takes more than 4oz per time, thank you.
B0018JWAF0 Yes, easy to use and clean. I know it has several parts but if you wash it right after the baby finished her bottle, you simply can rinse it in a warm/hot water and it's clean! If you don't wash it right away it's ok, use some warm/hot water, soap (I buy Planet or other mild soaps) and there are 3 holes in the vent part, brush them with a small brush 1-2 times.. is really easy especially after you do it a couple of times.The bottle is pretty thick but light. It seems strong and durable.Baby drinks with no interrupts. I like the natural flow feature of this bottle. If you use just nipple and bottle of other brand with no vent, it creates vacuum and your baby often stops many many times. I did not like that as she got tired faster and never finished her bottle and had to snack more often...The nipple is soft and it is standard. I like that it is soft breast like (so many other nipple seem so thick). We talked to 3 lactation consultants and they recommended Playtex Drop Ins (wide neck bottles) or in our case, our baby would only drink from Standard nipple/bottle, they always recommended Dr. Browns. So if these are the only 2 bottles I will buy for my children.I tried every bottle and nipple out there except Avent and Born Free (our lactation consultants really did not recommend them); mixed different bottles with nipples, inserted vent from Dr. Browns into different bottle when they didn't have the safe bottles yet and I was very happy to see these new Dr. browns bottles that are safe for my child.And one more thing. When we used OTHER bottles they were somewhat hard to wash. Bottles inside would be sticky and we had to brush them for a long time and rinse really well before they felt clean. I never had this problem with Dr. Browns bottles.
B0018JWAF0 We used these bottles for both of our kids, after a friend recommended them. We don't get these bottles easily in India. So we buy them from Amazon all the time. One thing is for sure: none of our kids ever had colic trouble.  I understand many kids would probably never have that trouble and I don't know we our kids are amongst those lucky ones. So its hard to tell if these bottles are doing the trick or not. I would also recommend buying the wide neck bottles because they are easier to clean and also easier to operate.
B0018JWAF0 We had previously been trying Breastflow bottles and my daughter simply hated them. In a moment of desperation we ordered Dr Brown's and they are SO much easier! The nipple is small and more comfortable for her to use; there is a special tube insert that helps with burping, and I found that incredibly helpful. It comes with a small pipe cleaner to clean the inner tube, but I'd recommend getting a larger brush for the bottle itself. All in all, a life saver!!!
B0018JWAF0 Other reviewers have said that these bottles are hard to clean. I do not think they are not hard to clean; they just require a few extra steps because they have a few extra parts.Besides, Dr. Brown's bottles are the only ones our infant has taken to... and we tried lots of different bottles.
B0018JWAF0 I bought these bottles because I heard great reviews. They are ok bottles, I wouldn't say the best. There are multiple pieces and are a pain to clean. The bottles did not reduce spit up at all, they actually made my child spit up more.  For the cost and the hassle I don't think that I would recommend this bottle to any friends. I would recommend others like the Vent-Aire instead.
B0018JWAF0 These are the only bottles that my son was able to use without choking on the milk flow. Don't bother buying the small 4 oz bottles-- baby will grow out of those way to fast
B0018JWAF0 very high quality and you won't be sorry.  Just know that at least one baby out there (ours) didn't really need these since she seemed not to every suck a lot of gas.
B0018JWAF0 Hear are the only bottles we use in our house. When our baby was having some trouble using the bottle (I breastfeed and she just wasn't that into bottles) she took this one best. I think it's because there's no vacuum effect when she sucks on it. It also gives her less gas than the other more traditional bottle we were using. Highly recommend.
B0018JWAF0 These truly are the best bottles. Whatever the special method is, I don't know, but it works to reduce airflow and the baby will be happier. All the fuss about the extra parts (in other reviews) is just silly. If you have a dishwasher and one of those baskets for baby bottle parts, you won't even notice or care about the extra parts.
B0018JWAF0 My son was incredibly colicky and gassy as a newborn and we tried many different bottle types - Dr. Brown, First Years Breast Flow, and Tommee Tippee, to name a few. The Dr. Brown's came highly recommended by friends and doctor's but did nothing to help our little guy and actually made him gassier. Not only did these not really do as they said, but they are also a pain to clean and put back together. These bottles have so many parts that they are more of a hassle then they are worth. Overall, a waste of money for us and not a bottle I would recommend. We discovered the Tommee Tippee's and will stay with them for the duration!
B0018JWAF0 Love these bottles.  My son has not had any gas problems using these.  The price on Amazon is by far the best price around.  Very sturdy design.  Yes, downside is that they consist of 5 parts per bottle, but don't let that intimidate you.  Very easy and intutitive to put together.  Love these.
B0018JWAF0 We have only used Dr. Brown's bottles since baby was born- both for expressed milk and formula.We love the vent system and our baby was never uncomfortable from gas and doesn't spit up a lot. The bottles do leak sometimes but I figured out that that happened when the blue insert was filled with fluid.We use the dishwasher cage to wash all the parts and heated the bottles in warm water when needed.
B0018JWAF0 I bought the Dr. Brown bottles for my newborn after hearing all the great reviews from other moms. He seemed to love them then I noticed he began spitting up. After him spitting up and gulping for two days, I looked it up in the baby book and realized that I had on the wrong size nipples. Once I changed the nipples, the gas stopped abruptly and he no longer cried. For the parents who may have had problems with Dr. Brown, it may be the case they did not check the nipple size level before giving it to their baby. One size does not fit all children. I was using the level 2 nipple and had to buy level 1. I hope this helps parents who are having difficulties with this line of bottles
B0018JWAF0 I received the pink 5 oz for a baby shower gift and really liked how it helped keep extra air out of my baby from sucking. Only thing is no matter what I do, the bottles leak!!!  So annoying.  I have to place a burp cloth around the top to mix and feed
B0018JWAF0 I had to stop nursing at around 2 months and we've tried the Avent Natural, the Gerber First Essentials, and the Dr. Brown's. Our munchkin is SUPER gassy and has stomach distress on a regular basis. Our experience with...... Dr. Brown's bottles: Great! Seems to be the least gassy/painful option for him - he does as well after drinking from these as he did when nursing directly from me. We have both standard and wide neck bottles, I really prefer the wide neck. The opening of the standard bottles is smaller and I tend to spill some of the very expensive formula powder when I'm sleepily trying to make bottles in the night.... Avent Natural bottles: Love the wide mouth, very easy to clean. Baby was very gassy after drinking from these and also spilled a lot while drinking. He would suck very noisily (the sounds that indicate a poor latch in nursing) and would somehow spit milk from the sides of his mouth while drinking.... Gerber First Essentials: I like the caps on these but the openings are small making them hard to fill. These bottles fit my Medela pump while I was still nursing. Baby was very gassy after drinking from these and would spit up quite a bit (sometimes it seemed like the whole meal!)
B0018JWAF0 These bottles I was hesitant on cause I'm a old school grandma, but to my satisfaction they have helped his poor belly a lot.. Now we just order level 2 nipple to see if helps spread out feedings some..would buy again for next grandchild..
B0018JWAF0 You must never pass the max fill line or they leak. You must never shake the bottle or tilt it up and down too much or they leak. You must never tilt it less than 30-45 degrees so that the blue vent pipe submerges, or they leak.At the times they don't leak, it is a great bottle. We almost never had the need to burp our baby. They're lightweight as well.
B0018JWAF0 There are so many bottles to choose from, it is hard to know what your baby will like. I went with these per a recommendation from a friend and I'm glad that I did. My baby loved these bottles and the air system helped reduce the gas associated with bottles. Great bottles!
B0018JWAF0 I returned this item.  Maybe I didn't give it enough time, but my son couldn't get any milk through the nipple and became frustrated right away.
B0018JWAF0 I haven't used any other bottles so I don't have anything to compare these to. I originally bought the variety starter and then as my baby grew past 3 months, I had to buy more of these 8oz ones. Because there are so many parts to clean, I wash a whole batch at a time. Yes, they are a pain to clean! There are so many little nooks that sometimes I miss a spot and that part starts to grow mold so I end up having to buy replacement parts, which are not cheap. Other than that, these have worked out for my baby since birth. She was colicky for 5 months of her life. I'm not sure if these bottles helped or not but I have no complaints.
B0018JWAF0 We were using Tommy Tippee bottles when my daughter was first born and almost immediately she was throwing up entire bottles. My doctor actually suggested us moving over to the Dr. Brown's bottles and wouldn't ya know it! The throwing up stopped instantly.Washing them are a problem because there are 2 other mechanicals besides the bottles that you have to wash and in order to get them adequately clean, you should really do this by hand. No big deal, but I spend 20 extra minutes a day washing all the components of these bottles by hand (even though they are dish washer safe).Now for the Biggest problem of all with these bottles - they leak and sometimes for no reason at all.  This morning I put the bottle on the nightstand and it was about half full, had not been tipped over and not bothered at all, the next time I picked it up to give it to my 11 month old she got doused with milk. This happens on an almost daily basis and every day it infuriates me and I yell \"I HATE THESE BOTTLES!!!\".I really have tried different bottles with her like Avent to keep the colic and throwing up down, but for some reason these leaky, messy, pain in the ^@(#&)@)# bottles seem to be the only ones that keep her from throwing up. So with that, I am willing to put up with this long enough that her little tummy doesn't hurt and move into sippy cups as soon as she gets the hang of them.I HATE THESE BOTTLES!! ARRRRGGGGGG!
B0018JWAF0 These bottles do what they say....less gas for baby! We use these bottles to help supplement our big boy. It helped that Dr Browns has a preemie nipple which is extremely slow flow so our little boy did not get to used to the fast flow at first and get nipple confusion.Take note: People complain about them leaking....you need to read the directions before warming the milk. The top has to be slightly loose due to the venting system or milk will back up into the vents and leak out when feeding. Without these vents the bottle is useless. We have only had leaking problems when we didn't loosen the top before warming or didn't tighten the top enough after.Also, we have tried the drop ins and avent and realize this is more to clean but after a while you get used to the extra 2 bottle parts and for baby it is worth it.
B0018JWAF0 I bought one of the plastic bottles and 6 of the glass bottles. Within a month with normal use 3 of the glass bottle had broken. So I do recommend sticking to the plastic version. That aside I must mention that I contacted the Handi Craft customer service via online form and within 1 business day I had a reply offering to replace the broken glass bottles with plastic ones (which is what I would have wanted given the tendency to breakage) and pay for postage to return the broken ones for quality control. I am totally impressed with this as well as the functionality of the venting system. My son has acid reflux issues and these bottles are great. I'm pretty sure (don't ask me how) that he actually consumes less air with these bottles than breast feeding. Love them and Love the company.
B0018JWAF0 Finding the right bottle is an exercise in trial and error. Even if the marketing material on the back of a box sounds great, it doesn't make a difference if your baby won't take it. I can't tell you why my baby loves Dr. Brown's, but I can tell you we've had the best luck with them.These bottles feature a silicone, free-flowing nipple, that provides a steady stream of milk. So if your baby likes to latch on without coming up for air, this is the bottle for you. Aside from the bottle, nipple, and collar, there are a few parts on the inside worth mentioning, a straw-like tube, and a plastic diverter. Both of those parts have small openings, so if you want to give them a thorough hand cleaning, you'll probably want to invest in a couple bottle brushes as well.I am a little wary about the overuse of plastic in children's products. But at the end of the day, a baby's gotta eat. And these Dr. Brown's bottles do the best job getting the milk where it needs to go.
B0018JWAF0 my niece and nephews have used the same bottles, so i was advised by my sister to pick it up, and I got a great deal from Amazon.My son got hooked on to it, very easily and no issues. One word - go for it.
B0018JWAF0 My daughter was born without an issue to latch or to feed. When I went back to work we chose the Platex natural care bottle because the shape was easier to feed. Bad idea, they leaked, dribbled, caused gas. Oh I had one angry babe!My friend whose baby had a hard time after birth was given Dr. Brown's in the ICU. She recommended them. I work in a hospital (CCU RN) and went down to the L&D.Yes;, they carry Dr. Brown's and yes they recommened them for any baby. The internal vent system takes extra steps to clean, yes extra time at the sink, but the benefits outweight the issues of cleaning. Voted American baby best 2012. I bought bottles for all the grandmas and extras for us. I have the traditional 8oz bottle, a little large and not the best ergonomics, however there is a larger wide neck that some babies prefer that mimicks the Tommy Tippie style.End point, my daughter was on baby Zantac for reflux. After changing bottles, her symptoms improved and we were able to stop her medicine. I would not choose any other bottle and would recommend.
B0018JWAF0 I tried Avent and Tommee Tippee bottles for my little one and although he wasn't picky we didn't care for them for various reasons.  Dr. Brown's shape of the bottle and nipple ended up being our favorite.  The longer bottle makes it easier to use your chin to hold the bottle briefly if you need to use your feeding hand to grab something real quick and the skinnier shape allows you to store the bottles in a diaper bag easier (I use a backpack for a diaper bag and the bottles fit nicer in the water bottle holder than the thicker bottles).  I originally avoided these bottles because of the skinny nipple since I was planning on breastfeeding and I was afraid of nipple confusion but nursing didn't work out for us so I gave these nipples a try after the Tommee Tippee bottles had milk leaking out of my son's mouth like a sieve and I was pleasantly surprised with the seal my son got on these nipples.  They rarely leak.  My only complaint is that the markings are very faint on the bottle and we've had to take a permanent marker to the oz. lines so that we can  see where to fill the bottle to.  If they could add color to the markings it would make it so much easier in low light and for older nannies' eyes!
B0018JWAF0 Even though there are extra parts to wash, these bottles are great.  My son was spitting up alot with Avent and I switched to these and he would burp right away and there was much less spit up.I got used to washing extra parts so it didn't bottle me.  The pros were greater than the cons.
B0018L146Y I got these when I had my baby, and I think they're wonderful! For diapers, I think they're superior to prefolds because they can be folded in more ways, and if you just fold them in quarters, you have a prefold anyway. I usually fold them in quarters, then in thirds, lay them in a simple diaper cover, and wrap the whole thing around baby's bum. Even in the dryer, these dry faster than prefolds, saving you energy costs.These are also terrific for other uses: I've used them as a burp cloth, a bib for my messy eater, and for general cleanup around my baby. Later I intend to use them as kitchen cloths and rags. They are the most versatile and most used item that was bought new for the baby.
B0018L146Y We use these as burp rags, and nothing is better! They are SO absorbent and easy to just throw in the wash. My baby was a major spitter, shocking pediatricians, but even with multiple spit-ups back-to-back this would catch and quickly absorb everything (though it might get pretty wet!). I shudder to think how much worse her spit up would have been to deal with with a traditional flannel burp cloth. These are soft and absorbent, what more can you want?
B0018L146Y These are awesome! Their main use in my home is to dry baby's bottom after I use wet wipes during a diaper change. They are also wonderful for kitchen rags and burp cloths. Great for cleaning glass and for drying car after washing
B0018L146Y These are so much better than the Gerber diapers!  Very sturdy and a good size (the Gerber diapers shrink badly and shred easily).  I was looking for the quality of what we were given by the hospital, and found exactly what I wanted!We mainly use them as burp cloths, but also as small drop cloths when we put our daughter down on something.  The large size makes them multi-functional, and less of a gamble when picking her up when we're already dressed for work.
B0018L146Y I like these flat diapers because they are large and thick. I use these from newborn to toddler. When my babies wet too heavily for just one diaper, I layer another down the middle before pinning. They still dry very fast on a line.
B0018L146Y If you're going to go with flats, then the All Together Diaper Company is the way to go. Their flats are the cheapest, and at least equal in quality to the flats you'll find anywhere else. I'm giving them four stars instead of five because I really do prefer the quicker and easier folding of prefolds, but if you don't have your own washer and dryer, flat diapers cannot be beat!
B0018LLZXQ Great item!  It's good to have extras.
B0018LLZXQ I have the Medela Freestyle pump, and all of the original parts that came with it.  This Spare Parts Kit is exactly the same as what came with my pump.  It works just as well, has held up through me exclusively pumping (7 months so far!) and is exactly as described.  I would highly recommend.
B0018LLZXQ I accidentally ordered the wrong spare parts kit. But, the return process was so easy, I had the whole thing packaged and ready to go in 10 min and in 24 hours, the wrong parts were gone. In 36 hours, the refund had been completed. No questions asked.
B0018LLZXQ This product is exactly as advertised.  It is efficient and does the job it is supposed too.
B0018LLZXQ Great to have extra parts. I had to take a class for a week and wouldn't be able to rinse the parts in between every use so I ordered these. They are just like the original parts.
B0018LLZXQ I have 5 sets of these because I hate washing every single day!  (I pump 2x/day).  I hate that these have so many parts and take so long to dry.  Also.  why the freaking high cost, Medela?!  These from this seller were the least expensive I could find, but gee wiz-arm and a leg!
B0018LLZXQ These are great if you need to replace the parts or just need a spare pare.  They came quickly and in great condition.
B0018LLZXQ IMPORTANT! These are 2 SETS, not just one.Bought these for my wife so she isnt having to wash the old set over and over.This is 2 SETS, not one as the listing shows. Great value!
B0018LLZXQ convenient to have to avoid washing parts in the dishwasher.  another person recommended not combining parts with your original so i have done the same.
B0018LLZXQ It's so great to have an extra set of parts. I bought this kit right away with an extra set of breastshields so I could have one set at work and one at home since I pump both places. This way I have less to remember and less stuff to cart around. With my first baby (& first pump) I caused a near catastrophe when I forgot to put my breastshields back into the pump bag to go to work with me... discovered at 11pm (I work at night). My husband AND the baby had to get into the car to bring them to me- fortunately baby slept through the whole thing. You already spent a wad of cash on the pump, go ahead and spend a few more dollars to avoid repeating the above scenario (although you still have to remember the pump :)). I also highly reccomend the microwave steam clean bags- a great way to keep your parts clean and all together.
B0018LLZXQ Great to have if you don't have time to always wash and dry the parts of just 1 set. I am considering having a third set haha. I only wish there was an option to order breast shields with this kit. It makes sense, right? I end up having to wash my one set of shields over and over. I guess I will have to order spare shields as well.
B0018LLZXQ It dose the same thing that comes from original package. It contains two sets in the package. (I wasn't sure when I ordered it)
B0018LLZXQ All I do is pump.  The spare parts make it so much easier!  I don't have to wait for them to dry or use a paper towel to dry the parts.  These are identical to the ones that come with the freestyle Medela pump.Side note (the really cheap 99 cent BPA Free plastic \"Reduces Colic Gerber\" bottles found at Target hook up to the Freestyle pump perfectly and are a lot cheaper than purchasing Medela bottles-- They come in 5 oz and 9 oz)
B0018LLZXQ After washing and drying and waiting and washing and drying and waiting, I decided to get this pack as a \"back-up\" so that I can always have another set handy--what a great idea! If you pump regularly at all, you really need to do yourself a favor and get a 2nd set. These work great with the Freestyle and I've never looked back. Totally recommend.
B0018LLZXQ I exclusively pump and I had to purchase several of these to save my sanity. Having spares allows you to only wash everything once a day instead of after every pumping. Also having back ups allows you to still pump if your set breaks or gets a hole.
B0018LLZXQ Unless you only pump occasionally (which you probably don't if you have the Freestyle), cleaning parts and waiting for them to dry every time you pump gets old, really fast. I wish I would have purchased a 3rd set of parts even.
B0018LLZXQ Same parts that come with the freestyle, always helpful to have extra parts in case something happens to the originals.
B0018LLZXQ I bought my first set to make it easier to pump - I don't have to dry the parts after each pump, I can just let them air dry, and I will still have the extra set ready to use!  I did chip the plastic part that attaches to the flange on one of them when I dropped it onto our hardwood floor.  It still worked (the chip wasn't that deep), but I ordered another set so I wouldn't have to risk problems in the future.
B0018LLZXQ I needed an extra spare kit to keep in the office for pumping. I was very disappointed to see cracks on both parts when I opened the box. The box was in good shape so the cracks couldn't have occurred during shipping.
B0018LLZXQ So I have these for my freestyle pump I am waitting to use with my 2nd baby.  My 1st son, I had a Pump in Style Advanced backback style.  Those have totally different connectors.  However, I like these a little better.  I wanted extra so I wouldnt have to constantly clean them when in a rush at work.  They connect to the hardshelled breast shields. I DO NOT like the ones that come with the freestyle.  I DO NOT suggest them, and I think they're the reason for the loss of suction. Good news, you can just disassemble them from the older PIS and connect on to these.  I think they're much easier to clean.  They are neat and less parts too!  Awesome find, for sure you should buy a few sets so you're not overwhelmed with cleaning constantly!
B0018LLZXQ I recieved a freestyle pump and needed all the parts. Everything fit perfectly and it was nice not having to go to the store to buy the kit. I'd recommend buying two kits.It's nice to have one set ready to go at all times...especially at 4 am!
B0018LLZXQ It's really handy having a spare set because they're a pain to dry out in between pumpings.  These are the exact same replacement parts.  If you're pumping alot, I would highly recommend having a second set so you're not constantly trying to dry out the crevices before pumping again.  I also like that it was inexpensive for such an expensive pump (mine fit theMedela Freestyle Breast Pump
B0018LLZXQ I think have a total of 18 spare part sets.  As a working mom, it's easier to have enough to use throughout the week rather than worry about cleaning and washing them every night.  This was the best price I could find at the time and you can't beat Amazon Prime delivery.
B0018LLZXQ I bought these extra parts when I went back to work. I EBF and pump a bottle a day when I am not working. These are nice to have when you use your pump daily so you can rotate your parts to avoid exessive wear. I have noticed small cracks in the plastic but it has not affected suction. I boil the large piece that actually touches the milk and hand wash the yellow rubber and small plastic backing. I love my freestyle pump and would recommended getting extra parts if you plan on pumping for an extended period of time!
B0018LLZXQ For a working mom like me, having a spare set of pump parts is a necessity. Need to also have an extra set of breast shields to have to complete set but maybe you can get away with using both the large and medium ones that come with the freestyle pump.
B0018LLZXQ Unfortunately there is no other option when it comes to this product.  I am still breastfeeding my 7 month old baby and pump no less than 10 times a week at work.  In these 7 months I have had to buy this product a minimum of 3 times, maybe 4.  If they go in the dishwasher they go faster.
B0018LLZXQ I would recommend this spare parts kit to any and every working mom with a medela freestyle. I got so tired of constantly washing the parts after each nursing session. now I've got this extra set to get me through two pumping sessions. I was so confused when I was ordering because the description does not tell you that it comes with a total of 6 pieces (2 bottle attachment assemblies) and the picture looks like it only comes with 3 pieces. Rest assured this is a complete set; however, it is worth mentioning that this does not have the breast shields included.
B0018LLZXQ I bought extra sets of these so i wouldn't have to wash and wait for them to dry at work. These have been a lifesaver!
B0018LLZXQ Got so tire washing it day and night and waiting for it to dry.  So got a 2nd set just before returning to work.  It fits the free style model and comes with a pair so just need to buy one item.
B0018LLZXQ There's not much to say about this product. It's an essential part of the medela hands free breast pump. It arrived on time and was in good condition.
B0018LLZXQ I exclusively pumped with my first son and I'm doing the same with my second. I originally bought a second set as a backup in the event I couldn't clean the first set before I needed to pump again. I quickly decided it was easier to clean everything at the end of the night in one batch rather than cleaning them after each use, so I bought more pairs.I have had these crack before. I'm not sure if it's because I use them all the time or if they just eventually crack over time, but I had one piece on one set crack after 7 months and another piece on another set crack after 15 months.Anyone who has the freestyle should have an extra set of these so in the event the set that comes with the pump cracks, you have another set as backup.
B0018LLZXQ These are exactly the same as the parts that cons with the freestyle pump. They work great. It is very convenient to have another set.
B0018LLZXQ I love that you can buy the spare parts on Amazon! Having an extra one on hand is a huge benefit when the other one is still drying.
B0018LLZXQ This hard to find item was much needed.  I love the Freestyle pump because there is no more bag to have to lug around, just the portable pump.  I bought the extra parts so that I could just keep the parts in my office while keeping 2 sets at home.  It's made storage so much easier.
B0018LLZXQ I am on my second baby but one side of my pump no longer worked.  I was able to order replaces parts for a good price.  My machine is up and running well.  I would recommend this product.
B0018LLZXQ i needed spare parts for the freestyle. this is useful because it was impractical to use just the two sets that came with the pump. now i have extra to use.
B0018LLZXQ I am an exclusive pumper so I pump multiple times throughout the day. I've bought several spare parts before because this particular style is known for coming loose and jamming the pump. The middle yellow, rubber piece will come loose causing the pump to freeze up mid-pump.  It doesn't happen often, but I know that when it does I have to re-order a new set because the suction is never the same after.  All in all these work great, but I'd recommend buying a back-up set. I go through about 4 sets per year.
B0018LLZXQ I ordered 8 of these sets for my wife now, since on the first 4 the rubber seal (in the middle) started shrinking and warping after 4 months. This almost caused an issue feeding the baby since my wife was first thinking it was her output.Just be warned that these seals (which can't be purchased on their own) have a VERY high failure rate. Especially very warm water (dishwasher, steaming or just very hot dishwater) causes them to shrink/warp.If you check other reviews, you will notice similar reviews. When we contacted Medela, they more or less confirmed the issue.They should really sell these seals as a separate unit since the plastic pieces are doing well.
B0018LLZXQ I wasn't sure from reading the description if there was only one pump attachment or two with this spare parts kit. There are two to make a set. I misordered and had to return one set. You do still need the breast sheields, though.
B0018LLZXQ These work for my pump, the Medela Freestyle. There are 2 but you will need to purchase spare breast shield separately.
B0018LLZXQ Nice replacement oem parts to replace freestyle pump. Works perfect.
B0018LLZXQ I like freestyle pump, and this thing is good for me when I go to work. It easy to clean and setting up.
B0018LWIDW These work very well! and very quick. you only need a few drops count to two and you get your results! Sucks that you only get a few for how much they cost though.
B0018LWIDW Best bet is to pump a lot.... not dump so if you get a positive read, you don't give your baby boozy milk. Just wait a few hours.
B0018LWIDW I was really hoping for a product that would say &#34;Hey, you had a drink, but your breast milk is FINE!  Go ahead and feed that baby!&#34;  Instead if you drank at all, ever it says &#34;hey there is some alcohol in there,&#34; leaving you to feel guilty about having that glass of wine even though you abstained for 9 months and squeezed out a life form all by yourself with no pain medicine.  It made me wonder if it WAS safe to feed my baby after 1 drink...In retrospect, I would either follow la leche leagues recommendation for drinking and not worry about it beyond that.I would have LOVED this product if it had given an indicator of how much alcohol was in the milk.  Just a little rating or variation in color change to indicateTrace amounts- go ahead and have anotherYour still safe but better quitYour pumping jet fuel- back away from the baby
B0018LWIDW I know there are people with strong opinions on drinking and breastfeeding, so I'll tell what I did, and you can decide for yourself.I would put my baby to bed and have a glass of wine.  Then, I would use the strip to determine when I no longer had any detectible alcohol in the breast milk before I would pump prior to going to bed.These strips worked very well.  They turn a dark purplish color if alcohol is detected, so there really isn't a question.  They sometimes take a few minutes to appear, but once it does, it's pretty clear.They are not designed to measure the amount of alcohol, just whether or not there is any detected.These are a bit expensive, but to me, they were worth it.  Once I used then a number of times, I learned how much I could have, and how soon it would metabolize.  I would've just been taking a guess without the help of these, and a few times, I would've been wrong, so I'm glad I had these.
B0018LWIDW I bought the 8 pack, but wish I had bought more.  It's nice to be able to get out of the house and have a good time and not have to worry about the quality of your child's food.
B0018LWIDW Very happy with these test strips.  I just wish more came in a package for the price, but they're great.  Allowed me to have peace of mind and know for sure if my milk was safe to serve after consuming some alcohol. Especially in the beginning when I was just learning how my body metabolizes and how much goes into the milk.
B0018LWIDW I was nervous at first to trust these but the first time I got a negative I knew they really work!
B0018LWIDW Its def smart to have this at hand when breast feeding!.. I only used it once and it worked like it should.. Unfortunately i stopped breast feeding earlier than i expected but i would have used this even if i had a glass of wine... !
B0018LWIDW We tried/tested it a few times and it picked up alcohol after only 2 beers within a couple of hours. Would reccomend.
B0018LWIDW This product is a very helpful indicator or safe milk. My breastfeeding consultant told me that one glass of wine per hour is fine when brestfeeding. This product is more for the vocational martinis. The pad on the stick will go dark if there is presence of alcohol in your milk. It might also slightly discolor the pad (not go dark all the way) which means that there is still some alcohol in there. Usually by the next feeding the alcohol is gone. Also if you leave the milk in the fridge for a week the alcohol evaporates (but still test again to make sure).
B0018LWIDW At the very least, they don't explain what the tolerance that they test for is and I've experimented with them half hour after finishing a glass of wine and they showed nothing. It could be that I metabolize that fast, but since I don't know how sensitive these are, I get no piece of mind from using the product. Save your $$$. I don't think anyone actually needs these.
B0018MJTV0 My child has started to want to walk with mommy in the store instead of riding in the cart. I have found that this \"leash\" comes in handy because I don't have to bend down to hold hands and my child has more room to move. My child was able to get this off the first time we used it, but she is a pretty good listener so I just tell her to keep it on or she has to ride in the cart. If you have a child who wouldn't listen and would keep pulling the leash off their wrist this is not the product for you.
B0018MJTV0 I'm a very gentle parent. My daughter likes to dart off. I'm disabled. This tether has helped us when out. It keeps her safe, it doesn't hurt her, and she likes the color. Win-win. We call it her bracelet.
B0018MJTV0 I purchased this tether based on the reviews and needing to try something after my two year old daughter bolted off in a parking lot.  She did seem to prefer the tether over holding hands, at least initially.  In addition, it seem to be comfortable on her wrist.  However, there is no give to the tether, so it did cause her to fall down a few times.  I have stopped using it as she is doing better at holding hands (at least when she is not tired/fussy), and I have ordered a carrier for the other times.  Beware:  You will get a lot of looks using a tether.
B0018MJTV0 I swore that I would never get one of those leashes or harnesses, but after a scary incident where my toddler ran through security and almost got hit by a security cart, we looked into wrst to wrist harnesses to assist us eith the airport. Typically my toddler is good about holding hands and not running away but at the airport, our hands can sometimes be preoccupied and he gets so excited about seeing the airplanes.I don't like the leashes or harnesses because i feel that jerking a kid around the neck is the same as treating your kid like a dog or pet on a leash.  At least with a wrist to wrist, it feels more like holding hands. Snce receiving this product, we have used it a handful of times at the airport and it does it's work.  Our toddler treats it the same as if we were holding hands and I'm still able to maneuver around decently. My complaint is that I wish that it had a neater way of being rolled up and stored.
B0018MJTV0 Works GREAT to keep toddlers close!! I have used this at flea markets and in the mall.....my kids DO know how to remove it so if they keep doing it I have put it around a belt loop and that keeps it on!
B0018MJTV0 Not sure what I was expecting, but this is literally like a dog leash.  No stretch or elastic.  Just a nylon cord with a loop for your wrist at one end.  My main complaint is the other end--it takes some work to make a workable loop with the fastener.  Just slipping it over my child's wrist won't work, so I wanted to use it around a belt loop, but it was just too tricky to make it happen.  Very, very basic.
B0018MJTV0 little hard to put together if you don't  read directions. lol.  but after that works great  glad to have it.
B0018MJTV0 Wish I knew where I put it. Will buy another. It's cheap, and I like the way it's a loop system, so I don't have to worry about my son getting out. Of course my son doesn't like it, but I feel better knowing he can get some exercise outside of his stroller and still have that added security.
B0018MJTV0 I bought this tether when my daughter was 18 months old. I mainly got it for when I go clothes shopping. My daughter likes to wander away from me which makes looking through stores difficult. This tether keeps her near, gives her the freedom to walk around a bit and gives me the opportunity to look at something other than where my daughter is running off to. I also like that this tether is affordable and compact and that it makes my daughter and I more like equals (since we're both connected at the wrist) and less like I have her on a leash. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is that it took me a long time to figure out how to loop the tether through the plastic buckle. No instructions are given and the buckle looks completely different from the picture.
B0018MJTV0 2 things people hate while they are shopping: crying children, while parents 'tune it out' (instead of removing them until calm) and Running wild children. This is a great item, that gives your child limited freedom. It provides safety and is considerate of other shoppers.I will often tie one end to either the stroller or the shopping cart. Great buy and nice alternative to the harness.
B0018MJTV0 My son hated this...not just because of the arm leash part of it :-)...but the actual cord itself is pretty rough and scratchy.I feel like I could have done something just as effective using a spool of ribbon.
B0018MJTV0 When I told my \"Bonus-daughter\" that I was getting these for the kids, she said our grandson wouldn't use it- but he does. Freedom but Nana has hold of him!! I HIGHLY recommend these especially if you have one who won't hold hands.
B0018MJTV0 I thought this would be a good idea to use since my son loves to walk on his own, but I just couldn't get the nerve up to put it on him. The strap looked as if it was too ruff and would cause redness on his wrist.
B0018OHCLC Got these and a couple of different kinds for my daughter when she was beginning to eat solids. These were by far my favorite for feeding her things like oatmeals, rice cereals, sticky-type foods, that they eat so much of in the beginning! The silicone tip is soft and they are affordable, so if you loose one (or a couple), it doesn't break the bank to replace them!
B0018OHCLC Besides the mislabeling on the website (which I reported), these are pretty great for first solid foods. They are soft silicone tips that are gentle on the gums and new teeth, and though they don't hold a lot, it makes it easier for the baby to learn how to deal with food. (A bigger spoon would likely get pushed out more immediately).
B0018OHCLC These were the first spoons we used for our 4 month old. Soft tipped and dishwasher safe. Overall a good product for a baby who is just starting baby food.Edit: As I mentioned, these spoons are great for new eaters. However, as they get better at eating, these spoons will not do as they don't hold nearly enough food. These are probably good for ~1-2 months while starting baby food, but after a while, your baby will get frustrated that she is not getting bigger bites.
B0018OHCLC Though I had already decided on Munchkin soft tip spoons due to the high ratings and low cost, Grandma bought us these and I figured we'd might as well use them.  I don't complain too much, especially since they were free to us, but I do wish I had stuck with my plans and traded these in for Munchkin.Pros:Goes easily into babies mouth (as in food comes off smoothly and quickly)Seem to get just the right amount of food for babies first solidsBaby \"helps\" easily, thanks to the long skinny handleCons:They don't seem to clean well.  One had just as much avocado coming out of the dishwasher as it did going in.Bent!  We were eating pears and one of them bent with hardly any effortBaby \"helps\" easily, thanks to the long skinny handle (I know, it's cute and terrible all at the same time)They aren't shallow at all.  I'd imagine once I need to start using \"larger\" spoonfuls these won't hold much.Ironically, that last con means I'll have to upgrade to toddler spoons sooner than I'd hoped (or go buy the Munchkin ones anyway), and while doing the research on toddler spoons, it does seem like NUK has the best ones to offer.  In the end, I wish I'd had Munchkin for baby (6 months to 12) and NUK for toddler (12+).  I'll probably just throw these out once he \"graduates\" because I can't imagine they'll hold up well for a second child.
B0018OHCLC I use these spoons daily and never use my other ones- Nuby brand. I originally liked the price for the amount, and then after using them this is the only spoon I use. My son just started eating solids, and what makes the spoon best for him is how shallow the spoon is. My other spoons were too deep and when you put the spoon with food into the baby's mouth,  he was unable to get the food off of the spoon. These work really well and are a nice small size for travelling as well.
B0018OHCLC These spoons are definetely on many people's lists. They seem to be the traditional baby spoons for starting them on solid food. The size is perfect and the plastic is good on their gums. Nevertheless, once I left a couple of spoons on the dirty plates and a couple of hours later I noticed that they both absorbed the colour of the leftover food. The white spoon was yellow (stained with mango) and the yellow spoon was green (stained with zuccini). This made me feel that the plastic is probably not good quality and will probably absorb all kinds of bacteria if they absorb the juices of leftovers. I'd be careful and would probably go for regular plastic spoons, since these can't be sterilized in the microwave because of the metal.
B0018OHCLC If you are looking for spoons for your beginning to solid feed baby then these spoons are for you and here is why. The rubber ending is better and safer for babies mouth and the metal end is great for holding and not losing grip. These spoons are a life saver and have not became discolored yet.
B0018OHCLC I realize that the spoons are for babies but you can really take just a drop of food out of the can.. if to take into account that it;;s not easy to make the baby wish open his mouth,, it will take ages to feed him. The silicone is of nice bright colors, but the metal looks so cheap, though it's washed pretty well in dishwasher.. Actually- they just cost their money. Good for their price.
B0018OHCLC These are the perfect spoons for when you are just starting purees because they are 1) soft and don't hurt baby's gums and 2) are very shallow.  The deeper spoons work well later on, but at first babies can't get the food out of the groove on some of the deeper ones.
B0018OHCLC A very petite spoon, but the 'rubberized' covering is nice for little mouths. Handle is slender, and easy for them to hold, but also long enough for mom to hold to feed.
B0018OHCLC I got a two pack spoon at a local buybuybaby store and absolutely loved it that I wanted to buy more. I was thrilled to find six pack for so cheap on amazon! I have tommee tipee plastic spoons that I got from my baby shower and I hate using them, doesn't feel like a proper spoon. Love how they are more like \"silverware,\" I hate how so many baby spoons are all plastic. The size is perfect for my little guy. The only downfall is that you can't choose color combination. when these arrived I got the pink, purple ones, the one that shows on the pic for my baby boy. Not a big deal but would've like to have chosen different colors.
B0018OHCLC I used these spoons when my daughters were babies and now I use them for my grandchildren! These, in my honest opinion, are THE BEST spoons on the market for babies graduating to eating more solid-type foods. The rubber spoon part makes feeding feel more secure in that there is no metal against their teeth. The length of the spoons are perfect and they are just
B0018OHCLC &#8226;Soft, silicone tip gentle on teeth and gums&#8226;Long, slim handles makes feeding baby easier&#8226;Dishwasher-safe&#8226;BPA-FREE&#8226;Available in 2pk and 6pk; For 4m+
B0018OHCLC We love these spoons!  They are soft so they don't hurt baby's mouth, shallow so it's easy to get food off (at this age you swipe the food off in their mouth, they don't use their lip to dig it out), and last a long time.  Ours didn't have any funny taste.  We tried the Munchkin spoons as recommended in other reviews, but the bowl is WAY too deep- there's no way a beginning eater can clean it out, and it's really wide making any attempt to use their lips very difficult.  Stick with these!
B0018OHCLC I only bought these spoons for my son because on my daughter I used the munchkin spoons and hated them. These spoons are very soft and hold a good amount of food too. They don't rust or discolor when I wash them either.
B0018OHCLC by the time your grandchildren are visiting you, all those &#34;baby forks and spoons&#34; from your own children have been either tossed or lost, and that &#34;ceremonial silver spoon&#34; is not one you want to use for a little one.  These spoons are perfect.  Great price point, dishwasher safe (if you choose) - soft bowl and edges designed not to hurt baby.  And several in a pack!  So you won't have to go digging for the one baby spoon you want - unless you have someone who only wants a particular color - which little babies are not usually so interested in - well worth the price
B0018OHCLC These spoons are the perfect size and shape for beginning eaters. I had tried two other kinds first, and they just generally are too big or too deep. These are fairly flat, the tip is small, and the coating is comfortable for babies just getting started.
B0018OHCLC I bought these spoons for feeding my 4 month old. I bought these along withTake & Toss Infant Spoons - 16pk. The take and toss spoons are very hard plastic and not good at all for starting a baby on solids, it is very hard on the gums. The gerber spoon are soo perfect. They are small for my sons little mouth and very soft. He can chew on the spoon with no problems. Very sturdy spoons and great handles for parents on hold.
B0018OHCLC Great little spoons, very comfortable to hold and feed baby from.  I like the length of the spoon handles and how comfortable and soft the spoon tip is.
B0018OHCLC I got these for my daughter to start on baby food. I like the plastic coating on the spoon to protect her gums. And the spoon is just right for her little mouth. Of course it is important that it is bpa free as well.
B0018OHCLC I like that they aren't color changing -- I can't imagine getting the spoons to change colors includes using a safe substance to put in my baby's mouth.
B0018OHCLC I purchased this because it's BPA free, but was a bit disappointed with the shallowness of the spoon and the unbalanced hold. The handle is metal and thin, so it's not easy to hold on to (baby swats the spoon out of my hand easily); and you can't grab much of the food with the spoon. Unfortunately they're just sitting in a drawer.
B0018OHCLC Dishwasher Safe, Baby likes them.... soft tip for babies teething. 4-8 months babies is probably the ideal time to use these. We've graduated from these into bigger spoons. 10 months old.
B0018OHCLC These are good spoons - small enough to tuck into a travel pack - I prefer the long handled, all plastic spoons - but these work and the small size is nice when you need them to tuck into bags.
B0018OHCLC These spoons are perfect for an infant just learning to eat. The rubber is soft for her to bite and the size is perfect for their little portions.
B0018OHCLC I'm really not fond of these and prefer the cheap Dollar Tree tossable spoon much better.  The food tends to fall off the sides of the spoon because of the design.  There is no 'bowl' for the spoon to house any food on it.  Try something else.
B0018OHCLC My son is 6 months old and just started eating solids.  The size of these spoons are perfect for tiny mouths.  The tip of the spoon is tapered so that you can get as little (or as much) as you want on the spoon.  The sides are a bit flatter so I use that to scoop up left overs on his face and lips.  The quality is very good and looks as if it'll last forever.  The set I got had green, blue, and orange spoons in it, which was perfect for my son.
B0018OHCLC Purchased this set from amazon for my young son.  My girlfriend approved the purchase and the kid actually uses them to eat his food, well, at least to transfer the food from whatever apparatus is holding it until it reaches his mouth.  Have been using it for a while and they seem great.  The spoon portion is nice and soft.
B0018OHCLC These spoons work well with my daughter, I recommend these for infants.
B0018OHCLC I am a mom of 3, my youngest is 7 months old. These are the best spoons for starting solids. A lot of spoons have too deep of a bowl, and it is hard to get it into baby's mouth when they are learning to eat, they can't get the food out of the bowl. These are a little more flat, so my kids could always get the food off easier. It is also narrower than some, so it fits in their little bitty mouths. They wash well, and have done fine in the dishwasher (utensil basket.) Love them.
B0018OHCLC I got lucky in the &#34;colors may vary&#34; department and got the ones I wanted.  That hasn't been the case in some other baby products I purchased at the same time that don't give you the option of ordering the colors you want
B0018OHCLC perfect size spoon and handle. easy to wash and easy to store. it fits into her tiny mouth perfectly and the rubber part is great because its gentle on her brand new teeth that are coming in. so far, i like all NUK products, we use their pacifiers too and she only likes those. Great job NUK and GERBER!  very nice spoons!!
B0018OHCLC These spoons are awesome for infant feeding. If you are feeding from jar food, just the right size. I used these with my two sons, and never a problem with them. They hold up well in the dishwasher, and were great first spoons!
B0018OHCLC The spoons themselves are great... the shipping was fast, etc. The only thing is that I was hoping to receive girl colors or at the very least gender neutral colors... nope! Blue and green...You at least be able to say what color you prefer and if nothing else they send neutral ones...
B0018OHCLC A little expensive... but gentle on sensitive baby gums. Compared to another spoon we use, these are more difficult to wash by hand, which we have to do because we have no dishwasher. We haven't been wowed by these, but not totally disappointed either.
B0018OHCLC Cute spoons--nice size and nicely soft.  But if ordering from Amazon, know that there doesn't seem to be a way to chose the colors you receive.  I thought I was getting the ones in the product photo, but they came in &#34;boy&#34; colors of blues and greens.  I wanted the pink and purple assortment.  However, it wasn't worth returning. I needed the spoons and they're cute enough.
B0018OHCLC I was looking for a spoon for our little one and I thought these would be amazing, and I was extremely disappointed.The rubber that was attached to the spoon was coming apart. When we got them I washed them and after I washed them I inspected them and noticed that the rubber on one was already peeling back from the metal. I did not even use these. I didn't feel that they were safe for a baby; if the rubber was already peeling back and they hadn't even been used yet, what was going to happen after these spoons are used all the time? I didn't think they were a safe purchase.Instead I went with another plastic spoon; not what I was looking for but a safer option.
B0018OHCLC We got these, the munchkin 6 pack of spoons and the Oxo spoons for our twin boys.  The Oxo spoons are the best which was not a surprise given they cost so much more but these were really terrible.  The chemical smell on these was terrible we returned the.  This was after hand washing them in hot water with soap.  They also had these black greasy smudges on them that didn't totally come off with washing.It did not seem safe to use these much less use them for my babies.
B0018OHCLC One spoon does not fit all.  I got these and the plastic Munchkin spoons and started cereal with these.  Yes, they are shallow, but a small baby doesn't get big bites of food anyway.  They are very soft and my son likes to try to grab them and chew on them while eating.  I take this as a good sign.  His first spoon experience was very positive and continues to be.I'm sure after he starts eating more at a feed and wants bigger bites, I will switch to Munchkin.  But for now, I love that these are smaller and not plastic.  I don't find them hard to use.  I have an older set that is pastel colors instead of the brighter colors, and they are cute and functional.Great, classic starter spoons.
B0018OHCLC This is the BEST baby spoon! The shallow shape is fantastic for when baby is learning to eat for the first time and continues to be easy for baby to eat off of later. I reach for these spoons above all the others in my drawer!
B0018OHCLC I purchased this set when my son was 5 months old- and he is now 14 months and I am still using them!
B0018OHCLC no hard edges, nice colors, easy to grip for mom and dad. Some of the best baby spoons out there.
B0018OHCLC I used these spoons for my son's first \"solid\" foods. Because the first foods are more liquid than solid, these spoons were so shallow they hardly held anything on it before it hit the baby's mouth.These won't last as long because they hold less food per spoonful than other deeper spoons.The lip is SO soft and rounded that when you use the spoon to catch dribble on the baby's chin/face, it actually just smears it or pushes it around rather than scooping it back up.(Buy the multicolored Munchkin spoons which are just as soft, will wipe food off the baby's face better, and hold more, thus lasting longer for when your child starts eating more volume and chunkier foods)
B0018OHCLC I have three children and have used these spoons with every one. They are the perfect size for beginning eaters and will keep the food on as long as you're not trying to pile a huge heap of cereal on it. I've never really had a problem with the food not staying on. I like that the well isn't deep; it makes it easier to place in my baby's mouth. They also make Gerber spoons that are the same \"Soft Bite\" material, but wider for bigger spoonfuls. Overall, I really love these spoons!
B0018OHCLC These are the only spoons I've used to feed my 7 month old son. They are not so great with thinner, more liquidy foods, but not unusable.  I've bought several packs because they work so well for us. My son enjoys playing with them as well.
B0018OHCLC My baby takes small bites and not much fits in these which is perfect for babies not ready for mounth fulls. He prefers these over the other 2 types we have at least for now.
B0018OHCLC A spoon's a spoon, it gets the job done.  I purchased these over others because they're BPA free.  Not sure how they hold up in the dishwasher as I choose to handwash all his stuff, but I'm happy with my purchase and would buy them again.
B0018OHCLC We like these because they fit in little mouths if you need to give an infant medicine, and are good for the initial solid food training. Later when they're getting teeth, I imagine these feel good on the teeth. Better to save the deep Munchkin spoons for later when they're a little more practiced at feeding themselves and won't get their mouths scraped on the edges of those spoons.
B0018OHCLC This is fabulous we have bought others in the past and none has lived up to our expectations other than this and I would recommend to anyone very nice for the baby
B0018OHCLC I know that this spoon isn't made for baby to chew, but it has helped interested my baby  to feed him self and I can feel safe that it will not hurt him if he chews on it. (6-9 months)
B0018OHCLC My son is 6 months old he tries to grab these spoons and feed himself. The soft tip helps him not hurt himself.
B0018OHCLC I liked these, but my daughter, who is the mom, said they didn't hold enough food after week one or two of solid food. At first I didn't agree with her, but now I like the ones she bought better
B0018OHCLC These spoons are my favorite. They are perfect for when you first start introducing solids to your baby. And even now that she's one I still use them.
B0018OHCLC These spoons make feeding a breeze. I like how simple they are. Nice metal handle and rubber on the end of the spoon. My son likes to chew on the end for teething in-between spoonfuls.
B0018OHCLC THESE SPOONS ARE SOFT BUT FOR A TEETHING CHILD THEY ARENT GOOD BECAUSE MY DAUGHTER CHEWED THE SOFT PART OFF SO NOW ITS JUST A METAL SPOON.
B0018OHCLC I got these spoons because it was traditional.  All babies seem to start with these types of spoons.  Yes they were a good size for her mouth, and when she was just starting to eat solids @ 5 1/2 mos and was biting down I thought it was protecting her gums.  The spoon well was so shallow that food just ran off it and she didn't get much with each bite.  The handle was also short and uncomfortable for me to hold.  It just didn't sit right in my hand.  I quickly switched (within a week) to the Munchkin brand and was 10 times happier with those ones.  Her gums were fine and boy does she bite down, and they are BPA free and safer for her to play with now that she tries to take it from me.  And the comfort for my feeding her is so much better with the long plastic ones over these short metal rubber ones.  I think these weren't necessary and a waste of money since I only used them for about a week, but I got them because being a first time mom, I thought that's what all babies started out with.
B0018OHCLC As far as quality goes these are fine but they just aren't an easy product to use compared to other brands out there. They are too short so they aren't that comfortable for parents to use. Also due to the length they are also messy because you have to dip into the jar or bowl and you tend to get the food halfway up the spoon. They are also very shallow making it difficult to feed those runny first foods that babies need. Go with Nuby they are great!
B0018OHCLC I like the size of these spoons for the first months of solids. The soft tip is great for babies who lie to bite.
B0018OHCLC These spoons are a bit small they do no hold much... they are only perfect for about a 4-5 month old.... you will have to buy better spoons in a few months.
B0018OHCLC This spoon is too small and too shallow, the utilization rate is not, almost useless, but I think just started eating baby food supplement may be used
B0018OHCLC In my opinion these are the best baby spoons. They stay soft after washing in hot water (which the thermal ones do not do!) and they are weighted perfectly. My 10 month old is still a pretty dainty eater so we have no problems with the spoon being shallow - now that we're feeding 3rd stage you can get quite a pile of food on there. I think these are THE BEST baby spoons! It seems weird to be reviewing spoons but anything to make mealtimes easy ends up being pretty important.
B0018OKNT0 I adore these classic baby spoons.  Our daughter has just started eating whole wheat rice cereal and these spoons are perfect for those first bites.  The soft rubber is comforting, they're well-made and hold just the right amount for her first meals.The colors I received were green and blue and they're cute too.
B0018OKNT0 We gave my daughter one of these spoons very early (around two months) to play with in the bath, and to get her used to having something in her mouth.  We started cereal around 3.5 months, and these spoons were perfect!  The silicon-tipped ends were soft on her gums, and the shallow spoon held just the right amount of cereal for her little mouth.  We have the Munchkin spoons as well, but DH and I both hate them because the bowl is very deep, and it's hard for DD to get all of the food out, even now at ten months old.  The spoons have held up very well, save a tiny bit of discoloration on our white one from spaghetti with sauce one night.  I recommend these to all parents with little eaters!
B0018OKNT0 This spoon is a nice size as my baby's first spoon.  Fits in my baby's mouth easily and shallow enough to make it easy for him to get all of the food off.  However, if you are starting with very liquid foods, I imagine it might be hard to hold very much food.  Our baby did fine with thicker purees from the start so this wasn't a problem for us.  I didn't find the thin handles to be uncomfortable to hold.  The only thing that concerned me was whether my baby would grab the spoon one day and poke himself in the eye with the metal end.  Maybe when he becomes more grabby we'll switch to a spoon with a thicker plastic handles.
B0018OKNT0 Our baby boy (13 months) has been on solid food for the past 3-4 months and we feed him a variety of foods with an assortment of spoons. His front teeth are all in and the back teeth are starting to show. He seems to like teeth and he took naturally to biting objects, including fingers. Now he's developed the tendency to bite the spoon that feeds him. He bites and holds on and at times doesn't want to let go. He exhibits quite a good grip, I might add. All of this is probably just a phase he's going through, but my wife worries about it. As such, she found these Gerber soft-bite spoons. Well, now he can bite all he wants and he probably won't hurt himself. The only problem I see with them is that the soft bitable cover doesn't go far enough up the handle. If it extended another half-inch, then there would be no problem at all. In any case, this is probably just a temporary phase that he'll eventually tire of. What next?Gary Peterson
B0018OKNT0 These spoons are great, because they're soft so baby can bite on it. They don't discolor like some of the other brands. Well made, and useful!
B0018OKNT0 They are the perfect handle size for my daughter to use and I love the soft BPA free silicone on the end.
B0018OKNT0 Compared to other baby spoons, this handle is shorter and the spoon is much more shallow - meaning it doesn't hold much food and there tends to be a lot of spillage.  prefer the munchkin ones.
B0018OKNT0 These spoons are great (and inexpensive, too!)  My baby loves them. They're not too big like most spoons. Perfect size.  Our baby is 5 months old and it's great for her soft gums. Easy to clean, A+++.
B0018OKNT0 I had some other spoons that we use to give our DS his medicines on because they are deep and we can dissolve his pills in them with some water.  But they were bad for feeding so I bought these, I bought because I thought they would be better for my DS who is 4 months and already teething.  Well not only are these better because they are softer but also because they aren't too deep.  My DS seems like he can shut his mouth on this and feel the food so he is able to take it in his mouth better using his gums and lips, this way I am not just trying to pour the cereal in his mouth.  PS I only started cereal because his reflux is so bad, and he wouldn't take cereal out of a bottle.  Plus he has fun trying to eat while we do!
B0018OKNT0 These spoons are perfect for baby's first meals. My daughter loves to gnaw on the plastic coating, and they protect her toothless gums. They can become quite slippery when the food gets all over of both of your hands, but that is expected. Just be careful and do not let your baby yank the spoon from your hand, which is easy when slippery, because she might gag herself. So far, I have put them in the dishwasher with no issues.
B0018OKNT0 The spoons are small, you cannot get a descent size scoop from the spoons. the colors are nice, and the spoons wont damage babys gums. i havent try any other products so far.
B0018OKNT0 i thought the handle will be longer but when this spoon arrived in mail it's not what i am expecting. now i have been using this spoon for a few months and i can say it has served its purpose. safe for baby's delicate gums because of the silicone but for me longer handle makes it easier to feed baby because sometimes i use this spoon then baby's hands knock it over and the food spills sometimes the spoon fell off my hands (just can't keep baby's hands still when she gets excited while i'm feeding her). wish handle is longer and everything will be perfect i have no complaint on the depth of spoon although it is more on the shallow side it's fine to use with baby food.
B0018OKNT0 Initially tried the Baeba infant spoons for my daughter. She was miserable, as the spoon was too big and deep for her. I tried the NUK Gerber spoon I received during my baby shower, and she loved it. I had to buy more!
B0018OKNT0 I use these to feed my 6 month old son.  They are the perfect size for his mouth.  And, because it comes with 2 spoons, he can practice feeding himself with one while I use the other one to make sure he gets enough to eat.
B0018OKNT0 The spoons are flat enough to where it is not difficult for our 5 month old to get the food off of them. The soft tips allow him to chew on the spoons.
B0018SUE9A These are great, I wear them at work to contain leaking. They are very soft and are not noticeable under the shirt (but I work as a nurse and wear scrubs so they're pretty baggy, I don't know how it would look like under a thin sleak shirt). They make my breasts warm and when I pump I feel it helps me pump better. I don't leak that much but occasionally I do and they contain small leaks perfectly. Amazing product!Pretty expensive but well worth it. Note that these are very big, they are supposed to cover the whole breast so if you have medium breasts buy size S.
B0018SUE9A I'm depressed. I bought these in hopes they were more substantial than the soft line. The description leads you to believe they would be. But alas, no, they are thinner, you can see the material through the wool fibers, unlike the soft line.  These are also more stretchy. And of course keep in mind how large these really are. I'm a solid C cup and when I'm full I'm easily a 36/38 D. These cover darn near my entire breast. Soooo I'm going to toss them in the washing machine with the burp cloths and see if I don't get what I'm looking for in the final product. Can't loose at this point.
B0018SUE9A If you leak heavily, there is no question about the fact that you need wool nursing pads. Cotton will get drenched within minutes and keep you wet and cold -- a feeling that can be very painful on your boobs. There are other wool pads out there, but I love the quality of these and the fact that they are organic! My skin is very sensitive and I tend to feel &#34;scratchy&#34; from most wool products, so I don't wear wool most of the time, but still found these to work great for me: they are incredibly soft, naturally anti-microbial, and they keep you warm  -- a feeling that your breasts will definitely appreciate while you're lactating. Occasionally, when I'm leaking heavily, they do get soaked, but they feel warm even then and they dry really fast as you wear them. I'm only using 2 pairs: one for around the house and another one that I keep dry for when I need to leave the house.
B0018SUE9A I have vasospasms in my breast, causing pain and blanching of the nipples. This made breastfeeding miserable, and even getting out of the shower was painful. I had tried everything--all the supplements I read about, all the tricks to keep the breast warm, keep the breast cool, etc., and nothing worked. Finally a lactation consultant recommended these, and literally in ONE day my problems were solved. I have honestly not had a day of pain since wearing these. I really can't believe it. So obviously, I can't recommend them enough. Even for those without any vasospasms, they are incredibly soft and comfy to wear as breast pads (way better than those paper ones, and larger than the cotton ones, which can leave an unsightly circle around your breasts that can be seen through clothing!).
B0018SUE9A First, these nursing pads work really well.  I tried Lansinoh and J&J; disposables and UnderKanppies and Bamboobies washables.  The disposables stuck to my nipples, and the other washables kept too much moisture against my nipples, causing them to itch.  Also, it was really hard to always make sure to wash the nursing pads, and I didn't want to make the investment to have 10 pairs just in case.These don't have to be washed but once in a loooong while.  I've been wearing mine for almost a month and STILL haven't washed them.  When I do, it's just a quick soak and then leave them out to dry.  So much easier!Also, I worried about the wool in the heat as I live in Houston, Texas.  So far, they haven't been a problem.  We've had about a week of 90+ degree days with high humidity, so I think that's a fair test.Sizing is tricky.  I tried the small and the x-small because I'm wearing a 32C.  The x-small fit inside my bras better, but I've always heard these are supposed to cover basically the whole breast, so I went with the small.  A little will peak out at the top/sides/bottom of my bra, but it's actually LESS lumpy than the x-small where you could see the circle of the pad.My supply has evened out, so I don't ALWAYS have to wear pads, but I do just in case.  I'm not sure how these would have performed when my milk first came in and I was soaking through my shirts every night, but I plan on using them with my next child to find out.  I like them that much, and I'm glad I CAN use them again.They may seem pricey, but you only need 2 pairs MAX, meaning ~$50.  You'd easily spend that in 3 months on disposables.  Twice or three times that on having enough pairs of the other types of washable pads.
B0018SUE9A My lactation consultant recommended wool pads after diagnosing me with Reynaud's. They definitely work well to keep me warm, but I find them a bit scratchy (I have extremely sensitive skin). I'm hoping with a few more washings with lanolin they may soften up some more (I've only had them a couple weeks so far).As for the size, I'm a 36D and the medium is the correct size. They're not like the disposables that only cover the nipple/areola. These are actually supposed to cover the entire breast. They do very well at keeping warmth in, which is why I got them. Personally, I've never had any trouble with their absorbancy, but I'm not a heavy leaker.
B0018SUE9A I got this in Original and Ekstra sizes.  At first I thought the Ekstra were too thick, but when I wore the original pads out during the day I leaked through them.  So now I wear the Original at night (when if I leak through them it's ok) and they work great.  I wear the Ekstra during the day when I go out.  Both pads work well, but there are less expensive pads out there that probably work just as well.  Loveybums.com has pads at half the cost.
B0018SUE9A I was in a great amount of pain and scoured the internet for a viable solution.  This was the one that worked for my vasospasms!  These pads are large, but they are meant to be so that they cover most of your breast.  I am a DD and the size small worked great.  Doesn't show under clothing.  Highly recommend these!
B0018SUE9A Im a new mom, so I'm new to breast feeding, and needless to say I was very sore.  Between the soothies and these nursing pads, I was able to heal much faster.  These pads kept the breast warm to keep the breast ready to nurse and also seemed to prevent the nipples from cracking.  It really is amazing that you don't have to wash them very often.  Wool is a fantastic product for nursing, nursery bedding and diapering.  These pads are huge though so be prepared, I bought small and medium and I swear the medium will cover my face.  In the end I had one C cup and one D cup so I used the medium to cover the entire breast, and love love love them.
B0018SUE9A Stupid purchase. These pads feel scratchy on the breasts. I wear a lot of wool, even as undershirts, and the wool is ok to the hand. It would be fine as a sweater but pressed up against the breasts is not so comfortable. They don't seem to absorb that well either, and the milk dries and solidifies on the pad, so it does need to be washed periodically. I think a small piece of an old flannel pillowcase would be better (more absorbent).
B0018SUE9A I tried the Ekstra style first, and I definitely prefer the Ekstra, for me.I have minimal leaking during the day, but I leak quite a bit overnight, and excessively during letdown! These original pads are much too thin to contain my night-time and letdown leaking, and too thin even for minimal daytime leaking...even normal cotton pads are better at containing the milk. However, the Ekstra pads work really well for any day or night time leaking, and are *almost* enough for my letdown leaking, so I just tuck a disposable pad or washcloth on the opposite side when baby is nursing if I'm not at home, and if I'm at home, I just use Philips AVENT Comfort Breast Shell Set to save the milk that is otherwise lost from letdown.SIZING: I had a difficult time determining sizing for myself. I'm currently a 36DD while nursing, so I started with a Medium Ekstra, and it is ideal for overnight. It covers the majority of my breast, and still fits into bras and shelf bras well enough. I then got a Medium Original and a Small Ekstra to try, for daytime use, and while the Medium Original was insufficient for leaking or letdown, it was also odd to me that it seemed more difficult to fit in my bras, even though it is the same diameter and actually much thinner...I'm really not sure why that is. The Small Ekstra is perfect for daytime leaking, and the sizing seems pretty nice: it doesn't cover my whole breast, but it covers the full front, and stays put very nicely in bras. If I were doing it all over again, I would keep the ones I got: Small Ekstra for daytime, Medium Ekstra for nighttime. I use the Medium Original just as a temporary use for if I'm washing one of the sets.Oh, and I don't know why people complain about maintaining these! It's so easy to wash these using the LANAcare Lanolin Wool Soap, and it's amazing to not have to wash them all the time like the cotton pads, and my nipples feel so much better using these rather than cotton or disposable pads!
B0018SUE9A Purchased these pads since I suffer from Raynaud's. I usually wear disposables, which barely get wet (I've even worn the same pair overnight AND next day without a single leak!). Well, popped these on and what do you know, I've soaked through the pad, bra and my shirt while feeding off the other side. I do not have a very strong let down and these pads did nothing to catch the minimal milk flow. Really upset that I wasted nearly 30 dollars on a product that doesn't even work for a few minutes, much less an entire day.ETA: Contacted the company, and they were very responsive and sent me a pair of Ekstra (the thicker pads) immediately. Great customer service!
B0018SUE9A Really want these to work for me.  I read so many positive reviews, but they sre simply no good for me.  I put them on immediately after having our fifth baby.  They felt great! Soft, warm, very natural feeling and looking.  Then my milk came in.  My husband was thinking of building an ark to save us from the flood that was coming from under my shirt!  The pads leaked thru.  The pads leaked around the edges.  Milk was literally dripping down my chest as i lay in bed nursing my sweet baby.  When i removed the pads, i expected them to be saturated.  No.  Just in the spot that was directly over my nipple.  So, not only did the pads leak thru, they somehow repelled the milk and shunted it out of my bra, hence the milk was dripping across my chest.I decided to give the pads another go once my milk supply stabilized and the engorgement had resolved.  Well, the pads leaked in the same manner with the very first feed.I emailed the company and they did not respond.  So, since i foolishly bought two pairs plus the lanolin soap...i'm out $60.
B0018T09ZI When I first heard of wool nursing pads, I thought, \"Yowch!\" After all, who'd want to put something scratchy like wool on such a tender area? But I heard so many good things about them that I decided to give them a try, and I'm very glad I did!The merino wool is incredibly soft (not a bit scratchy) and very absorbent. The pads are HUGE and look a bit intimidating when you first see them, but their size is supposed to help prevent plugged ducts by keeping the breasts warm. I find that the size is actually nice and keeps them from leaving little tell-tale circles that show through your shirt, like some smaller pads do.But the biggest benefit to wool is the lanolin, which keeps you from having to wash the pads every time you wear them. (Of course, you WILL have to wash them -- just not nearly as frequently as other reusable pads.) As one site explains it, \"As the wool absorbs moisture, lanolin is converted to lanolin-soap, which has an antibacterial effect.\" You'll need to use a special wool-friendly soap and occasionally relanolize the pads (you can do this with Lansinoh or other lanolin products). That's a bit of a pain, in my opinion, but definitely worth it to cut down on the washing.If you're a heavy leaker (like me), you'll definitely want the Ekstra pads. The regular ones are nice, but I found that, at least at the beginning, they just weren't thick enough for me.
B0018T09ZI Though these seem expensive I opted to try them when I was struggling with vasospasms.  Rumor had it that the warmth these provided would help - it did - but then I fell in love with them for other reasons.  1) they are super soft -you don't think wool will be - but they are 2) they actually conceal better under clothes - this is counter intuitive because these things are HUGE - but because they are huge they lay better - warning - they will also make you look bigger as they are a little thicker then regular nursing pads (some are thicker then others - these are about as thick as bamboonies overnights). 3) they are sooo easy.  I had mine 3-5 weeks before I washed them (and I'm not sure I needed to - but I wanted to wash my other pair - more on that later).  You do have to re lanolize (which scared me) - but I googled it and found that I could just mix some water, lanolin (great use for my Lanisnoh lanilon that I didn't like to use on my breasts), and a few drops of baby wash.  You then just mix it with water and massage it into the pads and then air dry.  I wear these EVERY day.I was at a boutique in town and found a different brand (now I can't remember the brand) - of wool breast pads - and I wanted a second pair - so I got them.  They were about half the price - and now I know why.  They are not nearly as soft - they are actually a little rigid.  I haven't decided if I hate them enough to get a second pair of These ones or not - They recommend you let the pair air at least once a day so I wear one pair at night and one pair during the day.  I have been doing this now for 5 weeks and I love it.. I'm not sure I'll ever go back to regular disposables or cloth...
B0018T09ZI I am a heavy leaker but I love this nursing pads!  I got 2 pairs and I never leak through and they do not make you hot or itchy.
B0018T09ZI For the first month or so I used these, they did itch, so I wore small cotton nursing pads under them. But after a couple of washes using lanolin soap, they were soft enough for me to wear alone. I don't know if they are to thank, but I had fewer plugged ducts once I started using these pads. They don't show much under clothes either.
B0018T09ZI I was really looking forward to make this ones go along well with me...sadly that wasn't the case, my skin felt so itchy with this ones. Maybe because I have dry skin in general but I liked the fact that these had the lanolin and keep it warm. Also, I didn't feel they were sticky like the reusable Avent ones I bought.
B0018T09ZI I used these pads for my first born after trying all sorts of other reusable pads I'd leak right through and look forward to using them for my second from day one.  I have one pair.  I used them as daytime pads for at least a year and they are in perfect condition still. Yes, they're very large but I appreciated the coverage. No obvious line from the pad shown through the shirt and I felt that the coverage helped with mastitis.  I didn't have itch issues and do have wool itch issues with some wool.  I let them air each night and used a good quality prefold diaper for my leaking at night (sometimes having to change in out during the night).  I rarely had to clean them (like every 4 weeks).  Just made sure to air overnight, use lanolin soap and spray with lanolin when needed.  I'd get a second pair for overnight but prefer not to wear a bra overnight.  If you are a heavy leaker, I definitely recommend the EKSTRA, I never had a leak although I didn't find them until after my heaviest leaking and spraying in the first months (I did continue to be a heavy leaker though).
B0018T09ZI I thought I fell into the &#34;normal&#34; category for the regular absorbancy and Small &#34;fits  most&#34; sizing. Not so much. I bought two pairs of the size small regular and they don't do enough. I leak a lot if I just wear one pair at a time, so I have to wear both. Kinda defeats the purpose. Then, I bought this pair of the Ekstra and they're much better. I still use the other two sets to double up and then they seem to work. I wish I would have spent the money on two pairs of Ekstra, but I'm hoping my supply levels off to where I won't need to wear both. My son is 4.5 months, so I'm not sure if that'll happen anytime soon. Just for reference, I'm now 36D and the Medium fit just perfectly.
B0018T09ZI These are very absorbent. I wear these at night and they do wonders.  I would recommend to any nursing mom.
B0018T09ZI I bought these pads in Ekstra and Original sizes.  I thought the Ekstra were too thick at first, but after wearing them they were perfect for wearing for a full day out of the house.  The original size was good for overnight when it didn't matter if I leaked through them.  The Ekstra size is good for daily use.  I would try both sizes to see what works for you.  The only complaint I have is the price - loveybums.com has organic wool pads for half the price.
B0018T09ZI not comfy, not so absorbant, better to just use a piece of flannel, the milk dries and hardens on the pad
B0018T09ZI I bought 2 pairs of these along with Bamboobies and these are always the first ones I go to grab. They are so soft and absorbent!  I purchased x-small and was a 34B pre-pregnancy and probably a C cup now.  I think they definitely run on the bigger side.
B0018T09ZI I wish I didn't purchase these nursing pads. They are expensive, but I thought I'd finally find nursing pads that work well for overnight use. However, I leaked through these gigantic wool pads when I used them overnight. Instead of the milk spreading through the whole nursing pad, it just leaked right through so that most of the pad was dry except the one spot where the milk was leaking. On top of that they are not comfortable. They are very bulky and not soft-- they made me itchy. I tried washing them with wool soap and curing them with lanolin like I do my wool diaper covers, but they still did not perform well. I finally did end up finding something soft and absorbent enough to handle my nighttime leaking-- washcloths! Too bad I didn't figure that out before buying these.
B0018T09ZI So I am a heavy leaker overnight and during letdown, with minimal to moderate daytime leaking, and I am a 36DD while breastfeeding. So I decided to try the Medium Ekstra first, for overnight.The Ekstra pads work really well for any day or night time leaking, and are *almost* enough for my letdown leaking, so I just tuck a disposable pad or washcloth on the opposite side when baby is nursing if I'm not at home, and if I'm at home, I just use Philips AVENT Comfort Breast Shell Set to save the milk that is otherwise lost from letdown on the breast baby isn't currently nursing from.SIZING: I had a difficult time determining sizing for myself. I'm currently a 36DD while nursing, so I started with a Medium Ekstra, and it is ideal for overnight. It covers the majority of my breast, and still fits into bras and shelf bras well enough. I then got a Medium Original and a Small Ekstra to try, for daytime use, and while the Medium Original was insufficient for leaking or letdown, it was also odd to me that it seemed more difficult to fit in my bras, even though it is the same diameter and actually much thinner...I'm really not sure why that is. The Small Ekstra is perfect for daytime leaking, and the sizing seems pretty nice: it doesn't cover my whole breast, but it covers the full front, and stays put very nicely in bras. If I were doing it all over again, I would keep the ones I got: Small Ekstra for daytime, Medium Ekstra for nighttime. I use the Medium Original just as a temporary use for if I'm washing one of the sets.Oh, and I don't know why people complain about maintaining these! It's so easy to wash these using the LANAcare Lanolin Wool Soap, and it's amazing to not have to wash them all the time like the cotton pads, and my nipples feel so much better using these rather than cotton or disposable pads!
B0018V2VEI This blanket is the perfect size for carrying around or putting in the car seat with your child. I was looking for a satin sided blanket that my baby could carry with her without dragging on the floor. This blanket is just right for that. It's super soft on both sides and seems well made. If you're looking for a large blankie this is not the one. This is a 1/4 of a larger blankie, if it was folded in fours this would be the corner if it.Pros:Smaller size so it doesn't drag on the floorSuperior softnessFull satin sideCons:None that I can think of
B0018V2VEI This one made us laugh. We wanted our little one to have one amazing blanket for Christmas and I must have over looked that this is the tiniest blanket in the world!! We opened the package and burst out loud with laughter. If your baby is crazy small, this is the right choice for you. Then you will need to upgrade to a wash cloth!!
B0018V2VEI This extra soft blanket is very cute, kind of small but very cute and cuddley for babys first blanky. I love it.
B0018V2VEI I guess it's my fault for not reading the size HOWEVER \"Elegant Baby Plush Microfiber Blankie - Hot Pink\" leads you to believe you are buying a blanket for a baby, not a baby doll.
B0018V2VEI I thought a lot before writing my review about this blanket. it is totally a waste of money. it might be suitable for a small chiwawa. Not for a baby at all. Very thin and very very small. If i have a baby girl who has a Barby doll. it might be useful for her.Do not waste your money like me. Buy something worthy.
B0018V2VEI Bought this as a binky for my best friends baby and I though it would be a little bit bigger but for ten dollars I guess I should have known but it really cute for a binky blanket or just a newborn blanket!
B0018V2VEI As my title suggests, this is NOT a full sized blanket. I, however, wasn't paying attention when I ordered it. When I took it out of the packaging and saw how small it is I was bummed. But, that's my own fault for not paying attention. I just hope you don't make that same mistake.Reviewing the product for what it actually is, I give it 5 stars! It's awesome. It's super soft and cozy. It's 20x20 size and fits in my 3 month old daughter's car seat and swing perfectly. I know she will love it as she grows up too. I plan to buy the full sized version when I get done with this review.
B0018V2VEI I'm really happy with this security blanket.  I've looked at tons at local baby stores to high end specialty shops, and this is high quality satin and microfiber, for a very reasonable price.  The blanket specifications clearly state how large the blanket is, so some of the other bad reviews didn't make sense to me.  Read the dimensions, this is NOT a full sized blanket, but is the perfect security blanket for baby girl.  It washes well, and seems to be holding up ok.  Might even buy 1-2 more just to have for her.
B0018V2VEI I guess it's more my fault for not reading the dimensions before buying, but this was much smaller than it looks in the pictures.
B0018V2VEI I ordered this last week and it came to my house within 2 days. I knew that it was a blankie when I ordered it so I was expecting it. I got the hot pink color and it is very cute and very soft. The uderside is a satin type material which is also very smooth and soft. The perfect blanket for little ones to carry around which is the reason why I bought it for my baby on the way.
B0018V2VEI This is the perfect blankie for our daughter! It's so incredibly soft and satin backed and trimmed. I wish it was also available in 30X40 size, not just 20X20. I'll definitely be ordering more for our house, and for baby shower gifts too!
B0018V2VEI Great product, i will be buying a couple more. great size for my 21 month old girl. She can carry it around without stepping on it.
B0018V2VEI This blanket is TINY! I made the mistake of reading a good few reviews and purchasing. I should have read the size deminsions! It's about the size of a burp cloth, maybe a little smaller than a small receiving blanket! I was expecting a decent size blanket, you can't even wrap a newborn up in this size blanket.Yes it's good quality but very small!
B0018V2VEI I read the other reviews so I saw the measurements beforehand.  This is the perfect size for little ones that love carrying blankets around plus it is very soft.  When I received the blanket today I handed it to my little guy and he started laughing and cuddling it right away---he loves it.
B0018V2VEI I bought this for my nephew as a baby shower gift. My kids are addicted to theirs because of the silky edge and back. They sleep with it all night and my son drags his around the house everywhere. Good quality lasts a long time through constant use. Highly recommended for little ones.
B0018V2VEI It's cute and it's soft but it's really small. It thought it was more like a regular sized baby blanket and it's more like lovey sized blanket. If that's what you're looking for it would be great, it not I'd look elsewhere.
B0018V2VEI Our baby wouldn't take a passy and we needed something that would comfort him in the night and when we took him on vacation or to strange places.  He has loved this \"blankie\" since we gave it to him when he was 3 months old.  we have it in blue.
B0018V2VEI You can't wrap a baby doll in it.  It's not for wrapping newborns.  It's so small, I do not know what it is good for. Maybe a lap cloth.
B0018V2VEI I bought this about 9 months ago and the product description stated 20\"x20\", so I'm not clear why so many people are still having problems with the size of the blanket, but for us it was perfect. I would term it more of a blankie, especially given the silky smooth side and size, but again this is what I was shooting for - Something my son could use while he sucked his thumb and carry around himself while we were out and about without dragging it on the ground or dirty floor.I know some people have had problems with the polyester \"fuzzy\" side getting stiff in the dryer, but since we dry on low heat we've never had that problem. Though, I would suggest making sure all the soap is out before drying as I made that mistake once and the whole blanket felt a bit rough even though the rest of the clothes from that load seemed fine. Re-rinsing and drying fluffed it right back up.I bought the bright blue and though it's not as dark as it looks on my computer it really is a gorgeous color. I had hoped that this would be \"the one\" my son latched onto as his one true lovey because it's so beautiful, but sadly for me he chose the even smaller lionheart white one I bought him. Cheaper and better for my pocket book when replacing, but definitely not as soft or aesthetically pleasing as this one.
B0018V2VEI The term 'blanket' is not an accurate description here.It's far too small to be used as a blanket - I use it as a burp cloth (just covers my shoulder).  It looks like a rushed-job from the creative department of someone's kitchen table. Neither plush or elegant. Missed opportunity!!
B0018V2VEI In my top 15 things to buy for baby. My son absolutely loves this.  He started using at 8 weeks and loves the soft textures and snuggles it to his face constantly. He can use this to put himself to sleep on his own by snuggling it next to his face to snuggle and block out any light that may be bothering him. It is NOT a baby blanket as it is too small for that. We call it our baby's &#34;snuggly&#34; and it is always with him. Buy two of them for when one is in the wash. Has held up to several washings so far.
B0018V2VEI so soft, holds up in the wash.  my baby loves it and so do I.
B0018Z06P0 We cloth diaper our daughter & did not want to spend the money or create the waste of regular swim diapers.  I found this cute diaper & thought it would be perfect!Because this diaper only keeps out solids, it is very easy to wash.  While on vacation I simply rinsed this diaper with clean water while also rinsing my daughter's swim suit.  We have never actually had to deal with solid waste in this diaper, so I cannot comment on the effectiveness of this diaper.So many pools require children to wear swim diapers so it is easy to have this diaper available.  We actually had to put our daughter in this diaper after she was potty trained because a pool at a hotel required all children under 3 years old to wear a swim diaper.  It was so nice not to waste money on diapers that wouldn't even be used.My daughter is quite thin so I am grateful that the velcro straps have the possibility of overlapping.  This diaper has a weight range of 8 pounds so when my daughter was on the lighter end we could pull it tighter & then secure it more loosely when she got bigger.The pattern on this diaper is adorable.  This is an added bonus!
B0018Z06P0 This swim diaper does its job well, the velcro tabs are strong and make for a great adjustable fit, and (best of all)--the diaper is true to size! My 20-pounder with chunky thighs can still wear the Medium we bought him. LOVE it!
B0018Z06P0 This is our second summer using a Bummi's swim diaper! I'm so thankful that we don't have to pay for expensive disposables!! This diaper works great! It is so cute, that sometimes I don't even put a swimsuit over it!! And it fits my daughter very well- seems to be comfortable!!! No swim diaper will contain urine (can't be completely waterproof), but they are designed to contain bowel movements. No leaks with this one so far!!
B0018Z06P0 We have tried multiple swim diapers and this one is (by far) the best. It holds poop in, in case of an accident and the fit is always perfect because its adjustable like a diaper. I wish we would have saved the trouble and money on all the other swim diapers we tried and bought this one first!
B0018Z06P0 Compared to the Kushies Swim Diaper, the Bummis was much smaller, even though I bought the size suggested for my son's weight (just under 24lbs). The elastic on the Bummis is very strong, which might have contributed to me not being able to wrap it completely around my son's waist to my satisfaction. I didn't want to cut off circulation, but I didn't trust that it wouldn't fall off either. I really wanted to like it, but it just didn't work for us.
B0018Z06P0 This has been a great swim diaper for us. I love that it opens with velcro like this-- I've seen other parents really struggling to get swim diapers off wet, wriggling toddler. Ours is really easy to put on and take off.It's important to note that it doesn't hold in pee-- I was really sad sitting in the waiting area, holding baby, waiting for swimming to start!My son is 22 lbs 4 oz (from doctor today) and has been wearing the large (22-30lbs) for a while-- so if anything, it's possible this runs a little small.
B0018Z06P0 Love this swim diaper. We use cloth diapers normally, so did not want to use disposable swim diapers. Our daughter goes to swim class at the Y so is swimming all year round. In the previous size, I bought the only reusable swim diaper available locally but it pulled on and off like underwear. It contained the accidents fine, but my husband really didn't like trying to change her after, which could get messy. So, I ordered this one because it velcros like a diaper to make changing messy diapers easier. She has not actually stooled in this diaper since we got it, so I can't be certain how well it would work for it's intended purpose. However, it does fit well and seems comfortable for her. It is also very cute. It does not hold urine, but no swim diaper (even the disposable) does.
B0018Z06P0 I previously purchased the pull on/off kind. These are SO much easier to get on and off. Imagine if your kid poops and you have to pull it off a squirmy, wet kid. I'd rather have these diaper style. Luckily my son has never pooped while swimming, so it hasn't truly been tested, but in the water the suit will puff up with air so that I can see air is locked in there. If the air is locked in I assume it would hold solids. I'm on my second suit and would recommend.
B0018Z06P0 The color is a little lighter than shown, but sense I put swim trunks over my son's diaper I didn't care.  We have used this diaper in the past in a smaller size and were so happy we bought the bigger size for this year.  It does great containing the poo even when swimming!  I rinsed the diaper and wash with our normal clothes and was pleased that the mesh didn't stain!  The velcro is strong so remember to fasten it back before washing or it might pick your other clothes or the diaper itself.
B0018Z06P0 These worked great for my twins.  I was able to use it with them before 9 lbs due to the velcro.
B0018Z06P0 This diaper is super cute and good quality.  Very easy to put on and take off.  We take him swimming all the time and it seems to be much better than disposable swim diapers.
B0018Z06P0 One of my baby-related email subscriptions had sent out an email concerning swim diapers on the precise day I was pondering such an issue.  After the email's dismay for disposable swim diapers, I followed its recommendations of two brands of swim diapers.  Considering that my little girl isn't yet 3 months, I paid special attention to the \"small baby!\" advice and purchased Bummis Swimmi.And I am so glad I did.What made this work for my tiny girl is the Velcro nature.  This diaper can be adjusted like nobody's business, allowing me to secure it around her little thighs--a reassuring feature that kept me confident that all poop would be kept in.That poop stayed right in the diaper.As for the cleaning?  So simple and easy.  A rinse and a wash and the diaper was ready for another swim.  Is it bulky?  Nope, it makes the most of being a relatively thin mesh covering with an adorable pattern (I went with the Bubbles) and fit nicely under my girl's baby swimsuit.Highly recommended, especially for small babies.
B0018Z06P0 Adorable! As an aquatics professional, I was looking for something that would meet health code (hint, disposable swimmers DO NOT), but also not hold a TON of water, and be comfortable for me little guy! This does all of that! We did put a cloth prefold inside, just in case, but the fit was great, even though he's still a little shy of the recommended weight, and it was easy to put on. Highly recommend!
B0018Z06P0 It has velcro which is great for adjusting the size. It fits snug around the legs so that any poop is contained (we've never had a poop in a swim diaper but it seems like it would keep it in there rather well).
B0018Z06P0 This diaper is big on my 22 lb boy. I probably should have bought a medium. I like the pattern, it is super cute. I like the mesh inside because it distinguishes it as a swim diaper in the bin versus my other true diaper covers. The aplix seems like it will last a long time. What I don't like about it is that I can't put it on my kiddo, put him in the car and drive to swim lessons or the beach because I don't trust that it will contain pee in transit. So, you really should put the diaper on the kiddo once you are ready to get in the water and not before. It isn't that I dislike it, I just don't feel all wow about this one.
B0018Z06P0 I LOVED this swimmi diaper. We used it all summer and plan to buy the next size up for next summer. These diapers work every bit as well as the disposable swim diapers, but cost about as much as one pack of the disposables. If you spend much time in the water you will go through quite a few diapers and could end up spending a fortune. The diaper is adjustable and fits really well. The only drawback is that it isnt water tight, so if your child pees before you get in the water, you will feel it! A small price to pay for a huge savings though. Buy this diaper!
B0018Z06P0 Thankfully we haven't had to contain a bowel movement yet, but we've been swimming 3 times, and this diaper has worked well. My daughter is 9 months, 20 lbs.
B0018Z06P0 The Good:- Initially I hated the velcro or hook and loop closure. The first time I took my 6month old to the pool in it, the hooks caught on my suit and the diaper almost came off when I handed him to my husband in the pool. Yikes! However, I learned to close the velcro more carefully, have never had a problem again and can make the diaper fit my strangely elongated infant. For comparison his iPlay swim diaper only started to fit after he became mobile and his thigh size began to match his waist; he's also 1.5lbs above the weight on the sizing and the iPlay fits perfectly. The Bummis has fit well for 5months now.- The velcro closure means never having to pull up a wet swim diaper, which I think might be impossible. It also makes taking off a wet swim diaper easier.- The thinner material is great. Pee leaks through all swim diapers. Bummis hasn't wasted time trying to pad the situation. And that means, you don't waste time waiting for the diaper to dry. The other reusable swim diapers we have with padding take much longer to dry, about 2 days hanging indoors. (And since it's impossible to pull up a wet swim diaper, it means you need at least 3 swim diapers for once daily swimming.)- The lack of padded means that you don't have to carry home a soaking wet wad.The Bad:- Fading! Fading! Fading! Perhaps we've loved this swim diaper too much. However, I think bathing suits should last more than 20 uses without fading. I've never had any fade very noticeably before. For a more direct comparison, I've used my swimsuit every time I've taken my baby swimming. He's used primarily his Bummis swim diaper, but some other reusables and a disposable. In other words, his Bummis swim diaper has been used less often than my bathing suit. My bathing suit is not faded at all, while his has lost the majority of the color on his bumm. The Bummis blog mentioned high chlorine levels causing fading. However, I find it strange that my son has been exposed to more chlorine on his bumm than his front or between his legs. Plus, our primary pool is a saltwater pool.The Neutral:- We have never had to deal with a poop diaper in the pool. Honestly, I'm not sure any of the swim diapers would handle one. I think that the customizable fit of the Bummis would make containing the poop most likely. However, an extremely liquid bowel movement (for example, what might happen if an infant starts consuming large quantities of pool water) might be better held with some absorbing layers.Conclusion: I really want to order another Bummis Reusable Swim Diaper. But at the moment, I am contemplating an iPlay instead because it currently fits my son and because we will be spending a lot of time in the color-fading sun this summer.
B0018Z06P0 This swim diaper does not have the bulky liner inside which I think is great.  It fits well with room to grow and is very easy to put on and take off.
B0018Z06P0 I was thrilled when I found this swim diaper as my son is so skinny. We got our first one when he was just 3 months old. It was also easier to get on and off than the pull-on swim diapers which was great when he was really little, its just like changing a regular diaper. The velcro and elastic was high quality and never wore out through all the swim adventures and cycles in the washing machine. It's still in good shape (minus some fading) and I plan on using it again for baby #2. We bought these until he figured out how to pull it off. Now we use the Iplay swim diaper which we also really like but sadly they are not adjustable at the waist, making finding the right fit a bit tricky. I gave 4 stars for 2 reasons: 1, the patterned fabric does fade in the chlorine. 2, they do not make an appropriate diaper for older kids who have figured out how to pull the tabs on these ones. I'd love to see a pull on/adjustable waist hybrid.
B0018Z06P0 I bought two of these when we signed our 6 month old up for swim classes.  He's worn these twice a week for the past 8 months.  They are great!!! Again for those that complain that they don't absorb urine..------- SWIM DIAPERS ARE NOT SUPPOSE TO ABSORB URINE!!! That would totally defeat the point of a diaper for swimming.  My boy did a number 2 only a couple of times and this swim suit caught it all just fine.  Nice snug fit and they wash incredibly well.  The velcro gets a little tattered, but honestly, for 8 months of weekly washing, they are so well made.  These are very appropriate for an infant/early toddler to wear alone without being bulky.  He received so many compliments on them.  He's now a bit bigger and wearing little boy trunks, but we put these underneath the trunks to catch any potties, because they will hold so much better than the trunks----they are that good!! Get them, you wont be disappointed.
B0018Z06P0 So far so good with this swim diaper.  We bought it for our 11 month old and it sits well, but there is room to grow!  We have used it alone and also with a disposable swim diaper underneath.  I recommend washing it in a laundry garmet bag though, the Velcro is very strong.
B0018Z06P0 Really dont know what I would improve.  Nice mesh lining, huge Velcro area for personalized fit, cute colors.  Machine wash and super-fast dry.  I use it with a disposable liner and haven't had any problems.Definitely recommend over any swim diaper that has to be pulled up and down.  Now if I could find Velcro baby bathing suit, I'd be set!
B0018Z06P0 My daughter used to get diaper rash from disposable swim diapers.  Also, the cost ends up being high per diaper for disposables.  This is a great solution- washable, breathable- no more diaper rash and a money saver!  i also love the fish pattern.  I only wish they had an XL Size.  This is up to 30 lbs.  My 21 month old is now 30+ pounds and this is getting a bit tight.
B0018Z06P0 Fit that my LO can grow into.  The velcro makes the fit perfect for him.  Haven't had any &#34;big&#34; accidents yet but the fit is snug and close so I'm not anticipating any problems.  Need more designs though :)
B0018Z06P0 I almost love this item. The fit was some what large because it didn't &#34;stick&#34; tightly to my baby's back, but he was on the very low end of the weight range that I purchased for. Otherwise it's great!
B0018Z06P0 So we had high hopes for this swim diaper. Our son is 18.5lbs and wears a M. Unfortunately, the M does not fit too well, it gets all saggy and the other day we had an accident in the wading pool and voila EVERYTHING came out of the diaper. It did not contain anything. If you are looking for something to have more elastic around the legs and something that fits snug try Finis swim diaper or iPlay. Supposedly those work better...this one did not cut it for us.
B0018Z06P0 My baby weighs only 20 lb and these fit him well. We've gone swimming a handful of times and I just make sure to rinse them when we're done. We have not had any poop episodes yet, so can't comment on that! Would definitely recommend these!
B0018Z06P0 Yes they work to contain accidents!!! Great sizing too due to the Velcro design- you can use before and after the weight limit.Only down side is that they stick out from girl's swim suits (bc they offer so much coverage) and the pattern often shows through- but this isn't a fashion show and the product does it's job and does it well!
B0018Z06P0 So far, so good. I love that this swim diaper velcros on his body like a diaper as opposed to the kind that just slip on - you can be sure it's a snug fit every time. The cute patterns always get compliments at our local Y! It's easy to wash, just be sure not to put in dryer! Follow the instructions carefully.
B0018Z06P0 We used these on our 12 month old and they worked great at the beach and pool. We never had to put them to the full test, but they fit him well and seemed comfortable. We ordered a medium and they fit fine.
B0018Z06P0 I bought this for our then 2+ month old.  It still fits and she is 5 months (90% percentile for height & weight) old and still wears it.  She's never leaked out of it and it fits great...probably will go to another size soon though.  Highly recommend the Bummis swim diaper.
B0018Z06P0 I have tried this diaper, the i play pull-on diaper, and disposables.  The bummies has the best fit and is the easiest to put on/off (the others pull on and off over chunky baby thighs).  I also love the turtle pattern.
B0018Z06P0 So, my 10 month old son has a hilariously tiny rear. Disposable swim diapers were a waste of money because the smallest size STILL doesn't fit and those suckers aren't adjustable. Try enjoying a beautiful day in Hawaii while constantly yanking your son's swim diaper back up and praying nothing... escapes.Obviously, we like this because it's adjustable and will fit for a pretty good amount of time. Living in Hawaii, swimming year round, means that it makes sense to use a cloth swim diaper instead of buying regular swim diapers over and over. Plus, we've found out through horrible personal experience that it's REALLY good to buy a swim diaper that uses tabs. Think about it. You have to pull the other diapers down their legs. And if you pulled them out of the pool because they left you a little present.... Yikes.
B0018Z06P0 I had bought a size medium Bummi Swim Diaper last summer and wound up never using it. This year, since my son is a year older, I purchased a new swim diaper.  After reading reviews, I went with an iPlay swim diaper, size X-large (my son is 19 months and 28 lbs which, according to the sizing and all the reviewers, it should have fit.)  I stupidly didn't have him try it on and this morning, on the day of his first swim lesson, found that it was too small and I couldn't snap it around his waist.  I remembered that I had the old Bummi laying around and prayed it might be usable - it was a tad small, but because of the velcro, I was able to make it work and fit around his waist.  The diaper worked GREAT, the velcro held well and I'm nor ordering a couple more Bummi's in the appropriate size.
B0018Z06P0 This diaper does the trick in terms of holding in baby poop when our daughter does her business in the pool. It is not our favorite swim diaper. We like the gender-neutral pattern so we can use the diaper if our next child is a boy, but the design has some challenges...Here are some notes to consider:It's very hard to get the Velcro straps off--they really need a pull-tab to help us get them undone. Instead, it's a two-handed and very awkward job that annoys our daughter during a time she's already uncomfortable--wet and cold. After we get our daughter out of the pool, we would love to be able to just slip off the diaper and take her into the shower with us to clean off the chlorine. However, since the Velcro tabs are so tough to undo, we have to take her somewhere soft to lie her down to get the tabs undone--or it's a two-person job at the shower door.Also, the Velcro tabs and hemming seem to chafe her skin slightly, as she has red marks when we remove the diaper. I'd love a softer hemming so that her delicate skin doesn't get irritated--the water makes it more sensitive, after all.The fabric is not typical swimsuit material. Instead, it's almost like a tightly-woven upholstery fabric. As a result, it holds a big puddle of water when we lift her from the water. It takes a moment to let her drip dry before we can hold her in our arms--unless we are prepared to get ourselves and our towels drenched. So, basically we use an extra towel to catch the water that pools in her bottom, that towels gets drenched, then we use a fresh dry towel to dry her off. We didn't have this water pooling issue with other swim diapers.The fabric has held its color and seems very durable, which is awesome since we are using it in chlorine water. Standard swimsuit fabric tends to lose its elasticity when exposed to chlorine after awhile and I can tell this suit will hold up.All in all, I'd recommend this diaper. Just know you'll have to have patience and an extra towel when you use it.
B0018Z06P0 No issues with it. Even held poop. Baby loved it we put it under his wet suit. Was comfortable and easy to clean. If there is poop all you need to do it put it under running water.
B0018Z06P0 We have a swimming pool downstairs and absolutely love this.  keeps the poop in and the design is very cute.  I like that you can take it off like a diaper instead of pulling it down, which would be a mess with a soiled diaper.
B0018Z06P0 This is the first cloth swim diaper we've tried, but we'll definitely be buying the next size up when it's time. We used it for five weeks of swim lessons without needing to test its ability to hold solids, but it fits snugly enough that I don't think it would be a problem. I like how thin the material is, so the diaper fits easily under swim trunks (we have the clown fish pattern, and it's also cute on its own). My son is currently about 20 pounds with chunky thighs, and the medium still fits well and has for over a month. This is a much better deal than disposable swim diapers!
B0018Z06P0 Used all last summer - love this suit. Velcro makes for easy on/off. No leaks or mess in the pool. No brainer!
B0018Z06P0 This swimsuit/diaper is really nice. It is so thin, and fits well. I bought a medium for my son, who weighs 18 lbs, and it fits great. I also bought a small for a friend who's having a baby, and it looks perfect for a 7-12 lb baby. It is very cute, and seems very well-made. You don't need a separate diaper insert, or cover, or anything - it's all one piece.
B0018Z06P0 I haven't used these much yet because the swim season is only beginning, but they seem to be well-constructed and will suit our needs perfectly. As other reviewers have said, I think these swim diapers will work best when worn over a disposable swim diaper. My swim club rules require babes in diapers to wear both. So these are perfect for us. If you plan to use it as a stand-alone swim diaper, you may want to order a size down. I love the fabric on the outside. It's a canvas-like fabric, which is preferable to the stiff, crinkly plastic-type fabric you find on a lot of swim diapers. The print is nice because you can pair these with a lot of different rash guards - blue, pink, yellow, etc. The diaper has a mesh lining inside, which is a non-issue for me due to the fact that my kids will wear disposables under them. Some kids might not like it. If you've ever had a kid poop in one of the reusable swim diapers that pull-up, rather than fasten in the front, you'll understand how nice the velcro is.
B0018Z06P0 I've tried MANY swim diapers, and this is one of the better ones. It's not the cutest, but it is much more functional than any others that are available on Amazon. The velcro can get a bit scratchy.
B0018Z06P0 This product works well. It is just as effective as the little dipper swim diapers that you can buy that are disposable. The best part is that you can use it over & over. Bear in mind what they are used for. If you arent comfortable with cleaning something up that has poo in it then maybe these arent for you. They fit well but when I ordered them I was concerned that a large may be too big. Unfortunately my son has already outgrown them. I guess it is hard to tell when you are ordering a product like this online. He is not quite 2 years old and of average size. There have been some floaters that have escaped while in the pool but no worse than any other product. Somehow its ok if my son makes #2 in the pool. Anyway I think you would be hard pressed to find anything that is completely effective at preventing escapage until you have a kid that is potty trained. As gross as it is there really aren't any alternatives.
B0018Z06P0 My little one is 4 months old and 16lbs.  The legs are pretty tight, but I think that's out of necessity.  It's pretty slim and I think the pattern is so cute.
B0018Z06P0 This works great.  Although I wish there were laundry tabs as the velcro easily gets caught on the fabric.  Either way though, doesn't change my 5 stars.
B0018Z06P0 The part between the thighs is way too wide, the fabric rubbed on my toddler's thighs so badly, it hurt his skin. I had bought various sizes so it is not a size issue.
B0018Z06P0 This is the best swim diaper. The disposable Huggie ones are convenient, but this save a lot of money. It has double walls around the thighs to protect from poo getting in the pool. We've never had a poo leak. It's adjustable at the waist. This will seriously fit my 5 week old 10 pounder, my 2 year old 25 pounder, and my 3 year old 32 pounder. That's pretty versatile!
B0018Z06P0 Found this when looking for an alternative to disposable swim diapers for my 8 month old to use in his kiddy pool.  I love that it has a fairly soft interior and it's very cute.  I bought the size large for my son who weighs in around 23 lbs and there is plenty of room for this swim diaper to grow with him.  Most likely he will be able to use it next summer as well.
B0018Z06P0 it fits great (size large, 12 months old ,23.5 lbs) and still roomy.although it does not hold pee (neither do the little swimmers)you can wear it as many times as you want and clorine won't damage them!!
B0018Z06P0 Seemed to work pretty well- Baby's about 16 lbs, and it seemed like he'll fit in it for awhile (Thank goodness) He got lots of compliments!
B0018Z6910 My daughter is currently sleeping away in her swing as I write this review.For the most part we love, love, love this swing.  We had a small travel swing for our first daughter & now that we have a 'real' swing, I can't believe we used that teeny, tiny, rinky-dink swing for #1.  This swing really has a lot going for it!pros:-the two directional swinging. love this feature! we initially had our daughter swinging \"head to toe\" because that is all the travel swing did with child #1. then a friend suggested that we try the side-to-side swinging. awesome! there are times when the head to toe swinging seems to frighten my daughter. she will have the 'startle' reaction every time the swing goes backwards. she will sleep for hours with the side-to-side swinging!-the music. I am not a big believer that all baby products need to light up & sing, BUT I have noticed that the \"night\" sounds (mostly of crickets) seems to calm my daughter down. I don't know why, but it does. additionally, the music volume dial allows for a wide range of volume. I can have it louder if I am not in the room or quieter when I am around so it does not drive me nutty.-the plush seat is so nice. (plus, I love the little ears that stick out! so cute!)-the \"toy tray\" is removable. I think the tray is a bit silly so I appreciate that it is removable. we have it packed away for now.cons:-#1 & most importantly, this model does NOT have an AC adapter!  boo.  my husband does not understand why any baby item that is THIS big & takes us this much space would not come with an AC adapter.  we would LOVE to have this run on electricity.  we use rechargable batteries & always have 4 ready for a switch-out.-this swing has begun rocking & rolling. the entire swing has started moving side to side as the swing rocks. we have looked into tightening screws but it doesn't seem to be an effective fix-it's huge! we are going from a travel swing, but seriously, this thing takes up a LOT of floor space! the description says it folds down for storage. nothing this big will ever be efficient for storage! you just accept that storing this thing will take up some serious space!I love this swing! &, more importantly, my daughter loves this swing. but, look into the swing with the AC adapter. even if it is a bit more expensive, you will certainly make up the money due to the cost of batteries!
B0018Z6910 We really hoped we'd like this swing, as it came highly recommended by several friends. Unfortunately, though, it seems like there was a lot of marketing hype, needless bells and whistles (sound, hanging toys, and the like), and the absence of a quality swinging mechanism.  This may well be true of other Fisher Price models with other \"designs.\"This swing is loud (though we may have been dealing with 2 defects, as a local display model was not as loud), and highly sensitive to whether or not it is perfectly level -- a problem when you're on carpet with pile.After our first unit made a terrible grinding noise out of the box, and would not swing well, we obtained a replacement.  While the replacement would run, it would not run consistently. It's frustrating when you're trying to deal with a screaming newborn and a swing that just won't get going at 3 A.M. when patience is thin (The voices inside your new-parent head may ask: \"Can I do this? I can't stop the crying, and I can't even make a simple swing work!\").Other negatives to consider: You're dealing with 4 D batteries (only, no AC option), and you need to use a Phillips-head screwdriver (4 screws) to swap them.  There are other swings out there that offer an AC option.Pros: You can rotate to get swinging left to right or front to back. The Fisher Price assembly instructions are decent, and they included the hex tool required for assembly.In the end, we opted for a different brand.  If, however, you do opt for this swing (or one with a similar FP mechanism) SAVE THE BOX in case you find yourself at wits end.
B0018Z6910 The best swing! Soft, snuggly and perfect rocking motion. It is a big swing but we love it as did our kids! Highly recommend this swing. A must have for any little one. This way you can get things done while little one plays or sleeps in swings. Great music and mobile too!
B0018Z6910 When we announced our pregnancy, all of our friends told us we NEEDED a swing so we bought the Starlight version of this swing and had it assembled before he was born. For the first 3 weeks of his life, he absolutely hated the swing and cried every single time we put him in it. I thought we had wasted our money. Well, we tried it again when he was just over 3 weeks old, and I don't know what happened, but all of the sudden it became his favorite place to take a nap. He falls asleep almost immediately when we put him in the swing. If your baby hates this swing at first, don't give up on it! I'm so glad we didn't pack it away.I also love that the Starlight version can be plugged in. We have this thing going for hours at a time, so it's nice to not have to change batteries even though we have to maneuver around the power cord in our kitchen.For those who are concerned about the color, the mobile toys and pillow are baby blue, but the cushion, the fabric that's lining the net, and the dials are lilac. We have a boy, and the color doesn't bother us, but online it looks like it's all blue.
B0018Z6910 If you going to buy a swing buy a cradle swing. My baby is 11 weeks old and has a hard time sleeping more than an inch away from me. Before she was born I bought one of those smaller swings that folds up and goes back and forth. Sometimes I could get her to sleep in it swaddled, but not all that often. I was sold on the cradle swing when I put her down in one at a friends house and she fell asleep two different times. She is still hard to get down, but she takes a pretty good nap in her swing at least once a day. She still does better in it if she is swaddled. I think she likes that side to side swing that my other once didn't do. So the swing it self is really cute. I found some of the older ones bright and annoying. But because it's meant to appeal to the adult eye, it is lacking in visual appeal to my baby. My baby absolutely loves her black and white mobile above her changing table but this one with all its spinning and moving up and down, she couldn't care less about. I was just reading the other day that pastels are pretty hard for a baby to actually see. So cool features of a mobile but she's not interested. The tray with toys on it is OK. Again, it has pastel toys on it she wasn't interested in, but I'm not planning on having her in there for play time. I think the little mirror is nice. She seems to like mirrors so I got her this swing over the other ones that do a light show. Not sure how good battery use is since I haven't had it that long. I do kind of regret not getting the one that plugs in. Size wise it does take up a lot of room in our small place. I'm not bothered by the motor. Just is kind of white noise to her at this point. Unless the house is kind of quite it's not something I notice. Putting it together wasn't hard except getting that seat cover stretched over the plastic wasn't the easiest. I don't really use the music or sound effects, they're kind of annoying,at least the music is. I didn't think the slower speeds really went all that fast. I usually have it on the fastest speed and it goes so much faster than that other swing I had. I wish the seat was a little deeper. Sometimes its hard to buckle her in right in the swaddle or I don't want to mess with her if she is already asleep when I put her in there. The older swings had deeper seats so buckling wasn't a necessity. This one looks like she could roll out when the swing is in the highest position to the left, so I put some pillows under the swing just in case. The right leg comes up a bit when the swing is in the highest left position, but that seems to happen to all of the cradle swings I've seen and they are stable. I noticed that the older swings where advertised as having 2 swinging positions and this one has three, but there isn't a new position, just side to side or back and forth.
B0018Z6910 I brought this for my crying one-month old.The first swing setting was too much for her, so I had to drape a heavier blanket over the bottom half of the papasan and let it hit the floor. This made the swing swing less and not as scary. Yes there is a clicking noise as it swings even if you don't push start the swing. I don't really find the clicking annoying because it's way better than screaming and crying. Also, if you increase the mobile volume to the middle volume, it covers the clicking noise.The legs fold together for easy transport between rooms even though it's still rather bulky, but you can't have it all. 
B0018Z6910 Bought this for my second child, didn't have one with the first, it's extremely easy to assemble, beautiful product! i love it, easy to store also
B0018Z6910 I have a 14 month old who's addicted to the swing. We get no peace and quiet unless we have this swing.We had an old family swing die when our baby was 6 months old (probably from overuse). So we got this wonderful contraption! You are able to lock an active child in place with a loud snap of the saftey bar and keep the child happy or sleeping for quite a long time. We don't use the turning top or noise option at all, so I can't review that option.Anyway, our child (19.5 lbs) sleeps in the swing for 4.5 hours (at various times) throughout each day. EVERYDAY FOR 7 DAYS A WEEK! So, our motor ran out of course. We replaced the swing free of charge after 6 months of that schedule. We're eagerly awaiting the arrival of the replacement.4 STARS because the motor ran out, because it only goes to 25 lbs, becuase it has a large footprint (on the environment and in the baby's small room) because it needs 4 D batteries every week and a half (at that intense schedule) and because it has such a loud snap when you secure the saftey bar.
B0018Z6910 We returned the swing.  Our family did not like this swing.  The mobile does not swing out of the way and hits baby's head when you try to put them in while sleeping.  You MUST strap them in (not alway practical) because the sides are low and baby can turn over and roll out.
B0018Z6910 I registered for this swing.  My neighbor has one that is very similar to mine (little lamb model).  It didn't bother me that there was no AC adapter.  But the longer I have it, the more some things kinda bother me.Pros:I like the mirror and lambs.The music and sounds aren't too obnoxious.The seat is very soft.My son does sleep in this swing very well.Cons:My batteries don't seem to last as long as everyone else.It is very noisy and creaky.The tool bar is hard to put on and take off and you can not take the baby out or put him in with it on.The seat itself shifts so that it doesn't always sit level when not in motion.It is really easy for the legs to shift and become uneven causing the swing to rock and squeak
B0018Z6910 Oh how I wish I had bought this three months ago! My baby turns four months old in a week and we just got this swing three weeks ago and it's been amazing. He loves the side to side motion - it's the only thing that soothes him.From the time he was 2 weeks old until 3 months my son screamed and screamed. Nothing soothed him. Sometime around 6 weeks we discovered he had a milk-protein allergy and acid-reflux - what luck for us (and him!). Up until that point I was exhausted and bought every single baby item for colic. Swings, bouncers, carriers, wraps, mobiles, gripe water, strollers, gas drops, formula changes, etc. and nothing helped and he hated EVERYTHING so I accumulated quite a bit of stuff.As the weeks went on, I noticed Jack really liked to be swung from side to side while swaddled so even though I was late in the game I ordered him this swing.HE LOVES THIS SWING! The other day he LITERALLY fell asleep the second his head hit the pillow as I laid him in the swing. He will take 2 hour naps in this thing and doesn't mind just chilling in it for a little bit when he wakes up from a nap (instead of instantly screaming). I wish wish wish we had bought this swing in the beginning. I tried to get away with a little collapsible/travel swing thing and it was slow swinging and boring and he was NOT interested in that thing in the least.If you have a baby who is hard to soothe - do yourself a favor and get this swing!!!
B0018Z6910 This swing is the best! Our LO has loved it since birth on a daily basis and takes many naps in it. It is soft and cozy for baby and the seat area can be removed and cleaned if needed too. The pillow is removable on Velcro, or also so you can adjust it for the height of your baby which took us a few weeks to discover. Our baby doesn't care for the play tray at all so we never pop it on. The motor is louder then I would have thought, but we don't have another swing to compare it to. My MIL said it was really quite in comparison to how swings use to sound so maybe it is actually quieter then some other models out there. My baby just started to like the mobile a couple weeks ago when he was 1.5 months old, before that he could care less about it. The music/nature sounds are not bad. Our baby doesn't seem to mind if it turns off after 10 mins so that has not been an issue for us like some people who find the music doesn't stay on long enough. Also the batteries last for awhile in it, he has used it daily for 2+hours almost every day and we just replaced the batteries for the first time yesterday at almost 2 months of use. Also its great that you can switch the direction that it swings very easily, side to side swing or forward and back swing- he loves both!
B0018Z6910 This is a wonderful swing... It's very nice and soothing. Baby loves it and he's comfortable enough to take a nap in it. The fact that you can have it swing different ways it's a big plus. It's very cute as well and the materials used are very soft and cuddly. I have done lots of research before purchasing this one and I don't regret the choice. The price was very nice too.
B0018Z6910 Superman had Kryptonite and my baby has swings. This one is really a peach. Its motions are completely irresistible to even the grumpiest sleep-avoider. The music is nice. The materials are very soft to the touch and the color scheme is not achingly ugly. My girl is 2.5 months old and large (15 pounds) but she fits in this thing perfectly just now. I put this swing together in 15 minutes. No lie. It's 4 screws and an allen key (supplied) and otherwise snaps together. You'll need a cross-head screwdriver for the battery compartment. It's that easy. I had been putting off getting a swing because they are expensive and I felt my girl would outgrow it very quickly but I was not getting anything done trying to keep her occupied and I cracked, ran out and bought this. She's been sleeping sweetly now for over an hour and went to sleep the instant she was placed in this device. Worth every dime.
B0018Z6910 It was the best purchase I ever made for my baby. He loves it! The swing always makes him sleepy, so it is great to calm him and even to make him sleepy. He also loves the mirror and the mobile, he pays attention for long stretches of time. The musics are also very soothing. I think that was a brilliant idea of Fisher Price to make the music and the mobile to stop after some time but keep the swing going for as long as you want. The timing is perfect, since my baby gets distract for awhile than falls asleep and I do not have to worry about turning the music and the mobile off to save some batterie because it does on its own. But the swing keeps moving which keeps him asleep (as soon as I stop it, my baby always wakes up).
B0018Z6910 Or should I say sanity saver!!!One thing I would change is that I would make it available with an AC adaptor so you could plug it in.That said, it didn't burn through batteries as bad as I thought, but the timing on dead batteries is always awful... So keep some batteries handy in the next room :)
B0018Z6910 First of all, the weight limit on this swings reads up to 25 lbs. My son is 16 lbs. (which is a full 9 lbs. under the weight limit), and the swing didn't move even on the highest setting. The motor was obnoxiously loud, and it made constantly loud clicking noises. There is no way this swing could sooth a baby, let alone rock a baby to sleep. My son was only in it 3 minutes, and he wanted out. We tried the swing without our son in it, and it worked; however, we then tried it with an 8 lb. weight, and it stopped moving. My husband and I bought this swing intending to use it for a month (or longer if at all possible) for our 6-month-old and then use it for the new baby we just found out we're having. Instead, it's going right back in the box and being returned. If eating expensive batteries was the only downfall of this product, then I might have given it an extra star. By the way, once you get the swing together, it's a royal pain to get undone and back in the box. Looks like I'm headed to a baby store to look for a better product/ one that actually works.
B0018Z6910 Ever since our daughter was a couple months old, she's loved her swing! We prev. had the Fisher Price Nature swing and she used it so much, it wore out the motor. We found this at a garage sale in perfect condition. Some nights it's the only way she can get to sleep. Ours came w/a 5pnt harness, that can come off. The head rest is REALLY soft and cozy. The only downside is the batteries run out fast and there's no AC adapter like the newer model. We use this swing many, many hours a day bc she falls asleep quickly in it and we don't want to take her out if she's sleeping! Shell fall asleep with it off too bc it's so cozy. I'm actually jealous of it bc it looks so relaxing! This is a must have!
B0018Z6910 This swing is perfect for our 9 week old baby girl for an afternoon nap or an unconsoleable crying fit. It calms her right down by simulating the womb with the position of the seat and the swinging. Add a pacifier and it really helps calm her down. I wouldn't recommend ever nap because she needs to learn how to sleep without the swinging, but it really helps her out when she needs it. Sometime she gets overstimulated with being held and needs some alone time to fall asleep and this works great.
B0018Z6910 Be aware that this only runs on 4 D batteries, althought they last a lot, probably 2 or 3 months depending on the use, it would be better to have it with a plug to the wall, the rest is just great, well made its been woring fine, its got music, movement etc.
B0018Z6910 Good product. Gentle with the baby. The only drawback is size. It occupies a big chunk of space. Overall I reccomend it.
B0018Z6910 My 3 mo. has used this swing since his first week home.  He often will take his morning nap in it.  He prefers the back to front motion instead of side to side.  The little lamb motifs fit in well with our home decor and doesn't scream baby land.  I would recommend the swing to anyone.
B0018Z6910 This swing has served us well.  My son is now 8 months and has spent MANY hours in the swing.  For a few months, he actually slept in it at night because it was the only way he would sleep!  He still naps in it.  You can read all the rave reviews about the swing in the other reviews -- I just want to point out my two biggest gripes.1) The swing runs on batteries.  Considering how much time my son has spent in this swing, I really wish it was a plug-in.  I know the Zen swing is similar and plugs in.  In retrospect, I wish I knew that because I would have purchased the Zen instead.2) The swing only has a reclined setting on the seat.  You can not sit your baby up when they are older to play with the toys.  We have never used the toy bar.Other than those two issues, it's a great buy and my son loves it.
B0018Z6910 I received theFisher Price Cradle n Swing, My Little Lambas a shower gift at our Baby Shower. I had registered for it because it had many good reviews and was from Fisher Price, a quality name in baby products. We were very happy to receive the gift and assembled it approx 6 weeks before out baby was due, as we were finishing up the nursery and getting everything in place. I was impressed with the materials used, they are very soft and nice to the touch. I also liked the folding feature that allowed you to store it with less space.However, once I assembled it I turned it on.... it all went downhill from there. The swing immediately started making a loud grinding and cracking noise. I immediately shut it off and looked over everything to make sure it was assembled properly and that I didn't have something messed up. Everything looked ok, so I turned it back on, it made the same noises. I tapped it a couple times thinking something was out of place, no luck.I looked online and found several reviews noting that the swing made noises of varying degrees. I thought maybe mine was just defective so I went to my local Toys R Us to see if they had one on display and if it made any noises. Luckily they did have on on display with batteries in it. I turned it on and it made the same noises, although not as loud as mine. At this point I decided this must be a flow in the mechanism design. I really wanted to like this, but I did not feel comfortable that, even if I got a quiet replacement, the swing would hold up in the long run.I contacted Fisher Price's customer support via e-mail on the Sunday that I assembled the swing about the noise asking if it was normal and if there was a way to correct the problem. Later that day I visited Toys r Us and exchanged the swing for a model by a different manufacturer, as the display made the same noises.I was VERY impressed with Fisher Price's follow up and attempt to resolve the situation. I received a reply on Tuesday (2 business days) from a service rep. She apologized for the problem and told me that a replacement motor had been shipped to me. I replied explaining that I had already bought a replacement. They told me the motor was already shipped and not to worry about returning it. The new motor arrived on Thursday, 2 days after the response and 4 days after my complaint. i was very impressed that they took such quick and immediate action to remedy the problem.UNFORTUNATELY, I unpacked the new motor and powered it up to see how it worked. It made the exact same noises. This confirmed my suspicion that it was a design flaw and not a fluke that my original swing made noises. It appears as though the motor and gears are made of plastic and not to the tightest specs.Again, I was quite pleased with the customer service, however I don't think there is anyway they could have corrected this situation short of redesigning the swing motor mechanism. It has reaffirmed my trust in Fisher Price as a brand, however I would not recommend this swing based on the noises it makes. I found an extremely quiet \"hybrid drive\" alternative (Bright Starts Ingenuity Cradle and Sway Swing, Bella Vista)
B0018Z6910 I love this swing.  I bought this when my daughter was almost two months old and I'm so glad that I did.  She loves to look around at things and this sits up high enough for her to do that without being held.  She also likes the mobile and will sit in the swing and laugh and giggle as it moves around.  I like to use the sided to side motion on the lowest speed setting.  Its perfect for getting my little one to fall asleep when she is being fussy and I know she's tired but she won't settle down when I'm holding her.  I've noticed lately though that I have to give the swing a little nudge when I first start it up or it takes a while to get going.  I don't know if this has to do with my daughter starting to weigh more or the motor is just becoming sluggish.  I still love this swing though and Amazon was definitely the most affordable place to purchase it.
B0018Z6910 this swing has worked wonders since the day we got it! our son would fall asleep if we rocked him in our arms but would wake up crying when you put him down and then you'd have to start all over again.  ever since the first night he slept in this swing he slept 5hours straight, he's only 11 weeks old now and sleeps 7-8hours a night in this swing (sometimes we don't even turn it on)! this swing is worth every penny!(also, not sure why it's cheaper here than everywhere else but that's a HUGE PLUS!)the only negative i can find is that there is no option for an ac/dc outlet, that would make it even more wonderful than it already is. for now we're using rechargeable batteries and it runs forever on them.
B0018Z6910 I registered for this swing for my son as it was one of the few non-feminine swings I could find.  I thought it was very cute & gender neutral.  I have been extremely disappointed.  The motor on it is a joke and what's worse, we exchanged it & had the same problems so I know it isn't just one bad swing.  The motor is loud enough that we thought it was broken when we first tried it out, but what's worse is it barely has the power to swing my 12 pound son.  Literally, if I leave it to swing on its own, it swings ONE INCH either way with my son in it & he is only half the recommended weight capacity.  Even when he was newly born (8 lb's), it barely swung him.  So I sit by the swing & push it manually.  Also, the recline is not flat enough for a newborn because my son's head rolls forward & he slumps in the chair no matter what I do.  Not only would I not buy this swing again, but after all the product recalls I've seen in the news, I'd be reluctant to purchase anything Fisher-Price in the future.
B0018Z6910 This swing is incredible and for the price on Amazon you really cant beat it! I bought it when it was over $100 and I am amazed at how cheap it is now (maybe because the new Fisher Price Snugabunny was released and that one  has a plug in option). It was very soothing for my baby and I liked how you can adjust the incline so it helped with his baby congestion. My only complaint would be it is battery powered... it really runs through those batteries but it also helps to make parents cautious of how long they leave their babies in swings anyway! Might be a cheaper option to buy the SnugaBunny one with the plug in option if your baby needs that constant rocking.
B0018Z6910 This swing is not what I thought it would be. I purchased this for my 3rd child and knowing that it could be my savior I looked for just the right one. I bought this swing because of the cradle design and thought a newborn would snuggle right in and stay for a while. However, my son is very uncomfortable in this swing as the head rest bends his neck forward until his chin is touching his chest. I thought since he was small 5.1 lbs that maybe he would grow into it, well he is now 11 lbs and is still uncomfortable with the head rest, I have taken it completely off but the Velcro is scratchy so I have to put a blanket under him. It is very loud and swings very very fast even at the lowest setting. My son is now 3 months and I can turn it on the lowest setting and sometimes I still wonder if its swinging too fast for him as the face he makes sometimes looks as if hes scared. I would not recommend this swing for a newborn.
B0018Z6910 I purchased the My Little Lamb model for my newborn. When he was 7 1/2lbs I tried to put him in the swing but even on the lowest setting it was going WAY too fast and he didn't seem to like it either. I tried the swing again about 3 weeks later when he was around 10lbs and on the lowest setting it was perfect. My baby falls right to sleep and stays asleep. He loves to look at himself in the mirror on the mobile and listen to the nature sound with the stream and birds.Pros:- One button to change the swing from front to back to side to side- Sturdy and stable- One step to change from laying down to sitting up- Has an option for the swing to stay still but the music and/or mobile to still be on- Reset button to restart the music and/or mobile- Very plush and comfy- Decent battery lifeCons:- Too fast for a baby under 9-10lbs in my opinion- Would be great if it had an a/c adapter. It is a large swing and won't be moved around the house so it would be very practical to be able to plug it in rather than having to keep replacing batteries.All in all, I love the swing and so does my baby. I would definately purchase this swing again. He sleeps longer in this swing than in his bouncers, crib or carseat so I have more time to take a nap or get things done around the house.
B0018Z6910 We have had this swing for 4 months now so I thought it would be a good time to review it. I would first like to say that out of all the swings I have tried I think the Fisher Price Cradle swings are the best out there. Having said that though I think there are both positive and negative things about this swing which I think other parents need to keep in mind if they are considering this swing:Negative Things:1.) One of the legs moves a bit off of the ground when the swing is in motion. If you readjust the legs this fixes the problem but you have to do it constantly so it stays on the ground when the swing is in motion. It frightens me really because to us this signifies that the swing is not 100 percent safe when in motion.2.) The activity tray is horrible! It is difficult to put on and take off!3.) The fabric on the seat is so hard to keep clean! It is super soft which is one of the reasons I bought it. However, I didn't consider that it is white and I didn't consider how hard it would be to clean. Although it is soft and our son seems to enjoy it, it attracts stains so easily which wouldn't be a problem if it was easy to get clean. My son tends to spit up a lot so we to wash it a few times a week and each time we have to wash it twice to get it even close to clean. The stains still don't even come out all the way! Also we again like that it is soft material and did keep our son warm and cozy. It was great in the cold months. However, in the humid summer this is not a good thing. Every time we put him in there we have to make sure he is getting extra air because he gets so hot in there.4.) We have been using the swing for 4 months now and we have been dealing with all kinds of weird sounds coming from it when in motion. It creaks and squeaks and sometimes it seems like the motor is having to work extra hard just to work.Positive Things:1.) We love that the seat has 3 different positions. It is great because it gives our son different perspectives. We also like that the seat can be reclined or up a little.2.) We love the mobile and the mirror. My son loves to look at himself and he also loves to try and grab the toys on the mobile.3.) Also the batteries last forever on this thing! We only have had to change the batteries every 4 weeks and we use the swing on a daily basis. I also like the fact that it runs on batteries because if it had a plug I think it would be a safety hazard for us and my 2 year old because we would probably be tripping over it all the time!4.) As I mentioned before the seat fabric is soft and cozy. This means that the head rest on the seat is cute and comfortable as well.5.) The music is nice and soothing and we love how we can adjust the volume on it.6.) The tray is functional and a good size. At five months my son is still entertained by the toys on the tray so that is a plus. We also put extra toys on there for him too so that could also be why.7.) Also we love the fact that you can fold it up and move it or store it. We don't ever move it but its nice to know that it can be folded up for moving.8.) Lastly it is very soothing for our son. He falls asleep in it so easily! Our two year old who is small for her size (only 21 pounds) also likes to sit in it occasionally and all the times that she has she has fallen right asleep in minutes!As I said there are both good and bad things about the swing. If I had to do it again I would probably still stick with a Fisher Price Cradle swing but I would not buy the \"My Little Lamb\" one again.Update:A few days after I wrote this review my swing started to lean to one side. My son is within the weight limits so there should be no reason it leans. Thus, I think that my rating has dropped down to three stars because safety is my number one concern.
B0018Z6910 We got a traditional swing and tried to use it when my daughter was born. However, due to the angle of the seat, my daughter's pediatrician recommended we find a swing that could lay flat to support her neck. The tray is removable so we were able to swaddle our daughter (in my other life saver by Swaddle Designs) and place her in this swing to rock to sleep as if she was in the newborn napper that came with our pack & play.  Since she was swaddled we found it built in a way that it was safe not to have to strap her in.  My daughter is now 6 months old and we still enjoy the swing for her day naps. We never really used it in the upright position with the tray. It has always been a napper. She is just now starting to notice the mobile and mirror on top. When she wakes up she will stare up at herself and bat at the stars and lambs.One other thing I liked was the angles you could place the swing. Left (front to back), Right (front to back) or Forward (side to side). That was especially nice when you were trying to keep the sun out of her eyes. I started used the side to side motion for a while and found she did better with the front to back motion.My biggest criticism is the battery. I ran through D's a lot in the beginning as we would run it every day for hours on end. My friend has one of the newer models with the butterflies and it now comes with a plug. That would have been nice. If it's available on the new models of this swing I'd give it 5 stars.My only other criticism is the legs. You need a lot of space to spread them out.
B0018Z6910 Baby loves this swing.  There were times I couldn't comfort him so I gave up and tried the swing.  It worked like a charm several times.  He stopped crying and fell asleep.  The swing gave me time to get a bottle ready or do other small tasks without having to hold him all the time.  I consider it one of my best picks.It can be a little loud when swinging but none of us were bothered by it.  Love, love this swing.
B0018Z6910 We've had this swing for 2 years and with 2 children. Both loved it.  I do wish when we bought it, that the cord adapter was available.  We go through 4 D batteries every month.
B0018Z6910 Our son loved this swing! He was happy in it for long periods of time. It was super cozy and so easy to put together- I did it myself in less than 30 minutes. The speeds were perfect, the music was nice, and the mobile was ideal especially as he got older. We bought rechargeable batteries by Sanyo and these were essential. We had a system of rotation with the batteries to be sure the swing was always working. Do yourself a favor and invest in rechargeable batteries. Our son is now too big for the swing but it will be used for #2 for sure!
B0018Z6910 I bought this swing because I read great reviews for it, but I have found that it is very noisy. I thought maybe the motorhead was defective so I called Fisher Price and they sent me a new one, but the new one is just as noisy. It makes this horrible creaking sound when you turn the swing on. Also, the legs are not very sturdy. I have placed it on every surface in my house (tile, wood, carpet, rug) and have not found a single surface that it works well on. The minute I turn it on the legs start to wobble. Needless to say, I stopped using this swing. A friend gave me another Fisher Price swing that her daughter used and that one is just fine, but it is a different model. I would recommend the Fisher Price swing but definitely not the My Little Lamb model.
B0018Z6910 Our daughter has used this swing since she was a week old! She naps in it and we used it for a while to help her get to sleep.  I bought this swing because it could go side to side and front to back and that has come in handy time and time again. She loves to sit up and be upright looking around so having it adjustable to have her sitting up more is also a great feature! Not every baby loves a swing, but this has been worth the money for us!The only problem I have with this swing is it seems to move when you take our baby in and out of the swing. Which isn't a big deal until you turn it on and then it creaks until you adjust the feet/legs again. The noise has never bothered our baby, thankfully, but it drives my husband and I a little crazy.
B0018Z6910 Was given this swing as a baby shower gift because I'd really wanted it. Its very cute and soft and the only way we could get our little refluxer to sleep couple hours at a time. We went through D batteries like crazy but as long as it was helping we didn't care! Well just 3 months into it it croaks!! The motor just died in the middle of the night and of course there wasn't much sleep for us after that. Couple weeks earlier I had began to notice the motor was a little noisier and it seemed a little sluggish till eventually it would work for a few minutes then nothing. My son has had trouble gaining weight so he wasn't even close to 25lb limit. When motor died he was barely 9lbs. I will say that FP customer service was wonderful! We went through a few troubleshooting steps to confirm motor was gone and once that was done she offered to replace motor but I explained we'd already went the very next day and bought another so they refunded our $. Was fully prepared to have to argue but was so relieved it was so simple. Were now on our 3rd FB swing and hoping it'll make it past the 3mos mark.
B0018Z6910 We originally had the graco sweetpeace swing which was the worst purchase EVER.  We went through 4 of them before I was like that's it!  I decided to pick this up and I am glad I did!!  My daughter is 10 months and still fits in it but we put it away for the next baby. But this was the best, it's so soft..the motions are so soothing. It's
B0018Z6910 I love this swing. The swing direction has 3 options- which helps me make my baby content. Newborns' preferences seem to change each day, and this swing gives you options! The bedding is soft and cozy also! I would definitely recommend this product.
B0018Z6910 My daughter absolutely loves this swing! My boo falls asleep after about just 3 minutes in this swing and whenever she is really fussy and I'm just too tired to rock her myself I put her in this and she calms down right away.  I love it.Pro's:1. the material is extremely soft.2. variable speeds.3. variable music and nature sounds.4. it swings 2 different ways.5. it's adorable and the color scheme matches easily with our decor.Con's:1. the motor is a bit loud, it really doesn't bother me or my little one but you can definetely hear it. I just think of it as white noise that helps my baby fall asleep.2. the slowest setting of speed is a little too fast for my 7 weeker.  In the manual however they address this issue and state to place one side a blanket under your little one and let the other end drag on the floor.  I did this with the addition of puttin a book on the floor end and it works great.  I'm guessing in a couple of more weeks the 1st speed setting will be just right.
B0018Z6910 I think this is probably the best baby swing out there on the market. It is especially great for newborns. My lil' one sleeps best in this swing because it is so comforting and swaddling-like. Since it is so scooped when in the fully reclined position, I do not have to buckle baby in which is great for sleeping.The only dislikes I have are that when it is in its slowest on position, the swing is still pretty fast. I weight it down with extra blankets/towels to slow down the swing. Also, I wish it had a power extension cord for plug-in like some of the other swings on the market. I also wish the music/mobile stayed on longer without having to be reset, but this isn't a huge deal.The cover is extremely soft and cozy and baby likes this.I also got a great deal on this swing through Amazon and saved a ton compared to the big retailers.I would recomend this swing to anyone looking for a swing for a newborn. It looks like it will be good later on too when baby is bigger and the seat is reclined to a more forward position. It is great that the safety bar can come on and off, especially since it isn't needed now while baby is so little.BEST SWING OUT THERE!
B0018Z6910 i bought this swing based on the reviews. it seemed to be  one of the best out there. we started using it from the first day we came from the hospital. my son will stay there with no problem. he also didn't sleep much at all and nothing worked, he just didn't even seem to be tired, so i put him in there and it put him to sleep quite fast. it has a very soft padding,which i like.i also like that it has 2 positions.i don't like that it moves too fast, but we put a blanket over baby's legs and it slowed it down. my son weighs about 15 lb now and we still use the slowest setting. i also don't like that the seat is tilted to the saide all the  time, especially when the baby is in it. i thought it's just mine, but when i looked at my friends' swings and the ones at the stores - they are all the same way. and whatever my husband and i tried to do to fix it - nothing worked. also when the swing moves on the slowest setting the whole thing moves also on one side - so the leg goes in the air, i think it's because of the seat being tilted.so i think it's an ok swing. especially for it being quite expensive, and you can use it for just 3-4 months.
B0018Z6910 I had a different version/model of this swing with my first son that i borrowed from a friend and loved it.  So when i had my second son i wanted to buy a cradle swing for him too.  Well when i put it together it looked like it was tilted to the left.  I thought maybe it was just me so i tried to forget about it.  A few days later it was still leaning to the left.  So i called fisher price to tell them what was going on and they said they'd send me a new motor mount.  They seemed very nonchalant about the whole thing. (like it's happened before)  I got the new one and installed it and the same thing happened.  So everytime my son is in the swing he is always leaning to the left of the swing.  It's a little annoying considering how much we paid for the swing.
B0018Z6910 This swing is great & a must have (lamb swing). My baby slept in this swing from the time I bought it until he was nearly 6 months old. I love that it reclines all the way & swings side to side. It's very cute also.I would give it 5 stars if it plugged in, but as it is, I didn't have to replace the batteries that often. Also, the music seemed to not rotate between songs evenly. I would hear the same 2 songs over & over, mixed in with the other songs occasionally. Minor things.I liked it so much, I also bought as a gift.
B0018Z6910 My husband and I purchased this for our first daughter. The swing itself is very cute and super soft. However, it made terrible clicking and humming noises. I am not talking about normal \"motor\" type noises, I am talking about loud and obnoxious noises. It sounded as though it was working double time just to swing (no baby involved). So we put some weight in it to see if it would help, nope. We thought maybe we hadn't put it together correctly, nope we did it right. So we returned it and got another. Guess what?!? The new swing made the exact same noises. Ugh! I had to give in and decided the cuteness factor did not outweigh the loudness of the swing. We returned it and got a Bright Starts Ingenuity Swing...absolutely silent and just as cute!!
B0018Z6910 1st off it is so loud... I swear something must be wrong with it. It has this annoying grinding noise. It sounds like a monster. 2nd our 1st setting for speed doesn't seem to work. 3rd I could have sworn the one I had ordered had an AC adapter. I feel like I got a completely different swing than most of the other reviewers. To take this swing apart and ship it back seems like too much of a hassle, but for the price I think I am going to just have to suck it up and do it. Ugh! More work than I need with 2 under 2. Oh and my husband who is an engineer cannot complain enough about what a piece of junk this is.
B0018Z6910 Our newborn loved this swing.  In fact, that's the only way we could get her to sleep sometimes.  My main complaint is that it is not a plug in.  If you are looking for a swing it is worth paying extra to find one that is a plug in.  Otherwise you will be going through batteries left and right.  The swing itself is great.  You can swing front to back and side to side by adjusting the top.  The sound quality is not that great and shuts of after only about 15 min. so you will prob. want to have an additional sound machine.  The swing motion is pretty good and you can adjust to varying levels.  Once your baby gets heavier though the swing does not swing as vigorously even at the highest setting.  Still it's a good swing for the money.  Only wish that it plugged in.
B0018Z6910 We have been using this swing for our newborn son who is now almost 5 weeks old. He really loves the swing. In fact, he has reflux so it's the only place he will sleep since he can't lay flat in his crib. He seems to really enjoy the mirror and rotating mobile above as well. We removed the tray completely since he won't be using it any time soon. It's easier to get him in and out without it there. The fabrics are very soft and fluffy, but can get kind of hot for the baby in summer. Although my son seems to really like the swing, there are a few things I wish I could change about it.1) It swings SUPER fast, even on the lowest setting. My husband and I thought ours was broken at first because we can't tell any difference between the lowest and the highest setting.2) I wish the headrest was detachable so we could wash it separately without having to remove the entire seat cover. As I mentioned before, my son has reflux and spits up a lot. Mostly it just gets on the headrest part, but it's a real bummer to have to remove everything since it's all one piece. And then my son can't use the swing until the laundry is done, and it's the ONLY place he'll sleep right now. (I've contemplated cutting the headrest part off with scissors to make my life easier.) However, I will mention it's relatively easy putting the seat cover back on, and I like that it is machine washable.3) The swing motor is quite noisy. It makes a loud clicking-type sound each time the swing is at it's highest on both sides. And on ours, the mobile squeaks loudly as it rotates (maybe we could just use some WD-40??). The noises don't seem to bother or wake my son, though. His big sister is much louder than the swing and he can sleep though her noise no problem.4) I wish it had a plug instead of only batteries. But other similar models have that feature, and ours seems to be doing good on battery life.If I could change those things, I would love this swing. But I suppose none of those things even matter because my son seems to love the swing and sleeps well in it. I guess that's what really matters anyways!
B0018Z6910 I love the look of this swing and was really excited to receive it. When I got it and spent the 45 minutes putting it together I was shocked to find that it only operates on batteries. I would not recommend this to any parent whose baby likes to sleep in a swing. Another big issue for me is the product came to me broken. The sound and music does not work. When I contacted Amazon about it I was confronted by a CS rep that did not speak the best english. It is hard to have an online chat with someone that doesnt understand the language you are typing in very well. I was frustrated and ended up keeping the broken product because I was tired and couldn't get a straight answer out of the Rep
B0018Z6910 this is singlehandedly the number one, BEST purchase we have made for our baby.  easy to assemble and very user-friendly, it is the one sure-fire thing to help him fall asleep.  our baby gets the longest amount of sleep for his naps (sometimes 2-3 hours) when he's in it.  the only downside is that my son will eventually outgrow it!
B0018Z6910 Great swing! Its the best gift we got for our baby shower. My daughter was using it untill 10 months! She liked to sit there and watch her favorite cartoons! I would definitely recomend this product.
B0018Z6910 I am so happy with this swing.  I use it everyday and don't know how I would calm my little one sometimes without it.  It has really been a blessing in our home.  I highly recommend it.  The batteries die occasionally if you use it a lot, but it's a small price to pay for a happy baby and some quiet time for mommy and daddy.
B0018Z6910 I got this swing from some good friends who used it for ~3 months with their baby girl.  They didn't love the swing, but it worked adequately for them and we were hoping not to have a to purchase a swing.  Since the point we started using it, it has never worked and we are looking for a new swing.The first issue is that it won't start swinging from a stationary position, you have to push it to get it started.  It also doesn't keep swinging, you have to give it a little push every now and then or it stops moving.  (We have a little baby, at 6 weeks she is just under 8 lbs.)Once you do get it started, it is noisy.  It isn't quite as noisy if you can get the swing going at the same rate the motor is trying to swing the swing, but that takes a lot of practice and patience.  Even then, the motor still makes a lot of noise.  Of course the motor isn't the only thing that makes a ton of noise, the frame itself squeaks.  If you get the leg spacing just right, get the screws at the correct level of tightness (not all the way tight), and put it in a place where it can't move at all while swinging, then you don't have to worry about this... but if you are a normal human being this is a nearly impossible feat.Then you have the battery issue... this things sucks batteries down.  We can get about 2 weeks of battery use out of 4 D batteries.  Of course during that second week we have to turn the sound and mobile off because it doesn't have enough power and the music plays at slow motion. (You remember what a record playing back wards sounds like?  It's kinda like that.  I'm sure there is a satanic message hidden in this thing somewhere.)-*-*-*-*-*-VERY IMPORTANT UPDATE-*-*-*-*-*-OK, so now on two occasions my child has almost fallen out of this swing.  The first time I thought maybe it was a fluke and I needed to adjust the straps better so I made sure everything was tightened down appropriately.  The second time was the most horrible thing I have ever seen in my life.  Somehow my child wiggled out of the swing and ended up face down with her face where her butt should have been and the rest of her body hanging out the bottom of the swing.  The only thing holding her in was a strap around her head that could have hung her.  I would seriously consider finding a swing with a 5 point harness system, or at least with a nice deep bucket seat that the child can't easily wiggle out of.
B0018Z6910 we wish it wouldnt use batteries, but aside from that we loved it.when she was little it was the one item that could sooth her and she sometimes fell asleep in it too when nothing else worked.it also bought me time once in a while to take a 3 minute shower.highly recommend it for the moments when you need your hands free
B0018Z6910 At first this thing was a Godsend! Then after a little while (about 3 months) we noticed it made a lot of noise. We used it so much the batteries were dying every 2-3 weeks. Luckily they make one now with an ac adapter GET THAT ONE if you insist on buying this swing. My husband wound up rigging it to have an adapter to save us $. But back to the noise. It creeks and actually wakes the baby up, defeating the purpose of it.  I honestly would've registered for something else if I had researched it a bit more. I even ordered a new motor ( Customer Service was very accommodating)and the noise was just as annoying. So, invest your money into a better swing if you can, or register for a better quality one if you can because I wouldn't recommend this to anyone. If my husband would let me I'd chuck it and get a new one. For the next kid we definitely will.
B0018Z6910 Our baby really loves to be in a swing and so we used this swing daily. At first it seemed \"ok\" but we were bothered by the noise as the motor is quite loud. Furthermore, there is no AC adapter and it takes a lot of D batteries.  For us, it seemed to go through them more quickly than we expected. The stroller frame rocked a bit so it was not perfectly stable although there did not seem to be any real risk of it tipping. It is quite big, and so to move it around the house is a bit of a struggle.There are multiple setting for the swing but I didnt notice much difference between the highest swing setting and the lowest. The music options on this swing are not that great and we didnt like any of them. Unfortunately, despite being one of the more expensive options, this swing proved to be unreliable. First the sound went, then the motors went and now after just 3 months of use, it is nothing but an elevated baby bed.We replaced this swing with a portable bright starts swing that was half the price. There is no AC adapter on it either, but it takes C batteries and it seems to work longer without a battery change. The bright starts swing was simple to set-up and folds up quite compactly in a jiffy. We move it around the house and frequently take it with us in the car when traveling so our baby can enjoy it. The music is better, it has a timer, and the swing motor is whisper quiet. Furthermore, it has been reliable to date, with no problems.We w
B0018Z6910 I was looking through the Fisher Price Cradle n Swing products, and decided on the My Little Lamb \"color.\"  I didn't realize that it didn't come with an AC adapter or jack for one.  Well, I guess that is my fault.  It takes D batteries, and it seems to run forever on them.  We have had it running for approximately eighteen hours a day for two weeks, and it is still running well.The swing and the mobile are both very loud.  The mechanics inside the device click and grind, and you can hear them from the other end of the house.  I have to max out the music volume just to hear it over the machine.  We don't even use the music often, because the swing is so noisy.Our daughter is only six weeks old and weighs just under ten pounds.  Even on the first speed setting, she weighs so little that the swing goes super fast.  It looks like an amusement part ride, and she gets scared and cries.  We put a blanket over her that reaches down and touches the flood.  The added weight of this blanket and the floor contact help keep the swing at a comfortable speed.  She'll enjoy the swing and the mobile, and she'll eventually fall asleep happy.  She doesn't seem to mind the grinding sound, but we do.This swing takes up quite a bit of floor space.  This is for stability, but it is good to know that it is just over four feet wide and just over three feet deep, once it is set up.  The legs collapse to allow you to move it around.  That is a real nice feature, because we move it to the living room and the bedroom every day.  The swing isn't too heavy; My wife moves it without complaint.Overall, I say it is average.  The swing's footprint can't be helped, because it is for safety.  The loud mechanics need to be improved, and a jack for an AC adapter needs to be wired in.  The style is nice, the controls are easy, blah blah blah.  If it had those two improvements: mechanics and power, it would be an easy five stars.  As it stands, I give it three out of five for being useful but average.
B0018Z6910 Wish I had bought the powered swing instead of the battery one, but other than that -- great! Baby loved this until he outgrew it. As a newborn he had no problem napping in it and as he got older 4-5 months, he loved to play in it with a suction toy on the tray. The cover cleans well and holds up well in the washer and dryer. A must for new moms!
B0018Z6910 I really wish I could give this swing a higher rating. It's a lifesaver in terms of getting my baby to sleep for an extended time.  If you have a baby that hates to sleep in a bed, bassinet, etc. (swaddled or no) then you'll understand what I mean.  For the first couple of months we had to either hold our son while he slept or put him in the carseat or this swing in order to get some rest.  Now that finally sleeps in his crib we are able to use the swing just for naps or other short periods of time. The swing seems comfy, the fabric is soft and it's very cute.  We would have purchased it on Amazon but we got ours as a gift.All that said, the problem I have with this swing is that the motors seem to be faulty. At first, our swing made weird noises from time to time, which was annoying, but then it started making these LOUD creaking, whirring, disjointed noises.  It seemed like it was going to break apart at any second.  I changed the batteries a couple of times and still the same noises, and after I reread the reviews on Amazon and saw that quite a number of people had issues with the motor noise or said that the swing was supposed to be \"quiet\", I called Fisher Price customer service.  The representative was very nice and helpful, especially since she could hear the terrible racket the motor was making.  She ordered a replacement motor at no cost to me (after I provided my personal info and model number, item number, etc.) and the new motor arrived in about a week and a half.  So we replaced the motor (which includes the part with the mobile) and everything was perfect for about 3 weeks.  The swing was finally pretty quiet and, most importantly, did not sound like a safety hazard. It was so quiet we even had to use the white noise machine for the baby to fall asleep the first few times we used it.  BUT, the swing recently started slowing down--even after changing the batteries--and also making a little bit of noise.  I'm hoping that we don't have to go through the same ordeal all over again.  We'll see.Other cons:**One leg kicks up no matter what we do to arrange/rearrange the legs. It's disconcerting but it doesn't kick up enough that I have to worry about it tipping over.**Only runs on batteries.  It's true that the batteries seem to last a while, but I do wish it could be plugged into the wall.  Apparently the new bunny version does plug into the wall.
B0018Z6910 While we liked the Graco swing that we received for my baby shower, I wish I knew how much my son would love this one. His daycare provider has this swing in her home, and because of the reclining position and multiple swinging positions and speeds, it is the only thing he will sleep in during the day. The fabric is so soft and cushiony that he loves drifting off while rubbing it with his fingers. If we didn't already have a swing, I would have purchased this one in a heartbeat!
B0018Z6910 This is a very comfortable swing that has alot of nice bells and whistles HOWEVER the motor is just too weak. It takes a starting push when a baby over 12 pounds is in it. Also, I am going on my 3rd motor replacement from Fisher Price. That costs $50 if your not in warranty. Overall I would not recommmend this swing because of this.
B0018Z6910 We got this cradle and swing as a gift and unfortunately had to return it, because of the horrible screeching noise the motor was making... It also seemed like the motor was too weak (it's really tiny). We tested it with some weight in it and again, the noise was horrible and it seemed like the swinging motion slowed down (vs the empty swing) even though the batteries were brand new. Also, you can't plug it in into an outlet... I don't really know which cradle and swing to pick now (especially because it seems like My Little Lamb has the best rating out of all available swings on the market), since according to reviews all of them are making some kind of noise...
B0018Z6910 This  is a lifesaver when I need a hands free break. Puts the baby to sleep and I can eat lunch or shower, etc. He loves it. The one major negative is the ridiculously small saftery harness size. I have a 4 week old and the seatbelt would only fit a preemie I swear. So I only close one side (one leg). This item is otherwise 5 stars. Oh and assembly is a pain in the rear.
B0018Z6910 This is a godsend for us.  Our daughter wouldnt sleep in the bassinet everytime and she could brew up a storm if forced to.  Sleeping in our arms was the only option in these times until my wife bought this swing. This swing soothes her to sleep and we put it near a window and she drifts to sleep withing a few minutes. The tunes are very pleasant.  Its also good when she is awake and the mobile keeps her busy.  We love this swing.  Would recommend it to all parents.
B0018Z6910 This swing would be great except for the awful griding noise it makes when operating. On moms' boards online, moms said the noise could go away by:- adding weight to the swing -- didn't work for us- waiting (the swing will make the noise until it gets up to speed, then stop)-- didn't work for us- exchanging the swing (not all of them make the noise)- calling Fisher Price for a motor replacement (babycenter.com moms noted the FP site cited \"performance problems\" with the swing and would send a replacement motor)Given that the swing never operated for us without this annoying noise, I can't give it more than two stars. Now we have a three-week old baby who can't use the swing, and the last thing we want to do is buy more swings at the store to exchange it (requires multiple swing set ups) or spend time on the phone with Fisher Price customer support.Save yourself a headache and buy a different swing.
B0018Z6910 We used this swing for our daughter for quite a few months. We loved that it could go side to side as well as a typical swing motion. There for awhile this was the only thing our daughter would sleep in!
B0018Z6910 We have not used the swing yet, but it seems to be very sturdy. Set up was easy and it looks great. Seems like a good mo
B0018Z6910 One of our most used items in the first 6 months. I was a little apprehensive about buying this item since it takes so much space but it was a life saver. It was by far one of our favorite items and it looks neutral in our living space which is great for a large plastic swing.
B0018Z6910 Our son is 4.5 months and 17.5 pounds, we started using the swing regularly when he was 1.5 months.  It has good qualities and no so good ones...Pros:* Two different swing directions* Variable speed to the swing* Mirror gazing ball and mobile* Deep, cradles baby nicely* Soft and warm* Good wide stanceCons:* Noisy motor* Batteries, no plug option* Rocks (and no, our floor isn't uneven- we laid the floor ourselves and can attest to it being level)* The mobile part stops, we would prefer that it kept going so long as the swing was on.* The slowest swing level really rocks the baby when they're light- we chose not to use it until he was about 10 pounds.All in all, we do like the swing and would recommend with reservations.
B0018Z6910 I am a little annoyed by Fisher Price because of this swing. We found our original swing (Fisher Price Cradle Swing Little Snugabunnyto be so indispensable that we had to buy one for the grandparents' house, too. For something different, we chose this swing rather than the same Snugabunny, also by Fisher Price.This swing is only battery operated and noisier - something I should have noticed in the product description, but annoying nonetheless. But, more importantly, it is considerably smaller than the other. It's not something we noticed at first, but as the baby grew, we realized that she was quickly getting far too big and unsafe for this swing, but fit comfortably in the other. Both swings say \"newborn up to 25lbs,\" but this is not true.10 months later, we packed up this swing two months ago, and the Snugabunny still fits her perfectly - and was a godsend when she developed a cold and needed to sleep more upright. Don't \"save\" a few dollars by buying the cheaper swing that will only last a few months. It's cheaper in the end to get the other.
B0018Z8BBQ This is one of my kid's favorite toys. It never gets old and she still loves it after 8 months.
B0018Z8BBQ I bought this toy for my son at around age 7 months.  At first, he showed little interest in it, but as he grew older, he started liking it more and more.  I like that it is small and compact, plays a variety of tunes, isn't too loud, lights up, and has the rolling rattle feature.  Depending on his mood, he will bang a key, kick the piano off his lap, or just spin the roller endlessly.  The toy has pleasant music that both my husband and I find ourselves humming throughout the day!  At 11 months now, my son still enjoys this toy.  It's not his favorite, but as long as I cycle through his collection every few days, he continues to find it interesting again and again.
B0018Z8BBQ My son loved this toy! The sound is the right volume- not loud enough to annoy parents, but loud enough that it will keep the baby's attention.  It was a fun toy for my 6 month old, but he was done with it in a few months.  I will be holding on to it for my future children.Great choice for a musical piano for babies that are just sitting up and crawling!
B0018Z8BBQ Oh how my son adores this piano. It has a permanent place on his high chair and captures his attention the moment we put him in it.When we first used this he was ~3-4 months and he would press on the keys a little. Now, at 6 1/2 months, he slams this thing around and we've never had any issues. He loves the spinning part on top with the little balls - he is simply fascinated by the way the balls spin around. He knows how to (accidentally) switch from piano mode to counting mode with the little lever too. When in piano mode (or just normal play mode, as you have the option or flute, piano or xylophone) he slams the keys down and thinks he's really playing. It keeps him occupied for long periods of time which is great.We used ours for ~3 months before the batteries it came with (3 AA) died but we've stocked up on plenty of rechargeable batteries at this point.Overall, a great toy to keep your young baby occupied and stimulated.
B0018Z8BBQ I was amazed at how fast my little one took to this piano. He was able to flick switches and push keys by four months old. He loves to play with it, bat at it, and roll around with it. It really encourages tummy time. The three languages are great (especially the French for my French Canadian heritage) and I'm sure that with coaching from myself and his dad that the piano will help him learn colors and numbers. I do wish it had at least two more keys, so that it plays a full musical scale.
B0018Z8BBQ This was one of my first \"big\" toys I got for my daughter. she is 5 1/2 months old and needed something more substantial than a rattle or small toy to play with. She was immediately intriqued by this. She loves the fact she can bang on it and it lights up and plays music. She learned quickly how to make it work. She also loves trying to chew on the upper spinning rattle part which is hard to do but she always gravitates toward it. I can sit her in her bumbo and put this on her tray and it keeps her entertained for 20 minutes at a time which is saying a lot for a 5 month old. I would recommend this.
B0018Z8BBQ This Baby Einstein gift was colorful and looking like it was going to be really fun however when turned on we could hardly hear the sound.  Our 7 month old grandchild loved the colors and lights but grew bored (quicker than normal) when the sound was so low and with talking around him, he could not hear it.  We looked for the speaker and it was on the bottom, so when sitting on the carpet or blanket the sound was so muffled that you could not hear it nor the words.  I cannot believe a company would place that on the bottom.  Unless you have hardwood floors or expect that the child will control it on the table so that the sound could be heard is not realistic for this age or normal carpeted homes.  A real disappointment.
B0018Z8BBQ My 5.5 month old son is not fully entertained by this toy for long periods, but he does like the lights that come up on the screen.  He does not use the roller part at the top for making noise.  I'm hoping he starts to like playing with this more as he is more able to sit up on his own.  It's kind of difficult to play with this until they can sit up.
B0018Z8BBQ Right now my daughter love the rattle part of it. She is only 6 months. I love how it has multi funtions (piano, flute, etc, french, english, spanish language, numbers, etc.  Bought this from amazon warehouse and glad I did.  not a problem with it.
B0018Z8BBQ My son has been playing with this BI piano for the past 2 months and has really enjoyed it. He is now almost 5 months and still enjoys it and is more able to press the keys as he is getting older and stronger. My only complaint is that when in the # mode when you press a key it says the corresponding number, but the next key you press it plays music instead of saying the number. Not sure why they would have designed it this way because it makes it harder for kids to learn numbers with it. The speaker is on the bottom of the toy which is kind of odd. It makes it difficult to hear the sounds if on a soft/squishy surface but I prefer it to be a little on the quiet side as opposed to too loud and obnoxious. Great 
B0018Z8BBQ I got this for my son when he was born (okay, too soon I know haha) He started playing with it when he was around 4months and starting at around 5 months he was consumed by this thing. He is 6 months now and we can't even have it on his play mat with other toys cause he will just reach for this! The spinning thing on the back just keeps him so busy...plus smacking keys!You will be happy you got this small size toy...so much fun for babies!
B0018Z8BBQ This works great for so many ages in the first year.  Tummy time, sitting, crawling.  We love this at our house.  Easy for kids to use, great music and it lights up. Doesn't get much better than that.
B0018Z8BBQ My baby loves to hit number 3 on this thing. The music doesn't annoy me and she seems to like it as well. It has some of the same music as her Gymini and Fisher Price mobile so I find myself humming along and pressing the buttons to finish the tune :) Very entertaining, I sit it in baby's lap and she has fun for a long time.
B0018Z8BBQ We bought this last year when our son was about 4-5 months old and he is now 14 months old and still likes to play with it. I would recommend this to others!
B0018Z8BBQ Love this little piano! All toys are pianos these days, so it's a bit of overkill, but I love that this is petite enough to sit in my little boy's lap AND the raised numbers on the keys make it an interesting texture experience for him.  We use the Spanish version for fun and the Einstein bright lights are great. Haven't had any problems with the speaker being on the bottom of the toy.
B0018Z8BBQ We got this piano used from a friend. It was used from 3 girls already and my 17 month old plays with it since she is around 9 month old. It got thrown around, had lots of accidents and it still looks great and plays music. We really love it and it's a nice sound so it doesn't drive you nuts like other sound toys.
B0018Z8BBQ I bought this for an infant at the time he was three months...well a year later he is still playing with it and it is the first thing that he picks up and drops..yes it has been dropped over and over and it still plays.  I now have a 18 month that I am caring for and she loves it too.  They both dance, baby dance, it is so cute.  They have their favorites songs and click their tongues to the tune.  I just love watching them.
B0018Z8BBQ This piano is very cute...with the English Spanish and French it is something he'll use for a long time....the keys are easy to press and the different musical sounds are great....my son loves this even as he's getting older he still plays with it!
B0018Z8BBQ A very cute toy! I thought there was going to be a bit more to it, it is kind of simple, but she loves it! It is a quiet toy which is very nice! You kind of have to push a little hard on the buttons, but my 6 month does pretty well with it! It's fun and you can mix it up some with the couple of different things to do. Worth the money!
B0018Z8BBQ Bought this for my 6 mth old baby .Pros1. affordable.. a baby toy for a price that does not burn a hole in your pocket.2. very entertaining for a 6 mth old. My baby will spend long time on this toy and not get bored easily.3. a form of entertainment:a. lights up whenever a key is pressed.b. keys are easy to press, for a baby.c. rattles keep my baby entertained.d. can choose if you want it to be a piano, flute or xylophone. also, there is option if you want the sound to come out as notes, music or numbers (it will say out the numbers in 3 different language, english, spanish and french.. you can choose which language you want.. AMAZING!)4. small and light5. no sharp corners or protruding parts that may hurt baby.Conscant think of any so far!!One reviewer mentioned that the speakers are under the toy so the sounds will be muffled. I have placed the toy on our bed and we have no problem hearing the music. so that is not a problem for me.If you have a 5 mth old baby and above and are out of ideas on how to entertain the little child, this will be your best bet.
B0018Z8BBQ My 5 month old loves this piano. It is perfect for tummy time. She loves the lights and the music and there are several different settings so it isn't the same noise over and over again to drive mommy crazy. =)
B0018Z8BBQ My daughter has been using this since she was 4 months old. She's now 9 months and is still playing with it. I don't think it's teaching her anything - but she seems to love to bang on it and roll the wheel at the top - and at the end of the day - isn't that what we want from a toy ? Something our kids will actually play with :)
B0018Z8BBQ To most babies love to make sounds, my grandson is no exception, is delighted with his piano. I recommend it for children between 1 and 3 years old.
B0018Z8BBQ This is a perfect toy for a baby who is just starting to be interested in pushing buttons and seeing results. Like most Baby Einstein toys who has beautiful music as well!
B0018Z8BBQ Its not the most used toy i have for my son but he likes it. I would say that this should go to a older child like 12 months or more.
B0018Z8BBQ My four month old loves this. Came in the box playing music cause the sound was switched on so wondering when I'll have to replace batteries. The only negative is the speaker is on the bottom of the toy. So it's muffled unless its sitting on their lap
B0018Z8BBQ My son loved this from 3 to 8 months. At 11 months he bangs on it every once in a while but it's not his favorite like it was when he was younger. But he got many hours of enjoyment out of it as an infant.
B0018Z8BBQ This toy was recommended by a physical therapist for tummy time.  My son loves it.  He'll stay on his tummy playing with me and this toy for well over half hour.
B0018Z8BBQ I think this is, so far, my wife and mine favorite toy we have given to our daughter. Our baby is currently 8 months old and enjoys this toy. Granted, a lot of times she just picks it up and tries to \"eat\" it, but even then it still serves it purpose! As she grows older this toy will continue to work for her.Very pleased with all the options this toy has:- Two volume levels. The highest volume isnt super loud, and as some reviewers have noted the speakers are on the bottom so it is slightly muffled sometimes. On the other hand, we've had some baby toys that are annoyingly loud so its nice to have a regular noise level toy- The keyboard has three settings: regular keyboard (pressing a key plays one note), song play (pressing a key plays one phrase of a song, has about 3-4 different songs), counting (playing the key says the number written on the key)- The keyboard also has three sound settings: piano, xylophone, flute (i think i am remembering those correctly)- A language setting, so the counting can be done in english, Spanish, or frenchSo as you can see, with all these options, this toy is very versatile. I am very pleased with how reasonably priced this toy is. It runs on AA batteries and comes with batteries already installed.If I had any complaints, i would say the sometimes the keys dont register a hit. For teaching cause and effect, it would be great if the keys always registered a hit when the baby touches it, but it is good enough. (Like sometimes when i am showing my daughter which key to hit, it wont make a sound, but i can hit it again the exact same way and it will register a hit then).
B0018Z8BBQ The only reason I am giving it 4 stars is because it's not that loud and some of the levers aren't as kid-friendly (i.e. it's hard to tell which selection they made).  My daughter likes it ok but it's not one of her favorite musical instruments
B0018Z8BBQ This is a great toy for my 9 month old niece who is just learning to crawl. Anything that can hold her attention and keep her stationary for a few minutes is wonderful! She loves pushing buttons and hearing sounds and this keyboard is big enough that she can do so with ease. She loves the way the lights on the screen flash and she enjoyed playing with the bead filled rattle on the top, too.  I love the size - it's compact - and the music has enough variety that it won't drive you crazy. There are different volume settings and while the speaker is on the bottom and muffles the sound, it was more than loud enough for her on the loudest volume setting. Highly recommend!
B0018Z8BBQ My son is 9.5 months old and has been enjoying this piano for several months.  At first, he just liked to play with the spinning tube with the balls on the back/top.  He didn't really get that the keys made noise.  But now that he is older, he plays with the keys as well and knows that moving the little meters will change the types of noise he can make.  This piano is really quiet when face up, but my little guy is obsessed with the speaker underneath & likes to play with it upside down so it is a bit louder that way.  The music is less obnoxious than most of the other music/electronic toys out there, so that is nice.  And it is a really durable toy.  Overall, we have been very happy with it.ETA - My son is now 14 months old & lost interest in this toy at around one year.  Hope this gives folks an idea of how long this one will last.
B0018Z8BBQ Great piano. We've had it for about 6 mo. now, and it has lots of options for different sounds, different languages. My son has liked it even when all he could do was spin the wheel on the top to now when he's figured out to press the keys and change the options above the keys. The batteries have lasted this whole time with the piano being turned on all the time.
B0018Z8BBQ The speaker is on the bottom of the toy so she can't really hear the music.  However, she does enjoy spinning the beads on top and the colors it makes when she pushes the keys. It's kind of big and clunky for what she enjoys about it though.
B0018Z8BBQ This little toy piano is a great toy... the \"piano\" function is fun, the foreign languages are cool but over my baby's head at this point, and I like the way that it can also play real music (much to baby's bafflement). This is great for babies who are too little for a real glockenspiel toy--too young for motor coordination. I wish that it had a full scale--its impossible to play most simple tunes--but it is a solid start for letting babies make music!
B0018Z8BBQ My son didn't find it as engaging as all the other reviews. I wish I would have purchased the FP laptop for similar price instead.
B0018Z8BBQ My 7 month enjoys this toy enough but the speaker is on the back of the toy which is usually on the floor- not a very genius decision for Einstein baby.
B0018Z8BBQ My 6 month old son likes this piano. The lights and music keep him entertained and I like the multiple settings. My only complaint is I feel like it doesn't function properly when set to numbers. Sometimes it says the number and sometimes it plays music instead. Not a big deal but still knocked a star off for it.
B0018Z8BBQ I received this as a gift for my 11month old, it is small and still entertains. I like how you can choose 3 languages for your child to listen/learn from. This will be great if you need something for a car ride or need to distract a baby, but don't want a big bulky toy.
B0018Z8BBQ this toy is decent enough, has three different languages and several music modes. my 8 month old daughter just finds other toys more interesting i guess so until she really sits down and plays with it i can't give much more of a review!
B0018Z8BBQ Piano is a hit with 8 month old.  Perfect for when baby is starting to sit up and crawl and play with toys while on their belly.  volume control is great (=not too loud so won't damage their ears), and settings are nice.this is a great toy and a great price.
B0018Z8BBQ The music never gets old.  Especially when my son plays for me.  I like the amount of options for the price.
B0018Z8BBQ I love how this toy has basically 6 different modes. There is the red toggle to give you 3 different ways the keys played will sounds 1) Numbers mode 2) Music mode 3) Piano mode. The numbers mode and music mode are similar in that the music mode when you press 1 key on the toy will play a little melody and while in numbers mode, it either does that or a voice will call out the # on that key. The piano is basically you press the key and 1 note is played. Any time a key is pressed a colored light goes off in the plastic window in the middle.The yellow toggle on the right side lets you pick out how the music sounds 1) Clarinet 2) Xylophone 3) Piano and that is kind of self-explanatory. \\There are also 2 yellow switches on the bottom. The one below the orange key is to control the volume, I just leave it on the highest volume setting. The switch below the purple key is to switch languages for the numbers mode 1) English 2) French 3) Spanish and I just leave it on English.The rattle spinning toy on the top is also another thing that I didn't expect to like but the baby loves it so I do too! Sometimes the baby rather spin the rattle than press the keys.The only drawback to this toy is that the speakers are on the bottom so if the playback volume is severely compromised if you leave it on a flat surface to let the baby play with it. That means you have to hold it up in your lap while the baby plays in order for the playback volume to be normal. I wish the speaker holes were on the sides to accommodate that because it's very natural to want to set down the toy and have the baby play it like that!Overall, it is a decent toy for the price with that 1 flaw.
B0018Z8BBQ my kids got sick of this very quickly and ended up being annoying to them. ended up in the toy/junk pile.
B0018Z8BBQ My daughter is seven weeks old so she doesn't really play with much at the moment, but the lights, music and spinning rattle keep her attention wonderfully! Certainly a toy I think she will play with for a while! Really glad we got this for her!
B0018Z8BBQ My daughter loves this.  I don't know why but she prefers to roll the top rattle part with her feet and steps on the keys with her feet.
B0018Z8BBQ This toy appeals to parents because the music isn't obnoxious, its marketing promises a brilliant (bilingual) baby, and it isn't very expensive.  The reality is there are so many switches, settings, and keys on this thing that it's all but impossible for your child to learn cause and effect.  My son seemed interested in the toy, but grew frustrated after a while because the effect of hitting the red key with the setting on Spanish with one knob turned to the picture of the metronome with the other knob turned to the picture of the violin was completely different from the day before when he hit the red key with the setting on French with one knob turned to the picture of the keyboard and the other knob set to the picture of the clarinet.My mother gave this toy to my son envisioning a valedictorian or the reincarnation of Beethoven.  I ended up lying to her, telling her the toy was great, and sending it to the thrift store.  If you want your toddler or baby to learn about music and cause and effect, simply put them in front of a keyboard or piano.  Overall, we've found that while they have a great marketing campaign, Baby Einstein makes pretty poorly designed baby toys.
B0018Z8BBQ I purchased this with three different toys. When they arrived I was so excited that they were here that unwrapped everything and threw away the packaging before my daughter and I played with the toys. I wish I wouldn't have done that because I would have without a doubt returned this item.It is made well, but the music and sounds are terrible! I don't get what all the fuss is about?!? My niece has a piano of a similar style made by fisher price. I wish I would have purchased that piano instead, but I was swayed by the overwhelmingly positive reviews. Sadly, I am so UNDERwhemled by the sounds and interactive qualities of this piano. Ugh... Live and learn I suppose.
B0018Z8BBQ MY 8 MONTH OLD LOVES THIS TOY SHE GOT THIS AS A CHRISTMAS PRESENT AND I LOVE EVERY THING ABOUT IT.
B0018Z8BBQ My 3 month old baby girl loves the lights! She's not quite pressing buttons yet, but I just have to press a buton or roll the rattle and she's transfixed!
B0018Z8BBQ This is a very durable toy, with good speaker quality, great battery life, and engaging music/lights/language. Our daughter has a lot of fun playing with the piano, and it's held up very well to her drool and throwing/dropping it on hard tile flooring. The only downside I can find with it is that the 'mode' levers move a little too easily and this can frustrate a young baby who is expecting one reaction and gets another. Overall, well worth buying.
B0018Z8BBQ This, like all of the other Baby Einstein toys we own, did not disappoint. As a matter of fact, it is probably our favorite! There are many options to this toy, including reciting the numerals aloud in 3 languages. The speaker is located on the bottom, so the sounds are not blaringly loud. Great for tummy time! Really motivates the baby to crawl toward it, and the buttons are large and easy for little ones to activate. The bonus is the top part, which my daughter loves to make spin, and hear/see the beads move all around. You will not regret this buy!
B0018Z8BBQ This toy survived a spill, a washing, and plenty of good baby beatings! It has six different settings and plays a decent variety of songs. My baby loves the spinning toy on the handle and the way the piano lights up as you push buttons. The only wish I have is that it be a bit louder because the sound get muffled by carpet since the speaker is on the bottom of the piano. Otherwise, simply a perfect toy for babies!
B0018Z8BBQ I love this and so does my son! I got this for him for christmas when he was just 4 months and it has helped him love to be on his tummy! at first he just loved the spinning rattle thing at the top but now loves the lights and pressing the buttons...this also helped him rollover for the first time because he wanted to play with it so bad! I recommend this to anyone!  My son is very active and this holds his attention better than anyother toy!
B0018Z8BBQ My son loves this toy, he smacks the keys and spins the top.  I agree with the other reviewers; it is very annoying that the speaker is on the bottom of the toy.  If you can prop it up slightly, the volume increases significantly.  We keep this on high high chair for dinner entertainment, and it has been a very successful occupier of his time.
B0018Z8BBQ Our eight-month old has not taken to this product much.  She mostly just spins the tube of balls on the top of the toy.I find the toy somewhat disappointing:- When in numbers mode, it for some reason alternates between saying the number and playing music.- The selector for instrument and mode do not line up with the graphics well.- The piano keys require more force to press than our baby can muster at this point.  She slaps them and nothing happens most of the time.
B0018Z8BBQ This piano is great and does a lot.  It plays like a keyboard, plays classical musical, and also counts.  The two things that my husband and I like best are the fact that the music is pleasant and the volume is soft and really soft (not loud and more loud like most baby toys).  My daughter loves to spin the rattle at the top.  It also counts in Spanish and French...up to 5.  I think that feature is a little unnecessary, but who cares.
B0018Z8BBQ My son (now 9 months old) likes this toy - somewhat.  It can hold his attention for max 2-3 minutes.  There are better and more interactive toys out there.  I would recommend to keep looking.  Also, the music is really low as the speaker is on the bottom and it gets muffled.
B0018Z8BBQ My 7 month old daughter loves this toy!  She has been playing with it every night for the past month and has not grown tired of it yet.  She loves the rattle on top too!
B0018Z8BBQ This is very cute and good for a baby who just bangs it with the hand because it works easily that way.  I don't know why, but my grandkids lost interest in it pretty quickly.  I'll put it away for a while and see if they enjoy it later.  It isn't too loud, which is nice.
B0018Z8BBQ I didn't like the fact that this was the 2nd toy (in the same shipment) that did not work upon arrival.  After replacing the batteries, I love the fact that there is 3 different instruments that can be chosen and that it comes in 3 different languages when saying the numbers.  My daugther is only 6 months, so she is only interested in the lights and sound at this moment.
B0018Z8BBQ This is my son's favorite toy and has convinced him that tummy time is not that bad after all. It has been his incentive to start rolling over more. He loves the lights and songs and likes hitting the keys and the rattle. He has spit up on it several times now (in between the keys too) and it is still going strong! The songs are actually nice to listen to, not annoying at all! Great for getting him to sit in the bumbo too.
B0018Z8BBQ If this will be played with on carpet, you will definitely notice muffling, but we did not notice until it was placed on a couch. Even so, my kids don't seem to mind, and they are humming classical pieces. This gets brownie points for having a French option, too.For anyone wondering, here's a list of the pieces featured on this toy:Contradance No. 11, BeethovenNocturne No. 6, K239, 3rd movement, MozartSonata in F, BeethovenRondo a Capriccio in G, Op. 129, BeethovenPiano Sonata in A, K331, 3rd movement, MozartSonata in D for Two Pianos, K448, 1st movement, MozartPiano Sonata in F, K533, 3rd movement, Mozart
B0018Z8BBQ My daughter outgrew this little toy a while back, but we still keep it around the house for our friends with small children.  It has always been a nice, easy toy for kids to manage... my girl loved the bright lights on the center \"screen\" and she enjoyed pecking at the little piano keys.  Highly recommended!
B0018Z8BBQ I should have listened to the other reviews. The speaker is on the bottom and its hard to hear the music, especially if the baby is on a soft surface like a bed or play pen. I find my daughter constantly tipping it upside down to listen to the music. It does play really nice classical music and had number sounds in Spanish, English and French. She does love the rattle on the top and spins it constantly.
B0018Z8BBQ We purchased this Piano for my 1 year old daughter. She absolutely loves it. She loves the different sounds it makes and sings along with them.
B0018Z8CN8 We did a lot of research when it came to tubs. Perhaps more than we should have. I knew we wanted to stay away from fabric sling insert tubs because of not only how cold it would get for babies but also because of the problems with mildew. Perhaps I'm incorrect in my thoughts but this was a common problem I read in reviews. I looked at top of the line tubs and can honestly say this is where we landed. I was a bit reluctant because well it didn't look as fancy. I know, I know how bad that sounds. But let me tell you, I'm so so glad we went with this tub. My daughter is now 8 months old and has used this since we brought her home from the hospital there was no need to bath her in the sink this has worked so well. The little hump in the middle helped prop her up and still does while she plays in the tub. She loved to move a lot in her first few months and never once did we have a slipping problem.The con to this item is that it doesn't fold up and does take up some space. So if you are tight on space I would perhaps look for something more compact or that has the ability to reduce in size when in storage.
B0018Z8CN8 We've used this tub with our twins from 5 - 18 lbs. so far. The bumper was enough to support them even in that early stage. Neither of them fell over or slid down into the water (bathed separately by the way), and the no-slip back seemed to help keep them upright, plus, it doesn't get cold like the hard plastic. They love having water poured on them with the little orange fishy shower thing. When it came time to remove the bumper, around 17 lbs. and 25 inches tall, I found that part very hard. There is no easy release button. What finally worked was pushing the sides out, as there is a little round piece that goes into the sides, and then removing the thing upward.
B0018Z8CN8 Great tub. Skip all the gimmick features of other tubs and just get one that fits its purpose, bathing. The butt stopper works wonders for keeping your infant in place and it definitely grows with your child (for about a year). It does attract mold under the butt stopper, so be prepared to remove it occasionally and clean.
B0018Z8CN8 I love it! Has been served us for 8 months already! Its very convinient and safe! GET THIS ONE! All the swing ones are SO lame!
B0018Z8CN8 This tub is affordable and excellent.  my newborn can sit comfortably during the bath. The newborn bar comes out too so when he is bigger he will have more room.  There is a drain in the tub too to make it easier.
B0018Z8CN8 I really love this tub because its quite big and grows well with the baby. It works really well for a newborn and when your child can sit up on his own you can remove the insert and he can sit in the deeper end of the tub. We used this tub until our son was 10 months old and over 21 lbs. At the point he wanted to move around more so we ended up putting him in the regular tub. It was great being able to use this whale tub for so long though because it saved us a lot of water from filling up the regular tub.
B0018Z8CN8 I couldn't love this tub more!!! I was given it as a gift, even though I thought I didn't need a tub... What was I thinking!?!? This tub is awesome!! My baby LOVES baths because of it!! Oh, and she LOVES kicking her feet around and splashing! :-) She lays on the foam part, relaxing in the warm water! It is the perfect depth to keep her warm! It saves on a lot of water because I don't have to fill the entire large bathtub- just the her little whale tub. And my baby feels very secure. My sister bought the same tub for her baby as they both loved it so much after using our tub!!  I love how it is easy empty with the drain spout. I used this on our kitchen sink when she was tiny; now I place it in my bathtub.This is one of my top 3 baby items I recommend (along with the Boppy and the Jumperoo!!)
B0018Z8CN8 Our baby girl has just adored bath time in this tub from the day of her first full bath. The infant stopper seat and rubber lining make for a totally slip-free experience. As a first time mom I was so nervous about bathing her, and people would warn about the dangers & difficulties. When I bathed her in this, I didn't see what the fuss was about! Of course I'm still supervising her at all times, but I've never needed to adjust her body or hold her up, even in that early newborn wobbly stage. I can focus on washing her, sprinkling water on her with the awesome included sprinkler cup, and just generally enjoying her cuteness.
B0018Z8CN8 This tub is great. I've used it for three months and my little one likes it.The tushie holder is secure, she's never come close to sliding down under the water. There are also secure legs to keep it from tipping or sliding.The shape is adorable and functional, the angle of the tail keeps even the wobbly newborn head in a good place.A surprise was how useful the little toy that came with it is. It's like a tiny colander in the shape of a fish, I use it to wash her hair, it's  a very gentle shower.The amazon price for this tub is lower than any store I've found, I highy recommend.Update: One year into ownership and even with frequent uses it's still going strong. I've removed the tushie holder, little one needed more room. The colors, shape, and stability have remained throughout. I would purchase again.
B0018Z8CN8 This tub is very cute, and my son absolutely loves bath time.  I love that this tub has a little insert for infants instead of some of the more complicated sling mechanisms I have seen in other baby tubs.
B0018Z8CN8 I love this bathtub. It is very cute and I love how it has the pad in it so baby doesn't slip and the toy it comes with works good as a toy for baby and as a way to pour water on baby. Love it.
B0018Z8CN8 Love this tub!! Baby loves it too! The seat insert works great. Others complain about mold forming under the seat, but we just make sure to stand it up to drain after every use. We have had it for about 4 months and have no mold at all when we removed the seat to check.
B0018Z8CN8 We bought the Puj originally, but quickly realized it wasn't what we wanted. We needed something that would fit in the tub. This was perfect. It's a solid non-porous plastic surface so it's easy to clean, it has room to grow, and allows our baby to either sit up or lay down. You can't beat the price either.
B0018Z8CN8 I was a bit apprehensive about going against the conventional wisdom of buying a sling tub for my newborn but I was swayed by the cute look of this item and all the good reviews here. Turned out to be one of our best baby buys - our LO is almost ten months and we're still using this.We had no problems with it because our baby was pretty big and long at birth so the bumper was placed just right to keep her propped up. I can imagine that a smaller newborn might need to be supported a bit till it gets long enough to be held up by the bumper without slipping down. For us till the age of five months, this worked very very well for us - we would bathe LO first on a spread-out beach towel on the nursery floor and then on our bathroom floor. At around six months, our LO learned to sit up and began to splash around like crazy so since then we've moved this into our big tub to minimize mopping up all the puddles she was making. Once we removed the bumper, the depth and length of it are still comfortable for her and she likes to play and chew on the little orange guppy sprinkle toy that comes along with the tub. We plan on continuing to use it for another couple of months and then just transition her into the tub itself. But till then, this is great for our baby's bathtime.
B0018Z8CN8 This tub has been great, up until now.  My son is 4 months old & not sitting up yet.  He's too big for the infant side.  He wiggles around a lot & his bum is always sliding up over the bump.  His head is so high up now it's hard to rinse it without getting water everywhere.  I wish there was more of that non stick foam in there or there was a lower setting to move the bump to.  Other than that, this has been great, my son lights up when he sees it.  It's sturdy & easy to clean & he loves the little whale cup, he lifts his feet up so I can sprinkle it over them.
B0018Z8CN8 I am so happy with this purchase.  I originally bought the pink sparkle one, but had to return it because the box didn't include the screws.  After reading all the reviews, I finally decided to give this one a try.  The green mat helps keep my baby in place, so no sling is necessary.  In fact, I like it more than if it did have a sling with it.  I started using this tub when my daughter was 2 months old.  She's 4 months now, and I'm still loving that she can grow with it for another long while.  The little water toy is wonderful for rinsing the shampoo out of her hair.  I would definitely recommend this product.
B0018Z8CN8 This tub is great.  It is nice and big and offers room for baby to grow.  The contoured stopper is great for little ones and easily removable for when baby is able to sit up on his own.Easily props on kitchen sink or sits in bathroom tub...
B0018Z8CN8 Love this tub! My favorite thing about it is that it holds my daughter very securely while she's actually in the water. I must admit to never having used the tubs with the slings, but I couldn't imagine how that would be comfortable for a baby to be suspended over the water rather than staying warm actually in the water. The only benefit I could see to the sling style tub would possibly be a sense of greater security of not having to worry about your baby slipping under. That has never been a problem with this tub though.I consider myself to be a very cautious mom, and my daughter was a preemie, but I have always felt completely secure with her in this tub. The green bar holds her very securely from slipping into the deeper water. It can be a little tough to remove (I take it out from time to time to better drain the water to avoid mold or mildew build up underneath), but I consider that reassuring for safety reasons.While it has nothing to do with functionality, I find this tub to be completely adorable. My daughter will be using this tub for a long time to come, as well as any future child I am blessed with. Equally adorable for a girl or a boy, and definitely built to last through many children.
B0018Z8CN8 Great to use.  my kid then 3 weeks old now 8 weeks still love taking a bath.  I know he's comfortable because he's all smiles and would kick his feet around as if he was swimming.  Before getting this tub giving a bath was 2 people effort but now 1 person can easily do it.The green piece in the middle of the tub can be removed when the kid gets older.
B0018Z8CN8 this is a great tub.  the \"baby stopper\" is wonderful - it allows my 2 month old son to sit comfortably by himself without me having to constantly prop him up.  and when he gets bigger, i can just remove it.  i haven't had any problems with mold.  when i'm done, i rinse it out with water and stand it up so it will thoroughly air dry.  i also bought theFirst Years Sit and Store Parent Bathing Seatsince it was hurting my back and knees to bend over or kneel.  now when i bathe him in my tub, i can just sit with him and let him enjoy his bath time :)
B0018Z8CN8 I wanted to purchase this tub for my baby but when I went to get it, they were out of stock.  I'm so glad that I waited and got it instead of another one.  I love this tub and my daughter seems to think it's her own little spa!  It was very easy to put together, has nice hand grips on the sides for easy lifting and it works great even for a small baby who can't quite hold their head up yet.  The little whale scoop is adorable and fun to use.  The only thing I would kind of like is non-slip grips on the bottom of the legs. I have a small apartment and so the tun doesn't fit over the sink.  Instead I set it on the counter.  It hasn't been a problem or anything, but it would just be an additional plus if the legs had less risk of moving.  I do understand countertop use wasn't in the primary design, though. Overall, I love this tub and so does the little one.  Thanks, Fisher-Price!
B0018Z8CN8 We purchased the leacho first- the reviews were great and we thought how nice and snuggly it would feel to our lil newborn baby. Umm, yeah, what we didn't think about was how every time we wanted to bathe the baby, we would need to first make sure our sink was super clean (I'm a bit of a germaphobe when it comes to my babies- total of 4) and we would need to keep one arm occupied with the baby, and then we would have to wash out the leacho really well, and hang dry it. With the fisher price- it's a total dream!! The seat area is cushioned and cradles/angles the baby in such a way that she's totally secure. Then, it fits perfectly over our sink (meaning the tub part is in, but hovering, and the very front of the whale and tail, fit on the counter) and it has a drain plug so you can adjust the level of water. Plus, clean up is a snap! The baby loves bath time and now so do we!
B0018Z8CN8 This is the best baby bathtub! It's perfect for my 6 pound baby. She is well supported by the bump and doesn't slide down or slump over to one side. The size is just right to keep her in place so I can have one hand on her and one hand free to grab soap or the washcloth or towel. I started using it right after the belly button stump fell off when she was ten days old. I had another tub for my first baby, but this is so much better. If you've been looking for a good baby bath, this is it.
B0018Z8CN8 Great tub! It works perfectly in my kitchen sink even though my son is already four months old. It's been a perfect fit from day one. Really love the green insert for babies that don't sit up yet and the non slip pad is wonderful. The only thing is that it got a small crack on the side the first time I used it, but I might have done that- not sure. Other than that, it's perfect!
B0018Z8CN8 Originally, I had a different tub that was horrible - my baby would not stay in one place.  She would slide to the side and would scream the whole time.  It was a fold-up tub that I thought would be perfect. Bath time was a stressful experience that I dreaded.  Next I tried the sponge type of thing to bathe her that you lay the baby on in a sink or bathtub.  She hated being on her back and usually threw up when I used it.  I finally broke down and read a million reviews for baby tubs, and I finally settled on this tub.  My baby loves having a bath in this tub and she seems more safe in it.  Now I can enjoy giving her a bath.  She doesn't mind the green part that keeps her from sliding down - that was my worry.  She just sits there like a princess and smiles.  I've been using it from the time she was 3 weeks old to now (2 months).  I decided I had to write this review to save another parent my trouble with the other tubs!  I would highly recommend this baby tub.
B0018Z8CN8 My son enjoys his baths in this tub. I don't worry about him hurting himself on the sides. Babies only need baths every 3-4 days so that their skin doesn't get dried out (eczema). It cleans easily too. I recommend this tub.
B0018Z8CN8 I registered for this tub, bceause it was really cute.However, when I went to use it in my kitchen sink (my sink is one big bowl)... it doesn't fit.  Maybe these aren't meant to sit in the sink, but I do have one now from Babies R Us that does fit.Anyway, be sure to verify that it fits in the sink - if that's what you're planning on using.Otherwise, its a really cute tub!
B0018Z8CN8 My son is now 5 months old and this tub has served us both well.  I researched heavily any baby products before I actually purchased so trust me when I say this was a great buy.  It keeps him secure while we bath our son and he even tries his best to wiggle now but so far so good.  All my friends who are new moms have also gotten this tub for their newborns.
B0018Z8CN8 My 5 month old baby has been using this tub since he was newborn. He seems very comfortable in it and bath time is always fun! It is so easy to clean as well. I just take the middle part out and rinse off the soap and dry it. Only takes about couple of min. I've been doing this every day and the tub still looks like brand new. I would highly recommend this tub.
B0018Z8CN8 This is the perfect baby bath - we couldn't be any happier with it. It's everything you want and nothing you don't. Well - it does lack a place to store the scoopy cup but we fixed that with a mini carabiner and a key ring. Problem solved.Seriously, I've used a lot of baby baths in my time. This is the best.
B0018Z8CN8 A nice tub all around, we bought this for our newborn after using an older hand-me-down tub for a few weeks.Pros:- Narrower on the \"tail\" end so that a squirmy newborn won't end up sliding sideways.- Cute design also.- I noticed the non-skid portion for the base of the tub for toddlers.- Sieve cup included (my daughter is too young to play with it now, but I love little accessories)Cons:- I wish it was slightly deeper.  During the colder days/nights I like the water a bit higher (yes, I end up putting a warm washcloth on her chest) to provide a bit more coverage.- It would be nice if the little slide stop for the infant section (the green divider in the middle) had a small notch or handgrip to more easily pull it off.  The picture on the website has it but it doesn't exist.- Would be nice if the slide stop had channels for water to drain to the section with the drain hole.  As it is now, it either drains very slowly or you need to tip the tub over.- Drain would be nice if the whole tub had a slight angle towards it, so water would naturally drain without having to tip it or swish it around.  The drain stop itself is slightly higher than the tub, so due to the stop you need to tip it over to get all the water out.Also, mine came with the 'Fisher-Price' tag and the green foam for the back all askew.  Was a bit disappointed that they couldn't even put on stickers straight.Edit June 21st:I'm going to take off another star off this tub.  The picture they provide really isn't the same, the lime green slide stop isn't channeled and I've realized this is an issue.  I've discovered that due to the lack of a channel or any aerating, the under-portion of the stop and the portion of the bathtub being covered by the stop doesn't get to dry between baths and will slime up.  It would potentially get moldy and the baby could eventually be bathing in water sitting in mold/slime.  A horrible design.  I have to 'pop-up' the slide stop after each wash which adds a bit more time and makes putting away the tub more of a hassle.  They definitely need to change this.  I like to give the baby a rinse so she doesn't have soap over her after her bath and the stop keeps her in soapy water or makes draining too slow.
B0018Z8CN8 This has been a solid product and would recommend for other parents. I have not tried other types of baby-baths, but have no complaints at all about this one. The cup (fish) that comes with the tub is a great tool; the baby loves getting the water sprinkled on his head like a shower. The reclining position and shape of the tub seems natural and comfortable for him. I like that the inner lining of the tub is cushioned with foam-like material (and not hard plastic). Draining the water out of the tub is easy. All-around, it is just a very good choice.
B0018Z8CN8 Best tub ive ever had for a baby! great for when they are so tiny and also works for bigger babies by taking the divider out. Also saves on water!
B0018Z8CN8 Our baby loves taking baths in this tub! It's a great buy. I like that there are no \"extra\" parts like a sling or hammock - instead the baby's back rests against a soft padding (green in photo). Also, our young baby is kept from sliding down into the tub by a removable ledge, and her legs free to move and kick. Only negative? Our baby loves this bath so much that she splashes water everywhere at 2 months.
B0018Z8CN8 This is such a cute and simple tub! No rough seams or places for baby to get scratched. My 8 year old assembled it (attached the legs) all by herself in less than 5 minutes. The green leg bumper was tough to remove the first time but is easier now that we know how. You do have to put some muscle behind it that first time or two!
B0018Z8CN8 This tub is great because:-it fit in my sink-it was stable on my mother's bathroom counter-I forgot about the \"legs\" and use it in my tub now, with no stability issues-it is easy to clean-it worked well for my baby with the width, height, depth, and cushion-it is still perfect for my large 18 month old so I don't have to fill an entire tub-it's cute-the orange fish is also easy to clean (no mold like in the squirter toys)-the orange fish is strangely fun for my childAll of my friends got the summer infant one with the sling--the sling seems hard to clean and not easy to use. I have a hand-me-down of that one without the sling; it doesn't seem to fit my toddler well. The top-rated review pretty much says it all!
B0018Z8CN8 This is the best bath tub.  Our son is long (3 months and 26 inches) and he fits really well in this tub. He loves kicking his feet around to splash in the water, and is kept warm because the water covers his body. The little bum bump is also removable for when he gets bigger/longer. It also comes with a little whale toy that sprinkles water on the baby. I have no complaints whatsoever about this tub!
B0018Z8CN8 I waste so much money on baby stuff. I tried two different bath slings before I finally bought this. My baby is hyper and starting rolling over early (about 10 weeks). I could not keep her on the first sling. The other was more like a \"seat.\" Her legs were too long for it, so that got thrown out.The whale tub works great for us! Her long legs fit just right. There is an insert we used until she could sit up on her own. She still has plenty of room to grow in this one. It is easy to drain, and she adores the little orange fish cup that came with this...in fact, we use it to rinse her hair.I highly recommend this, and most other fisher price products!
B0018Z8CN8 Everything about the tub is great, keeps baby sitting up, comes with a little cup for rinsing her head, it's a good size (she's 2 months now), and fits in the full-sized bathtub.
B0018Z8CN8 I got this tub after reading reviews of other models.First, other tubs that come with a mesh sling to support a baby are geared towards newborns.  The mesh sling is for washing the baby while it has the umbilical cord stump, which can't get wet.  Once the stump falls off, at about two weeks old, the sling is obsolete.  So, a mesh sling isn't really an extra.  For the first month, I washed my baby by getting a bowl of hot water, and giving him a sponge bath with a wash cloth, one part at a time, and then drying that part before moving to the next.  Drying each part before moving to the next kept him from getting cold.The Whale of a Tub has two extras for baby:  the green butt bumper, and an orange fish shaped sprinkle cup.The green butt bumper works to hold my one month old baby up in a sitting position.  I keep a hand on him always, but that hand is there just in case and not because I have to hold him up.  The butt bumper also separates out the water a little, so be sure to use an elbow to check temp in both the butt area and the feet area before putting baby in.  When baby gets big, the butt bumper is removable, so the tub can fit a larger toddler as well as a baby.The orange fish sprinkle cup is a cup with holes in it, so you can shower parts of baby.  This is good for washing soap off.  One month old is too young to be interested in toys, but from reading other reviews, the cute brightly colored sprinkle cup becomes a fun bath toy as the baby gets older (and continues to clean baby).The biggest drawback of the Whale of a Tub is that it takes up a lot of space in my one bedroom apartment.  I put a hook on the wall, and the is a hole for hanging the tub located on the whale's tail.  It's easy to hang and unhang the whale, and if I wanted to, I could attach a bigger loop to the hole on the whale's tail for easier hanging.  Still, it's taking up wall space where I can hang other baby things, like the bouncy seat.  Storing this on a shelf, or under a sink cabinet would take up all the space.  The Safety First folding tub www.amazon.com/Safety-1st-Space-Saver-Infant/dp/B006ZISPTE/ got good reviews and stores small, but is outgrown faster by baby.  That was my second pick which I ultimately didn't get, and every time I get this one down, I look back wistfully at the rejected smaller option.Ultimately, this tub is a good option for washing a baby safely.  I'm happy with my purchase.  I wish this took up less space, but almost all baby tubs take up a lot of space.Update:  At two months old, baby likes being sprinkled with the orange fish.  He seems really happy about being sprayed.  Baby is now about 14 pounds, and there is less room around him in the tub.  I'll post updates to see how this holds up as he gets physically bigger and is a tighter fit.  So far, he gets a bath in this tub on the living room floor, and has not realized that kicking will make a splash.
B0018Z8CN8 My little one is 6 weeks old, so I will update this review as he ages. Right now, at the newborn stage this tub is working great for us. We sit it on our bathroom vanity over the sink, and it is very stable there. My son fits well in the area designed for infants. The baby's bottom is supported by the green plastic piece in the bottom, and they lean against the green foam oval at the \"tail\" of the whale. My son enjoys sitting here submerged in the few inches of water at the bottom of the tub. When we're finished with bath time the tub drains conveniently into the sink.UPDATE: My son is now a little over 9 months. We removed the infant support once he was a very stable sitter. Even when he was very stable outside the tub, his bottom still had a tendancy to slide in the tub making him unstable. He's definitely gotten the hang of it and now sits more at the \"head\" of the whale where and enjoys splashing and playing. I like how the sides are rounded and comfortable for him to hold on to while he plays. We've also moved it from the top of the sink down into the tub due to the splashing fun. I'm still more comfortable bathing him inside it than in the big tub, because if he did happen to topple over, he can easily catch himself on the side of the whale. One drawback - our stopper seems to have warped or changed shape somewhat and is now somewhat difficult to fit into the hole in the bottom of the tub. Otherwise, great tub and we're still loving it.
B0018Z8CN8 This is the first time I have left a review on anything, but I really LOVED bathing my daughter in this tub. She was so happy in it! And I felt like it was very safe. There is a green little \"seat\" that is in the tub that keeps them from sliding down into deeper water, but she is still in enough water to splash around and keep warm. When she got old enough to sit up on her own, she loved to sit in the deeper tub part and splash around. It was perfect to fit over the sink, and the drain hole in the bottom was perfect. We definatly got tons of use out of it... we only stopped using it when she was strong enough to start crawling out of it, so we moved to our normal bathtub. I loved this tub, and am excited to use it for our next baby. I have also recommended it to many friends, and they have loved it as well!EDIT: My son is now 2 months old and we love using this tub just as much as I did with my daughter. I'm so glad I got this tub, I love it!
B0018Z8CN8 The tub is well built and very durable.  The seat positions are perfect, and it's an invaluable tool for bath time.  My son loves it.  It's easy to clean and a solidly built unit.
B0018Z8CN8 We've had this tub for 9 months now and love it.  Our baby is 9 month old, so I finally removed the insert portion of the tub.  Little did we know, mold was collecting underneath the insert the entire time.  I guess we failed to read the care instructions.  After a good washing, all the mold came out and our little guy has ample wiggle space now.
B0018Z8CN8 This little tub is sturdy, just the right size, and adorable!  The padded headrest keeps baby from slipping, although I also add the green frog sponge cushion.  It's lightweight and easy to move, and I absolutely love that the middle \"bump\" section can be easily inserted and removed as baby grows.  This is my 3rd tub, and I love it by far the best!  My baby loved it too!  Smiled and laughed and splashed the whole time!
B0018Z8CN8 I had this on for my first 4 years ago, at the time I was given others but I did love this one for the baby positioning the fact that you then adapt it to bigger kid, it's easy to clean and honestly, for a baby tub it's cute. when i was done with I gave it away. second baby around I thought I would go for something else with a transat and all as everyone was telling me that was the best... well, it took me 2 weeks, gave the fancy thing away and bought this one again, I love it again, baby is so much safer in it as it's snug enough to hold him in place but you can still maneuver around it's just one of those perfectly designed product, love love love it and recommend to anyone
B0018Z8CN8 The tub is very cute and easy to use and clean. The middle part that keeps the infant from sliding does come out for cleaning. You squeeze it until it \"pops\" off. I wish this tub came with some little toys instead of just one baby whale cup, other than that the one negative, it's great.
B0018Z8CN8 I bought this tub b/c of the price and the excellent reviews. I dont understand how everyone is giving it 5 stars. The newborn insert my baby outgrew before she was able to sit up unassisted so it has been difficult to hold her from going forward or from sliding down into the tub. I have to use an inch or less of water, i just leave the plug open that way if she slides down or goes too far forward then she won't go under water. It is frustrating and my back is sore every time from leaning over the bathtub, with her tub inside. Even when she fit in the insert there is no way to clean her private area because she is sitting down on them. I would have to hold her over one arm and pour water over the other. Now that the insert is taken out, i have to lean her back and put her legs all the way up to her chest to be able to clean her properly. That leaves her back uncomfortable. This tub will be better once she is bigger and cannot slide down into the tub or fall forward while sitting. For now I am going to look for a sling, like what i used when she was newborn.. only that sling broke and i'm waiting to get it replaced.
B0018Z8CN8 Works great, out newborn loves it! There is a partition that helps keep our newborn from sliding too far into tub. What's great is that you can use it in the tub or you can just use it on the ground in the bathroom. Overall a great purchase!
B0018Z8CN8 Bath times used to be a fiasco at our house but we saw this tub on sale and bought it. I guess it was a comfort thing, because our baby boy just loves this tub! He splashes like crazy, and the little cup that comes with it to shower the soap off of them is so perfect. It has holes in it so you can hold it over them like a shower, but the flow is slow enough that it doesn't scare them at all. My little one loves tht part of his bath too. It helps that the tub is extra cute too. I'd recommend this to EVERYONE!
B0018Z8CN8 My 2 months old grew out of the Pujtub and we decided to give this a try.Pros:+ very reasonably priced+ FUN design (but mostly for parents, especially early on)+ Great rinsing cup/toy included (orange whale)+ good non-slippery surface for the head and back.+ good infant stopper+ the tub \"grows\" with your child - remove infant stopper when she is old enough to sit.Cons:- Infant stopper is difficut to remove. I have to use something for leverage and apply a good amount of force to pop it out. Why do you want to pop it out if the baby is not yet sitting? --> because water gets trapped under it and mold WILL grow! So I have to remove it after every bath to dry the whole thing properly.- The drain does not close/open very smoothly. Again, have to apply force for this, but I suppose this way the water is actually kept in the tub.Other notes:Some reviewers complained about the drain being on the bottom and thus difficult to drain if the tub is sitting on a flat surface. We have enough counter space in the bathroom (and it's a very average size bathroom), to put on bath on it and this way the drain is conveniently positioned over the sink.The baby is only submerged to low waste level (the back is covered with water due to recline in the tub), but from researching other products, it seems to be a feature of all infant tubs. Have to keep pouring water on the baby to keep him warm.My baby is not sitting yet, will be interesting to see how he does in this tub when he can support himself and how long before he outgrows it.Overall: good tub, no regrets!
B0018Z8CN8 This tub is great, because it has a separator which is great for newborns by providing support against sliding down.  The baby is very comfortable in it and it fits in the kitchen sink.  The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because it is hard to let the water out of it with the baby in it, because the hole for letting the water out is on the left side and you have to tile the tub to let the water gush out of it, not a big deal just a little bit of a hassle that's all.  Overall it is a great tub and I would recommend it to friends.
B0018Z8CN8 My mom thinks it is hilarious that we need a tub instead of washing our baby directly in the sink. I like this product because it saves me the worry of dealing with a slippery, wiggling, baby in a small, hard sink!Assembly:I was surprised to learn that this tub requires some assembly. The back legs need to be attached with a long, Phillips screw driver. A simple process once the appropriate tool was located.Storage:This thing is huge. We shove it under our stairs closet when not in use.Clean-up:The drain is effective and makes clean-up easy.Price:Amazon is constantly juggling the price of this item. Sometimes it's ridiculously high (I'd risk the sink) and other times it's more reasonable. It fluctuated by 25% to 30% while I was considering the purchase, and currently it's 100% more than I paid! Check the local, brick & mortar prices and corresponding store coupons before committing. Better yet, just keep your eyes open for one at a garage sale.Newborn:My only complaint with the concept on an infant tub like this one is that its very difficult to reach baby's back and bottom while bathing. It currently takes two sets of hands: one to hold up, one to wash. I expect the problem to go away when baby ceases to be jelly-like. The tub is helpful because it raises the working height (at waist or elbow heigh as opposed to hip) and provides a shallower depth than the kitchen sink.
B0018Z8CN8 My son loves splashing around in this tub every night. The little whale toys is also great to pour water over the baby and for him to grab on to. Makes bath time fun for both of us!
B0018Z8CN8 We have used this till our son was 7 months old. The reason I gave it a four star & not a five is because its hard to take out the bump thing that holds him up and ....when we took it out even though he is long he would slide down. they really should have put something in it to make it not so slippery.
B0018Z8CN8 My son loves bath time. He takes a bath at least once a day (Sometimes twice). This tub is great.Its too big for the sink but we put it in the tub and works great. :)
B0018Z8CN8 The infant insert (little green bar) is perfect for supporting my newborn in the tub. This keeps her butt propped up so she doesn't slip into the water and the green no-slide stuff on the back keeps her from sliding side to side. It makes bathing her SO MUCH easier because I can take my hands off her for a few seconds to grab something or move something! The drain at the bottom of the tub doesn't work perfectly so I just flip the tub over when I'm done to let it dry out and I've had no issues. The functionality is amazing and it's so cute on top of it! Highly recommended.
B0018Z8CN8 its very nice product, i love because its like a real whole its not heavey weight and good quality, i recomemded
B0018Z8CN8 My mom was giving me grief about buying this oblong-shaped tub. She said they're often wobbly due to their long shape and its fun shape/design makes it seem impractical. Absolutely false! This tub is sturdy and its shape is fun, cute and practical. The tail end provides excellent support for baby and the head end holds plenty of water. I love the little fishy scoop. My baby loves his shower/bath combo. The green pad where baby's back lay against is made of this non-slip rubber; I think it really helps baby from slipping. The seat insert is solid and sturdy and you can remove it later when baby can sit on their own -- I didn't know that. The only thing I'm not too happy about are the legs that you have to attach/screw on yourself. You will need a long screw driver...which I don't have because I have those fat screw drivers with switchable heads/tips. Anyway, everyone loves the tub. Me, baby, daddy, and even grandma.
B0018Z8CN8 The tub is really cute, and it's easy to use since you can have both your hands free and don't need to hold an infant up with one.  My little one also loves the fish that comes with it.  We use it to sprinkle water over his belly and keep him from getting cold during his bath.
B0018Z8CN8 Save yourself the time and money and get this tub.  My son loves bath time and I think it has everything to do with the tub. When he was a tiny baby, I tried a different kind of tub only to find that only his butt was in the water.  This bath allowed him to actually be submerged in some water and was easier to bath him in.  At 7 months, I was able to remove the \"butt bar\" and place him in the deeper side of the tub.  I imagine he will be able to use this tub for a few more months!  He loves the tub and so do I!!!!
B0018Z8CN8 I must say that I always \"poo-pooed\" the idea of a baby tub. I never bought one for my son, who is now 3 years old. We always used the sink or the big bath-tub. My daughter, however, has made it perfectly clear that she does NOT like to lay down at all in the tub. She insists on sitting up and keeping her head out of the water. So I had to cave in and buy a tub. :-)After reading reviews on several different tubs, I bought this one, and I must say, that I am so glad that I did!! My 3 month old daughter loves this tub. She kicks and splashes in it and the insert holds her bottom well enough that I don't have to worry about her sliding into the water too much when I lather up the soap on my hands. She does not cry in this tub. She laughs and squeals during bath-time now and I couldn't ask for a better tub.This is an absolute excellent buy and I highly recommend it to anyone who needs a tub for a little one.
B0018Z8CN8 Fantastic bath for infant.  Really makes bathing pleasant for the infant and keeps them safe.  The baby's body position in this tub is great, and makes bathing pleasurable for the baby and parent.
B0018Z8CN8 love this tub!  she does not slip and it's very cute.  Easy to use, soft bottom and can be changed to an older childs tub
B0018Z8CN8 This was one of the first items I bought our baby before he even graced us with his presence. It really is such a cute little tub and comes with cute little toys. It was perfect for him when he was a newborn and it fit him well up until he needed to move onto the big bath because he was sitting up and ready to play. It fit great in the sink and very durable. It also never leaked!
B0018Z8CN8 One of my favorite purchases for the baby! Bath size fits perfectly for the baby. Not too big so easy to fill up and get the bath ready. Toy is fun for her. They designed it really well where the baby can be comfortable sitting with insert as infant and then sitting w/out insert when they are a little older. Highly recommend!
B0018Z8CN8 We received this bathtub as a gift for our 3rd child. I like it the best out of all the tubs we have had. It is cute (which my older kids like.) It keeps baby at a comfortable angle, my daughter never fussed. It was easy to wash her in, she did not slip down due to the bar that held her in place. It was easy to pick up, even when full of water so that I could dump it out. I bathe her on the bathroom floor so my older girls can help. Easy to rinse and wipe clean. Love this tub.
B0018Z8CN8 Not only is this tub adorable, but it's well-designed! I can give my 8-week-old a bath (and have since he was a week and a half old) using the little orange \"seat\", but I can remove it when he gets older. There is a green pad for his head, which is not that soft, but my baby doesn't seem to mind and it's better then him resting his head on the hard plastic. Also, the tub comes with a little orange fish toy that is like a cup with holes in it. I use it to give him a \"shower\". I love how this tub looks and my baby loves to take baths in it, so I'm happy!
B0018Z8CN8 I've used this infant bath tub since my baby was 1 month old.  It works great.  She kicks and splashes until the whale tub starts bouncing around the big bath tub and her head still stays above water.  We love the baby whale cup for rinsing her hair.  The water drips out of it very gently.My only concern with this tub is that it might not be big enough for an infant that can't sit unassisted and is tall.  My 3 month old is in 6 to 9 month size clothes.  She still can't sit unassisted and her head will soon be completely above the back of the tub, so that it will become too uncomfortable for us to continue to use if she can't sit unassisted soon.For a baby that is average to small in size or can already sit unassisted I would give this tub 5 stars.
B0018Z8CN8 I bought this on sale at a local store for $9.00.  It's perfect for newborns to about 9 months, depending on the size of your baby.  I love the little green barrier which keeps their bum from sliding down into the water when they're tiny.  Then when they can sit up without help take the barrier out.  It's small, easy to clean when necessary, and cheap unlike the $40 tubs they sell at fancy baby stores which take up a ton of room and have a silly amount of unnecessary bells and whistles.This one is exactly what we needed at a terrific price.
B0018Z8CN8 It has a little hump right about the whale's fin that keeps baby in place. Lightweight and easy to use. There's a plug at the bottom to let out water if it gets too full but drains slowly enough that if you are running water in it, it won't empty too fast. It's cute and dries quickly. The little cup that comes with it is useless- use something else.It's been in use 3 months now and is hanging in there nicely- which is saying something considering how hubby bangs it around. :)
B0018Z8CN8 my daughter is 21 months old and we are still using this tub...because she's too uncomfortable for the big bathtub, even if mommy is taking a bath with her.we started using the tub when we brought her home from the hospital and have used it ever since.  it was perfect as an infant because the stopper and rubber bottom kept baby from sliding too far into the tub.  at about six months, when baby can sit up, you can remove the stopper for more maneuverability in the tub.  we still use the stopper, she's still chilling lying back in the tub, and even though she's big enough now to hang out the sides,  it's still functional, she is comfortable and loves bathtime, and we are all very happy!the only thing i'm not sure how to handle is making room for the new baby when he gets here in a couple of months!
B0018Z8CN8 My baby outgrew the sink pretty quickly, so we bought this as the next step. He's now 7 months old and loves splashing around in it, and I know we'll get a few more months usage out of it, which is great for the price.  It provides good support, although you might want to cover your baby with a warm washcloth while bathing because the compartment they sit in doesn't fill up with much water, so they can get cold. My one criticism is I wish the drain hole were bigger; it drains a little too slowly.
B0018Z8CN8 I bought this for my baby on the way in May 2011 and it looks great. Its made out of pretty good quality materials and seems pretty sturdy. I had read the other reveiws on this product and decided with the multiple 5 stars and great price that I'll try it out.
B0018Z8CN8 This is one of those items that most people are going to review without having used an alternate product. That's true for me as well. But I can say this: I'm one of those new moms who scoured reviews and Consumer Reports to pick what to register for. I'd picked another tub that looked more sophisticated I guess, then ending up registering for this one since it was available at a certain store where it seemed ALL of my shower guests wanted to shop. And I've been totally happy with it.It's worked great for our baby since the time the cord fell off and he was allowed to get wet. And it seems like it will grow with him well. The green insert that he sits on is smart; it comes out to make room for a growing toddler. The little whale shaped cup that comes with it is a cute bonus. It has holes to sprinkle; that's a little annoying now if I want to use it to rinse him, but will be fun later as he learns to play with it.Our baby feels secure and enjoys baths, I feel he's safe in it (always supervised of course!), we've had no issues with it staying clean, the holds water and then drains well, no issues with the legs being sturdy... all in all, can't think of anything I'd change.
B0018Z8CN8 Sits over the sink perfectly and my son fits in perfectly and it keeps him upright. The plug on the bottom is super nice an it cleans up easily. You dont need a foam insert (which can become moldy and holds in bacteria).
B0018Z8CN8 nice tub .i gifted it to my friend for baby shower she loved it,said that their baby enjoyed bathing in it.
B0018Z8CN8 I got this one because it did not have a sling and it was padded at the back. I am so glad I did. It has a little hump that stops the infant/newborn from sliding down, but they can still be free to splash! My son LOVES it. He cannot sit up yet, but when he can, he might just like the toy bar also!
B0018Z8CN8 I didn't originally have this tub.  I registered for the Blooming Bath - and debated between that one and the Puj.  Both are pretty pricey and have their limitations and can only be used for a certain time period - and in a certain sink size.  After our son was born and his umbilical stump came off, I quickly realized that the Blooming Bath wasn't going to work for us.... he was little and squirmy and there's no way we would have been able to hold him and bathe him at the same time.  So off I went back to the store to return it and instead, I found this one.  I saw it had good reviews online so I figured for less than half the price - I might as well give it a shot.It's SO SO SO simple to use - and our newborn baby had no problem laying in it comfortably.  The little green insert in the bottom is a lifesaver - keeps him from sliding down, and the grippy green thing for their back to rest against keeps them from sliding all around while you're bathing them.  My son is 4 months old now and he absolutely loves bath time.... and I am pretty sure he loves this tub!  We still use it over the kitchen sink (which it fits perfectly on - everything is exactly correct, including the drain hole) although you could use it on the counter or table I suppose.  He loves when we scoop water into the orange fish thing and dribble it over him - my only complaint is that the fish thing could be a little bigger and hold a little more water so I don't constantly have to keep refilling it, but whatever - small detail.I also love that once he sits up on his own, we can remove the infant insert - and I like the fact that it's not one of those slings - I can't stand those.  You can put this directly into your bath tub to use also - which eventually we'll have to do as he's at the age where he kicks and splashes and our kitchen counter is soaked by the time we're done.Seriously though - do yourself a favor.  Don't waste your money on all those fancy, high tech infant tubs that are only good for a few weeks and are ridiculous to clean and put together.  This is the only tub you'll need for quite some time and at the price, you can't go wrong.  Fisher Price definitely knows a thing or 2 about baby products - everyone should register for this tub!
B0018Z8CN8 This is the third tub we own because my daughter was afraid of our larger tub and outgrew the sling-type bath seat. It sounds ridiculous but it is true that the whale cup is the best part. My daughter carries the cup around the house sometimes. I have to use a different cup because she won't share it in the bathtub.The tub fits well in our standard shower. We hung a bungee cord from it to hang dry.
B0018Z8CN8 I love everything about this tub. It's the right size, lovely colors that are not too garish. The little toy that comes with it is also cute and fascinating to baby.
B0018Z8CN8 I received this infant tub at my baby shower and I love it! I have been using it for 6 months now and the tub has held up beautifully. The green foam and the removable insert truly keeps the baby from sliding down into the water (plus those features allow me to use both hands to bath my son unlike other tubs where you have to hold the baby with one hand/arm). The tub is really is to clean as well (you don't have to worry about mold growing on it like tubs with the slings). This tub is worth every penny!
B0018Z8CN8 We've been using this tub for my son since he was a few weeks old.  We would've been using it sooner had we had it.  The plastic piece that you insert in the middle for newborns is wonderful because it stops your baby from sliding down into the tub.  You can decide how much you want your little one submerged in the water simply by how much you fill the tub.  I fill to just under his shoulders and he loves it.  Baby lays back and can kick his legs freely in the water.  He's almost 4 months now and is still using the insert.  Once he can sit up on his own I will remove it.  I plan on using this tub for as long as he still loves it and can fit in it, which will probably be awhile.  You can't beat the price for the quality and safety this bath gives.  The little whale toy it comes with is perfect for rinsing baby's hair.  Oh, and I love the fact that I don't have to clean out the big grown up bath tub every time I bathe our son!  His little bathtub only has his little germs and I wash it once a week which is fine.  Highly recommend this tub.
B0018Z8CN8 i kind of like this.  i tried out 3 other plastic tubs after my baby outgrew the puj tub, which i loved.  this one has a \"stopper\" in the middle to keep my 8 week old from sliding down into the water.  i wish there was a similar tub in white though.  and who likes these big plastic monstrosities anyway?  but my son loves his evening bath, they relax him completely.  so this is good for now.
B0018Z8CN8 CONS:- The green bump needs to be taken out so the tub can be cleaned as it collects toe jam and mold underneath. It is also a pain to remove (the trick is to pull apart the sides of the tub so it releases. Also, once your child is older and you remove the bump, the holes it snapped into are exposed. They need to be cleaned with Q-tips as crud gets lodged in there.- There isn't much support for an infant (tub is best for 3 mo +)- It never fit over my kitchen sink. I tried to use the tub over the sink (a single stainless steel 'regular' sink), it never worked. We always had to set it up on the counter or table.- You can't pop the drain with the tub resting on something, so if the tub is in your bathtub, you can't drain the water with the baby in it.- The tub was too small by the time my son was 8 months old, we moved on to a larger toddler size cheapo plastic tub. It's pretty much the same thing, just supersized.PROS:- It looks cute.- The toy is a huge hit. Really cute, really functional.- The green bump kept the baby from sliding down, the tub is large enough for play time.Altogether, I wasn't disappointed. In this price range, I think the tub is a great choice. If I did it over again, I think I would have stuck with my original tub choice, \"4moms Cleanwater Infant Bath Tub with Digital Thermometer\" - running clean water through the tub the whole time would probably beat using a cup to rinse off at the end of the bath, and once the baby starts crawling around, they do get rather dirty. Though, the Cleanwater tub looks rather small, I think my son would have outgrown it a lot sooner (which is ultimately why I chose the whale tub!)
B0018Z8CN8 I chose this tub over the ones with slings out of just personal preference.  I didn't quite like the idea of the sling.  Anyway, my baby has used this since he was about 3 weeks old and haven't had any problems.  Even when he was at his smallest, he wouldn't slip because of the infant insert.  Even when he could sit up, we still used the insert because it helped him balance better.  Overall, a sturdy and practical bath tub.
B0018Z8CN8 it provides great support for babies and unexperienced mothers, i would buy this item a thousand times! easy to use and very secure, no complains!
B0018Z8CN8 Baby loves his bath time and this Whale Tub has served the purpose well.He's still small so we're still using the insert.  Tub is comfortable and safe, no slipping down into the water.
B0018Z8CN8 We bought a more expensive tub first and returned it, after which my mom bought us this one. Needless to say, it was perfect. We used it when our baby was tiny with the little butt bumper in, and now that he's almost eight months old we use it without the bumper and he just sits up in it (I lay him down to rinse his hair). We'll use it for as long as he fits! The little orange cup is one of his favorite toys, and the price is excellent too.
B0018Z8CN8 I'm using this tub for my 1 month old baby and he loves bath time!  This tub is also very easy to drain and clean after baths. He stays safely in place thanks to the foam back and the bottom bar. I definitely recommend this tub.
B0018Z8CN8 We somehow lost our hand-me-down whale tub when we moved recently, and I HAD to find another one! Both of our kids have now very much enjoyed bathing in the whale tub as infants. The little &#34;bump&#34; where the baby's booty sits is perfect, and it's the perfect size for the tub. We will be keeping up with this one for a possible third baby!
B0018Z8CN8 Even before we purchased this from the store, we noticed that there was scratch marks on the foam where the baby's head rests. While this doesn't affect the great quality of the bathtub, it would be nice if they could find a nice alternative to the foam.
B0018Z8CN8 Got this for baby shower, adorable tub that I can see being used from baby to toddler. Easy to set up and seems sturdy.
B0018Z8CN8 I really think this is the best baby tub on the market.  I didn't want to mess with the slings that some of the tubs come with.  We just waited until my son's cord fell off at 4 days to put him in here.  He cried through his first bath, but has loved every single bath since.  We bathe him nightly to establish a bedtime routine.  I like that this tub doesn't have a shampoo holder or any annoying crevices to clean.  The only thing you have to remember to do is take off the green seat piece from time to time and clean under it to make sure no mold grows there.  The piece can be hard to remove, which is the reason I gave 4 stars.  Otherwise this tub is perfect.  It's also adorable.
B0018Z8CN8 I bought this for my brother for his baby shower.  He got FOUR baby baths that day, but this one was by far the cutest of them all.  I am confident he will be returning the other ones and keeping mine :)
B0018Z8CN8 I had to find a tub after my baby outgrew his puj tub which is awesome! I picked this one based on the reviews. It did live up to the hype! I love the lil seat that the baby can rest on. The orange toy it comes with is great when I have to rinse his hair. No more water running down his face! I just wish the seat was adjustable for larger babies that can't sit up unassisted yet. It would be nice to have them lower in the water. Also, there should be a piece of grip in the bottom so when baby is big enough you don't have to worry about them slipping around. Overall, I'm very satisfied!
B0018Z8CN8 I bought this as a secondary tub for when my son is visiting with my mom, and like it better than the fancy tub he has here at home. I like the angle, it's lightweight, and easy to maneuver.
B0018Z8CN8 This was our son's first bath tub and we are still using it at 8 months.  I gave it 3 stars because it worked better at certain ages than others.NEWBORN:We had to hold his head from flopping to the side and he was too short for his butt to rest on the green butt-bumper so it was functional but logistically a bit tricky.  We stuck it on the counter in our bathroom and because it wasn't as large as some of the other tubs, it was workable.3-5 MONTHS:Before our son could sit up on his own this was the PERFECT time for this tub.  His head rested comfortably on the green foam (although not too cushy, just a non-slip type pad), and his butt could rest on the green bumper to keep him from sliding down.  The angle of the tub back was perfect so he didn't get water in his ears but we could fill the tub up to keep him warm.  We still put a warm washcloth on his chest in the winter to keep him from getting chilled, but in a warm bathroom this wasn't necessary as their was enough water in the tub.6+ MONTHS:Now that he can sit up on his own, we took the green butt-bumper out and he can sit comfortably in the deep end of the pool facing either front or back.  He can splash and play and we can still lay him down if needed.----The orange cup with holes in the bottom was a hit at every age and we'll use it long after he fully outgrows the tub.
B0018Z8CN8 My 3 week old fits perfectly in the tub.  I love that it has little leg supports and the non slip pad for her back keeps her in place.
B0018Z8CN8 This whimsical tub makes you smile just looking at it! The colors are great, the incline is padded, has a removable safety bar on the bottom to hold your infant securely, a plug to pull for emptying, and even comes with a colorful little toy! How can bath-time not be fun time in this \"Whale of a Tub\"?
B0018Z8CN8 This tub is great for newborn even. I was scared to bath baby in it but it worked really well providing back support. it has a plug to let the water out. you just need to get a better jug and separate bucket or have an extendable shower. I also used a towel initially to provide some softness.
B0018Z8CN8 This tub is just perfect for little ones. I started using it when my son came home from the hospital and we still love it six months later. After six months of use it still looks brand new. When my son was a newborn I placed a hand towel over the bump to keep him from sliding. My son loves the little orange fish cup that came with the tub! Couldn't be happier, would buy again.
B0018Z8CN8 This is the best baby tub ever. My hands are free and I don't need to hold her up at all to bathe her in here -- it's simply perfect. It worked since birth and she absolutely loves it. She started splashing around and playing with the water a month ago (she just turned 3 months). The green \"stopper\" is the best invention ever. I'm so glad I read the reviews on this tub and decided to buy it instead of other expensive tubs. I don't use the green legs that you screw to the bottom of the tub, I don't feel like they are necessary for my kitchen sink, maybe later on if I decide to bathe my little one in the bathtub I might screw them in.
B0018Z8CN8 We have been using this tub for 2 months now and we love it!  My son seems comfortable in it and the toy it comes with makes it easy to rinse him off.
B0018Z8CN8 We've been using this with our 9 month old since she was 2 weeks old. She was pretty tiny - just over 6 lbs- but the infant insert and non-slip back kept her upright very well. Now that she is bigger she loves to splash, so if we fill it up past the notches that the infant seat snapped into we (and the kitchen floor) end up getting a bath, too.  It fits very securely on our kitchen sink even with her moving all about. Do make sure to take out the infant seat after each use - doing that ensured that we never dealt with mold/mildew issues that other reviewers have mentioned. The little sprinkler cup that it comes with is a favorite of hers and I'm sure we'll still use that after she outgrows the tub.
B0018Z8CN8 perfect for my 1 mo baby, it will work after she can sit up too. level of water is ideal for a relaxing bath and I have 2 free hands to work with, just make sure the head doesn't flop sideways. I was trying to go with something smaller and have been using the puj fordable  tub but the water level is so low that my baby was shivering and crying. this bath made her happy. she falls sleep every time! unfortunately it is large so we use it inside the bath, but you can't have it all.
B0018Z8CN8 I recently had my first baby in March.  Being a first time mom, I wasn't completely sure as to which items were really necessary and what we could get by without but I needed to create a registry and wanted to have a wide variety of items for people to chose from.  I ended up with a couple items from Fisher Price's Precious Planet collection on my registry, so in keeping with that theme, I also chose this tub.  We actually ended up buying this ourselves and I'm glad we did!For starters I didn't use this until my son was about 3 or 4 weeks old because it took a long time for his umbilical stump to completely fall off.  I just did sponge baths on his changing table until that point and he would scream the entire time I was washing him.  The only thing he did not object to was when I washed his hair over the bathroom sink using the little orange whale strainer, that comes with the tub, to wet and rinse his hair.  Once we switched to the tub, he was fine with bath time.  He is able to sit comfortably in the tub, reclining against the whale's tale.  He doesn't slip down due to the butt stopper wedge, which is easily removed when baby gets bigger, and the foam/rubber no slip area under his back also works great.  He is now 11 weeks old and is really starting to enjoy bath time.  He smiles when I sprinkle water on him and he likes to kick his legs in the water and make splashes.I have it set up in our regular tub in the bathroom.  It's easy to fill and drain.  It has a stopper in the bottom for draining but if you're using it in the big tub, it's faster to just tip it over to drain.  It was a little hard on the back, at first, to be leaning so far in but I don't notice it now.  When I bought this, I also got thisKidCo Bath Storage Basket, in which I keep the baby wash, shampoo, etc., so everything is right on hand for bath time.  I also purchased theFisher-Price Precious Planet Bath Kneeler.  It's really cute and it's saved my knees.  In fact, think I like bath time as much as my son does and I wish I could bathe him more often.  I really love the entire Precious Planet collection.Update:At 4.5 months, he's started wanting to stretch out in the water, which has made it difficult to bathe him and he just looks uncomfortable with the wedge in there.  I've removed the wedge and the tub still works great.  While he can't sit up on his own, yet, he can still lay back comfortably in the tub and he's big enough that his head does not slip into the water.  I add a little less water to the tub, now that the stopper isn't there, and I always watch him closely but we both still enjoy bathtime very much.
B0018Z8CN8 I was really on the fence about whether to buy a baby bathtub, and after we finally purchased this before our baby was born, I had some buyer's remorse as it is quite large.  I wondered if maybe we should have just washed our baby in the kitchen sink or something.However, now that baby is here and nearly four months old, I love this bathtub.  I bathe my daughter at least once daily, because she loves it.  I'm sure this convenient bathtub is part of the reason she enjoys baths so much.First of all, yes, it's large, but it makes a nice roomy tub for a baby.  My baby is now 12 pounds and fits very comfortable with the insert in it.  I think we'll be able to continue to use the tub for some time to come.  I know a lot of baby bathtubs have fabric slings and things in them.  I see no need for such a sling, and I really like that this bath is simple and just plastic with no sling to mess around with.The feet at the back of the tub hook over the edge of a normal kitchen sink, and this is very useful.  I feel my baby is totally secure sitting in the tub.  The insert in the bottom of the tub keeps her head above water, and the tub is very stable over the sink.  Bathing baby over the sink is also useful because I can drain water out while she's in the tub and add a bit more in with the tap to make it warmer or colder without taking the baby out.Last but not least, the water scoop that comes with it is cute and surprisingly useful!Finally, we have to give our baby medicine four times a day, and we actually use the tub to lay her in while giving medicine as well.At $20, I have gotten great bang for my buck with this item.  Yes, you could live without a baby tub, but for such little money, I think it's worth having one.
B0018Z8CN8 With our first child, we registered for and received a fancy baby bathtub with a sling, hand held sprayer, etc.  Being new parents we were clueless.  Within a few weeks, we figured out the sprayer ate batteries like crazy and soon broke and eventually the sling got all dirty and deformed as well.  We ended up tossing it because the whole thing was useless.The second time around we got smart and got this bathtub.  Simple but completely awesome.  Functional and has all the features you need (and none of the ones you really don't want!)The ledge works beautifully for newborns and supported our baby well.  The little fish scoop works perfectly and the baby enjoys playing with it as well.  When he was old enough to sit up, we popped the ledge out and he is still comfortably using this tub.This tub looks adorable and has held up much better than our previous fancy schmancy Summer Infant tub.  It could easily last through one more baby should we decide to expand our family further!
B0018Z8CN8 This tub fit my baby perfectly since the time she was able to start taking regular baths. She is almost four months old and splashes with her arms and legs and still stays securely on the built-in ledge. She has enough room to splash without feeling insecure. The only difficulty is washing her backside with the way she sits on the ledge, and the tub is fairly large to store. 
B0018Z8CN8 This tub is the greatest. My daughter is one and we are still using it. We put it on the kitchen counter and used the insert when she was a newborn and never had any issues. We kept using the insert for awhile after she could sit up on her own because she seemed to feel more stable and confident. She could have been in the full bathtub for months now, but she tries to swim face down so keeping her in the whale solves that problem, plus it saves water. Every time she sees the tub she signs bath because she loves getting in that thing. The accompanying cup is great for play, and for rinsing.
B0018Z8CN8 Our son loves bathtime thanks to this tub. As a newborn, he sat nicely up against the green foam backing and would happily kick his legs away. The stopper ensured he didn't get submerged so we could easily wash him with both hands (didn't have to be stabilizing him with one hand as you might have to with other tubs). However, he's in the 95th percentile for height so by 3 months he was too tall for the stopper - most of his body would be sitting outside the water unless we filled it up all the way, and if we filled it up all the way most of the way we'd end up with water everywhere. We tried it without the stopper, but he can't yet sit stablely (is that a word?) by himself, so we're having to hold him with one hand while trying to wash with the other. Once he can sit stable (another month or so) then we'll go back to using the tub as he definitely loves it. Incidentally, the process to remove the stopper is essentially to just yank on it as hard as you can. I kept thinking there would be a release tab or something, but indeed you just pull as hard as you can. It comes right out and goes right back in, even though you think you're going to break it! It is very cute and a good price so I still gave it 5 stars even though we're taking a few months hiatus.
B0018Z8CN8 Love this tub! It is so easy to use!  Clean up is easy and my son loves it!  I would recommend this for anyone!
B0018Z8CN8 I think this tub would be fine if the legs had screwed in properly.  For one thing, you need a standard looong screwdriver... we only had a shorter interchangeable one that came in a toolkit and it could not reach.  The biggest problem was that even when screwed in, the legs were still wobbly.  So, we tightened the screws a bit more, and then a bit more, and then it broke... the leg broke off and when we turned the tub over, the screw had started to come through the plastic of the tub.  The directions DO say not to overtighten, but with the legs so unstable, I didn't think it was safely tightened enough!So, just beware that this could happen, and perhaps your experience with the tub will be great!  I plan on calling Fisher-Price to see if I can get a replacement or a certificate for a different style tub.Good luck!
B0018Z8CN8 This is a great item.  I like that there aren't really any moving parts--just very sturdy and basic.  It's nice that it's on an incline for when the baby is too young to sit up.  The butt bumper is great to keep the baby safe.  It's also super-cute and a great price.  We put it in the bathtub--it's easier to fill and catches any overflow from happy splashing.  I'm able to sit on the edge of the bathtub and splash around and talk to him.  The orange \"shower\" cup is a big hit, too.
B0018Z8CN8 We have been using this tub since our baby was about 4.5 weeks old. it is excellent. She sits comfortably on the seat and we are able to wash her easily. This tub makes bath time a breeze!
B0018Z8CN8 I received this tub as a gift from my registry and I couldn't be happier.  The tub is colorful, attractive, and easy to clean. I've been giving my son baths in this tub since he was 2 weeks old and he loves it.  He sits still and comfortable in the tub, making it fairly easy for me to bath him and rinse his hair.  I like that the tub is big enough to grow with him.
B0018Z8CN8 There aren't many baby items I would describe as &#34;must haves&#34;--we are pretty good at making do in most non-essentials.  This tub, however, is great.  We've used it for four years now, through three kids.  Our youngest is just three weeks old, and the green infant insert makes all the difference when bathing a newborn!  I don't have to worry about whether he's going to slip out of my grasp, and the way the tub is designed makes it easy to get to every area that needs cleaning without difficulty.For my older kids, it was so much fun for them to lean back and splash their feet in the deeper bottom part when they were a bit bigger.  In addition, the little whale cup has consistently been a favorite bathtime toy, long after the tub itself had been outgrown.We've gotten a lot of use out of this little blue tub, and if I had to, it's definitely a purchase I would make again.
B0018Z8CN8 We've been using this tub for a month now with our newborn.  Overall it has worked just fine.  You can see our son's first bath in this tub here: [...]We like the orange fish toy because it is a scoop, but has holes in it.  You can scoop the water and then let it \"shower\" out of the scoop onto the baby.  Our son enjoys this.  There is no need to use any other water scooper.The green leg thing is a bit hard to get out, but if you use a butter knife you can pry it off (it's just held by one peg on each end).  We recommend taking this off at least once a week to let the entire thing dry underneath.The plug is handy, too, as you can drain the whale without having to pick it up full of water and splash everywhere.The legs on the whale are great for just setting the whale on the counter in the kitchen.  We have a double sink, and it doesn't work to sit it over the sink, so we just set it on the counter.
B0018Z8CN8 I got this for my daughter before she was born and then we had been gifted a couple of other baby baths and decided to try them all. This is by far the best bath out there!As a new mom, I was worried about the baby slipping all over the place in the bath. There is absolutly no slipping from side to side or slipping down either. When she was a little older she love the little whale spout.My daughter was only 7 lbs when she was born but grew really fast and always topped the charts. The bath fit her from newborn until she was able to sit on her own at about 6 mo. It was a sad day when we had to retire the bath because she had outgrown it. Even my husband loved using it!
B0018Z8CN8 This tub gets the job done.  It's simple to use and everything I need.  I can use it in the sink or in the shower.  I usually bathe my son in the kitchen sink with it because it's such a convenient height.  Great price and exactly what I need!
B0018Z8CN8 We had another seat that just sat in the bathtub for our newborn which she hated, so I decided to buy her a little tub of her own. She loves this!  The water stays around her tushy to keep her warm (which the other seat didn't do so I think that's why she hated it) and she enjoys kicking her feet in it to splash water everywhere. :)  I also love that it will adjust by taking out the spacer as she gets older. Highly recommend!
B0018Z8CN8 I originally picked this tub for looks. I saw it and thought it was the cutest thing ever. I knew my (at the time future) son's bathroom would be a sea life theme, so this was perfect. But not only is it adorable, it is also an excellent tub!It was especially great when he was a newborn, because it fit VERY sturdily on our double kitchen sink. The baby also fit securely in the tub, and I never felt like he would slip. The green insert really helped keep him in place. I loved rinsing him with the little orange whale cup! Not only was the cup cute, but the water didn't flow out of it too fast.As he got older, he LOVED that whale and would always grab it from me to play with. As he started sitting up, he could face either way in the tub and still be secure.  Unfortunately, he is a tall boy and outgrew the tub at about 8 months old. He is 11 months now and has a One Step Ahead (also highly recommend!) inflatable tub.He has tons of bath toys, but his very favorite is still the little orange whale that came with this tub! No matter how many toys I put in the tub with him, he grabs it first every time!I HIGHLY recommend this tub. I can't imagine anything better.
B0018Z8CN8 Worked very well for us. We took the green stopper part out when she was able to sit up and even after we moved her to the big tub we continued to use this one to let her play in outside in the summer.
B0018Z8CN8 This whale tube is super cute, safe, and it works for newborns and above.  Make sure you screw the legs in and when the baby can sit up take the green insert out.  Also, we rinse it out after each use and flip it upside down to dry in the tub.  We have not had any mold issues like other reviews.My only recommendation is to buy it from BabiesRus (sorry Amazon) but it's $25 there and I used a 20% coupon, so it came to $20. ;)
B0018Z8CN8 Baby loves it. His loves siting in there and enjoys the bath. I have not seen a baby love a bath so much.It's a perfect size for my 7lb son.Cons: had to drop 1 star due to some discoloration where the material did not quite set right. it showed up after the first wash. Another con is to install the legs. Make sure you have a very long screwdriver. the legs will be secured but like any plastic, it does not sit flush .
B0018Z8CN8 We had the Safety 1st frog bathtub and I hated it.  Needed 3 hands to bathe him and he stayed cold. We love this one!  His hiney stays in the water and he gets cleaner and I don't have to hold him up.  My only complaint is that...although the butt bump is an awesome feature...it makes it hard to lift him up and scrub his bottom a little better.  I felt like I kept pinching his butt trying to lift him, but otherwise I LOVE it and its so cute.  My friend has this one and reccomends it as well!
B0018Z8CN8 It's cute.It's comfy.My son loves it.The insert is not hard to take in & out.The legs attach easily.The foam is simple & does the trick.The little sprinkle cup is cute & fun for baby.My one complaint is that water gets trapped under the green sitting ledge even though I turn it in every direction to try to drain it all out before I turn it upside down in the tub overnight....that part is a little annoying, but the real problem is that then when you go to use it, the tub has a bit of cold water inside that isn't so fantastic on baby's butt if you sit them in before filling and use a hand sprayer like I do. So...one day I decided to pop out the little ledge for some weird reason & saw that it had mold in it because it almost always stays a little bit wet.No biggie now that I know, I just take it off often and bleach it to be sure it stays clean, which is super easy...but it was kind of gross to see that I'd been bathing my baby boy in it with mold inside. Ew.
B0018Z8CN8 We love this bath tub, we could place our newborn in the tub easily & securely. Our baby is almost 6 month now and we still haven't removed the insert, and she still fit in it. The only thing I wish could be improved, is that the tub is a bit higher, so that the water can cover more of her body. But so far she seems to enjoy bath time very much, so I guess she's not cold because the water doesn't cover more part of her body.
B0018Z8CN8 This bath is great.  We bought and used another dark blue bath till our daughter was about 5 months old and it got too small.  So we bought this one.  She's 7 months now but we can still use this bath.  We think we can use this bath for a while.  We should have bought this bath in the beginning!
B0018ZC7H0 Took it camping for a few days. So much better than porter potties.
B0018ZC7H0 We were looking for a chair that was a little bigger than our Potette Plus.  Unfortunately, the seat of this was actually a little smaller than the Potette so anticipating a growing child, we returned this.  Loved the idea, but it just didn't work for us.
B0018ZC7H0 We bought this for our son for those times when a potty is not close. This seat is very sturdy, easy to clean up, and folds fairly compact. I would definately purchase this seat again. The hole also seems to fit my sons bottom well (ie. not to big ot small). One other thought I purchased another cheaper brand of potty seat which the hole in the seat was round and big plus when my son sat on it he fell through the hole and his bum touched the ground. Not good at all! One part that is helpful is this is high enough when set up to be about the same height as any other portable potty. Imagine that. Would recommend this to a friend, that's how I knew about it in the first place.
B0018ZC7H0 My almost 2 yr old son is not potty trained yet, but we're planning on it soon. I bought this cause my best friend has this for her kids and I absolutely loved the idea! The only problem I have is with opening and closing it, it's not smooth and tends to jam up a bit. But that's only a minor flaw and I'm sure with more use, it will free up a bit.All in all, it's perfect. I love the side compartments where you can keep extra ziplock bags and wipes/toilet paper or whatever else. And I absolutely love that you can just buy regular 1 lb ziplock bags from the dollar store and there is absolutely no mess/clean up with this potty.I imagine it will come in handy for all kinds of trips. We'll be taking a road trip soon and I'm sure my son will love to go potty in this in the back of our SUV and I won't have to worry about finding a bathroom or him using some of those nasty/dirty bathrooms out there. Will update my review once he uses it!
B0018ZC7H0 Though the travel potty is not the most environmentally conscious item (the waste of plastic bags every time my daughter pees it is thrown away), but it is much better than carrying the big potty with us everywhere. It is real small and portable. When we take it with us, most people don't even notice what it is (unless they know this item ;) ).My daughter likes using it, but we did have 2 leeks in the new minivan :( (the bags sent with the travel potty had tiny holes in them, never had that problem with the store bought zip lock (sp.?) bags (or equivalent).My husband would not agree, he does not like the travel potty at all! Because of the waste of bags and the leaks we had (2 of them).
B0018ZC7H0 After reading the reviews I was a bit worried about ordering since people were saying the seat was too small and 
B0018ZC7H0 We purchased this chair and the Fisher-Price version at the same time. Both potty chairs are good, but we prefer this one due to the sealable bags. Yes, the hole is a little small, but, so far, this hasn't been a problem for us at all.The potty chair folds compactly, so it packs easily. The side compartments allow for us to pack extra bags, tissues, wipes and even small board books and toys when the \"duty\" is going to take some extra time.It feels a little flimsy compared to the Fisher-Price seat, but we've used it multiple times and it remains intact. We do have some trouble opening one of the compartments, but the other side opens easily.Update:  Six-months laterStill loving this potty chair.  Even though it feels flimsy, it's been used multiple times, smashed in the trunk under multiple loads of groceries, etc, and looks and works the same as the day we received it.  Would recommend to anyone and would definitely buy again.
B0018ZC7H0 no potty works well when boys pee, but it works well with the other business. My boy likes sitting there since it's big enough and comfortable enough. He also likes to take out little books and ready them while he is sitting there. But these plastic lids are not study enough.
B0018ZC7H0 We keep this one in the car.  Oh man has it saved the day a few times.  Nothing like being on the road when you get the call from the back seat that it's time.  The bags are just like zip locks, easy to seal up and store for later disposal.  Couldn't be any better.
B0018ZC7H0 Love it. We take it everywhere for our daughter who is newly potty trained and to avoid public restrooms.  Great
B0018ZC7H0 Potty training was going great at home, but out with BIG toilets and the pressure to go while in the public restrooms... Not so great.I love that this potty folds down like a brief case. Opens easily. has two storage areas... I keep one filled with clean one gallon bags and a few wipes. The other has a spare outfit.... just in case.My only complaint--- it would be great to have a pee guard in the front. My little girl over shoots routinely.I keep it in my car trunk. She can use this where and when ever! I love that I can take out the soiled bag and put a clean one in, in less than a minute. It is sturdy enough for my toddler, but I don't know how strong it actually is....hopefully by the time she weighs more than 30-40 lbs she will have no problems peeing in public restrooms.Overall very satisfied with this product.
B0018ZVT4M This is a must have for those wipe down days. I just put it on the counter and wiped my baby down with a damp washcloth. It's inexpensive and is much better than trying to give your newborn a wipe down whilst holding him.To dry it, I just squeezed out the water and stood it upright to dry. You don't really use this too long before moving onto a baby bathtub, so there's no real need to worry about mold.Highly recommend.
B0018ZVT4M I'm not sure why people thought this would be bigger - read the size specs. It's big enough for at least half of baby's body to be on the mat and the other half can be kicking legs in water. My daughter loved it. Now she's old enough to sit in the tub and I use it as a kneeling mat. Great buy!
B0018ZVT4M This bath cushion was exactly as expected. Very simple, just a sponge to keep baby from sliding around in the tub.
B0018ZVT4M We have this sponge for our baby and thought it would be good for sponge baths in the first few weeks but he hated it.  It was itchy and very thin.  I wouldn't want to lay on it with no clothes on either.  I ended up ditching the cushion and folding up a big beach towel, it seemed more comfortable for him.  The cushion also wasn't very long, our son was 20 inches when he was born and was already a bit to big for it.
B0018ZVT4M I got this little froggie, actually, with a tub. The tub was just too much to handle (filling it up, emptying it out) and so I went the old fashion way, as my Mom stated and \"Just use the sink.\" But I needed something on the bottom of the sink for my little one to sit on. We've been using this thing from 4 months onward. Then our froggie started to get old and I needed a replacement. THIS froggie was the EXACT froggie we got with the tub! Perfect! Now I can continue with using it with daughter now 2 yrs old, which we now use in the tub. As for it's roughness? I don't use it just to lie my little one on and use a damp cloth to bath her. No. It is rough that way. How I use it and why it's wonderful to me? It's because it's completely submerged in water. UNDER the water, completely filled with water, and absorbs the water, so it's very soft. After bath time, I wring it out, and hang it over the towel rod (ours is inside the tub, so any drips-drips stay in the tub). Wonderful, wonderful sponge for bathing. Fills up the sink's bottom when she was a baby. Definitely a item that has lasted and worked for us for almost 2 years.
B0018ZVT4M I have used many of these bath sponges. Every few months I just throw them away and get a new one. It is really great being able to give the baby a bath in the bathtub and not one of those baby tubs. However I will say that compared to all the sponges I have used this one is the smallest and thinnest. I would use a different brand because my 8 month old fits the others much better.
B0018ZVT4M I love this product.  Both of my children hated the infant bath tub, putting them in an awkward position, so this was the perfect solution.  I put a bit of water in the tub, just to dip the washcloth in, and tada - perfect for laying the baby flat. I highly recommend it.
B0018ZVT4M Just wish it was a little longer as my baby is a little on the larger size. Great for travel!
B0018ZVT4M use this in the bath to lay flat and wash my baby. he is now 7 months old and its way too small, so meant for small babies not bigger ones.  love it, wring it out and let dry between uses so it wont develop stinky smell or rot
B0018ZVT4M I bought this to put in the bottom of my inflatable baby tub (Snug Tub) because some reviews said it was slippery on the bottom. It wasn't that slippery....but I like this product anyway. It keeps my baby relatively still and I don't feel like I need to keep my hand on him to keep him from sliding down while I soap him up. I'm also planning to use it when he's big enough for the big tub. It doesn't really stay at the bottom but I don't think its meant to be completely under water. When he's sitting on it, it stays fine. It takes a lot of wringing to get all the water out. Its thick and coushy and a nice place for baby to sit. If I have another baby I will use this for my newborn, inside of, or instead of the hard infant tub.
B0018ZVT4M My sister recommended this to me after having her 3 children and using this product. She told me it is very helpful for those first few weeks when you are just using a wash cloth to bath your newborn! It is such a great price as well!
B0018ZVT4M It does cushion the baby's head, but this foam cushion is barely large enough for a newborn. In a couple months, it will only be big enough to support the baby's head. The rest of their body will hang off, and you can imagine that that gets a little uncomfortable! The foam isn't particularly soft either.
B0018ZVT4M Perfect for what I needed, and kept my baby cushioned, safe in the bath. For sure made bath time easier.
B0018ZVT4M UPDATE:We used this bath cushion for our first child and loved it! We tossed it once she was sitting up.When I was about to have our second baby this was one of my must haves! We bought this bath cushion again and it too was excellent. It's as soft as any other foam and just the right size for a newborn- 5 month old to lay down on. I love that it's smaller than a baby tub but provides the same comfort and security. This, in my opinion, is so much better than a baby tub! I highly recommend this item!We have used this with our baby since she was a newborn. It works great for bath time. We just lay this down in the sink or tub, fill the tub or sink with about 2 inches of water , make sure this thing is soaked and lay her on it. I highly disagree with comments that say this thing is scratchy or thin (maybe they got duds??). I think it's perfect and does it's job very nicely.
B0018ZVT4M This item is exactly what I was looking for, something soft and cushy to support my little guy in his baby bath. It drys quickly, and is adorable. I highly recommend this item!
B0018ZVT4M I bought this to bathe my infant grandson when he is visiting.  It holds him securely, but I would not move away from him, and dries fast.  When he is older I will use it in the tub for him to sit on. For now it is cosy and clean for sink baths. It is also small and inexpensive which counts for a grandma who already has a house that is beginning to look like babyland.
B0018ZVT4M LOVE this bath cushion! We use it every night at bathtime. My son is 3mo old now and he lies down on it, but once he's sitting up he can still use it to sit on and not slide around. Worth the money.
B0018ZVT4M When my son was born he freaked out in a baby bath so I put this pad in my bathroom sink to give a little cushion and keep my baby from sliding.  He did much better in the cozy little sink.  This pad is not thick which for me was perfect because I went from the sink to sitting on a stool in my shower and putting the pad on my lap and I lay my son on my lap and again the pad keeps him from sliding and I use a hand held shower head to bathe him on my lap and he LOVES it!  He is now 8 months and I still bathe him this way.  He sits in a BUMBO seat in the shower with me while I shower and when I sit and grab the green foam he starts to yelp and and giggle and wave his arms with excitement.  This works great, as I said, for the way I use it.  If your looking for a very thick foam pad then this isn't the one for you.  It lasted 7 months without falling apart at all until I made the mistake of letting my son play with it and he bit it and ripped the head off so this is purchase #2.
B0018ZVT4M It's thin enough to use as extra cushion in the baby tub and thick enough to do its job. Exactly what we wanted
B0018ZVT4M These are so hard to find in the stores.  I use these in the bottom of my special needs daughters bath chair.  She does not like the mesh feeling on the seat and this keeps her from slipping around.  I have had many before and I have even washed them in the washing machine a few times to make them last a little longer.  I always order two or three at a time so I can have them on hand.
B0018ZVT4M Get the yellow sponge.  This one's cute and fine, functional and friendly, though the yellow comfort sponge is a bit larger and better suited to hold baby.  This one can be your back up if you really love frogs like me.
B0018ZYDWW I was very excited receiving this product, because I was trying to get one similar to the playground and this one came with very good reviews. The product is very sturdy and with good quality, I have no doubt it will last years. The only concern I had was that the material is very hard resin, instead of softer rubber like the one in the playgrounds. My 9 month old baby enjoys sitting in it very much, but I was a little concern that the front part between the legs will cut into his leg a little if he sits in there for longer time. But after half a year's swinging fun, I found that it was not the case at all. The back of the seat is a little higher than the front, so it's good for some support. Overall it's a good product and would recommend to friends.
B0018ZYDWW This made it through two toddlers and still in great shape even though it was left outside 24/7 for over three years.
B0018ZYDWW I purchased this for my 10-month-old son, to use in our backyard. It is hung from our covered back patio, and is perfect. Hardware is separate. The seat is really sturdy. My son did get his arm stuck between the little triangles on the side and it presses him firmly around the leg holes leaving marks if he isn't wearing pants, but it's not the swing's fault. Just be careful how you put him in (I put his little hands on the back of the triangles or the front with his arms bent). He might be a little too small for this seat, and he's on the larger side.
B0018ZYDWW I didn't expect this swing to be of such great quality.  It looks to be made out of the industrial strength stuff that you would find on a neighborhood playground.  I have no doubt this seat will last for years out in the elements.
B0018ZYDWW Got this for my 10 month old son even though it says for 2+years since many reviews said they had even younger kids using it. I am glad I did, he loves it! The first time I sat him in it he grabbed the front and looked up at me with a smile ready to go. I was concerned he would need padding, but he seems fine without it. He even fusses if I let it slow down before he wants to stop. A great buy, just be sure you get any chains or S-hooks you might need.
B0018ZYDWW This was the best price I found for this type of swing.  My only problem was that it wasn't compatible with the chain set that goes with our playset.  However, my husband rigged it, so it works. Would be nice if the chains were included.
B0018ZYDWW Great quality, just like the swings they have at the park!!  My daughter literally squealed with delight the first time she saw the swing in her own backyard.  We have it in the sun in South Florida and it has shown no signs of fading or sun damage such as cracking.
B0018ZYDWW My daughter loves this swing. She just laughs and laughs and squeals, &#34;do it again!&#34; I like how secure she is in it. I also like this bucket swing because of its versatility. I do not have a swing set; just a maple tree in the backyard. The swing and chain sets were just too short to hang from my ideal branch. I also really wanted to be able switch out this swing with a belt swing in a few years when she is ready. So purchasing a quality swing seat that was separate from the chain was really important to me. This swing is high quality, fit my needs perfectly and absolutely delights my 2 year old daughter.
B00190JO5C Great seat, virtually no installation and easy to use. My son loves it. Great buy. This is inexpensive too, so perfect for an extra car or family/nanny.
B00190JO5C I purchased this booster seat to use when my 5 year old grandson is visiting, and I love it. It is cushy and comfy enough for him to be completely comfortable in the back seat, and the seat belt adapter buckle keeps the shoulder strap of the normal car seat belt from going up around his chin. The little hidden cupholders are apparently perfect for keeping Lego guys close by (since he's not allowed to eat or drink in the car). I can't attest to clean up for the same reason - he's not allowed to eat or drink in the car - though I'm not sure the fabric covering would be very easy to clean up and would probably be susceptible to stains. The seat is sturdy, comfortable, and the adapter causes the shoulder strap to fit the little guy comfortably. I highly recommend the product - just don't let your child eat or drink in the car!
B00190JO5C Our toddler son is getting to the size where full car seats big enough to hold him is fairly heavy: he's just turned 3, but he's 42\" tall and 45 pounds.  We have tutors for him who occasionally drive him around, but don't have their own car seats. This booster seat provides the perfect solution without being a huge hassle to put in and out of their car.The seat itself is incredibly light, just a few pounds. It includes armrests which can be raised or lowered with a little work (my son doesn't use them), cup-holders which can snap out (also not used by us), and a nylon seatbelt guide strap that attaches to either side of the back of the seat, so you can make sure the seat belt rests at the right spot on your child.My son is happy to drive for a half-hour in this seat, no problem. We still go with a full car seat for longer trips, but there's an awful lot you can do with your kid within a half hour of your home. The seat itself is easy to position, and stays in place firmly once you've got your kid in it and buckled up with a lap-and-shoulder belt.We've got at least two of these. One I keep in my car and set up whenever I'm driving my son, and the others are used by our tutors. Great value for money, and they feel safe (as far as this kind of seat goes)!Pro:+ very light and portable+ comfortable for my son, he's happy to sit in it for 30 minutes, no problem+ shoulder belt guide works great, and can be adjusted for either side of the seat+ seat stays firmly in place when it's being used, and 'feels safe' at least to meCon:- the arm rests aren't very useful, and a bit of a pain to move.Overall, a great booster seat for occasional use!
B00190JO5C I purchased this booster seat to take with us on a trip, as it would be easy to carry thru the airport and gate check once we were on the plane. It served it's purpose well, but it definitely wouldn't be one I'd use daily. It has very little padding for your child's rear end and I can't imagine it would be comfortable for any trip of a decent length.Additionally, the booster seat I ordered from Amazon had a manufacture date that was several years ago (seats have a limited number of years lifespan). They quickly shipped out a replacement, but it had the identical manufacture date.
B00190JO5C i thought it was white, and was hesitant for stains, but it's gray ~ AND MACHINE WASHABLE!  my child loves it and there is an attachment to pull the shoulder belt snug against the body if smaller siblings or friends need to borrow the seat.  for $20, i certainly can't complain about cushioning b/c you get what you pay for, but graco has upheld its reputation in our home :)  only downfall is that when it is placed next to another carseat, it's hard to reach the buckle, so it's better in a bucket seat or separated from another safety seat.
B00190JO5C I got this for my 5 year old.  It works great for her.  She fits perfect in the car with it and it seems comfortable enough for her
B00190JO5C We own four different booster seats and I'd say the Graco backless booster is very comfortable for my kids.  Its seat is padded.  The armrests are adjustable up and down.  The cupholders are easy for the kids to open and retract.The fact that it's backless means the children have to be slightly larger to use them.  They must be a minimum of 40 lbs. versus 30 lbs. listed for their full back boosters.  It does, however, make the booster more portable, and the children will accept the booster for longer because it's not immediately visible to their friends that they are using a booster.
B00190JO5C Needed a booster for my 4 year old cause a full front facing seat was getting a little awkward for her to be in. This one is comfortable, easy for her to get in and out of too. It got really good safty reviews, but I am not sure that it is any better than the 15 dollar ones you can get at Walmart or Target.
B00190NB3I We bought this without doing any research....we really wanted a 2nd one of the Evenflo Expressions that we love,but the store ran out, so this was the next affordable choice. Unfortunately many  drawbacks that I just haven't thrown it out because we need it and can't afford another...The tray is too easy  to take off, the permanent mini tray doesn't come off and makes it hard to put the child in and take out, and the cleaning insert is laying in a corner in my pantry because we never were able to use it because it too comes off too easily...these are supposed to be aimed at fussy, stubborn infants and toddlers, right?
B00190NB3I its just very good it come in original package with instructons and very easy to assembly even its a little big but you can use all the time for your baby
B00190NB3I The quality of this prooducto and security that gives the baby are great, all pieces can be washed and not lose their shape. It is cheap and very light. My baby loves it
B00190NB3I I like the different height levels and how the seat reclines. I don't like the tray and feel as if it takes up too much space.
B00190NB3I My son loves his new chair, the chair is light weigth, easy to move around, great quality chair. Also very easy to clean.
B00190NB3I I only gave the high chair 4 stars because its not steady when folded and doesn't fold very flat...otherwise...great product.  Most everything snaps together, only two pieces to screw in and everything was super simple.  High chair had nice clean lines and the fabric is so pretty!  Way prettier in person than online.  I ordered the lively dots pattern.  We have only used it once, but baby seemed to like it.
B00191YSLG We bought this for our 2nd son who was born earlier than expected, but he was actually on time.  He was born on Jan 12, 2011.  I love the color and the softness of this bundle me and it kept it's softness after we washed it in the gentle cycle before it was used.  It was easy to put on the car seat and it does what it says it's going to do.  I love how, when we took our son home from the hospital, all we had to do was pull the front flap over the canopy of the car seat and zip it up a little more to shield him from the cold and the sun.  Would definitely recommend this to others!
B00191YSLG Love this thing. Easy to put into my carrier and into a stroller.  Keeps my kid super nice and snug.  It also has a lot of room inside for him to grow with it.!
B00191YSLG When I saw this and read the 5 star reviews I knew I had to have it since I take my son on lots of jogs in the stroller. I have also used this on his car seat, and the length to match up on the seat has too much fabric above his head, and not enough to accomodate his legs and my son doesn't have long legs either! Needless to say he was too big for this at 6 months because he couldn't stretch his legs out when zipped. Although a nice idea, and the sherpa is very warm.. it just doesn't work out appropriately.. I wonder if the toddler size is better, but.. I don't think I will blow another 40 bucks to find out... Stick to a blanket, they really don't drop on the floor!
B00191YSLG I like this toddler version of BundleMe (navy) as much as the infant one. My 10-m-old outgrew the 1st one way before she reached 20lb, but what are you going to do... This new BundleMe has a lot of room to grow into but I wouldn't bet it will last till she is 3. It washes well (on delicate), and I didn't notice any shedding or fuzz. It keeps my DD warm on a long walk in her stroller (UppaBaby Vista - nice fit except the bottom hangs below the footrest), but I would never put her in it without a snowsuit. Even in 45-50 degree weather she still wears Columbia 3-in-1. It's easy to take off the top when she is awake so she wouldn't get too hot and put it back on when she falls asleep to keep her cozy and warm.
B00191YSLG I was very skeptical about buying this but ended up falling in love with it. Having a baby at the start of the winter is really tough for getting out and about, and this bunting made it so much easier. We didn't have to dress the teeny baby in a snowsuit but instead, we put our baby in here and laid a blanket close over him to trap more heat. (Of course, we also put a hat on him.) This also came in handy for times we needed to rest him in his car seat for a little while to get a few things done; the warmth of the bunting helped him feel swaddled, and he often fell asleep right in the carseat. Perfect buy, highly recommend. My sister ended up buying one too for her baby and felt the same way.
B00191YSLG We have a Peg Perego Primo Viaggio infant seat that we purchased in 2008 for our first child. We lived in AZ so we never needed a bundle me. I purchased one with expectation of using this for our second now that we live in the midwest and I am due in December. Lucky for me a friend came to visit and I was able to dry run the car seat with the bundle me, and it does not fit in the car seat due to the wings. However, I love the cover and the snuggliness and will be attempting to modify it to fit around/ under the SIP wings. Once we removed the elastic my friend's daughter was able to recline better, but she was awkwardly sitting in the car seat at first.
B00191YSLG Love this for the stroller on a chilly fall/winter day.  Keeps baby all snuggled and warm without worrying about a draft or blanket falling off.  Also comes in the bundleme lite version, if you live in a warmer climate where it doesn't get very cold.  It's nice not to have to bundle the baby in heavy jackets - baby can dress normally for indoors and just sit in this cozy bundle me when he goes outdoors.  He seems much happier (and less fuss) than wrestling the jacket on.  Found it to be durable and no issues with it.  We didn't use it in the carseat, since the nurses at the hospital cautioned against using anything that goes between the baby and the carseat . . . could reduce the effectiveness of the carseat during an accident.  The packaging claims to be car crash tested, but I've also read that there are no standardized car crash tests for products like this, so there's no gauge as to whether or not it performed well.  I do know a lot of moms who did use this in their carseat, so it could be fine.  I'm probably just an overly worried first time mom.  :)
B00191YSLG These should not be used with any brand of infant car seat, they affect how the straps are used and make it impossible to secure baby correctly.  If you look it up, you will see there have been instances shen these have been used and in an accident the babies shoulders came out of the seat straps.  You CAN however use the car seat covers that just go over the top of the car seat without the back thing.  Just please look into it.  There is a reason your car seat specifies not to add other additions to it.
B00191YSLG I was about to buy the BOB Warm Fuzzy.  I am so glad I did not because for the same price you have the JJ Cole Bundleme.The quality of the fabric is outstanding and it is very comfortable.  It is large!  My grandson is 13 months old and in the 90 percentile for height.  He had plenty of leg room inside.  You really don't need a heavy jacket, only a sweater and a warm hat.  He was so comfortable inside that he took a two hours nap!  I strongly recommend the JJ Cole Bundleme.  I got the Navy color and it is very beautiful!
B00191YSLG We bought one for the stroller and the car seat.  Baby Ethan LOVEs being in this.  So warm and yet breathable for the 2011-12 winter.  Ethan's fast asleep quickly in this and he'll stay warm throughout the ride.  In really cold weather, we usually tuck a fleece blanket or two around him to swaddle him and also so the zipper of the BundleMe won't get caught on him. Easy to install and remove for cleaning.
B00191YSLG This bunting has been more than essential for us. When our son was born we used it ( Jan 20 is his b-day) because we live in Chicago. When Spring can we took the top part off and left the inside for a little extra cushion and comfort. When Summer came occasionally we got use out of it on windy days. Now as we exit Summer,  Chicago is getting cooler and breezier and we are using it again! Nothing like actually using a baby product for longer than a few months! It's warm and cozy and if necessary you can add more blankets inside and the zipper keeps everything from falling or the baby from fidgeting in cold weather. I love it. It washes great and it's very soft.
B00191YSLG This is the most awesome product ever! It has kept my two tiny babies warm in their carseats during outings, winter walks, etc. It fits perfectly in the chicco keyfit carseat, and looks stylish to boot! Highly recommended for winter babies.
B00191YSLG This product is well made and easy to put in car seat. Keeps the car seat warm and is very soft.
B00191YSLG I am so pleased with the JJ Cole Bundleme. Before I purchased this item I was always struggling to keep blankets on my baby or trying to put him in his car seat with a coat on. Neither situation was ideal and I didn't feel like he was warm enough. The Bundleme has slits for the straps so they sit directly on his chest. It is very soft, warm material. It hasn't been super cold this winter but the few times it's gone down below freezing the baby has stayed warm. I would definitely recommend this product for parents who live in cold climates.
B00191YSLG I've been using the JJ Cole Bundleme for around a month now and I have to say that it works perfectly. My baby boy is just 2 months old and every time we have to go out to a doctor's appointment or something else, he seems not to notice the difference between being inside the car or being outside in the cold...he stays comfortably sleeping in his car seat, NO PROBLEM! The Bundleme is very easy to install as it separates in 2 pieces: Just open the 2 zippers all the way to the bottom and then remove the top cover, then you are able to easily install the bottom part of it on the car seat. The bottom part has multiple slots for different seat belt adjustments depending on your kid's size, so it is a breeze to install. After that is done you just re-attach the top cover using the zippers (just like you would when closing the front zipper on a jacket), sit your baby in the car seat and close the zippers half way up...voila! Baby is warm and comfortable! The quality of this item is very good, and the variety in colors gives you a lot of options to combine with your car seat or stroller; mine looks as it all came together! ;-) Highly recommended!
B00191YSLG I purchased this item for my brother and his wife for their soon to be here little one. It's very soft and my sister in-law said it was very easy to install on the car seat. What I like about this particular product is that it has been tested for safety with car seats. I had to take an extensive course on car seat safety for my volunteer work and you have to be very careful about installing anything on a car seat that hasn't been safety approved. All in all I would definitely buy again.
B00191YSLG I absolutely love how soft and warm this car seat cover is.  Not only does out cover over the Baby's head, but it the Baby's back side as well.It comes as a one size foods all.  My only complaint is that the elastic does not fit around the chicco car seat.  I'm willing to deal with this because it is so warm.  So o spend an extra 30 seconds every time straightening out the bundle me
B00191YSLG This bundleme bag fits very well, is super soft and washes up well.  I would definitely recommend this/buy it again.
B00191YSLG For those cold days.  This is the best invention for the car seat.  I bought this for our car seat for our grandchild, what a life saver.  I remember the snowsuits and car seats for my own children, what a nightmare.  This is just wonderful
B00191YSLG Another must have for any parent. So well made, soft, warm, washes nicely.  Never worry about the blanket falling off again.  The top portion Zips off/on easily if it warms up, cools down.  Great idea for a baby shower too.
B00191YSLG I bought this for a trip we were taking to Canada.  I used it in my little one's stroller and it made it so nice and cozy.  It kept him warm in really cold temperatures, so he was happy!  It's really soft and nice quality.
B00191YSLG I purchased one of these and when I received it, I was so impressed that I purchased another one for a gift.  The fabric is very comfortable and warm and looks great in the stroller.
B00191YSLG My son is 2 and a half and we still use it. It's very washable and very warm and cozy. Great for those winter time/spring time walks when it's cold outside. I've used it on my Peg and my Baby Jogger and it fits fine.
B00191YSLG I love this stroller blanket! It works great in our Bob and another smaller jogging stroller. My daughter, who wears a size 3, still fits fine in this blanket, my son, who wears size 5 is too tall. We use this blanket every single night for a walk on the coast of California and it's the perfect weight to keep the kids warm but not sweaty. I wish I had had this blanket when we lived in Maryland, it would have been awesome in the winter, I would have put my son in sweats with maybe a vest or jacket on top. Highly reccomend.
B00191YSLG I got this for our baby's Graco Snugride Carseat and it fitted perfectly.We used it for a Christmas vacation trip to Madrid, Spain. Our then 3-month-old baby was warm and comfortable and we never got a single complaint from her during our long strolls.We thought about the risk of having an extra layer between her and the car seat, and our conclusion was that this cover is not as thick as to cause a problem in case of compression in an accident. It is about 1 cm thick, if it compresses let's say to half of that in an accident, the gap between baby and seat belt/ car seat (0.5cm) would be insignificant. Think that two car seat safety specialist can adjust it 0.5 cm looser or tighter and still be correct.BUT PLEASE NOTE that if you use this it could void your car seat warranty in case of an accident.Hope this helps you take a decision.
B00191YSLG We have the Revolution B.O.B. stroller and this fit well in it. I debated about purchasing it or not, but I am so glad that I did. It kept my daughter warm without having a blanket constantly falling off. Would highly recommend it!
B00191YSLG I have a BOB Revolution stroller and this fits just fine.  It has so many holes to accommodate the different straps that I'm sure it would fit any stroller.  The fabric is super soft and warm.  The 2 side zippers are heavy duty and very durable.
B00191YSLG I was going to buy the Orbit footmuff which was $140-160.  I saw the JJ Cole Bundleme in the other items that customers buy.  I got this one for $25 ( HUGE difference from $140-160).. Yea it may not be organic or oeko-tex certified but the reason why I want one is so that my baby would be warm and cozy and the Bundleme does the job without the hefty price tag attached.  I saw this same one at babies r us for $40'ish so save your money and just buy in amazon.
B00191YSLG THE MATERIAL IS SSSO SOFT, I JUST LOVE THIS AND BABY IS SO CONFY IN IT, IT KEEPS MY BABY SO WARM AND I LIVE IN ALASKA AND THIS IS JUST PERFECT! =0)
B00191YSLG I had to return the bundle me because it doesn't fit our Peg Perego Primo Viaggio SIP 30/30 car seat.  The car seat has side impact protection wings by our baby's head (which I love for the added safety) but it meant that the bundle me didn't fit.  First I tried stretching the back of the bundle me over the side impact wings which made it impossible to fit the 5-point harness straps through the bundle me without interfering with the straps positioning to the point that I thought it was unsafe because the straps had to loop up and around to get through the holes.  Then I tried not putting the bundle me over the impact wings but that left a lot of extra fabric where the baby's head would be, which I thought was a suffocation hazard.  In the end I just wasn't comfortable that my son could be safe in his car seat with the Bundle Me.  I was very disappointed because I thought the Bundle Me would be perfect to keep my winter baby warm through a New England winter.  I got the Kiddipotamus CozyUp Black/Red or BLue/Ivory Kiddopotamus CozyUp Carrier Covers instead because it goes over the top of the car seat only and it worked really well.  My son seemed comfortable with it and I didn't have to worry about anything interfering with how the car seat was designed to work.
B00191YSLG I loved using this product for my son as he was born in January of 2013 A.K.A cold season. Very easy to install and I never had to carry around blankets all over the place. I could have lived without this product but it sure made life a bit easier.
B00191YSLG I live in Arizona, but it does snow where I live. I purchased this JJ Cole Original Infant Bundleme, Apple, 0-12 Months for my girl. I used it less than 5 times and gave it to my pregnant friend who's planning to move to Canada.I would  recommend this product to Mom/dad needs to go out often with her/his baby in very cold weather.It's well-made and all... but not worth the $$. Too easy to outgrow.
B00191YSLG This is a great product.  Its great for when your getting in and out of the car and running around on chilly (not cold) days without disrupting the baby.
B00191YSLG It's a bit larger than I anticipated, but it went into my Britax B-Agile very easily and keeps my little guy warm. Well worth the money since we'll be able to use it for a couple of winters. The navy is much bluer in person than on my computer screen and the interior is very fuzzy. I love it!
B00191YSLG I advise that you have a big car seat because this does take quite some space that it will be snug or the car seat might make it too small for your child. It functions perfectly, keeps the kid warm, and doesn't cover their face so I love it.  We take it everywhere we go this winter in Seattle.
B00191YSLG THis has been great.  We have a car seat that locks into a stroller and keep st he baby toasty warm on walks.  Zipper runs a bit high so we haven't zipped it all the way up, but she's only 2 months old now so I like knowing there is room for her to get taller.  Easy to setup in the car seat (a Britax B-Safe).  Just be careful with what you dress the baby in since this puppy is warm.  If you dress them for cold weather and then put them in this in the car it can get pretty warm, too warm.
B00191YSLG I cannot say enough about how terrific this is for winter travel.  We live in Florida and traveled to colder climate for the Christmas holiday.  Although we bought cold weather clothes for our 4 month old, the bitter cold and snow would have made it terrible.  The Bundle Me was great, it stayed connected to the infant carrier and created an easy, warm way to transport the baby without worry of wind or cold.  He was totally happy and slept right through trips from the warm car to the house without being woken up from the dramatic drop in temperature.
B00191YSLG This cover works good in cold weather, acting like a sleeping bag to keep baby warm.  However, I felt odd putting the cover over his head if it was raining/ snowing because I felt like it was right on his face.  Like my other cover for bad weather days.
B00191YSLG My 4 month old used to have this car seat cover until I realized it's unsafe!  The layer of fabric between the baby and the actual seat prevents the safety straps from being as tight as they need to be in order to be effective in an accident.  It served it's purpose and kept him very warm but so does my new cover- and it doesnt jeopardize his safety.  Now I have the one that fits over the seat and although it's a little harder to get him in/out it keeps him just as warm and is not a safety hazard.
B00191YSLG This is a very nice product. You're not supposed to keep your baby in a snowsuit while it's in a car seat because it interferes with the tightening of the harness straps. This solved all my problems. With my first daughter I was constantly having to take her out of her snow suit and then put it back on her when we got to where ever we were going. It was a pain in the butt. I got smart with my second daughter and bought this. I will be using this again when my third daughter comes in a few months.
B00191YSLG The genuine \"bundle\" me, has to be at the top of every baby shower gift. I have owned them from day one. Since I came home from the hospital with baby number one. Hands down they are the best cold weather solution on the market. Totally eliminates the need for blanket layers. All you need is one fleece or sherpa blanket and your bundle me,and you can brave the elements.
B00191YSLG JJ Cole Original Bundleme Bunting Bag arrived very fast. The color I wanted to match the stroller and carseat was good and it looks comfy.
B00191YSLG This makes traveling with an infant just that much easier.  I find that I don't need to stuff my little one in a jacket and then into the car seat.  I can just put her right in this and she stays plenty warm (sometimes too warm).  It works great and it's so soft.  I only wish they made an adult size one. Just kidding, but it is super cuddly.
B00191YSLG loved it, this is fantastic item, I got the small one and I was worried because my little one is growing so fast, so when I saw this I ordered ASAP. really great!
B00191YSLG Although this is snuggly, soft, and adorable, when we took our car seat to our local California Highway Patrol station to have it professionally installed, he saw that I had put this in it (it was cold and rainy at the time) and warned me that car seats are not crash tested with these in them, that they can compress during an accident and cause the infant to slip, and 
B00191YSLG It was a life saver in the hash Chicago winters. I had to insert an extra folded blanket inside and zip it to make it warmer. It performed well under snow and mild rain but you might need a plastic wrap during heavy rains. My baby was not a fun of the product but it was necessary.
B00191YSLG Bought this for my new daughter as winters here are cold and long. It's easy to intall into the carseat, there are 3 separate holes for the shoulder straps to fit through so it will last and fit for as long as the car seat does. The top piece zips down or completely off and it very easy to take off or put back on. The color is a lovely rich purple and the comfy inside has almost every adult we meet commenting on how they want one for themselves.We have not yet washed it so I don't know how it holds up after washing or if the darker color will run onto the light one.
B00191YSLG We take the baby outside for his naps, walk around the neighborhood, etc. This is a great cover - you don't need to carry a blanket, if it's too warm you can unzip and take off the top part, the bottom part serves as a cushion.
B00191YSLG I wish I had used this item sooner.  I originally purchased this item before my son was born, but reading some reviews I scared myself out of using it based on some reviewers stating that it was not allowed on a car seat.  For this reason, I did not put it on the carseat for the first few months after my son was born.  I did keep it however to use it in the stroller.The bundleme is so very soft and cozy and protective especially in the harsh New England winter weather.After attending a mother's group where almost ALL of the other babies were in similar type bundle sacks, I was the only mother who did not have her child in a bundleme, and it felt criminal.  I did some more research, and found that it really was fine to use the bundleme correctly in a carseat.  It allows access to the safety straps and harness and does not cause any gaps.  My son felt as secure or even more so with the bundleme.Sometimes all of the research can lead to paranoia, but really this product is great whether you decide to use it in the stroller or the carseat.  Personally I found it to be such a comforting item to my child, and very safe and practical in use.
B00191YSLG This is a GREAT I recommend this highly.  It fits great in the Graco infant snugride, and keeps the baby nice and warm but still with plenty of room to move around.
B00191YSLG I have not hadf to put my son in a coat since using this bundle me. It keeps him warm, all he needs is a hat for his head. I usually just put him in thnis w a think sweater or jacket no need for a big bulky coat
B00191YSLG Looooove this product! Of course your child will need a coat, you're going OUTSIDE!! but it'll keep him so much warmer and comfortable. I don't go anywhere without this in the fall/winter. We just had a very cold winter here in NYC (even though there was no snow)and my son kept warm all throughout. I make sure I zip it all the way up so he's completely protected, hands and all. If it's really windy, I also use a weather shield plastic cover. If I could give this 10 stars I would. Would recomemend to everyone (and have!)
B00191YSLG It works with CITYMINI - take the colored seat top off, it snaps. Also take off the shade cover and the thing in the back which allows the seat to adjust backwords. Then put the black velro strip around the side of the seat. Put everything back together, and voila you can use the citimini and blanket without losing anything!
B00191YSLG I bought this for our Baby Jogger City Classic. It is perfect for keeping our toddler warm on chilly and windy walks. We've also used it in Yosemite for cold strolls on paved and semi-groomed areas. There was a light snow and the foot of the bundle me did get wet but kept our kid dry. When I got back to the hotel, pressing a towel against the wet spots dried it out instantly.My only complaint is the attachment elastic for the upper part of the bundle me. Because the Baby Jogger has an attached hood, it's difficult to secure the bundle me and keep it from sliding down. It took me awhile to come up with a solution.I finally found that I could unsnap two straps under the sun cover/hood where it attaches to the handle bar. It works, but the elastic is getting pulled down each time we put our toddler in the seat. It would be better if the bundle me had a two-piece adjustable strap that could go around the stroller more easily and not get stretched out over time.
B00191YSLG We purchased this because our baby was due in winter! The quality is GREAT, it's easy to place and EASY TO WASH! We expected less for the price but we were pleasently surprised.
B00191YSLG I really like our new bundle me and so does my baby. It keeps her warm and snug in her carseat as my car's heater doesn't work very well. She sleeps comfortably in it as well. It fits on the baby carrier very well and still keeps her in place.
B00191YSLG Having a February baby I knew I needed something very warm and comfortable when taking her out in the cold weather. This does not disappoint! It keeps my little girl very warm. The fabric is very fluffy and it is quality fabric. A must have for winter babies! I cant wit to use it in her stroller when she gets older.
B00191YSLG Purchased for our JJ Cole Broadway stroller. Keeps baby nice and warm and looks great. The only thing is I'm not sure about the fit. I thought that being the same brand, it would fit like a glove.. not so much. Still, worth the buy. When it's warmer out, we zip off the cover and keep the bottom piece in for added comfort.
B00191YSLG ~*My baby used to sweat in 25 degree weather with just his clothes and this bundle me. its very good quality! i like the khaki just in case of any stains/spills/spit up it camoflauges wonderfully!*~
B00191YSLG This item arrived promptly and as described.  It works wonderful, it's nice and soft, and I absolutely recommend it during winter.
B00191YSLG This product is very convenient.  It allowed to not have to bundle up our little with layers every time we left the house this past winter.  We had a brand new jacket for her that she never wore b/c of this product.  It was very durable and kept our baby very warm.
B00191YSLG This Bundleme can keep my son warm and cozy. Easy to set up and remove, Easy to wash. Love it very much!!!
B00191YSLG We Loved using his in Central NY for the bitter winters. Fit inside our Chicco Keyfit 30 infant carseat easily
B00191YSLG This has been great to keep my baby warm and snug in her stroller, really helped me immensely.  But please please please do not use this in a carseat - it is sooooo unsafe in the carseat because it interferes with the buckles getting tight enough.
B00191YSLG You basically have 2 options for the carseat. A big bulky snowsuit, which is advised against because it could compress in a crash and the baby could be ejected from the seat, or this cover. I choose this because I can unzip it and he won't sweat as much. He is almost 6 months now and if I restricted him in a snowsuit I wouldn't hear the end of it. ;) He also will kick off blankets I just tuck in the sides. So I zipper him in this and then unzipper once we get into the car. (remote start-awesome) The only negative is if I am taking him into a store. I still have to carry the car seat in with us or I would have to put him in a snowsuit in the car.
B00191YSLG I was so excited to get this product - thought it would save the effort of finding a blanket (and not losing it) to cover-up the little one during the winter months.My excitement was dashed this weekend when we had a car seat inspection done (by a licensed inspector) and she said that anything between your baby and the actual car seat is not recommended.  In fact any \"after market\" project is not recommended - meaning anything that does not come in the box with the car seat.  She said we could use it in the stroller if we wanted.  She also said that babies could have the potential over heat - not good - and that the car seat along with a blanket covering their legs would be more sufficient (when in car or inside a building - which are typically heated).  To protect the little one from any short term, cold outdoor temperatures to use a car seat cover (that goes over the entire outside of the car seat).
B00191YSLG I would be cautious with using this in your carseat, as it may affect the safety of baby in the car.  But we use ours only in our stroller, and so far it's been amazing.  It's a really beautiful, high-quality product.
B00191YSLG I am very fond of the product. i had doubts at first about it sliding down cz it's not made specifically for my stroller. i have a peg perego skate that like many other compatible strollers has a little lever in the back that reclines the seat. so i cut two parallel lines in the back of the bundle me cover about two inches from the top and an inch from each other. and pulled that \"strap\" over the lever. now it never slides down and it's just perfect for my extra tall kid.
B00191YSLG This has been washed at least twice, and air dried and still has held up.  Very warm and snuggly so I don't feel like I need to bundle my babe up.  We had -20 degree weather this winter and it was good enough.  I love the eggplant color.  The back part is very thin so there isn't much between baby and the car seat.
B00191YSLG Our son was born in March in a city that snows into the \"summer\" months.  This product was so great.  He has been using it since we brought him home from the hospital.  It is great not to have to bundle him up to go outside.  It fits in our Chicco carseat well.  A must have when you have a baby in the winter!
B00191YSLG I'm a first time mom...we live in Kansas so it gets pretty cold in the winter months. I do like this product, I purchased it in the cocoa color. I have a Chico 30 keyfit and the bundleme fits nicely. You do have to finagle it just a bit because if you don't put the elastic bungie underneath the canopy to loop it behind the carseat, then the material will be pretty taut where baby puts his/her back. I have not used it on our stroller yet as it's too cold out now to get out for leisurely walks. As soon as we do, I will be sure to update this post. But so far, so good!
B00191YSLG This is wonderful for winter babies, no more dropping in the parking lot.  I now give at all baby showers!
B00191YSLG I'm really glad I decided to splurge on this item because it does exactly what it is supposed to. This keeps my son bundled up and warm on our walks like he's in a little cocoon. He is so much more comfortable now when its cold outside. The back has several places where you can adjust the straps of your stroller though to the front. We have a baby trend jogger and it fits perfectly. When I put my son in this I just put thick socks on him because it is a pain when you get a shoe lost at the bottom, also its so toasty I don't think he really even needs to wear shoes if he is staying in the stroller.
B00191YSLG Well-made and very warm, also easy to use. It would be 5 stars, but my 9 month-old has already outgrown it in length; her legs have to be bent in the stroller to be able to zip her up in it. She's not freakishly tall - her feet don't hit the footrest on the stroller. This is more suitable for younger infants.
B00192JIZQ I agree with the other reviewers - they are adult proof as well as child proof! Unfortunately, I bought these at a Buy Buy Baby, and I hadn't read the reviews beforehand.  Lesson learned: always do research, no matter what the product.
B00192JIZQ My husband purchased these locally, not on Amazon.They're great if you have a cabinet you want EVERYONE to be locked out of. Try cooking dinner and being in the thick of it, and not being able to access your cabinets because you as an adult can't get these POS's to work.Don't buy. There has to be something better than this.
B00192JIZQ My oldest (now 4) figured out many cabinet locks by the time she was two. She lacks the strength and coordination to get this one undone, but my husband's arthritic grandmother has no problems undoing it. Love that it changes to green when it is tightened enough. Great feature for caregivers and visitors to our home. Doesn't work on all knobs though, as it is rather thick. We've found it works best on handles and longer knobs. It's quite strong too. We had one in use on our bathroom vanity and our oldest liked using it as a step to reach the faucet (much to our disapproval)
B00192JIZQ Bought these locally.  They looked similar to one I have, which works great.  These, however, are useless in that the parent can't even get these to open. I have one that works okay.  The other one was violently ripped off the cabinet by my husband this evening after being on for only a few hours as he nor I could get the lock to budge.  Going to remove the other one before it seizes up and has to be broken in half like the first one.  Waste of time and money.
B00192JIZQ There are better options available for securing cabinets.  We are currently using the slide type lock on other cabinets (no complaints or problems with these), but we wanted to try this product on an entertainment center because this product is less conspicuous.  However, the hook portion of the product is too thick to use on knob style handles.  Also, the handles must be spaced a good distance apart because the hooks do not slide all the way together.  The gap on our entertainment center was too large (3\" apart).  We also tried to use it on a kitchen cabinet with conventional handles, but it was not very secure.  This may be a usable product in the exactly right situation, but I don't know what that would be.
B00192JIZQ We bought several of these.  The instructions seem easy enough, but I can assure you even NOT attached to a cabinet they are a pain in the you know what to open.  I'm having to buy all new locks, so don't bother getting these...no, your kids won't be able to open the doors, but neither will you!
B00192JIZQ this lock is not working at all, once it locked, you won't be able to open it. they should re-design this or discontinue this product.luckily, I didn't buy it. I got it from a friend and decided not to use it after we couldn't open it! what a waste!
B00192JIZQ I bought these (vs other brands) because it looked a bit more stylish...and because we're in a rental and don't want to drill or leave adhesive if we can help it. However, it was a mistake. These are such a pain in the butt to put on and take off that I hardly ever go into the cupboards that I put them on. So, if it's for cupboards that you hardly ever use, go for it. Instead, I finally just emptied the cupboard (guest bath) of anything dangerous. I should have taken these back to Target the day I bought them but I thought \"Oh, they'll get better when I get more used to them.\" NOT. It's been months and I still hate them and now don't have the packaging or the receipt (at least they weren't terribly expensive). And as others have mentioned, be sure the spacing works for your cabinet knobs...
B00192JIZQ Let me start out by saying this lock is not for every cabinet which is why I gave it three stars.  For cabinets that store items such as pots and pans,etc. I would recommend an easier lock to get on and off.  However, we use this for our cabinet with household cleaners, etc where I do not want our toddler having even a remote chance of breaking the lock and this serves its purpose well.  The lock takes a a few times to master but it can be easily unlocked once you have had a little practice.  This lock is perfect for  cabinets that store dangerous items.
B00192JIZQ We have beige cabinets with knob pulls and these blend right in. I do not believe they will work with handle door pulls though.  We have gotten a pack that was hard to open but these have been great.  If they are a little difficult to open at first they loosen up over time.
B00192JIZQ Listen to the reviews! Unless you have at least 10 extra minutes every time you want to open your cabinet, buy something else. ZERO STARS!!
B00192JIZQ OK, I'll write one for the other side.  These aren't THAT hard to open.  Maybe they did some redesigning with it (I'm using this in mid 2009, and the other reviewers seemed to have this in 2008).  Yes, it takes two hands - i dont expect any of the child proofing devices not to.  (I have never been in a situation where I absolutely couldnt put my child down - when they are in the stage when you need to child proof, they are a lot more independent).What I am taking stars away for, however, is that they technically are too large for my cabinets.  My knobs are only 2.5\" apart center-to-center, so the thing doesnt close enough to activate the button on the right-inside that turns the safety indicator from red to green (looks like you'd need at least 3\" between the centers).  The device stays on and wont come off without you using the button at the bottom.  However, this means that the cabinet doors can be opened somewhat.  My daughter is 1, so I'm not sure how much this matters or doesnt, but the product should be designed for closer set knobs.  It might help that she probably cant really grasp the knobs with this over it since its bulky (we have ones like this [...]  We'll see how long that lasts...
B00192JIZQ I don't review on many things, but I felt I should say a word or two about these locks. I bought these for the babysitters house since my 8 month old son is now getting into all her cabinets. It took us about 5 minutes to even get the things open after messing with them and once we got them open and on the cabinets, they didn't even fit. Unless, your cabinet handles are literally within an inch of eachother, it won't work. I took them back right away!!
B00192JIZQ We bought this when we were planning to set up our childcare at home.  It works for cabinets with small knobs that are close together like the one below the sink where most of the cleaning products are kept.It is mostly made of plastic in neutral color which is actually not a sore eye at all. Relatively easy to install, you just need to hook both ends to the knobs and push them close together.  There is a window indicator which will tell you if it is properly installed.  A red open padlock signals you to push it further together and a green padlock tells you it is safely locked.It works very good for protecting and locking the cabinets.  There is a slide button on top that you need to push with your thumb if it's time to remove it.  I got the hang of it after some practice but not without a some effort.  I agree that it is probably safe for toddlers and smaller hands, but my wife complains that is quite a hassle even for adults to unlock it.
B00192JIZQ This is the WORST babyproofing product we have tried. I wish I would have read the reviews before buying but I got these at a big box store. Once the lock was on I couldn't get it off. My fingers were sore from trying to get it to unlock. Finally, I had to unscrew the cabinet knob (which was a feat in itself!) to get it off. These are awful. Listen to the other negative reviews and save yourself some frustration and hassle and buy something else.
B00192JIZQ I should have listened to the other reviews.  One of the locks was defective - it would not release/open after locking my cabinet.  The other was very difficult and painful to get open.
B00192JIZQ We have beautiful wood cabinets and wanted to avoid drilling holes into them with the latches to prevent our infant from opening them.  We bought these cabinet locks for all the cabinets in our house (so we have a bunch of them).  They're extremely difficult to open (for adults), which makes them inconvenient when you're trying to get into the cabinet.  You have to push a button while applying pressure to the inner part of the hook and pull outwards...maybe wrapping rubberbands around the cabinet knobs would have been easier and more enjoyable to use.
B00192JIZQ The Safety 1st Grip n' Go is super frustrating to open without a little experience. To echo what one of the other reviews have pointed out, you have to push the two clamps together while pressing the button before you can pull them apart. This takes a little practice, and even then, it's not the most intuitive experience. The &#34;button&#34; is less like a doorbell, and more like a latching device that you have to press with a lot of force at a specific inward angle to unlock.There's also a crude, color-coded red/green indicator that lets you know when your cabinet lock is locked. This indicator tells you nothing, you know when the device is locked by giving it a tug, and the indicator slides out of place pretty easily. I don't know why they bothered including it.Once you learn how to use it, it does keep your cabinets secure from prying little hands, and unlike other locking devices, you don't have to screw them into anything. That said, a simple cabinet lock shouldn't be this difficult to operate, no matter how inexpensive they are.
B00192OI2E I bought these and then read the review about them being too wide and bought some spring loaded safety first latches, planning to use them instead. The spring loaded ones popped up when I tried to close the drawer and I had to push the latch down each time I closed the drawer. So I tried installing these instead (they are one piece for latch, one piece for catch, no spring loading) and they worked perfectly.They do allow small hands into the drawer or cabinet, so you will have to take that into account in organizing your stuff -- so I have spoons in the front, knives in the back.  My son is 18 months and cannot yet defeat these.
B00192OI2E These work well and install reliably, unlike the terrible spring-loaded version. They have adequate length, but the specially made under counter latches are also recommended and reviewed by me. I used both in my kitchen.
B00192OI2E Work great and have em on every door.  All tho it seems to have taken my husband quite a while to put them up...
B00192OI2E I've bought about six different types of latches, and so far, these are the ones that work best for my needs.  The lever's reach (its \"width\" as other reviewers have called it) is longer than some competitors (some of those others are too short for some installations, such as under counter overhangs).  In some types of cabinetry, you can mount the catch as far back as you want.  If, however, you have \"face frame\" cabinets, you may not be able to mount the catch far back enough to prevent a small arm from reaching inside the door.Basic construction: thin plastic is just strong enough to be secure, but does not give a feeling of solidity.  The levers are quite flexible compared to some others, so a child may learn to defeat these more quickly than stiffer, thicker models.Security: Good.  This is the most important feature, and the only reason this product gets four stars instead of three.  The lever and catch have tabs that grab onto each other and prevent the latch from popping open when the door or drawer is opened quickly - a problem I've had with the Kidco model.Hardware: acceptable, barely.  The screws are only 0.5\" long.  If you are screwing into soft wood, you may want to get larger screws.Overall: gets the job done.
B00192OI2E So I put these on all my drawers and cabinets.  Easy to install and seemed like they all worked great.  Though my 2 year old could still pull the drawer open a few inches because of the design and reach his hand in to grab stuff like utensils. So had to place things away from front of drawer.  Then my 2 year old figured out that if he pulled the drawer open with force ( the few inches allow him to get momentum ) that the plastic tips just break. Within a couple days he had defeated every drawer he wanted to get into.  This would have been a great product if it was made of something stronger like a hard steel.  They are just too fragile. Back to the net to try and find something better.  These may fool your kid for a short time but eventually they will figure it out, just hope it is not the drawer with the knives or the door under the sink.  Pass on this and get something better.  It is true, you get what you pay for, what is your kids safety worth?
B00192OI2E These work great, wish they where a little longer for not standard shaped drawers (required some modification for instillation on an antique piece of furniture).
B00192OI2E These safety 1st latches are OK.  However, if you can afford it I'd pay a little extra and get the 10 pack of spring n release latches.  I had purchased these latches at walmart.  Then I realized I needed more and purchased the spring latches.  I started installing.  Overall to install 20 latches (they install exactly the same) it took 5 hours.  I predrilled all of the holes.  I feel that is a must.  Be careful I drilled too far once and went through the front of the cabinet.  Oops!I installed the spring ones first.  Then when I started in on this product I noticed they looked a little different.  I just think in the long term the spring latches will last longer.  I'd certainly never want to do this project again!!!Edited to say:  These are 1/2 inch longer than the spring latches.  I forgot to add that until I read other reviews.
B001936S4O These were the best for eating in a restaurant with small children and babies. I still use them sometimes for my 3 year old (when I remember to put them in my purse. They stick securely on all four edges and keep baby from eating directly off the table. I used a reusable place mat for my older child, but my younger one would pull it off the table. Not these... the Neat Solutions Baby Einstein Biodegradable Table Topper Disposable Stick-on he left on the table where it belonged. He enjoyed looking at and pointing to the pictures, it was very entertaining for him while waiting for his food when he was very small.
B001936S4O My baby reached the point of only eating finger foods but was not well practiced using a plate.  These allow me to provide a clean surface for her to eat off of at restaurants. I received two different prints in one package. I am very satisfied with my purchase.
B001936S4O Super convenient and easy to use, and they stay well on most restaurant tables. The only downside is that sometimes there is residue left behind from the sticky strips.
B001936S4O Works just as written. I don't know what the fuss is all about not being able to peel the sticker, we had no trouble whatsoever. Because of this we can dine out comfortably and with peace of mind because those tiny hands won't be touching on nasty tables anymore.
B001936S4O We love this for eating out at restaurants. It totally saves us from holding a plate to keep it from being broken by our 1 year old! The only complaint is that it can be somewhat difficult to place, especially when the little one is grabbing it - and you only really get one shot at it - likely by design, to make it easy to remove. Sometimes, it leaves a bit of an outline from the adhesive - but with a little elbow grease it removes easily. A must for the diaper bag!
B001936S4O I can't seem to find the ones made of calcium and are fully biodegradeable so these were the next best thing. They work great, lots of colors and the multi pack I purchased from Amazon came with a few different designs that my son seems to love. He can't really color on them which isn't a huge deal.  Great for easy cleanup!
B001936S4O I loved this idea but I can't get my son to stop peeling it off the table. The adhesive doesn't go completely to the edge, so my little one can pull up the edge and rip it right off.
B001936S4O we bought this to go with this Inglesina chair, and I have to said I think it is one of our best baby purchases. These things STICK to the table, so he can't get them up. Being that his hands always touch surfaces and then go in his mouth, and knowing that restaurants either clean with nasty chemicals or do not clean enough-these are a MUST have for your baby.
B001936S4O Absolutely love these disposable stick on placemats! We had a boring one before (i can't even remember what it is lol) but this one has nice bright colors.
B001936S4O I've tried several brands of disposable placemats and these are the best (and cheapest) I've found.  The plastic is thicker than others and the adhesive that sticks it to the table is much stronger than others we've tried.
B001936S4O If you go out to eat a lot this is a must have for sure! Sticks right on the table and kiddo can est rift off of it. Of course once your child can est off a plate im touching need these anymore.
B001936S4O My son loves them because they are colorful and fun.  I love them because they keep my son from eating food right off the tables at the restaurants. Easy to use and I recommend them to everyone!
B001936S4O Purchased the Neat Solutions Baby Einstein 30-count Biodegrable Table Toppers.  Received Neat Solutions Baby Einstein Eco-friendly table toppers made in China, package print reads 18 (must have been a misprint, in such cases these mistakes are usually off-loaded at close-out prices but these were sold not as such) but has a white round sticker slapped on top that reads 30.  Package has a white round sticker slapped on top of the 18 that reads 30 - I counted the package contents and it did indeed contain 30 table toppers but they are not as pictured, not biodegradable, and not made in the USA as the description misleads.  See photos uploaded by me and you will see what I mean...I did use a handful of these before realizing they are not what I had ordered, at least it does not match as pictured and described.  That issue aside, the product is useful to a point.  The 5th piece used, my 8 month old son found the corners and started peeling the plastic sheet off the table with relative ease so it was rendered useless within 2 mins of having stuck it on the table in the restaurant. Size is kinda small, would be even better if the length was longer/wider so that my son does not end up touching the table to the left and right.Hope this review helps.
B001936S4O We love using these disposable placemats at restaurants with our toddler.  He's still at the stage where he's &#34;exploring&#34; his food (a.k.a. getting it everywhere) so it's nice to have a large area for him to contain his food.  We also felt better about having his food on top of these mats instead of on the restaurant table.  The designs/pictures on the mats also kept him distracted for a bit (until something else catches his attention).  The best part is being able to peel it off at the end of the meal and roll up his mess right along with it.  The only thing to be careful of are the sneaky fingers that try to rip it off.  Also, it doesn't stick to all surfaces so be wary of that.
B001936S4O We always feel guilty for the mess our baby leaves behind at restaurant tables, and these mats help us to keep things under control. Now they need to make one for the floor ;)
B001936S4O We got these primarily because our baby loves to gnaw on the table when out at restaurants... The disposable placemats given at Chick-Fil-A worked great as a barrier for her, so we got these. Ehh, these aren't nearly as good - she manages to yank these off in a matter of seconds vs the other ones staying on for most of our meal.
B001936S4O if you hate germs these are wonderful they cover the table so baby can put food all over it and play with the pretty pictures as well
B001936S4O These are great and a must have for any diaper bag. My son is still pretty young and small (10 months) and I'm a little concerned he will have no trouble ripping these off once he gets a little bigger but for the last few months they have been great and make me feel much more comfortable when we eat out. I lay this down, place his food on it and away he goes.
B001936S4O These are perfect. I love them. They are easy to put on and do the job. I pop one on a restaurant table, toss down some tiny finger foods and everyone is happy. Plus my child isn't ingesting all the chemicals and germs left behind by others!
B001936S4O My husband and I use to cringe when our son would move his food to the restaurant table.  Finally, we can have a little bit of peace with these placemat.  Additionally, we are thankful we can leave our table a little cleaner at restaurants because the placemat kind of contains the mess.  The biodegradable quality is a nice bonus!On a side note, this specific item number is better than the item that comes with the container.  The container is too bulky to be practical.
B001936S4O We use it every time we eat out and it keeps my son from making a bigger mess. Plus, it keeps my son from putting his hands all over the table which could have been cleaned with a dirty rag. Lots of wait staff have mentioned how it is such a great idea. It does leave some glue residue on some plastic table tops but, so far, we have been able to get the glue off with baby wipes and elbow grease.
B001936S4O I LOVE these. Not only are they practical for eating out, but they are educational too. I'm a teacher and I love the Baby Einstein products.
B001936S4O Very colorful and fun disposable placemats.  I think these are a great deal because you get so many for the price.
B001936S4O I do not, as much as I would like to, always have time to wipe off every surface my child touches. However, if the surface is one he'll be eating off of, I would dearly like for it to be clean. And this is where these neat little table toppers come in. Just slap one down, and you don't have to worry about what grime lies in the cracks of the table underneath. It also makes clean up (of the table, at least) easier - just pull up the sides, wrapping up any remaining food on the mat, and toss it.The one thing that annoys me are the stick on sides. It's really tricky to pull the plastic off the stick-on edges, even more so when your little one is grabbing at it. It seems impossible sometimes to get a nail between the table topper and the plastic covering the adhesive. But, if you don't stick all four sides down, it's pretty much guaranteed that you might as well have not used the topper at all, as it's going to end up on the floor (along with anything that was on it). Baby Einstein - all your stuff is made so well, please add a little \"pull here\" tab to the sticky edge covers and this item will be PERFECT.
B001936S4O I bought one pack of these a year ago and still have not run out.  (We eat out just a few times a month).  They work really well and I like how they are sticky on all four sides which makes them harder for my toddler to take off.  My package had a &#34;30 count&#34; sticker over the 18 count on the package, but I did count and there were 30 inside.  Great buy and seems like a better value than what you can buy in stores.
B001936S4O Great product...really works well when dining out with baby.  My son loves them!  It really separates him from all the germs that could be on tables.
B001936S4O Fantastic product, works as specified. I keep a couple of these in the diaper bag for impromptu meals out with baby and they are invaluable.
B001936S4O I keep a packet of these in the diaper bag and they are so useful for when we go out to eat. They easily stick to the table to provide a clean, sanitary, area for my son to eat from since plates and bowls just are thrown. They are also easy to remove and leave no marks.
B001936S4O These table toppers are great!  I use them because I want to protect my little one from the germs and dirt on tables.  I also use them b/c it saves servers time cleaning up.  I stick them to the table, let my son make a mess then peel the table topper off and roll it into itself.
B001936S4O My title says it all.  Chick -a-Fila use to have these available at thier restaurants and I used to take a couple at a time.  They got smart and now only put them in the bags for kids meals.  So, I purchased them here.  I really don't think it matters what type of charater you get, it is just important to be able to put these down on the table in public restaurants.  The mat stays in place with a sticky adheseve on the back.  My baby is too young to eat off of a plate, without her trying to throw the plate on the floor.  I feel good knowing that my baby is not eating off of a table that was probably cleaned by a dirty dishrag anyway!  So my advice to you moms out there... Get these!
B001936S4O Just started taking our twins out to eat and have used twice. Work well and fell comfortable with them eating off table when out. Did leave a little residue on one table that did come off when scraped. Packed in easy to carry bag.
B001936S4O I've always relied on these placemats - mostly to keep my kids' messes contained and easy to clean up.  But I do find that they are easily pulled up by the younger eater when he wants to be like the big kid.  I haven't found that they leave any residue on the tables we stuck them to.
B001936S4O We really like these convenient disposable placemats. They keep his little hands from the dirty table and also keeps him entertained while we are eating as he likes touching the little pictures. We keep them in his eating out pouch that containes his food, disposable spoons, wipes, and bibs.
B001936S4O We have used these table toppers since our son began sitting up in a highchair when we went out and the table toppers have been a life saver!  We have avoided plate throwing and messes are easily cleaned up with removal of the topper from the table.  This will absolutely be a repeat purchase.
B001936S4O These are great for eating out! I like that they are colorful and entertain my son  but also stick well to the tables. I usually fold them over the end of the table too since he likes to try to put his mouth on the tables. 36 for this price? You cant beat that!
B001936S4O I loved using these on our trip as well as every restaurant visit we've taken.  We sanitize before putting these down, and don't have to worry about bringing plates for our DD.
B001936S4O They peeled off pretty easily...most young infants like to play with everything... so we would use this but wouldn't last but a minute because our child would easily peel it away!!!! love the concept though... and cute colorful design.
B001936S4O I use these for my one year old whenever we go out to eat, since he makes a big mess and cannot eat off of a plate without throwing it. These make it a sanitary eating experience!
B001936S4O These are nice to have when we go out with our son to restaurants and we need to feed him.  You do not have to worry about the cleanliness of the table or how dirty things will get.  My son is only 11 months, so he is more fascinated with the noise the plastic makes than the decorations.
B001936S4O Adhesive strips on all 4 sides help, but intrepid toddler fingers can still peel them up. But, that's true of all stick on placemats! These work well for what we need: something for our 1 yr old to eat on when we are traveling or when we are trying to contain most if the mess at friend's homes.
B001936S4O These are perfect! They are self adhesive, right size and colorful perfect for meals at restaurants.  Bought these for my daughter and her and her husband love them!
B001936S4O These are a must have for going out to dinner with babies.  They are really easy to use and they protect the baby from laying food on a dirty table, but also protect the table from getting all dirty from the baby! I carry them in the diaper bag and use them whenever we go to a restaurant with our 2 year old. I would highly recommend this product.
B001936S4O This product works great! It has adhesive on all four sides (unlike another review said). We just have to peel the plastic backing on the adhesive (the plastic is static-y, so it's easier if you have another person to take the plastic while you continue to peel other sides), and then position it on the table.We like to leave a little extra room to cover under the table since our LO likes to run her little hands around the edge.The design is cute too and you can describe it to your LO to distract him/her.Given that, I wish it was a little wider though. Maybe for babies/kids who are more still, this might not be an issue, but our LO likes to reach for everything so it seems like this topper doesn't cover enough area. I guess I can use two, but that's overkill. Maybe just 5-6 more inches wider would've been helpful!
B001936S4O Good materials, great design and good colors. My daughters love them (they are twins). Easy to use and 100% portable.
B0019449JO I don't like these.Pros:1. These are very easy to install. Simply press into place.2. Color blends in well with the outlet.3. Very cheap (price, that is...see below for quality problems)Cons:1. If you have fingers bigger than the average 6 year-old, good luck getting these off when you need to. You either need to use a screwdriver to pry a corner while pushing the center \"push tab\", or tear your fingers up with extreme pressure.2. You have to be a master at \"Twister - the Hand Version\" to get these off. Push tab serves no purpose. It was SUPPOSED to add leverage to allow you to use one-hand to slide it out of the socket, but I always end up doing the following:A: Using my right hand's thumb and middle finger, grip the sides.B: Using my left hand's thumb, reach up in-between my right hand's death-grip and push hard on the center push  leverC: Using my left hand's pointer finger, reach over and down, in-between my right hand's grip, and pull at the top of the plugD: Apply steady, painful pressure on all points, until my fingers start to hurt, or it comes off3. Little fingers can more easily wiggle their points into the protector, kind of defeats the purpose...Overall: I DON'T LIKE IT - 2 STARSAvoided one star because of the price...I shouldn't have cheaped-out on these, spend a few more dollars, and gotten better ones. Caveat Emptor.
B0019449JO This is a horrible product.  Waste of money since I now have to throw them all out.My 17 month old just pulled one out without any problem.Useless and Dangerous!
B0019449JO After breaking several fingernails trying to get outlet covers off, I tried several brands and found this to be the only one that didn't fight me.  I have 15 month old twins and they haven't tried to pull them out. I also like how there is a built in way to clip the cover to a cord.  So, when I pull out the cover to use the vacuum, I can clip the cover to the cord. No more forgetting to replace the cover when I'm done! I highly recommend this plug cover!
B0019449JO 
B0019449JO My toddler can remove these covers in about a second!  They do nothing to protect your children from live outlets.  You could turn your back to find your child had pulled it out and stuck something into the outlet.  Terrible product.  Do not buy these covers choose a different design.  I have replaced mine with the Mummy's Little Helper covers which DO stay in place and my little man can not pull out.
B0019449JO This company should be ashamed to sell such a hazardous product. Any child can remove them from the socket. They are a choking hazard.
B0019449JO My child quickly figured out how to remove these outlet covers. Don't waste your money. Just buy the cheapos that are more difficult for you and nearly impossible for your toddler to remove.
B0019449JO My 11 month old can take these off with no problem. They're junk. Don't bother. Just use the old-fashioned, flat covers instead.
B0019449JO If you buy these, you may want to buy locally in case you need to return them.  I have seen raving reviews, but I just don't see why.These plugs just slip in to the socket and there is nothing to keep them in there like the \"dual release\" plugs (which we have and work).  Another option is to get the plate covers.These plugs are marketed for adults.  Even on the front of the box it notes \"push to pop out - save your nails\" and \"clip to vacuum cord when cleaning - never lose it again\".  You won't break your nails on these plugs because they come out fairly easily - you don't even need to push their little button.  My 10 month old twins can wiggle these out - and they didn't even see me install/remove them.  So, you still have the electrical hazard as well as a choking hazard.I do not recommend this product based on my personal experience.I will add that I shared my sentiments with Safety 1st and they did contact me to try to resolve my dissatisfaction.
B001950V90 I love this bottle brush! I bought it before my daughter was born and did not realize what a great brush it was until we needed another one and my husband bought a different kind. It is so sturdy and gets everything clean really easily. I like that it doesn't have a \"sponge\" type thing on the end like so many do. That just holds bacteria. I did not, however, use the soap dispensing feature so I cannot comment on that. To me, there is no need. If you are looking for a great bottle brush, this is it.
B001950V90 I bought this brush to help clean the countless bottles you get piled up with little kiddos. I like the soap dispenser in it but I wish it also had a smaller brush to help clean the nipples better.
B001950V90 This bottle brush is too big for the mouth of a traditional bottle. You can shove it in the bottle, and it will do the job, but when you yank it out - and I do mean you have to really pull - the water on the bristles shoots everywhere. Then you have to spend the next 10 minutes drying yourself and your kitchen. No thanks. AND THE SOAP LEAKS! Awful product.
B001950V90 I like this brush, i had been looking for a bottle brush like this for months. I use half the soap when I clean, which makes me happy and saves me money which I like. I will be getting this for every one that I know with a baby.
B001950V90 Good and practice to clean baby stuff at kitchen and use a different thing to the normal cleaning things at the kitchen
B001950V90 I had the standard Munchkin bottle brush and loved it, so I thought I'd try this one since it holds/dispenses the soup. This brush is actually quite different from the non-dispensing one. This brush's middle is thicker, and the bristles are denser and more rigid, so I had a hard time getting this brush in and out of the bottles. Also, because of the rigidness of the bristles, I would get a spray of soapy water on my arms as I pulled the brush out of the bottle. I went back to the cheaper and more simple Muchkin bottle brush and am much happier.
B001950V90 For me, this brush has been the absolute best!The soap dispensing feature came in handy when we went on vacation and I didn't have to carry soap with me to wash the baby bottles. I had no issues with the soap squirting too much or too little. It was alwasy the right amount. Having to wash about 6 feeding bottles many times a day for my twins, the bristles of this brush held up very well for many months. It has a nice suction thing that will make it stand up like in the picture so it dries nicely after use. BTW there is no nipple brush that comes with this so you get only the big brush. Hope this helps.
B001950V90 I was using a sponge-topped bottle brush, but thought I'd try this one because it dispensed the soap. Not really pleased with it. The bristles are too stiff, and a touch too big, so when you pull the brush out of the bottle, it flings water all over the place. Worse yet, the soap doesn't come out easily -- I have to hold the brush upside down for about 45 seconds before the button to dispense the soap will work -- even when it's really full!  I think it's got some funky design flaws that could be fixed to make it better. Just my opinion though. :)
B001950V90 I bought this to clean my baby bottles with and thought the soap dispnser was genius, however it didnt work great, soap just leaks out of it hen held upside down, it doesnt just squirt a little and runs out quickly.  The brush part s good and fits in most wide baby bottles, doesnt fit in regular dr browns baby bottles.
B0019526UW My son loves using this.  It works well and is easy to use.  The only drawback, like someone else said, is its very difficult to keep the inside clean.  We turn ours upside down and put it on the edge of the tub but it still got moldy after about a year.  For the price, its a great product.  Im buying a new one to replace ours instead of going with a different product.
B0019526UW It's obnoxious. I do everything in my power to get all the water out when drying, but it still gets mold in the &#34;feet&#34; of the pelican.  It's a bit frustrating and it doesn't come out in a very smooth stream.Technically it does rinse because water comes out, but it shouldn't be so difficult to maintain.
B0019526UW I really like having a rinser to rinse my toddler's hair. It holds a large amount of water and it has a cute design.
B0019526UW We had SO many toddler toys after babysitting our first grandson for our second to play with, we thought adding to the collection of bath toys would be a good idea for #2's first birthday.  We're lucky that both of our \"munchkins\" thoroughly enjoy bathtime, and not only is this darling pelican great for rinsing, it's also perfect for storing some of his little bath squirters!  Sometimes it's a little scary when a baby graduates - in our case, from the confined space of the kitchen sink! -to an adult bathtub, which must feel like an ocean to them!  Colorful, fun bath toys are a good way to ease the transition.  I sometimes bathe both boys together when I'm short on time, and even Big Brother enjoys the new assortment of toys.  Happy grandkids = happy grandma!  Great purchase.
B0019526UW The water stream coming from his mouth doesn't travel horizontally very much, it makes it difficult to aim the stream of water away from my baby's eyes.  It's not very useful for watering my plants, either.  Looks great on the bathtub shelf tho!
B0019526UW We love this rinser! It holds a good amount of water and is lightweight. My 2 year old daughter likes to take it and dump the water over her head. A great buy!
B0019526UW I bought this because it's so much cuter than a rinse cup & my daughter seemed to like it...BUT...I had to spend too much time cleaning it weekly. Not sure if others have noticed but it does get moldy in the cracks & is extremely difficult to clean because of the shape. I threw it away & started using a plastic cup & guess what??? my daughter plays with that as well!!Too expensive & difficult to clean so not worth the money.
B0019526UW So truthfully a large plastic cup is just fine for rinsing soap out of hair, but what are baby showers for if not to get ridiculously adorable items you wouldn't otherwise justify spending money on?  We got this as a shower gift and I love it.Pros:Hole on top makes it easy to fill.Holds a decent enough amount of water to rinse baby's hair but not so much that it's heavy.Sturdy plastic means it doesn't bow with pressure (like a plastic drinking cup might).Cute, I could see this transitioning into a toy when my daughter is older.Cons:Not easy to clean out.  Pelican's mouth isn't wide enough to get your hand in super easily and it's shape means there are some little cracks that you can't reach.  I haven't had the build up others have mentioned, but I'd suggest maybe turning it upside down to drain after use and a bottle brush?
B0019526UW I fell in love with this little rinser because our nursery was beach themed. At first, we just used a small squirt bottle for baby when she started having full immersion baths. But as she grew, we were having to refill the bottle just to rinse her off. So we finally got this off our registry because it was bigger than the squirt bottle and cuter than a plain cup. It was the perfect size when it arrived, but all the water rushed out the first time we poured it over her. There was no good way to see how close the water level was to the lip edge in order to control a slower pour. Even after we figured out how to control the speed of the pour, the rounded pelican mouth prevents controlling the volume of water poured. if it had just a slight point, it would be much easier to aim. Since we spent the money on it, we use it to rinse her back and we'll try to rinse her head with it again once she gets a little older. But so far this is ending up to be a major inconvenience and disappointment. Also, I have NOT noticed any scum/mold like some other reviewers.
B0019526UW I love this. It's fun and will last a long time. Will become a tradition with bathtime.
B0019526UW We gave this as part of a baby shower present & the girl loved it.  Not sure how well it worked after the baby was born but it looked super cute as she was holding it up during the shower!  It gets lots of compliments that's for sure!
B0019526XE &#8226;Includes baby food grinder and fresh food feeder&#8226;Safely introduces your baby to fresh food&#8226;Ideal for fresh fruits and vegetables&#8226;Ideal for babies above 6 months
B0019526XE I got one of these at a Goodwill store, and it was so handy that I bought one for my diaper bag in case we stopped at restaurants. There are a few things to remember: 1. the metal grate only goes one way, dips downward. If you put it the other way it won't chop right. 2. the flat side of the blades must face the metal grate, or it won't chop right. 3. the knob on top controls how tight the handle is. You might have to loosen it up just a little to turn easily. 4. food must be relatively soft. I've chopped chicken and lasagna with no problem, and no leaks. Use common sense with food, if you chop pineapple it turns to liquid and might leak a little bit. 5. The biggest headache with this is getting the assembly out after use. I use a pointy can opener inserted into a grate hole to get it the grate to rotate. OK, yeah, that's a pain. Otherwise, this thing is just the best. When I put the pieces in the dishwasher I put the interior pieces in an appropriate baby bottle basket (which you probably have anyway if you're taking care of an infant), but I keep the blade and metal shaft together and screw the top knob onto the metal shaft to keep those three small pieces together so they don't drift out. Yes, it's a little cumbersome to clean, but no more than your everyday blender or food processor. Even if you only use this once in awhile, it's so inexpensive that it's a shame to not be able to share your food with your kiddo!
B0019526XE I bought this grinder planning to mash up some simple foods for my daughter to try on a meal by meal basis. I did not intend to use it for mass food production.It's awful! The handle keeps getting stuck, the grinder jams easily, it's a mess. I'm not happy with it at all. It's too much work to clean and use. A fork works better.The feeder is okay. I've used it once, but can see it being more useful when my daughter gets a little bigger.
B0019526XE I like the masher a lot.  It does very small amounts of food easily, so the baby just gets a little of whatever we're having - beets, sweet potatoes, peaches, whatever.  This is way easier than making separate baby food, and more interesting for him.  Plus, if he doesn't like something, I didn't have to make a blender-full to find that out. (For whatever reason, current dislikes include carrots - who'd have guessed?)The mesh feeder is more hit-or-miss; the baby will mouth the food end a bit and then settle into chewing the plastic ring end.  Perhaps this will improve as he gets the hang of it.  I've heard these are difficult to wash but we have not found it so. (We've just avoided putting banana in it, which I hear is the worst culprit for sticking to the mesh.)  It's been used so far with cantaloupe, watermelon and apricots without trouble.  The feeder does need to be hand-washed; a dishwasher will not get the bits off.
B0019526XE I loved that this was BPA, Phthalate, and PVC free first of all.  It worked great for a couple of months with light use...but it's not doing a good job anymore. (even with something that should be easily 'mushed')  Boo :(  At least it was cheap I guess. I'll still buy another with the next kiddo...it's worth $10.
B0019526XE I got this feeding set after browsing around Amazon for affordable babyfood making products to play around with. My 6-month-old baby only recently started eating solid foods, so I wanted to buy a few things to experiment with. It has great reviews, so I gave it a shot. Plus, I love that this comes with the food mill and little food sucker thing combined...two things to try and the package is affordable.Here are my findings:Food processor...First: how it works: Basically, it's two pieces (more if you unscrew all the parts). You put the food, like a banana, in the cylinder of the main piece and you put that cylinder on top of the plunger. You then apply downward pressure to the cylinder while cranking the mill. As you do this, the food is churned through small holes in the top of the cylinder and retained in a small basin. You then Scoop the food into your storage device, like a bowl. I scooped mine into infantino pouches.--If you're processing a hard food, like pineapple, you really have to push down hard on the cylinder. This can be uncomfortable for the wrists, as it's a sideways push for the wrists due to the angle. It would be great to have a little handle to help with leverage.--Some foods don't strain as easily as others. For example, banana comes right on through while pineapple does not.--You have to take the whole thing apart to clean...including unscrewing the crank. It's a pain for a simple product.The food processor is great. I wasn't sure how it would work because I'd never used one before, but it's fast and easy. There's a lot to clean up though. I'm glad to have this in our kitchen, even if it's not an everyday item.Now, the food pouch...I put pineapple in this and my daughter went nuts. She loves it. Now that she's teething, we like to put cold fruit pieces in there for her to suck on, like cold apple. What a great add-on!
B0019526XE This grinder does not grind meat worth a flip.  It seems to work ok on fruits and pasta and softer foods that don't have fibers like meat.I have used it in a pinch for soft foods and it does make a good size grind.
B0019526XE Can only get small particles of food, easy and effortless, but at the bottom of the cleaning is not very convenient, use loose screw has some three months
B00198PQHY I love this mobile, and so does my son.  It plays 4 different songs and the remote control is great.  The animals are cute and they turn as the mobile goes around which helps keep baby's attention.The only complaints I have are that it doesn't attach well to my crib and the light isn't very good.I had to attach this mobile to the short edge of my baby's crib rather than the longer side, because the edges on the long side are curved.  Right now I have the mobile attached to the side of a chair so I can keep it in my front room where the baby plays.
B00198PQHY Does the job well. Cute, entertaining... Great music options. Easy to use. Also easy to assemble. My daughter enjoysI bought this one n returned another that had a bunch of bells n whistles which did not work well
B00198PQHY I had a hard time choosing a mobile for my baby.  Personally I think this is really ugly, but it gets the job done.  I did like that it came with an adaptor for cribs with wide tops.  I ended up needing to use this part, and was very thankful that it came with one.  I also really like the different options in music choice.
B00198PQHY We just received this in the mail after ordering it three days ago! Our son is 13 weeks old and just made the transition from his bassinet in our room to a crib in his own room, I had bought the Winnie the Pooh Mobile to match his rooms \"theme\"... it was a waste of $20.00. It is a wind up and every 5 minutes I would have to run in his room and rewind it, in the process the music stopping would wake him up. It was a big mess. So we broke down and spent the $40.00 on the Tiny Love - Sweet Island Dreams Mobile... he loves it he will lay and stare at the little characters and seems to like the music and it had a remote with a handle, so after the 20 minutes is up u can grab the remote hanging from the door handle and turn it back on this is well made and thought up A+++++++ a must have!!!
B00198PQHY This thing right here has been a life saver! not only does it play for 20+ minutes, it has a remote so you don't have to disturb you lil one. simply put, this is a must have for any nursery!
B00198PQHY This is a great product. My infant loves it. Doesn't get monotonous. Sometimes after 45 min of continuous use the toy stops.
B00198PQHY This is one of the best one I have seen till now..the colors are great and it looks amazing in our crib... The new version comes with two attachment and I think it will fit any crib..I would defiantly recommend this one to everyone...Very cute!!!
B00198PQHY This is my single favorite baby item purchased for my daughter!!It's super cute, super functional and keeps her attention for 10 minutes at a time months after we got it!!  The little critters spin as they go around and it's really cute!!  I'm going to miss it when she starts sitting up by herself!! I can't tell you how many showers this thing has allowed me!!  So nice that it stays on for so long and I'm still on the original set of batteries!!  Highly recommend!!
B00198PQHY We love this mobile. The music is very soothing (classical) and the movement is also slow enough to capture the baby's interest but not be overly stimulating. The best feature, however, is the remote control. We kept it outside the nursery door and when she would wake up and we needed a few more minutes we could turn it on. Voila! A happy baby and we got to sleep another 30 minutes.
B00198PQHY This mobile worked well on my Ikea crib.  My son loved watching the animals and we learned the words for them.  The animals spin separately from the mobile so there is an added action to it.  The music was soothing and he learned to push the buttons himself.
B00198PQHY This product is SO cute. I was so excited to put it on the crib but even with the extra attachment, it won't fit on the rails. My husband is going to have to try to rig it with zip ties. Other than that it is adorable.
B00198PQHY I don't know what about this is so attractive, but this is one of the best things I ever bought for my baby. We have been using it since he was about 5 months old, and at 14 month he still gets amused by it. I also like the fact that the music is actually pretty correct representation of the actual pieces (Mozart, Debussy, Chopin and Bach). And Bach's partita No. 2, allemande? What a brilliant choice! Such a difference from all the nonsense arrangements or tired and trite choices.* Monkey light is not that useful (it's not facing the baby anyways!)
B00198PQHY this things motor make so much noise its louder than the music. i got a different tiny love one instead and it was definitely better! THIS THING WAS HORRIBLE!
B00198PQHY Este movil es seguro, practico y de muy buena calidad, los ni&ntilde;os se relajan con los diferentes tonos o melodias que tiene el movil.
B00198PQHY This has movement on multiple levels... the main branches rotate, but the animals themselves also rotate independently  when gravity catches them on the upper end of the tilt.  Our little one loved watching this between months 4-7. Very cute animals and the There are multipe sound settings.
B00198PQHY My daughter has loved this mobile since day one and continues to this day to listen to it every night and uses it to soothe herself.
B00198PQHY Best. Product. Ever.And the batteries last a long time to boot!
B00198PQHY One of my favorite aspects of being a mom to an infant is buying infant gear.  I especially like crib mobiles.  i love watching the babies watch the mobiles and I love the distraction the mobile provides so I can do really indulgent new mom things like 1) take a shower, 2) take the dogs out or 3) move the laundry from the washer to the dryer.  This is my favorite mobile at the moment. I have it attached to her changing table.  She likes watching it for a few extra minutes.  The music is nice and quiet, the size is smaller compared to the classic and geometric tiny love mobiles we also have.  I like the remote.  This is the only mobile we are using that has a remote right now.  The fact you can run this mobile with the mute button on is also nice.  That may come in handy sometime.  Anyway, there's no clicking sound when the beads fall like with the classic tiny love mobile.  She just wants to watch the giraffe and monkey twirl and fall.  She likes the little monkey's eyes on the part on the side that lights up.  It's cute and catches her attention (and not too many toys to yet (she's nearly 12 weeks), so I'm happy since she is entertained. Big brother (age 4) loves turning it on for his baby sister, too.
B00198PQHY I bought this for my doughter, who is ten weeks old. I am using this when I need to put her down for shorts periods of time.  She talks to the  animals.My baby loves staring at it. I can finally take a quick shower,or just do quick thing of my 
B00198PQHY I like the product, but it fits a little crooked on the crib we bought from JC Penney.  I guess you just have to try it out to make sure it fits the crib you purchased.
B00198PQHY The mobile is ultra-cute, very-well constructed and easily assembled and disassembled.  It takes less than a minute to assemble and just a few seconds to attach it to the crib.  It features not one but two motions - all the animals rotate around the clock and then they also rotate around themselves.  This secondary motion of rotating around their own axis is cleverly designed to be gravity based and is not motor driven.  As a result this secondary motion might produce clicks and is not ultra-smooth.The plastics are high-grade and are very-well made as well as the animal figurines (except for the bird's head which is not attached properly to look forward). Everything is very colorful and entertaining.There was also no initial plastic smell whatsoever that I could detect and that was very important for me and was a rather rare occurrence.Musical selections consist of classical music mixed in with nature sounds and delivered in a continuous stream with no interruptions.  I'm not sure why some people are complaining about the music as its quality is good (much better than my playard) and on-par with my baby Einstein toy.  The selection could be larger and also it seems the music does not alternate between all the available melodies unless manually selected.So what's not to like.  There are two problems: one minor and one major that other reviewers have mentioned.1) You cannot attach it easily to the playard; at least the one I have and judging by other reviews to any other.  It does not clip onto the side, it is screwed onto the railing and there must a void space large enough to let the large plastic screw go through the material.  After some monkeying around with my Graco playard I was able to attach the mobile near the corner of the wall where fabric can be pushed out of the way to make some space to insert the screw through.  I did have to use the additional white attachment accessory to secure it.2) The motor makes a lot of noise.  It is very loud obnoxious drone that frankly annoyed me within couple of minutes after I put in the batteries and turned it on.  The spinning is very slow and not very smooth and yet there is so much noise that it seems there is a lot of work being done when anything barely moves.  I'm suspecting that perhaps  the motor is weak and/or the gearing that facilitates the motion is not well-designed.You can barely hear the music coming through while the motor is working.
B00198PQHY This is a life saver musical. My son loves watching it and listening to the music. And although it is battery operated, which I am hesitant to buy because of how much use there will be with such an item, after 3 months we've changed the batteries once. It has a low drain and long life with one round of D cells.
B00198PQHY My husband assembled this upon receipt, but it only played music and didn't have any movement. I called the manufacturer directly as indicated on an insert accompanying the assembly instructions. I received a prompt return call and the customer service representative asked me to try a few fixes while she waited on the phone. None of her suggestions worked, so she said she would send me a replacement part for what she thought was the faulty piece. I received that part within a week, but still no movement! I called back and was told that they would try sending a different replacement part. This time it took two weeks for me to receive that part, but it worked. I was frustrated that it took three weeks to get a working mobile, given how quickly babies grow at this age. But, my two month old loved the mobile once we installed it on his crib. We've been using it for a few weeks now and he still seems very entertained. We are happy with the end result and were pleased with the response of customer service, I just wish the replacement parts had arrived a little sooner or it would have worked the first time.
B00198PQHY This was very cute!  The price was great too.  Comes with a remote and plays piano music as it rotates around.  I would buy again!
B00198PQHY I bought this because I was looking for a mobile that played for a longer period of time. The music is great and the animals are cute, but the motor is SO loud. Also, there is an annoying click when an animal spins around. I guess it's fine for the price, but there must be a less loud way to have some animals go around in a circle. It's not rocket science...
B00198PQHY We originally had a wind up traditional mobile. It was the only thing that would calm my daughter down when nothing else worked. Having to wind it every couple of minutes drove us nuts. This goes for about 20 minutes. The remote is handy. When she wakes in the morning I use the remote to turn it on which keeps her occupied while I use the restroom before going into get her out of her crib.Only downside is if we have a boy next there is quite a bit of pink on the animals. They could possibly be switched out but the rest of the mobile is essential (ie: couldn't use this motor and hang another mobile from it).The four tunes are quite similar but my daughter likes all of them.One of the best purchases we've made!
B00198PQHY We have loved this mobile. The music and spinning characters kept my baby's attention for the full running time of 7 minutes. They were graceful, soothing, and unusual compared to our other traditional mobile. Now that he is sitting we removed the mobile for safety, but he still has the music box attached to his crib. We use it every night to help him wind down. Sometimes he even presses it on himself. In 8 months we have only had to change the batteries once. I see us using this for quite awhile more.
B00198PQHY If you have anything fancier than a bare bones crib (such as one that converts to a toddler bed) it likely won't fit it as it only attaches to side rails that are less than about 2.5 inches.
B00198PQHY The colors are very vibrant and it has nice choice of music. Battery lasts for ever. We didn't play it every night but after a year it still works and no need to change the batteries yet.
B00198PQHY I purchased this as a gift from a baby registry. They research this item in advance, and they love it.
B00198PQHY If I had reviewed this when my son was 2 months old, I would have said it's the best thing I have ever purchased -- he would watch it easily for 20 - 30 minutes. However, at 3 months, he's completely not interested in it at all.Overall, however, I would say the following:1) Good quality2) Cute animals -- they do rotate as they go around such that they look like they're moving. My son used to watch one as it came into his point of view, would turn and then go away from him and then he'd start watching the next one -- great for tracking!3) I really like the music4) Night light is WAY TO DIM to be called a night light5) You can changed the volume and I find the lower volume to be best -- some people said the higher volume was too soft -- I did not find this to be the case6) You can attach this to any size crib with the included adapter -- someone said it didn't fit their crib -- my guess is that they didn't realize there was an adapter that came with it -- we even attached it to his Co-sleeper Mini before attaching it to his crib7) You can't play the music without the animals moving (unless you take off the arm with mobile)
B00198PQHY Granted, I have only had it for a week, but we have a VERY fussy baby and nothing has worked until now.  He can be screaming and we put him in the crib under this and he instantly stops, smiles, coos and watches it.  This gets us about 15-20 minutes of peace when he gets out of control.  (yes, we try the s's).  The moving arms are on an angle, so when it rotates, the individual animals actually rotate too once they cross the peak.  Baby loves it and that is all that matters.  It was VERY easy to assemble and install on a Pottery Barn crib.
B00198PQHY Really wanted to like this, but the motor is SO LOUD.  We tried everything we could to get it to stop making the awful grinding sound with no success. In addition, one day the mobile part fell off onto our daughter's head.  Clearly we will not be keeping this item.  It's too bad because the colors and the rotating animals are really cute.
B00198PQHY before our son was born we purchased a wind up mobile, the kind that matched the theme of his room.  after using that thing for about 5 minutes i was looking for one that ran on batteries!  i purchased this one and our son has used it everyday since he was about 2 months old and he is now almost a year.  when he was little he would lay in his crib and stare up at it, mesmerized!  the glowing monkey is perfect now for when he wakes up at night because it allows him to see us when we settle him back down.  the music is perfect too, not annoying at all like most baby items.  definitely one of our best purchases for our son!
B00198PQHY The music is nice and relaxing, even for adults! Also it's piano music, not adapted to child-like instruments, but the real piano, very nice and relaxing. Babies enjoy watching the mobile spin around. Well made and easy to install. Worth every penny.
B00198PQHY My baby actually likes this mobile more as he gets older. He is now close to 5 months. He smiles and kicks his legs at bed time when I turn it on. The animals are cute and occasionally \"turn\" (due to gravity and the angle they are hanging), so there is some visual interest for the baby. We haven't had any mechanical problems with it yet and we've had it for about a month. The music is nice, although it doesn't sound \"high quality\" (sounds SLIGHTLY mechanical or low quality but baby doesn't care of course. He loves piano type music). We attached it to a Graco \"Sarah\" crib and it screws on just fine without leaving bad marks. It has a \"lip\" on the edge of it to fit over a crib rail. I'm not sure if it would work for every crib... it comes with an alternate attachment piece, but we didn't need it. We also don't need the remote, because I don't leave it on very often or when he's asleep.. and it has a 20 minute timer anyway. You can use the mobile with or without the music, and also with or without the night light. The music also has two volume settings, but we always keep it on the lower setting because it is plenty loud.**UPDATE:  My son is now almost 9 months old and I still turn this on for him while he is in his crib. He still loves it, and we keep using it because he cannot sit up on his own or grab the mobile at all yet. The instructions say use up until baby is 5 months old or can push up on his hands & feet, .. thankfully my boy gets quite a bit more use out of this!
B00198PQHY I love the remote option.  It has nice options on music and it doesn't take up too much space over the crib.  My 4 year old loves it, too.
B00198PQHY Baby loves her mobile, but it was windup. So we went looking for something that would last longer. a 20 minute program, 4 tunes (2 of which are NOT in any of our other baby music producing items) and a remote control to zap it once more before bed is awesome. Colors are bright, the dangling animals rotate independently of the orbiting arm, and the tilt makes things interesting. Baby is happy and so are we.
B00198PQHY Our baby loves this mobile.  We change his diaper in the crib and turn on the mobile.  Even if he is crying, as soon as he hears the music or happens to open his eyes, his focus is on the mobile and then he starts smiling.  This is a great addition to the nursery and I am so glad we have it!
B00198PQHY We tried another mobile before this one, but this mobile is great! It is battery operated instead of wind-up so it stays on longer, but eventually stops after about 20 minutes. Even if it is &#34;on&#34; once the turning stops, it doesn't use up the battery. The music is great. My son loves it!
B00198PQHY Our son really loved to watch the animals spin around on this mobile when he was an infant. My only issue with the mobile is that the music was SO LOUD that we had to tape something over the speaker to muffle it a bit. Even on the lowest setting the music was crazy loud.
B00198PQHY I read lots of the reviews, and decided this was a good mobile for our daughter.  But I guess I missed the reviews were it talks about it not fitting on \"modern\" cribs with wide top rails.  The mobile doesn't mount from the top of the rail, it sits under the top rail and you use one of two attachments to get it to work.  We are using the bigger of the two, and it pushes the mobile farther out into the crib.  Also because it mounts lower, the mobile is in the way of you getting the baby in and out of the crib.  There really only are two options for music, bach or mozart and or bach with nature/ island or mozart with nature/ island mixed in. And the sound setting are loud and super loud.  Wish there was a softer setting, cause at 3am I don't want the whole house to be listening to music. When the mobile is going the little animals will spin too, making an annoying clicking sound and the motor is loud. And the little monkey does light up, but I cant say our daughter really cares for it.
B00198PQHY A month after using this contraption, the gears inside the motor unit assembly started making a loud winding sound. It became increasingly annoying so i had to take apart the unit and regrease the gears.  Keep in mind that this was only after a month of use!!!!!!
B00198PQHY Instead of the typical mobile where objects move in a circle, this mobile is better because each animal swings 360* while they all rotate in a circle. Lots of bright colors keep baby's attention. The music, even on its lowest setting, is louder than I would desire it to be. While baby loves to watch her mobile, it has never kept her awake. Baby can easily turn away as to not look at the mobile. I was worried about the mobile being too stimulating but this has never been a problem.
B00198PQHY this is a very pretty mobile with good music that my daughter seems to love, however, after a month it started making this whirring sound when ever a song is played. Sometimes it even stops singing and just spins and sometimes it makes a loud sound and stops. I read the reviews before I purchased this item and other people complain of the same issue but I though they just got a bad one that they weren't all like that but mine no longer works effectively. It seems to me that \"Tiny Love\" has quality control issues. DON'T BUY, INVEST IN A MOBILE THAT WILL ACTUALLY WORK!!!
B00198PQHY My two month old is enthralled with the movements, and let's face it I could watch that thing for just as long! We have a 4 in 1 convertible crib and we were able to secure it just fine on the side rails. We did have to exchange the first one because the sound base stopped working immediately, but the mobile is SO cute and such a great deal compared to the wind up mobiles that aren't as interactive. With amazon it was a breeze waiting for the new one to come and switching the base out for return.
B00198PQHY The pricing was good the it was quite cute.The only thing that was dissatisfactory was not including a starters battery in it.It requires a rectangular battery that usually people doesn't posses so I had to go out and buy it.
B00198PQHY My daughter loves this mobile! It keeps her attention and allows to me get some stuff done during the day. It's nice that there is a volume feature so that is neither blasting loud nor barley audible (a problem I have come across with other musical items). So far this has been one of the best things I have bought!
B00198PQHY This mobile was a gift. I wasn't sure how our baby would like it, because our two older kids were indifferent to their mobiles. Well, they never had a mobile like this one. Our baby loves it. She will stay in her crib long enough for me to get breakfast and sometimes even to shower! The animals spin at unpredictable times--I think that is why she likes watching it so much. The music doesn't grate on me as much as some baby toy music, and baby loves the part of the Mozart tune that has a trill. I hang the remote control on the nursery doorknob and when the music stops, I can start it up again without her seeing me and begging to be picked up . . . and she often enjoys a second 20 min. round of music. The biggest drawback is that she is so cute, wiggling and smiling at the animals, that I stay there watching her rather than taking full advantage of my hands-free time. :)
B00198PQHY This is a really nice mobile that plays relaxing music. My newborn is easily soothed and often falls asleep listening to the musiv. Their are four song choices, two volume settings plus a mute mode, and a remote control so you don't need to get up to turn the mobile on or off.
B00198PQHY I was at first upset that the mobile did not fit our Pali crib - however I was able to rig it (I tightened the screw enough that the mobile was clamped against two vertical slats. The mobile base is supposed to clamp on the vertical crib bar, but allows only a certain width, and our crib was wider). Baby ignored it during the first month, but then slowly started tracing the moving toys with his eyes and at 3 months coos and laughs every time I turn it on. He can be entertained by this for 20 minutes or more, which is the longest I have managed with any toy/activity. Absolutely wonderful! Note however, that it is stimulating  - I wouldn't use it if I wanted to put baby to sleep.Other positives:1. music is pleasant; listening to it several times a day for a couple of months, I am still not sick of it.2. can lower the volume and even eliminate the music (still keeps baby entertained and allows mommy to make a phone call).3. looks sturdy, and much nicer than other mobiles that spin on a horizontal plane (our baby ignores such a mobile on his swing).4. long battery time.5. can choose to operate without the night light or music.6. when choosing to operate without music you can't hear the motor noise.Negatives:1. may not fit all cribs and info about fit is not posted on the box or product description.2. the night light does not attract baby's attention.3. the remote is unnecessary.4. the toys soemtimes get caught in my hair when I bend over to change the baby (because they are all different sizes and rotate on an angle).
B00198PQHY I was a little put off initially by how gawdy this thing looks.But i was informed by other parents that babies dont care about stylish modern mobiles.. they want things that look like this!Our 7 week old daughter coos and smiles at this everytime we turn it on...the mobile turns as well as the colorful animals.Buys us a solid 15-30 mins to get food going or laundry finished.Music feature is great. Comes with a remote which we hang on the nursery door for quick restarts on the mobile without having to intrude. The main &#34;tree&#34; comes off easily for those times you dont want to stimulate your little one.Ive heard this only hangs on cribs with small/narrow bars, of which we have on our crib.Highly recommend.
B00198PQHY I received this mobile for shower gift. It rocks the first day when we are back from hospital. The music is great. It not only soothes my little one and I also find the music soothing for myself. When my daughter is 2 month old, she started laughing every time when the monkey is coming down and turn around over her head. She can watch and \"talk\" to the mobile for over half an hour. One of the best gifts I received, now I am ordering one for my friend's baby girl.
B00198PQHY This is one of the best purchase we have made by far. The first couple of weeks I was able to eat in peace because of this! My baby is 6 months now and he still enjoys it. He doesn't love it as much right now as he did before because he is occupied with other things ie. rolling around in his crib but when he was younger he loved it so much he would look at it for an hour and smile!
B00198PQHY I purchased this mobile, and must say that it is quite beautiful.  It plays classical music from the likes of Bach and Beethoven, which is supposed to be great developmentally for the baby.  I turn the mobile on and my baby knows that its time to go to sleep.  When the baby is awake, its nice that she has something to entertain her.  I would definitely recommend this product.
B00198PQHY My son loooooves this - he could stare at it for hours and smile at it:) Finally I could do stuff! Definitely worth the money!
B00198PQHY This is a very good mobile, although I think it is a little big. It had a good effect in making my baby calm and quiet in the beginning, but as my baby grew I stopped using it, because the boy would grab and pull the little animals of the mobile.
B00198PQHY My newborn is a go, go, go type of personality. She always has to be moving, if she's not moving, she's crying. So you can understand my amazement when I put her down in her crib with her new mobile and she's instantly entertained, I can put her down when she's upset and these little animals cheer her up instantly. On days where I desperately need 15 minutes for a shower, I can just put her in her crib and turn the mobile on. Most of the time I'll get a half an hour of happily entertained baby time. Seriously one of my best baby purchases to date.
B00198PQHY Edited on 7/11/11 to add: You know what's weird? The day after I wrote this review, the remote control on the unit stopped working. I thought maybe it was in need of a battery change. So I have changed the batteries a couple times and nothing works. The red light on the remote activates when the button is pressed, but it no longer turns the mobile on and off. I called customer service today and they said to email them the problem along with proof of original purchase and they'd send me a new one as long as it was within the 6 month warranty (I looked for warranty information on the package but couldn't find any information on that, but the representative I spoke to on the phone said it was 6 months from the date of purchase--I'm 5 months in on the 6 month warranty). I will update as the situation progresses.---I got this mobile a few weeks before my son was born (he's four months old now) and we've used it with the musical settings ever since. He loves it. Even when he was a couple weeks old, when I doubted he could see the mobile clearly, it captivated his interest. When he was about 3-5 weeks old, he started cooing at it and moving his arms and legs all over the place because he was so happy. Even today, he turns himself around all over the crib and watches it from a number of different positions and loves it still. Tiny Love says to stop using it around 5 months old, but I can't see it becoming a problem within a month, even if he does start pulling himself up because I placed it directly in the center of the crib and so it's up really high. Baby Bargains says to move a mobile from a crib to a changing station at around 5-6 months old, but we have a dresser as our changing table so it wouldn't be able to attach.Amazon also had the best price I could find. All the ones on ebay were being sold for around $17-$25, but then charged $15 on average for shipping. And those were for used ones. I just bought a new one for approximately the same price. However, if you can wait for this particular price to fall a couple bucks, I would. When I bought this one, it was only $34.65--in case you don't already know, prices fluctuate on Amazon (not just the independent sellers), and not always in the cheaper direction. I've been shopping at Amazon for 10 years and didn't realize this until May (ha!).
B00198PQHY My son is 2 months old and loves this product.  It doesn't really put him to sleep, but rather the opposite right now.  I gave it 4 stars, because the motor is really noisy, you can't even hear the music.  Easy to assemble.
B00198PQHY The only reason I didn't give it a 5 is because the motor was a little loud.  Not real loud, but I would have liked it to have been a little more quiet.  The monkey, giraffe, and bird are very cute and I like the way it spins around.  I don't use the remote but for some people it may come in hand.  The music is nice but mostly the songs all sound a lot the same.
B00198PQHY This mobile is annoying.It takes odd size batteries (3 C's and 2AAA).The music does not play clearly and is very annoying.As the animals go around in a circle they make clicking noises.You would be better off with an old ipod, a cd player, or a tape player for music.You can make a mobile part out of any paper around the house and sticks from the yard and it would be better then this piece of crap.
B00198PQHY After reading the glowing reviews for this mobile, we were really excited to put it on our baby's crib.  When we received it, we found out that the music box portion which needs to be mounted on the side railing of the crib, doesn't fit!  We don't have a fancy crib or anything, but like many of the other cribs we've seen in the store, ours has a thicker (er.. taller) top railing all the way around, but it is by no means elaborate or huge or anything like that.  The music box can't be mounted on any top railing that is taller than approximately 2.5 inches.  REALLY wish that Amazon's description had stated this information so people can know that it won't fit before they have to buy it and go to the trouble of returning it etc.... but to be fair to Amazon, I even went to Tiny Love's website and did not find the same info.  You basically have to buy it and see if it will fit your crib.
B00198PQHY This mobile is great- it plays a variety of tunes and has a really unique way it rotates all of the animals.  It runs for about 20 minutes and has a great little remote control so you can turn it back on if needed with out going into your baby's room.
B00198PQHY This is a great mobile. Unlike the traditional ones where everything just goes around in a circle, this mobile is slightly tilted while it rotates. Because of the tilt, the little units on the mobile has an additional movement to it (from gravity due to the tilt).My baby loves it. It can entertain him up to 45 minutes at a time. Hopefully maybe even longer in the future. My baby loves to coo and talk to the animals on the mobile, even if it's not turned on.The only thing I don't like is the auto shutoff at 15 minutes. The remote that comes with it is too limited in what it can do. I wished the remote would also let us select the volume and song choice, instead of just turning unit on/off.
B00198PQHY I bought this mobile when my daughter was about 5 weeks old, which was about 3 weeks ago. I turn it on a couple of times per day, when she is already calm, and she almost always appears very interested in both the circling animals and the music. She can lie there with attentive eyes for quite a while (30-45 minutes) which is a LOT longer than she'll look at anything else. I sometimes narrate the goings on, and sometimes just leave her to her own devices, and both ways are effective. Almost as important, I like the music and the twirling animals (the twirls are ingenious, by the way), which is quite different from my reaction to some of the more insipid music in other gizmos that is touted as children's music but which is actually just bad music.  5 Stars--highly recommended.
B00198PQHY This mobile works well and my baby enjoys it but I'm not a fan of the colors. I wish it wasn't so bright and big. It screams playroom. I like the remote option and it's nice that it comes with an attachment for wider/ larger cribs like sleigh styles. There is also a small light that is cute and I originally thought it served no purpose but my babies eyes are drawn to it which is great. Recently he was in the hospital for croup and we took this mobile to the hospital with us so he would have something familiar. It worked like a charm, it soothed and calmed him the entire time we were there, in fact we had to keep it on or he got upset. Overall I would definitely recommend and buy again!
B00198PQHY This is absolutely perfect for our 8 week old when she started really looking intently at objects and things. I wish we gotten it sooner for when she was 4-5 wks old when her eyes started focusing on the ceiling fan above her bed. She loves the music during \"play time\" and the setting on silent for when she is falling asleep is perfect. When she is alert she coos ever time the animals turn and its so adorable. It fits on our convertible crib great! A wonderful purchase and highly recommend it!
B00198PQHY This definitely catches the attention of my infant, but fails to keep it. The hanging animals spin themselves as the mobile turns, which causes a clicking noise which is kind of annoying. I think if there were some lights on the animals it may be a bit more eye catching, especially at night. But all in all, it seems to do its job.
B00198PQHY I tried a couple different mobiles and absolutely love this one.  The materials seem way nicer than the other mobiles that I tried.  The music isn't really great or soothing but I was using it more for the animals.  What is great about this is that as the mobile spins, it is at a slight angle which makes it so the animals also spin as they reach the top.  Not sure it the description makes sense but it makes it much more entertaining for a baby to sit and watch than some of the other mobiles.  I just with they would have a few white noise options and a couple lullabys or something 
B00198PQHY Love it...It's very cute and it entertains my little girl long enough to put make up on!!  She's only 2mo old right now, so she'll only be entertained by it for about 20 minutes...but it keeps her attention!!  The only downfall is it's pretty big so sometime i boink my head on it getting her in and out of her crib, but it's a small price to pay.
B00198PQHY Cute colors, like the music, love how the little figures move (which keeps my LO entertained), but after about 2 months of occasional use, it no longer turns. It still plays music, but I can't get it to turn. I changed out the batteries, thinking it was just low batteries, but no go. :-(UPDATE: I contacted the company, and they sent me some new parts, so the unit works again, but one of the parts was super hard to attach to the other, and the whole unit makes kind of a whining noise now. It works, but has an odd noise that goes along with it.
B00198PQHY This mobile functions well.  It does what it advertises.  There is a noticeable motor sound when the mobile is turned on.  But nothing too egregious.  Our son is a notoriously bad sleeper, so we have tried a number of things to help him sleep.  I would love to say that this helped in any way, but that is sadly not the case.  He does watch the mobile for a few minutes, but was never too interested in it.  The music is nice and we love that it plays classical pieces.  Kinda wish the musical excerpts were a little longer. I like that the mobile part comes off super easy (for a parent, can't imagine a child would be able to get it off).  Without the mobile, we just use it as a music box.  There are two volume settings, wish it would be more of an adjustable volume, but am probably asking too much from a more inexpensive mobile.  Overall, its a nice product, not too blown away, and my son has little interest in it.  But it looks nice on the crib.
B00198PQHY My first reaction was that it was over priced and the animals didn't spin like I thought they would but my boys ended up loving it.
B00198PQHY It's very colorful and the music options are okay.  Not great quality sound/music.  The remote works great and the design feature to attach to your crib is one that will fit any crib.  when the mobile is in motion, it makes a weird jerking moving each time it turns.I would suggest choosing a different mobile.
B00198PQHY We bought this for our son when he was 3 months old, and I swear,the animals instantly became his best friends. He LOVES this thing. He's 6 months now, and still loves it. I turn it on in the mornings while I get ready, and he babbles away to them, and shrieks in delight when the monkey spins. He's learned to press the buttons himself now, and he always stares at the nightlight as he falls asleep. I might cry when he outgrows the mobile part, but I'm so thankful I can continue to use the nightlight and music since he's so used to it as a cue for bedtime.Pros:*Very engaging for the baby with the movement*Great product for the price*Has 4 music settings that you can choose from*Longer life than most mobiles since you can detach the mobile arm*Easy installation*FANTASTIC battery life. I haven't replaced them in 3 months, and they are being used a lot. Compared to the baby einstein aquarium, which we barely use, and needs the batteries changed every 2 weeks or so.*Sturdy - I don't worry about anything breaking loose and falling into the crib like I did looking at some other mobiles.Cons:*Our remote didn't work, but I didn't really care about it anyway.* You have to be careful not to bump yours or babies head when you're getting them in and out if this is on, since it moves at an angle.This is seriously one of the best purchases we made, and I only wish we'd bought it sooner!
B00198PQHY Our child loves this mobile. He won't sleep without it. We tried other items and the sounds were not as soothing for him. It has four songs, which it rotates through, about 20 minutes of music and comes with a remote control.  Product works well.
B00198PQHY The toys on this mobile are great! I love how they spin at certain points on their rotation. Our son is pretty fussy but is mesmerized by this for 5-10 minutes at a time.
B00198PQHY The mobile is beautiful and super cute, but the motor is very loud. This motor problem seems very common. The animals make a lot of noise as they spin too; however, my son loves when the animals spins. These extra noises aren't that big of deal when the music is on and may be comforting when the music is off but may also cause problems.One of my greatest dislikes on this product is that there is a built in 20 minute timer. This could be really nice if it was an option, but there is no other time option. There are times that I would like to let the mobile keep running because the baby is still entertained. I really wish there was like a 10, 20, 30, 60 minute timer settings. It does come with a remote that from close by you can turn the mobile on. My remote did not work (they company did send me a whole replacement mobile without issue) and I am not sure of the distance.
B00198PQHY We got this mobile before my daughter was born and she has enjoyed it at various stages since she came home. The movement pattern of the creatures is simple and quick and they are bright and engaging -- not way too busy. The mobile seems to stimulate her without over stimulating her. She is a little bored by it at her more active times, but in the morning and at night she will stare and talk to it with glee. The remote makes it really convenient and it attached to our wide crib. The music quality is high and it sounds like actual instruments, not some cheesy music box like so many baby products.  I do agree with other reviewers that the music snippets loop too quickly and do get repetitive, but that bothers me and not her so, oh well.
B00198PQHY this is a great mobile. baby still enjoys looking at how each animals turns on its own as the whole thing turns.
B00198PQHY This mobile is fantastic. My 3-month old daughter loves it. It is captivating and entertaining. He is happy to kick his legs and gurgle in delight watching it as I sneak in some house work. The music is lovely, with four different tunes and a baby-friendly volume. Easy to assemble and install. I recommend this to everyone. By the way, purchase through Amazon was quick and easy and best price was offered too.
B00198PQHY This is our second Tiny Love mobile. I think the new design is more durable. I love that this mobile has nature sounds and classical music together. My baby loves the moving animals. Another great feature is the ability to have the mobile moving without the sound--terrific for when big brother is already asleep.
B00198PQHY No issues. been using for several months and baby loves it. the music is not annoying for adults.
B00198PQHY is ok, but is making a no funny noise when the toys make the rotation, if is a sensitive baby will stay awake, the music: only 4 and each one is not longer than one minute or less and repeated one and another time, no funny. The toys are nice and funny, the color are bride and call the baby attenti
B00198PQHY our baby absolutely loves this musical mobile... we use it every day and he really enjoys the tunes, the colors and the cute animals twirling on it... we are very glad we got this.
B00198PQHY Can't comment on the quality of the product because I didn't get to the point of assembling it. On the lower right side of the product description page it says \"Birth to 5 months+\", but on the arm of the mobile it specifically says \"WARNING From birth to 5 months\".  I was hoping to get more than 5 months use out of this. This is going back to Amazon.
B00198PQHY I purchased this mobile rather than the Nojo Jungle Tales mobile that matched the bedding set I ordered. It seemed more entertaining and engaging than most other mobiles. The colors are vibrant and the music is nice as well. My son enjoys lying in his crib and watching the animals move. It is a great way to keep him occupied for 10-20 minutes while I am in the shower or doing laundry.
B00198PQHY I think my husband would agree that this is the best toy we have purchased for our daughter so far.  She was 1 1/2 months when we purchased it and she is now 5-months.  She LOVES watching the animals go around and stare down at her, and when they spin it is like an added bonus.  When she was 3-months old she started screaming with joy at the animals and loves to smile back at them.  She can spend long periods of time in her crib just enjoying the mobile, it is how I get a shower every day!  Honestly, I think this toy helped her to like being in her crib.We just recently had to change the battery, and we use the mobile at lot.  I love that you can easily remove and replace the mobile part without having to take off the base.  The music is pleasant too.I am sad that we will have to take the toy down soon since it is only for use through 5-months.  I will probably keep it up as long as she is awake and I am around since she is starting to try to touch the animals, she just loves it so much!
B00198PQHY It keeps the baby entertained, for a while. More music variety could have been offferred, though. Also, it would have been nice if the individual animals, the danglers, moved as well. The whole round thing does move but  I think if each individual unit moved too, that would have been added to the fun. Overall, a good item.
B00198PQHY She watches it in awe. She still doesn't know what to think of it and its amusing watching her watch the animals go around. Why I love this mobile because it is very colorful and the animals spin as well as the mobile that spins.
B00198PQHY I like the look and movement of this mobile. The animals are cute and don't just spin in a single circle, but they also rotate on their own individual circle (think rotating planets also rotating around the sun). I'm not a big fan of the music, though there are two volumes which is nice. I wish it had just a &#34;nature&#34; or &#34;white noise&#34; setting with no music.It is easy to install, and it's also super easy to take the mobile part on/off if you just want the music and nightlight left in the crib.
B00198PQHY I fell in love with this mobile because of the colors and theme. I purchased it because I saw a picture of it on amazon.com posted by a customer of it being used  on a playard. Also the first review I read specifically wrote that the baby now sleeps in the co sleeper because of this mobile. So I thought it would work on my co sleeper. And it doesn't. I might end up returning it unless I figure out a way to safely use it somehow.This would be such a shame since I think its absolutely adorable and would hate to have to return it.
B00198PQHY My baby loves this mobile!  It is the most attractive mobile out there.  He kicks and squeals with delight every time.  We have theTiny Love Take Along Mobile, Animal Friendsas well but it doesn't get the reaction that this does.  Ended up returning that one. This one is a keeper.  Love the remote control!  Don't notice any clicking sound. We also have a mobile on our Fisher Price SnugABunny swing which is the worst!  It is so ugly and boring, I feel so bad that he has to look at it sometimes.  Thank goodness for this mobile!
B00198PQHY My baby absolutely loves the music and the colorful hanging characters. For a newborn, this is just the right amount and kind of stimulation. My baby is now 4 months old and she still really enjoys it and falls asleep with this music every night.I was initially skeptical about the remote but surprisingly it has come to really good use. When I am feeding my baby before her bedtime, I turn this on towards the end while still sitting in my feeding rocker. This creates the bedtime environment at the right time. I wish I could do more with the remote then just turn the mobile on and off (maybe change tunes and definitely adjust the volume!). Although the packaging recommends this mobile for upto around 5 months, I think I will continue to use the tunes player (even if without the hanging characters) for much longer given how much my baby likes the music.
B00198PQHY She lays in her crib and watches this thing for longer than she will do anything else.  She loves the pink monkey and smiles and squeals at it.  Best buy ever for this fussy baby!
B00198PQHY This came in the mail yesterday, had it put together in less than 5 mins.  It comes with an adapter to make it fit larger cribs, thank goodness.  My son slept thru the night, in his crib for the first time!  Well worth every penny.
B00198PQHY I rely heavily on user reviews for my purchases.  I purchased this mobile with hesitation as I was concerned it wouldn't fit my crib.  I do have a modern crib (Franklin & Ben Mason crib).  The first thing I noticed when I received the product was an adapter for the mobile could be mounted between vertical rails rather than sitting atop the crib.  Boy was I pleased!!!In addition the mobile was everything I hope it would be.  The characters are super cute and the music is pleasant.  The lower volume setting is still fairly loud but I just tape some gauze over it when I want it quieter.  Frankly I use this when my little one first wakes up, not to put him to sleep.  So the volume is not a concern for me.  I also like that each individual character rotates based on gravity rather than a mechanical system - less parts to break!  The installation was super easy.  I didn't even read the directions.My little one is now six months old.  I do wish I had purchased this earlier to get more use out of it but he thoroughly enjoys it now.  I found this to be a very valuable purchase and highly recommend it.
B00198PQHY My 2 month old son LOVES this mobile! I was hesitant to purchase it since I really didn't want to risk wasting money on yet another baby product but I was very pleasantly surprised with this mobile. First of all the mobile is really great quality, very colorful, adorable and just generally well made. The music is very soothing for both baby & parent plus it has nature sounds which also has some soothing music playing behind it. The animals rotate individually at random times as the mobile moves which really helps to keep my son interested. Another great feature is the remote control. The music lasts for 20 minutes and usually by the time it turns off he is asleep but if not we can restart the music from the doorway without going into his room and disturbing him.Overall this product is a must! I originally purchased a $50 wind up mobile but aside from keeping him interested for a few minutes it really did nothing for us. It would play for a few minutes and stop, he would scream and we would have to go and wind it back up again thus disturbing him and starting the whole process all over again...this mobile avoids all those issues and helps baby learn to self soothe!As a first time mom I HIGHLY recommend this mobile!!
B00198PQHY Makes noise, spins around, and lights up, everything a little infant would seem to enjoy, I'll keep you posted on any issues that may arise.
B00198PQHY This is a really nice little mobile and attaches/moves easily but is still sturdy. For our little one in particular the issue was she always wanted to get to the little animals... until it got to the point where she was tall enough to rip them off. Even 10 months after animal removal these little guys are still some of her favorites (especially the giraffe which we have to wash often as the feet seem to be the ultimate teethers for front, canines and molars). It has nice melodies and a very soft light if you choose that option. Battery life is middle of the road.
B00198PQHY This mobile plays music for a very long time.  We have used it every night for the last year and have only had to replace the batteries twice (six month intervals).  The remote is VERY handy.  Must buy.
B00198PQHY We purchased this battery operated mobile to replace a windup one. Our baby enjoyed staring at it for a good 20 minutes while awake. He didn't even mind when I walked away. (Granted, it's brand new... and he noticed it was 'different'). You have a variety of melodies to choose from. It turns off after a reasonable amount of time on its own. I like the remote (we keep it on the door nob so we can turn it off on our way out of the room). I wish there were a nature sounds without music in the background... But I feel like this mobile was made with the baby and the parents in mind when providing a variety of classical tunes.
B00198PQHY My twin girls love this mobile. I like that the music and the motion of the mobile are independent and that the music has two volume settings. The mobile turns at an angle so as it turns, the animals turn individually and their dangling swaying feet seem to be endlessly fascinating to the babies.I'll lay them together in a crib and they'll watch it mesmerized for a long time. The music/mobile plays for 30 min at a time and I know when a half hour has gone by because they'll start crying when the mobile stops.
B00198PQHY I love all Tiny Love products. If this had fit my crib, I'm sure I would have enjoyed it. But this does not come with an adapter piece to help attach it to sleigh cribs. Additionally, the picture shows little plastic accessories on the neck and arm of some animals, these are not included on the actual mobile. For these reasons I returned the item with ease. In turn, I purchased the Tiny Love Classic Mobile which fits a sleigh crib nicely.
B00198PQHY I have 6 daughters and 15 grandchildren and am still buying baby items since I often babysit and still have two cribs in my house.  This is a really nice \"baby soother\" since it has various music choices and a very nice rythmic movement.  The music lasts for quite a while before stopping and has a remote control as well in case you want to restart it from a distance.  In addition, I like that the hanging mobile portion of it can be removed and still leave the light/music attached to the crib --- which may come in handy very soon as my one grandson is 16 months old and will probably begin pulling them apart if I leave it on when he is using the crib.  Overall, I am quite satisfied with this product.
B00198PQHY This is a very cute mobile and very different from the cheaply made ones I kept finding. Mine is slightly different from the one in the picture having more orange then green but its still very cute.
B00198PQHY My baby outgrow it when he reaches 3 and half months old. Before that, he really enjoyed it. The music is really soft and soothing. He would always stare it to sleep.
B00198PQHY This is an attractive mobile that certainly holds the attention of my baby, It offers four pleasant songs and a motion that fascinates my baby while lulling him to sleep as well. We purchased the mobile when the baby was three months old, and at six months, he still enjoys it. I expect that he will use it for many months to come. The remote is a great feature, along with the volume option and the light option. My only complaint is the small clicking noise that you hear occasionally since not only the mobile moves as a whole, but the individual animals turn as well. It is not loud and does not happen often, but it is a little annoying (probably just to me; I doubt that the baby notices).
B00198PQHY We wernt going to get a mobile at first but then my eye doctor told us it was very important visually to have one to learn to track things. We went through 3 mobiles before we found this one. the first 2 were the simple mobiles that match the bedding sets both of these would only play music for like 2 minutes and the music was not relaxing. after looking for a mobile that would last a little longer with music a little more soothing we found this one and we LOVE it. the classical music plays for about 20 min usually my son is asleep before the music stops. it also comes with a remote so you can turn it on with out going into the baby's room. There is also a long battery life we have had it now over 4 months and havent needed to change the battery yet.
B00198PQHY And we managed to get it to attach to the Graco Pack 'n Play as well!  We typically turn the mobile on, but without the music going.  We find a nature, classical CD or other 'new agey' music is much better suited than the music on this mobile, but at least there is a variety on it!Our son didn't even get into the mobile until roughly the 6 week mark.  By week 8 he was REALLY into the mobile and loves to watch it go around.  Usually he'll wave his arms, kick his feet and snort snort snort! while watching it go around.  Eventually he falls asleep after 20 minutes of excitement from this mobile.We are very please with the mobile.  We lost the remote to the mobile, so we have to turn it on manually each time, which isn't a big deal if your crib or co-sleeper is next to the bed. The light on the mobile is dim enough so that he can see the  animals going around when we turn off the lights.
B00198PQHY I got this for my extremely fussy colic like baby. My son will stare at this mobile for 10 to 15 minutes which is worth the cost to me.  3 star because I wish it had more toys on it, that we had an option for how fast it spins and would of been awesome if it had flashing lights. Would recommend to others who just want a few minutes to themselves.
B00198PQHY My son loves this mobile, ever since he was about one month old he kept watching the little figures and when he turned two months he even laughed when the little animals turn individually. Right now he's five months old and still loves it.
B00198PQHY Most of the purchases we have made for our baby have been disappointing, to say the least.  This mobile, however, is FANTASTIC!  The baby gets so excited to be in his crib, and kicks his legs so much that he winds up at the other end.  The animals have an extra little spin to them, the item is fun, it's brightly colored, the music is not annoying (although, when it's on low, you can hear the motor), etc.  I don't understand the point of the remote since you have to be in the room with the child to use it, but other than that, my kid can happily play for over an hour at a time watching this thing spin around.
B00198PQHY I put this together and it is very cute. The colors go with my baby girls room very well (pinks and greens), but it would also work well with a boys room (blues, greens and oranges). I was very unhappy when I put it all together and the music did not play. I was bummed and tried to call Tiny Love and the number that I tried first didn't work (of course this got me more upset). Then I went online to their website and tried to fill out a replacement part form and it said to call if it was a baby mobile. Finally I found another number on the box that worked and I called them and the lady told me to forward my amazon.com confirmation email to them and that she would send me the replacement part in 7-10 business days. I am excited to get the replacement part and HEAR the music that comes out of the very cute mobile. Hope it works or I will be very disappointed. I will review this product again if there is another problem, but I am hopping to LOVE this product and give it a 4 or 5 in the future.
B00198PQHY You need to be creative to get this to stick on the co sleeper....but he loves it. It does not get him sleepy...but it does keep him company when he wakes up:)
B00198PQHY I bought Tiny Love's Sweet Island Dreams mobile when the mobile that came with our crib bedding broke 2 weeks after our baby arrived. I can honestly say that was the best investment in any baby item we have made yet. This mobile has very soothing music and our baby just loves that the animals rotate. It really keeps his attention. We use this mobile all the time. It calms our son when he's crying and nothing else seems to work, I can actually take a shower (gasp!) without him crying, and at 4 months our son will put himself to sleep for naps and at bedtime if we just turn the mobile on and keep the lights low. He'll even stare at it when it's not even moving. The ONLY negative thing I have to say about the mobile is that the remote has very poor range. We have to be standing in the room in order for it to work, which makes it pretty useless. That being said, I still give this a very strong 5 star rating. I'd recommend anyone to skip the expensive and poor quality mobiles that match their nursery bedding and get this. You won't regret it!
B00198PQHY My daughter loves this mobile, however even on the high volume setting you hear more of the motor running and the plastic crackling sounds of the plastic pieces as the animals move in circles, NOT a good thing.  I was disappointed with this, but it keeps my daughter interested.  I do love the remote option, just wish there was more lively music for when she's awake rather than Mozart and Bach (boring), this is good to soothe her to sleep, but not bubbly for her play time...also it would've been good if the item had a light on the animals to brighten up the crib for her to see the animals.
B00198PQHY This is an excellent mobile!- It is colorful and has nice motion, but not too much.- It has a remote control, which means you can turn it off or on without getting out of bed, and without needing to wind it up repeatedly.- It has four melodies, all of them nice and not annoying for the grownups.- The animals are set so that they seem to look straight at the baby when they're at the lowest point, which delights her.- It's set at an angle so it doesn't make getting her out of the crib too difficult.- My baby loves it! She coos and talks to the animals, and can stay entertained by it for a long time (until she gets annoyed that they don't answer her, I think).
B00198PQHY This product has been designed well except for the motor which is noisy and annoying especially if you are using the mobile in mute. I like the characters, the colors, the way they move and the music. Well for some reason, it never did anything for my little one.  She just plainly ignores it hence the rating of 4 stars.
B00198PQHY This product arrived on time and was easy to assemble. I recommend having C batteries on hand as soon as the package arrives because you will want to try this mobile out! Good quality and the animals are cute and colorful.
B00198PQHY My son absolutely loved this!!!  He would sit in his crib and watch it until it turned itself off.  I did have to make a modification because I thought it was weird that the animals were looking out instead of down at him.  When they get big enough to reach it, you just pull out the mobile and leave the music box.  The motor was very quiet and continued to work for as long as we used it (about 6 months).  The remote is perfect for just peeking in the door and turning it on or off without disturbing your baby.
B00198PQHY Love this mobile! When we first did our nursery, we purchased a really cute, beautiful mobile from a well-known furniture kids' store. The mobile matched the crib bedding, curtains, etc and looked great. The only problem is that baby hated it. It only played music for 3 whopping minutes, wasn't bright or colorful, etc. I didn't really realize it (and just assumed my baby wasn't into mobiles) until we went to my parents' house for a visit. My mom had this mobile for the crib there, and my baby loved it! She actually watched it until she fell asleep - which she never did with my &#34;yuppy&#34; mobile.  The day we returned home, I ordered this and threw the other one in the closet and haven't regretted it. I just regret wasting money on that first mobile that I was buying more for me and what I wanted. Granted, this one doesn't match the nursery at all, but who cares if it helps put my baby to sleep...and I get sleep!The animals are colorful, bright and fun, and I love how they each rotate too as the whole thing rotates.The music selections are nice and volume is perfect.  My baby watches it every night as she falls asleep and if she is overtired during the day and needs to &#34;chill&#34; out in her crib. I swear sometimes she is babbling to the animals too.  Some mornings, she has even managed to kick it on herself (not sure if that is coincidence or she really is aware of what she is doing). I'll be sad in another month when we likely will need to remove the mobile portion and just leave the music box base on the crib.  FYI -This fit on our sleigh crib with no issue (an attachment is provided for thicker crib rails).
B00198PQHY I was a little skeptical about this at first, but after using it for the past 7 months, I can't imagine not having it. First of all the music quality of the speaker is very nice - not tinny or fake sounding. Because the arms rotate on an asymetrical axis, the animals each take a turn spinning around as the arms rotate! It's genius. My baby learned to anticipate which animal is going to turn around next and watches for it. As a newborn, she loved watching this from below. Now that she is 11 months, she loves pushing the button on the remote control herself to turn the mobile on and off. There are 2 volume settings and 4 different classical songs, and you can set it to play one of them over and over again, or play each song after the other. Only negative is our ostrich's head is mounted so that he is always looking behind himself.
B00198PQHY The baby loves it and the music does put her to sleep!  The movable characters are an added bonus, but the music is meh...not that great, could use a better line up and not so short and repetitive.  Only 4 choices and nothing I would really want myself.  I can say I would not buy it again only based on that, but otherwise the baby does like it.
B00198PQHY Parents and baby like it a lot. The music is nice and helps baby to sleep. Mom loves the remote control. It is also nice to easily undo the music box and take it to a different room if needed. The mobile is a bit noisy, but since our son is now 6 months old we no longer use it.Update, april 2012 : the remote control is no longer working (yes, I changed the batteries, lol). It is very disappointing, since it was so practical :(Update, december 2012 : 2 years old and still loves the music. He plays it every night before falling asleep and every morning when he wakes up.
B00198PQHY I could tell you about the product but let me go to straight to what matters... My babies love it so much, they quiet right down when it's on.  The  movement holds their interest every time.  Ahhh, yes!  Nothing like crying babies to make you fully appreciate the value of peace and quiet!
B00198PQHY this is awesome ! my sweet baby loves it,she sleeps like a dream to the music.and when awake she talks and talks to it. i would do it again
B00198PQHY i would have given this 5 stars if the motor was not so darn loud, making a constant humming sound. however that sound can have a calming &#34;white noise&#34; effect too, so its not so bad.  my daughter is now two months old and is very amused by this mobile, she loves to watch the animals spin and move and even giggles- adorable!  so the mobile lets me take care of some chores knowing that baby girl is amused and happy
B00198PQHY We really loved the design, but we tried every method to install it. There are axis parts that are supposed to be clipped together. It just won't push in. We used tools and still wouldn't work.
B00198PQHY We have a co-sleeper in our bedroom, so we can't use this to help our son fall asleep there.  But after discovering he was very entrained by it during the day, we tried it last night in his future crib in his nursery and he was entertained for over an hour before falling asleep.  Then I was able to move him asleep into our co-sleeper.  Not a horrible solution, but it would be nice if they had other versions of this that could fit on the Arms Reach co-sleepers.  We will keep using it and would buy again in a heat beat, because he loves it!
B00198PQHY my baby loves it. she would look at the mobile and smile for a long time.i purchased this because i thought baby would fall asleep while listen the music. it didn't function well in this aspect. my baby actually gets more excited. however it is still a life saver because she likes it.
B00198PQHY My daughter loves this mobile.  I bought it sight unseen based on the amazon reviews and we have been so happy that we chose this one.  We've used it for the last 4 months and haven't yet had to change the batteries.  We were able to easily install it on our crib (DaVinci Kalani Convertible) and it cannot be removed by baby.  The stuff animals each rotate and that keeps my daughter amused for a long time.  She loves watching them. The music gets repetitive but at 9 months old she still loves it and it puts her right to sleep when we put it on.  Also this mobile was priced lower than most I had searched for online and was a great deal.  My friend concidentally bought the same one and she raves about hers also.
B00198PQHY Each night my grandson, who isn't quite ready to sleep in a full size crib yet, has bedtime play time in his crib.  He will lay and watch this mobile and listen to the music before bath time and after bath time.  Keeps him very ocuppied and entertained as when the mobil spins, the figurines do a little flip around and that catches his eye for sure. The music is okay and love the remote aspect as well.
B00198PQHY Tiny Love Sweet Island Dreams MobileOriginally I was looking for a mobile with softer colors to coordinate with my daughter's nursery. After searching for one that would coordinate nicely and included all of the features in this model, I couldn't find one at a reasonable price (under $80). This mobile offers great value while at the same time being an excellent product.  The installation was a breeze and it fit the crib which has sloping side rails (vs. straight rails). The characters are colorful and cute and the classical music selections are great. My only MINOR complaint is that the \"low\" volume option is still a bit too loud for bed/naptime, however you do have the option to turn the mobile on without music. My 2 month-old loves staring at this mobile and it encourages her to turn her head to follow the animals as they rotate. Great product!
B00198XSS8 Update May 8th 2013:Just got back from a drenching downpour (it's rainy this time of the year in Australia) and the bag kept everything dry!I've had at least 5 diaper bags in the span of 2 years- Storksak,Okiedog,Carter's,and a Coach diaper bag; I use a non diaper bag backpack which is good for when we leave the stroller at home and my 2 year old prefers to walk.This beats all of them (even the designer Coach bag) by a mile! The bag itself is cute (I got the Shadow Waltz version),I love the dark fuschia pink trims everywhere.The organization of this one (with all of it's compartments, a mommy pocket,even a gadget pocket-roomy enough to hold a Kindle Fire HD) is the best part of the bag.No more scrambling for the wipes case-it stays latched on to garterized compartment.My Coach diaper bag is heavy even empty, which is not a good thing especially used on a Maclaren stroller-it causes the stroller to fall on its back all the time.I saved the stroller straps from my Storksak,clipped it on the bag and it's perfect!This bag seems like a mom designed as it really does covers all the basics-plus some.It's not bulky as well, and it looks like a normal backpack.I'm glad I got it because we travel abroad all the time and I'm hoping it will hold well.I'm thankful that the bag is machine washable (something I can't do with the Coach bag).The front pocket is slim,long and deep enough to hold passports and boarding passes-a winner in my book-and easy enough to open and close with a magnetic snap!This came with a matching changing pad that's very soft (maybe that's the memory foam all about) and almost 20% longer than my other diaper bag's changing pad.
B00198XSS8 My first ju ju be bag was the BFF and I LOVED that bag.  However as my kids got older (now 2 and 3) I wasn't always taking a stroller with me and even though the BFF can be worn as a back pack its not comfortable for ALL day outings so I purchased the back pack style diaper bag and ju ju be does not disappoint!  I wore it on an all day trip to NYC and barely even realized it was on my back.  Easy to access all pockets and I love the pocket at the very top where the handle is (great place to stow wipes for quick access for clean ups!)
B00198XSS8 I originally purchased the Okkatots back pack. I like the Okkatots but over time, it started to smell from the various food items I would bring for my baby...(ie suction tray, Jujube fuel cell). The backpack is only spot clean. So I ended up ordering the JJB BRB. I really love the padded straps, the Mommy pocket, the one pocket for a cell phone barely fits my I5 so I usually lay it sideways, the back zippered compartment where the changing pad is is great. I now place my baby's suction tray there. No lingering smells! Yea! I like the top pocket where I usually put 2 size 5 diapers and some disposable bibs. Organization is great. Only small negative is with the Okkatots I was able to stuff more things in vs the JJB. I ordered this item late Wednesday night and received it Sat before 2. Amazon prime n FedEx rocks!
B00198XSS8 Let me start by saying I LOVE my old diaper bag (by Oioi.)  However, it is a messanger bag style and now that I have a 2.5 yr old and a newborn on the way, I was hoping to find something with a little more room (if possible) and I really felt the need to have a diaper bag that would leave my hands free (although I didn't want a backpack so big I'd look like a Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle walking around.)  I am pleasantly surprised with this bag!  I bought it after seeing how much it fit on the Youtube video posted by Little Dudes and Divas.  When I received it, it looked kind of small, so i was skeptical, and I was concerned with some of the other reviews that complained about lack of pockets and losing items in the one large compartment.  But I found the number of pockets is just right.  I can fit everything that was in my old bag, plus I still have plenty of room to spare.  The way the pockets are configured are different than what I was used to with the messenger style bag.  It took me about a week to get used to the verticle set up, but once I \"re-learned\" where everything was, this sucker ROCKS.  It's like I barely have to go into the main compartment.  I love that I can fit my portable potty seat in the back outside pocket where the changing pad also fits.  The package of wipes fit lovely in the front outside pocket along with a travel pack of Wet Ones, and Clorox wipes.  There's a pocket at the top where I fit 2 disposible changing pads, 2 pull-ups and 2 diapers, along with room to spare.  There's a front top pocket where I keep small bags of snacks (fruit snacks, M&Ms; for potty rewards, rice bars, Annie's cheddar bunnies etc.)  I don't really use the \"Mommy Pocket\" for my things as much as additional rewards for potty training, a swiss army knife, and random toys (cars, wind-up toys), tissues, comb, individual wrapped wet ones, etc.  There has been occassion when I didn't want to bring my pocketbook where I also put my wallet, phone, keys, lipstick and pocket mirror in there as well (plenty of room for everything.)  Then of course the \"main\" compartment fits everything but the kitchen sink.  For me, I just keep 3 snack cups, 2 Take & Toss bowls filled with snacks, a change of clothes for my toddler (new baby isn't born yet), apple sauce, coloring books, crayons, etc. (stuff I don't typically need to access on the fly.)  It's virtually empty.  I'm figuring this is where I'll likely keep most of the babies items (change of clothes, blankets, spit-up rags, swaddle blankets, nursing covers, bibs, etc.)  So, needless to say, this bag, although it appears small, holds a boatload.Then there are the \"amenities\"!  Teflon coating makes it super easy to wipe clean.  My son spilled apple sauce only a day or two after i got it.  It wiped clean without so much as a smell, stain, sticky mess or anything.  I love the concept that I can just drop it in the washing machine in case it does get gross.  It's the only diaper bag I've seen on the market that offers this option.  I've spent so much time wiping my old bag down with Clorox wipes and spraying it down with Lysol whenever I've dropped it on a bathroom floor, or had to tuck it under an airplane seat.  The 3M insultated bottle pockets are awesome!  Ju-Ju-Be advertises that it will keep a bottle or cup hot or cold for 3 hours.  I've found it lasts much longer.  First, I like the height of the pockets.  I have the tall sippy cups for my son, and they fit in there perfectly.  The sides are elasticized, so it \"holds\" the cup in place, but allows me to easily reach in and grab the cup, but the height prevents a large amount of the cup (and mouthpiece) to stick out and possibly touch things like shopping carts, the car floor, etc.  I pack my son a straw cup of ice water every morning, then I leave it in the bag when I drop it off at daycare with my son.  I've become accustomed to room temperature water in the evening when I pick him up, but now the water actually stays cold!  The ice is melted, but the water is still cold.  I was SHOCKED.The bag itself is super comfortable.  The straps are easily adjustable where it only takes seconds for my husband or I to move the size (I'm 5'5\", 120lbs, and my hubby is 6'0\" and 220 lbs, so there's a big difference in what \"fits\" each of us.) The memory foam padding on both the back of the bag (entirely covers your back) and the ones on the straps makes this bag actually enjoyable to wear (even pregnant, it's extremely cushy on my back, and seems to take the weight off carrying so much stuff.)  I also really like that there's a handle on the top of the bag that let's me reach down and pick it up with one hand to carry out to the car or whatever, without having to actually put it on my back.The only reason I didn't rate this bag a 5 is because i would have preferred some additional options in pattern.  We got the Stargyle which is very nice.  I like it.  But I wanted something distinct in pattern (so it stood out), but that wouldn't be too \"girly\" for when my husband had to carry it.  This pretty much fits the bill, I guess.  It's not overly feminine, but there's nothing remotely masculine about it either.  I would have preferred something more gender neutral.  This pattern is cute, though.  I like it, and since I'll have 2 boys, it works out fine.
B00198XSS8 This is the best diaper bag for me! It's a little expensive compared to my other 3 diaper bags but is definitely worth it! It looks very sturdy and stylish at the same time. This backpack is perfect for traveling especially by plane because you can fit in a lot of stuff and still feel comfortable with the padded back and strap. You can use the diaper changer pocket as an iPad pocket as well. I was trying to put in my MacBook 13&#34; but it didn't fit.All in all I'm very satisfied with this purchase. I also bought a Be quick in Royal envy which is a perfect pair for this bag.
B00198XSS8 I was looking for a diaper bag that would hold enough stuff for a toddler and a baby and that would give me the hands-free option with juggling two kids. After hours of research and reading customer reviews of different bags I really thought this bag would work and I really wanted to love it. Though the dimensions of this bag were bigger than my old diaper bag (Columbia messenger bag) I could fit less stuff in it. The lack of pockets makes organizing difficult. In the big compartment the big inside zipper pocket comes in handy for clothes (to keep them in place) but besides that there is just one other inside mesh pocket to hold diapers, no other pockets. So if you have loose stuff in the bag and open the flap to get to the diapers other things will fall out. Most backpacks turn into a deep whole where stuff disappears in (at the bottom), this one not so much because of the wide opening.The outside pockets are all good but I wish there were more. The quality of the bag is excellent. Love the materials! The shipping speed and fulfilling was also excellent. So the quality of the bag receives 5 stars but because of the functionality, small size and lack of pockets I only gave it 3. I had to return it.
B00198XSS8 This is a great diaper bag for older children, such as toddlers. I purchased this for my newborn because I love the idea of a backpack and a pretty/unique bag. After about a month I realized this is not an ideal bag for a baby. It is hard to get diapers, wipes out when you need them in a hurry. I do like that the zipper zips all the way down on both sides, an improvement on their last backpack but when you are in a small space, it is useless because you don't have anywhere to open the bag out flat; such as in a bathroom changing your baby on a changing table connected to the wall or trying to find a pacifier in your bag while in the car and a screaming baby is asking for it. My husband absolutely hated this bag and so did my mother. I think I will use this bag again later on when I am not depending on having everything easy to access in a hurry.  The bag is large and holds everything but it's all smooched in together and things at the bottom are impossible to find.
B00198XSS8 I love this bag, but I love all my ju ju be bags.  I use this every time I am going somewhere with the kids that requires my hands to be free: so amusement parks, nature walks, and places that don't allow a stroller.  This way I can carry my baby, and hold my toddler's hand.  It fits everything I need for a day, including diapers, changes of clothes, toys/teething rings,wipes, medicines, sunblock, crocs, and all my personal stuff (wallet, cell, phone, makeup) my be quick, and the fuel cell.  I use this bag interchangeably with my be prepared (long day out somewhere) and my be all (for single child errands).  I do not agree with a reviewer that said not enough pockets.  There are so many pockets it's really easy to stay organized.  It hangs off the stroller so well, and is very easily accessible.  I love the top handle to grab for quick moves.  I got the black and silver so it's really neutral and I can continue to use it after the kids are a bit older.  LOVE IT!!!!
B00198XSS8 We had bought a Ju Ju Be Be All when our son was born. It wasn't my first choice but man oh man am  I glad I picked it. It stood up to the test of time with me. After 2 years I wanted a new one. Not that I needed one because it was still going strong. I now had 2 lil ones to tote around with me so I wanted a backpack type bag. This has been IDEAL! I am able to reach the sippy cups without even taking it off. The top zipper is where I keep anything that I may need to check out. It fits a ton of stuff. I would HIGHLY recommend this to anyone.
B00198XSS8 I received this as a Christmas Gift.  After having my second baby, my first diaper bag was starting to get strenuous for my shoulder.  We went on a small vacation, and I used a backpack while at the amusement park.  I asked for a diaperbag backpack for Christmas, and my parents purchased me this one.  They were worried it could be too small, and at first glance, I thought it could be too.  Hardly!  Not only is this bag better on my back, but my favorite feature is the organization of this bag.  All the compartments are easy to get to and unlike a traditional diaper bag, I don't have to pull everything out to find the diaper or the extra onsie.  Here is what is inside currently:- 8 diapers for the baby- 6 fot the toddler- package of wipes- 2 extra set of warm clothes baby- 1 set of clothes for toddler-  wallet- makeup- keys- two bottles w parts & formula- emergency kit- small toysand there is still plenty of room!The construction is great!  Can't comment on how long it'll last, since I've only had it a few weeks.  But I'm hoping for a long time!
B00198XSS8 Just what i needed. I love bags even before i had my babies and ju ju be brand just top it off in diaper bags. It's a nice size backpack with a lot of space and pockets for all baby stuff
B00198XSS8 I have have owned the Ju Ju Be BFF, packabe and ppb's boxy backpack. This one is my favorite.Here is a detailed comparison of the BFF vs. the Be Right Back 2.0 (I will refer to as the BRB for the rest of the post)--The backpack straps on the BRB have firmer padding and the padding extends down the strap longer. This is important for those of us who have 'thicker' shoulders or those who choose to pack the BFF's back pocket to the max.-The BRB has a nice mesh breathable fabric against the back and underneath the straps, the BFF does not-The BRB straps are very easily adjustable, the BFF's are not-The BRB has a side zipper pocket that runs along the back and is easy to access (changing pad located here), the BFF has a pocket on the back and in order to access it you must move both backpack straps (changing pad located here)-The grab handle on the BFF is slightly more padded than the grab handle on the BRB-The insulated cup holders are deeper on the BRB-The mommy pocket is a different shape and has less pockets 
B00198XSS8 Royal Envy is so beautiful in real life and the be right back is a wonderful bag that holds a ton!  I have a BFF and this holds a lot more that the BFF!  Thanks for yet another wonderful product!
B00198XSS8 I am a big fan of Ju-Ju-Be bags so when I needed a new bag I went back to the brand.  I have a 4 month old and a 3 year old and this bag easily holds all of our needs.  It is comfortable to wear although sometimes a waist strap would be helpful if it's really loaded down.  I would give it 5 stars but I am on my second bag already.  The shoulder strap on first bag came out at the base of the bag after only a month of use.  I think it may not have been sewn correctly; however, I really liked the bag so took advantage of Amazon's amazing customer service and returned my defective one for a new one.  I have not had any similar issues thus far and hope this one stays together.
B00198XSS8 This is a great bag with lots of pockets. The small details, like rings for stroller clips, make it a perfect diaper bag.
B00198XSS8 these best diaper bag ever.  I need to be organized and know where everything is and with this bag/backpack I finally am.  We have the perfect place for everything including the wipes that are easy to get to. you will not regret this one.
B00198XSS8 So many compartments!  Really easy to keep things organized and I love that you can open up the whole front of this backpack so you're not digging into a \"black hole\" to find stuff.  I like the felt pocket for my phone and it's genius where they put the changing pad!  Doesn't look like a diaper bag at all and is comfortable to wear all day.  It worked great on our trip to Disneyland.  These people think of everything!
B0019AC8GE I had already purchased the Inglesina Fast Chair.  Our daughter has been using the Fast Chair since about four months and loves sitting in it.  We get compliments on it when we are in restaurants and its fairly easy to clamp on with big rubber top and bottom clamps to protect tables.But we decided that we'd probably prefer a snap on table with a tray as our daughter enters the \"messy-eating-by-herself\" stage.  Enter the P&T; Lobster.  The P&T; looks more stylish, is sleek, and has some serious clamp-on ability -- I certainly liked it better than the Inglesina.  The only problem I had is that my daughter didn't!  She's now 8 months old and a little over 26 inches tall.  When she sits in the Inglesina she can easily see and manipulate items on the table in front of her, rest her arms on the chair sides, etc.  There is still room to grow but she fits in it.  In the P&T; Lobster, the seat is so deep that she was drowning in it and while her head was still higher than the table top, she could no longer see things as well to interact with them.  As a result, she doesn't like being in the chair and we've had to return it.It's possible the P&T; will work beautifully for older children, but for our sizeable 8 month old, it was just too deep.One last thing, while this chair does have a tray, the tray simply slides in (and back out!) easily and has pretty small sides for holding food in.  I didn't see a way to clip it to the chair or cause it to stay put when you have a wiggling kid trying to move everything around.  It didn't strike me as a particularly solid or useful tray.  I'm going with a tinydiner mat and the Inglesina for now until I find something better.
B0019AC8GE I don't want to hate it....I really don't....in fact I was so excited to get it, then....I GOT it and ugh!Below is the letter I wrote to P&T; and I will update with their response:Hi \"Phil and Ted\",I just want to write you to express my qualms with this frustrating lobster chair. Firstly, I would like to mention it's one pro: size, but that one pro is also a large downfall as well! Then I would like to ask also if either of you or your product designers have children and, if so, if you have tested this on them!?The chair is deep, which is nice, and narrow, which is nice too for space saving, but it's impossible to use the buckles let alone the shoulder straps and very challenging to get a child in (getting them to put their legs down in the holes) and out (making sure they are facing the right way in order to not scrape their body).Cleaning. Ha! That's a joke! Do you have a young child? Have you seen them eat?! It's a mess, something that resembles a very talented artist who fetches millions if dollars for their splatter art! Add a canvas rather than a tray and move over Jackson Pollock! Getting the canvas part out requires unscrewing and then the rest is easy BUT the seat cushion is not removable nor is it washing machine safe on gentle or anything. Hand wash!? No way! I want to throw this whole thing away before I attempt to scrub the cakes of yuck out of the mesh-like side and cracks of the seat.Also as many MANY people reviewed on amazon, the tray doesn't lock in at all so a plate on the tray becomes an easy projectile thus further warranting the need for a washing machine visit.It goes on and off the table nice and easy so that is a plus, but cleaning is the number one priority following the obvious safety aspect!Please please let me know if there is anyway I can invest the hours of cleaning from a recent pasta meal and return to this to you. I cannot pay $80 for this and hate it so much. I need to reinvest my money into a different chair. Would this be possible? I do not want write my review on amazon but I was led astray and I want to prevent anyone else from feel this way as well, I would love to write a review that says how wonderful the customer service is and how amazing you guys are! Hopefully it's true!I am so sorry to be so grumpy but for $80 I have much higher hopes on the ease of cleaning factor! Great chair otherwise for areas of safety, size (which also is a downfall at times), and aesthetics.Thanks and hope to hear from you tomorrow,\"----------EDIT TO ADD with Phil & Ted response (see below)-----------Hi -----,\"Thanks so much for taking the time to reach out to us and provide the feedback. We really value all feedback from our customers as our products are all designed with the needs of parents in mind. Let me see if I can help you find a solution to your issuesDue to the need for play in the design of the lobster claw, the trays will never fit 100% well underneath the claws with perfect spacing. This may cause the tray to not lock tightly with every use. The tray is not made to lock completely securely as the primary concern is the ability to guarantee a tight fit of the claw to the table. The tray on every model will have slight motion. What I personally find is helpful is if you clamp in one side of the lobster (with the tray under it-so that side is tight) and then clamp down the other side of the lobster with the other piece of the tray. Does that make sense? Another option that I found is helpful is to attach the lobster to the table, so the lobster is secure, then slide the tray in under it. if it still has some give-you can release one of the lobster clamps and then move it slightly inward-and try the tray again.We do have some good instructions for caring for the fabric:The fabric should be cleaned regularly. Brush off any excessive dirt or sand and rinse with lukewarm water. Wash your Lobster by hand using a a sponge dipped in mild natural soap solution in lukewarm water (no more than 38C/100F). Rinse thoroughly. DO NOT tumble dry or dry in strong sunlight. To avoid fabric fading, cover the Lobster if it is exposed to direct sunlight through glass e.g. in a car or if stored in exposed areas.Unfortunately we are unable to process refunds on product. A return for a refund would need to be coordinated through your retailer as they have your money in this case.Please let us know if there is anything else we can do for you.  Have a great day.\"Devon Powers800-839-4985Sales Supportphil&teds;----------------------------------Ok so my thoughts on this: I took the chair apart, unscrewing the screw to slide out the canvas part and sponge cleaning it. It is pretty easy to sponge clean but COMPLETELY ridiculous if after a super crusty, messy, or saucy meal.I wish I could return this but amazon would make me pay shipping, I got it as a gift, AND not sure they would take it back used just because I don't like it. It works for what it is right now. Unfortunately I was mislead by such raving reviews that I thought I would post my feelings since they weren't all rainbows and sunshine. Decide for yourself. If you have a neat as a pin infant/toddler and very little space, a table with no lip, and tons of time to clean each time, than this is the chair for you!
B0019AC8GE Bought this for my 7 month old. Overall, I love it. I like how compact it is, how easy to set up. I like that it comes with a tray and it seems very well-made, sturdy and secure. There are a few things that I would like to see fixed especially for the price of this item:- easier to adjust straps- removable strap pads- elastic webbing to hold the tail ends of the straps- a better way to secure the tray to the seat (it is very easy to slide out and move around so I find I'm am pretty constantly adjusting it)- a zippered carry bag with a long shoulder strapSeems like a lot of flaws but they are basically small things and I would purchase this item again.
B0019AC8GE I'm a self proclaimed germ-a-phobe, and countless times, I've tried to wipe off a restaurant high chair, only to be disgusted by the dirt, grime, and who knows what else, comes off the chairs that they never, ever clean.  I have owned a couple different high chair covers though my 3 children, but my last child happens to be a very active little girl who manages to spin around in the high chair and takes the cover with her, to the point where it's covering nothing and her bare hands are all over the nasty high chair.  I got this as a last resort, and I LOVE it. I wish I had this when my other kids were little.  I no longer have to worry about other kids germs, slobber, food coming in contact with my baby's little hands!  I love that she sits in the booth with me, instead of stuck at the end of the table where people are walking by and servers are passing over her head with trays of food and drinks.  So far, I have only been to 1 place where the seat didn't work, and that was because the table was like 6 inches thick. The seat is very easy to attach to tables and my daughter really seems to like it. My only 2 complaints: #1 The tray is worthless.  it is easily pushed out by a baby and not even worth having.  It might be better when she gets older and isn't so interested in moving it out of the way.  For now, I just put down those disposable placemats with the sticky stuff on the back.  P&T needs to make it so the tray clips on to the seat clamps. And #2 there really should be a small carrying bag for the seat.  I wouldn't stick this in my diaper bag....there's no room for it.  So I just have it in a small canvas bag.  P&T should have had a bag with something like this.  Other than those 2 things, it's great!  I look forward to getting a few years of use out of it.
B0019AC8GE We eat at stools at our kitchen counter so we wanted a chair to use so our son could be at the same level as us (regular high chairs were too low).  After thorough research, we first purchased a Chicco clip on chair (the lobster was not on the market yet) but the arms were very long and it didn't fit on our counter.  We exchanged it for this chair and have been happy with it so far.  The clamps are short and it fits perfectly on our counter.  Our son seems comfortable in it.I think the tray is pointless, it kinda clips into the clamps but my son can push it out easily.  We haven't tried taking it to a restaurant yet can I can understand how it would be difficult yo use (per other reviews) because it should only be used on certain types of table tops and without a table cloth.Overall we are happy with the chair and feel it is the best option for eating at a counter.Update, my son is now a year old so we have been using the chair for 6 months.  It remains our primary chair when eating at our counter (where we eat most of our meals) but we did pick up a booster/highchair that attaches to a chair when we eat in our dining room or outside since both of those tables have a lip.  We have taken it on vacation- just folded it up and put in our suitcase, and we take it to friends houses.  It is easy to clean.
B0019AC8GE we have twins and a small kitchen so these work great. we attach them to table for dinner and the bar overlooking the kitchen at various times so they can hang out while we work in the kitchen. they are also great to take to restaurants and friends homes. i don't know that the straps are necessary, our girls are 6 mo and we haven't used them. the carrying case is nice. we have never used the tray. the soft black part in front definitely gets covered with food but probably less so when they get a little bigger and pretty easy to wipe off. we are not planning on getting regular high chairs. if they outgrow these at some point (Before expected) i will repost. they seem very secure.
B0019AC8GE We love how compact this travel highchair is. We can put it in the basket of our stroller and whip it out as needed; it could probably even fit in a regular backpack or a very large diaper bag. The foldaway design is genius and we like the fact that it comes with/fits in its own small bag. We sold our Chicco 360 seat after getting this one, since this one is so much more portable.That said, the two downsides to this otherwise very nicely-designed product are:1) The included tray doesn't lock to the seat. While it's GREAT that a tray was even included, we would love if it locked into place with the seat so our little one couldn't push it out and overturn/fling it.2) Because the way it connects to the table are basically two heavy duty clamps, it only works on tables without a lip. We've found we're able to use it only 50% of the time when dining out due to this, plus the regular restrictions when using a hook-on chair (not on a tippy pedestal table, etc.). This is a pretty big downer because not being able to use it in so many instances defeats the purpose of having it and the convenience of its small size.
B0019AC8GE I agree with the other reviewers re: the limited use of the phil&ted;'s Lobster Highchair given that it's a clamp design and won't work with tables with lips or tables that are too thin (like the kind you find at Chinese banquet halls where they place a large round table top over their smaller table to create a larger table). I suppose this is for safety reasons, but still, it does limit the use of the chair. I really like the fact that it folds so compactly and comes with its own carrying bag. Also, the tray is an added bonus, though as other reviewers have mentioned, it doesn't clip on to the chair so it's fairly easy to remove by the kid, which defeats the purpose IMHO.I'll focus on few things that it appears no one else has mentioned:1) The seat is quite deep. I guess this is good because it means it has room to grow with the child, but we use it on our 11-month old, who is in the 75th percentile in height and he sits REALLY low in the chair. The first few times we used it, he did not like it at all as it seemed to be sunken in the chair. We have since placed a thick blanket in the bottom of the seat for him to elevate him, and that has helped.2) There is virtually no space between the child and the table, which again, might be for safety reasons, but it makes the child's chest butt up against the edge of the table, which doesn't seem particularly comfortable to me. Luckily, we have a fairly skinny child so he fits fine in the chair, but I imagine that if you had a chubbier kid, this might be a bigger issue for you.3) Like the other reviewer said, I wish the bag was zippered. However, to add to that, I also wish the bag was just slightly bigger so that it wouldn't be such a snug/tight fit when trying to put the chair back in it. It cant be a bit of a struggle. Perhaps a bag with some stretchy qualities to it might do the trick.So, given these few flaws, I think I'd still recommend the chair. It's quite stylish, easy to take with us and the clamps feel very sturdy.
B0019AC8GE My sister bought this for us and it is perfect for our on-the-go lifestyle. We've secured it to picnic tables, restaurant tables and tables in homes. It comes with a tidy little carrier which helps. My husband and I hate baby \"junk\" clutter so this is amazing for our city apartment.Also very helpful when our son was too little for restaurant high chairs--super secure and with support/safety straps.For people complaining about how it doesn't attach to tables with lips--true but that's a very small issue compared with its great versatility.Our only high chair.Phil&Teds; also has amazing customer service so I love buying products from them--they back their products.
B0019AC8GE Have you ever been to a restaurant with a toddler? I have. The question is.. have you ever been to a restaurant with a toddler and  felt like giving up on life and crawling back to your dank dark apartment and never leaving again? Because I have been there too.  My toddler is the kind of child who wants all the attention at all times. She wants to get into everything and never let me do what I want to do.. even if what I want to do is the simple task of &#34;eating.&#34; Do you remember &#34;eating?&#34; Like before children? Because to me it seemed like this blissful fairy tale that never actually existed but I had created in my mind to help me get through the dark times.Then I bought the lobster chair. Red. Beautiful. Sexy even. It's got a soft, luxurious seat and claws that clamp so hard, aint nobody falling off that table. Trust me. I tested it myself. I do love my little gremlin, don't get me wrong, I want her safe. I just want to eat too.The first time we took this to a restaurant it was like a miracle. Not only did she actually SIT in it.. she liked it. She sat in it swinging her legs and eating rice and smiling and never wanted out of it like she did with all those stupid wooden pieces of crap they call high chairs at most restaurants. I was so happy I almost cried. I actually got to eat at the same time as my husband and didn't have to wrestle an unruly demon child who wanted to say &#34;hi&#34; to every stranger at every table and then go back again for a second round of that.If you're on the fence about this chair... do yourself a favor and take the leap. Worth every penny. I will never go back. I keep this in my trunk and feel panicky if I ever take a different car and forget it. It's a priceless tool that every parent should have.
B0019AC8GE We have one of these lobster chairs in our car at all times and use it on various occasions: when visiting friends, going to a restaurant, staying with families, even when eating at a picnic table during a road trip.in short: WE LOVE IT.The only downside I can see is some tables have a skirt that don't accommodate the chair.
B0019AC8GE We tried a couple of brand and kept this one as well as another type from Chicco. For one, we have twins, and second, we wanted to make sure that we always have a chair that fits. We use this seat approximately 60% of the time, 30% of the time we use the Chicco Caddy Hook On Chair, and in 10% of the cases neither of them can be mounted safely.This chair fits great for all tables that have a sturdy top, even when it is several inches thick. It will not fit tables that have a lip or some kind of skirt. The seat is smaller than most others and I reckon we'll have to stop using it when our boys reach 18 - 24 months of age.The tray that comes with it is fairly useless as it is just pushed in from the front so the boys can very easily push it out.
B0019AC8GE It's easy to get on and off our counter.  This is perfect for our needs.
B0019CDXXE these are nice cotton blankets, but nothing exceptional.  by the reviews i was expecting extremely high quality, but they were actually just normal cotton blankets.  pretty great to have on hand with a newborn, but definitely not a one-of-a kind product
B0019CDXXE This blanket was a splurge for me, however I came back and bought another one because every time my son wet on the original one, panic would ensue around our house! They are really great quality, and we like them because they are the perfect stretchy-ness for swaddling. Highly recommend!
B0019CDXXE I love this blanket. It's very soft, like a thick t-shirt. I swaddle my baby in it every night and have come to believe this blanket plays a crucial role in helping my baby sleep thru the night! ha! I just wish it was bigger. My son is now 3 months and I don't see him being swaddled in this blanket much longer. We also use it to cover him while out and about in his carseat.
B0019CDXXE We love these swaddles (and the burb cloths!). we own a lot of L'ovedbaby items. The swaddling blankets feel amazing. My husband loves how they stretch and you can get a tight swaddle. We originally ordered two and then got two more. These will be a gift we give to all expecting parents!
B0019CDXXE This blanket is made very well, it came as described and is very soft and cuddly for baby! An absolute must for anyone looking for a swaddling blanket!
B0019CDXXE The quality of this blanket is outstanding. The fabric is beautiful, washes and looks new every time and makes great for swaddling and for a 'light' blanket at night. We use ours from the waist down for our son in his co-sleeper as well as a sleep sac. When he was smaller though, it swaddled wonderfully and we have the hats to match
B0019F35AW They are a large size and are much easier to change rather then the crib sheet each time. Very nice, hold their shape after washing and drying.
B0019F35AW As our little grandson starts to become a big boy, it is time to start protecting his big boy bed. These are just the right size for the toddler bed. Not too big or bulky. They are soft also. They fit great under the sheets and don't require fighting with the mattress corners.
B0019F35AW These pads function perfectly well.  However, after washing them several times, they get really pilly.  We like to have pads like this around the house, anywhere that the baby might get changed or play, and this gets so worn-looking that I don't like to have it out and visible.  If you were putting this under a sheet though, it would be perfect.
B0019F35AW These are great to be able to put on the pad in the Pack N' Play and toss in the washer when they get soiled.  They do tend to start pilling pretty quickly after a few washes though
B0019F35AW A little rough, difficult to remove stains. Works ok, I use it to line the changing pad. I would recommend it
B0019HEENC My 11 month old does not have this down yet, but is getting there.  If she shakes it upside down, cheerios go flying, but I think that when she understands better how to reach in and has better motor control, this will be great.  I think getting the lid is a must and think it should come with the cups.Definitely not gender neutral, but I didn't really care.
B0019HEENC I'd like to have a lid for our snack traps for when we pack them to go with us, but why do I have to buy this pack of 3 accessories? Why not just sell the lids?
B0019HEENC We love the replacement cover and lid to keep snacks fresh and contained in the diaper bag.  The sippy cup lid seems stupid and we'll probably never use it.  I wish we could just buy the replacement lid and cover.
B0019HEENC We use these ALL of the time!!! Great because they're not too big or bulky, but they hold a lot of snacks nonetheless. I also like that the lids are such that it is easy for little hands to navigate in and out without struggle.
B0019HEENC I just paid the same price at our local baby store for ONE solid cover for the Snack Trap.  I didn't get an extra snack trap lid or a \"sippy cup\" lid to go with it.  Doh!  I do love the Snack Traps - we own 4 of this brand and 1 munchkin.  We prefer these ones which are smaller and easier for our little one to grip.  With both she's figured out how to dump everything out of them pretty good, but c'est la vie.
B0019HEENC The picture and description was not clear.  These are JUST THE LIDS! Now I have lids but no containers.
B0019HEENC The concept is great!  However, the more my toddler sticks her hand in the lid to get her snacks the more the lid caves in. I wish they would have a little more bounce-back to them so they would hold up longer. It would last be great if they just sold lid replacements without the variety pack of lids.  I'd probably order a 3 pack of slotted lids more often if that were an option.  We are trying the Munchkin brand now and I think I actually like those a little better.
B0019IKF02 I decided to use the nail scissors and clippers on myself, but the files I will use for my daughter... The scissors have a thicker blade and are slightly curved. I think the thickness is what doesn't work for me most. They are also really long when you think of a child's small hands and even smaller nails. This just doesn't work for a little one, at least not for me. I prefer the pigeon brand, which costs more, but you get what you pay for. Good deal for a manicure set (for myself) for the price. Overall, I will not use the actual nail cutters in this set on my daughter.
B0019IKF02 Love the scissors!! They make trimming tiny nails very easy and I am not afraid of cutting their fingers like I did with traditional newborn clippers. This should be a must-have for anyone with babies.
B0019IKF02 I bought this a second time since we lost the scissors from the last set.  I use the scissors and clipper to cut my son's nails and both are easy and safe.  I feel comfortable cutting his nails with this set and highly recommend it...plus it's a great price!
B0019IKF02 Our baby's nails grow so quickly but they are easily taken care of with this set. I do her nails after a feeding and there is no fussing, she just let's me take care of it. Decent product.
B0019IKF02 I love these nail files and use them instead of scissors as I clipped her skin even with these scissors.  The nail files work great though.
B0019IKF02 Very good little set.  My boy is 2 mo old and I use the scissors the most and have just started using the clippers.  I tried the emery boards and they didn't do much.  PLus they are SO small that if you manage to file down all 10 fingers and 10 toes, you've pretty much used the board up.  Still for the money, it's a better buy for the set than getting them separate.
B0019IKF02 The baby nail scissors in this set are easy to use and are nicely curved so that that get under the nail and don't catch on baby's skin. I'm a first time mother and I was scared to clip baby's nails because I thought I might clip his little finger. The nail files are ok. I tried those first before the scissor and they didn't do much. I haven't tried the clipper yet.
B0019IKF02 I have been using these since my daughter was a newborn.  They are easy to use and I am not nervous about cutting them too low or cutting her.  I use the scissors and the file only.  I would highly recommend them to anyone with a new baby!
B0019IKF02 The regular baby nail clippers scare me, boards don't work, and I am not putting a baby finger in my mouth and chewing off a nail (yes, this was the advice I got over and over again from friends, but I'm not into nail biting for myself, and surely not into do it for someone who puts their hands into their diaper every chance they get...ick!).  These nail scissors are nice and curved so they run along the shape of the nail easily, preventing accidental skin clipping.
B0019IKF02 I use the clippers to cut my babies toenails and the scissors for her hands. Works perfectly and never had an accident. I don't use the files tough.
B0019IKF02 scissors were too big and bulky, was afraid to cut the baby accidentally. the blades became dull after some use. bought a different kind with shorter blades that i am very happy with . I cannot comment on the nail clippers because I do not use them on my baby. however, the nail files are useful because it makes the nails smoother which helps prevent baby from leaving scratch marks on her face.
B0019IKF02 i am just wondering how could other buyers bear this product as the scissor completely won't work; have to return it. buy a better one.
B0019IKF02 I like the scissors and the clippers, both work well.  The emery boards are way to rough, instead of being a fine grain for baby nails.
B0019JF0T2 First let me say I had this sling for 9 weeks now and did not know Dr Sears was involved with this one as my husband bought it for us.It's incredible! I have a baby with high needs/\"some colic\" (the Dr says) and we wear baby everywhere now. I'm about to take him grocery shopping. I LOVE that you don't have to wrap anything and the sling is ready to go, you just pop it on and baby in it.It stops him from ALL FUSSING. I mean anything, if he's already got to the point of wailing I just pop him in there and bounce around a little extra as I walk. One circle of the house and he's calm, he loves passing out in it.One time we went to the beach after he'd been fed and I couldn't get him to latch and he was fussing. We hopped out of the car in 40 degree weather and I walked him around in the sling, he fell asleep (so even hungry this calmed him!)I can't say enough good things about this sling. The only downside is the plastic part where it connects at the strap can sometimes dig into your shoulder if you have it positioned a certain way, I just throw a burp cloth or two in between me and the plastic part if it bugs my shoulder and viola, solved!LOVE THIS SLING! It's a sanity saver!!
B0019JF0T2 I bought a MOBY wrap first.  After a few days I was tired of wrestling with 15 feet of fabric and then it was hot!!  This BB is so handy!  It will fit in the diaper bag and it is easy to put on like a purse and the baby fits right in.  It is also easy to get the baby to sleep and then remove and put in bed or swing.  This is much easier than lugging a car carrier everywhere (they're so heavy!).  This way you can leave the car seat in the car and just pop the baby in this sling to get groceries or go to the Dr. etc.  And if you don't like people to touch your baby all the time this is the way to go, they look but don't touch.
B0019JF0T2 I bought this for my second child. It has become such a part of our lives, I can't imagine life without it. Sometimes I think it is a magic sling. Baby loves to be in it. It calms baby during fussy times. It lulls baby to sleep. It helps mama chase after big sibling while still holding baby. It goes with us everywhere: on trips, to restaurants, at church. I can sit through a 45-minute sermon with baby quietly sitting or sleeping in this sling! My husband wore baby to a conference and attended presentations with baby quietly in this sling! We go out to eat and to weddings with baby in this sling! We are confident enough to take baby anywhere, because we know this sling will work its magic.I am surprised by how comfortable it is. I find it much more comfortable than a BabyBjorn, for example. The shoulder strap is well-padded and really distributes baby's weight evenly. I have no soreness or aches from using this sling. Just be sure to follow the instructions and place the strap on your shoulder and not on your neck.The elastic rail is great for holding baby in place. The pocket (which is on both slides) is perfect for holding a pacifier, baby toy, or other small object.I bought brown because I wanted it not to clash with most of my clothes (and I always wear brown shoes). I have noticed that it has faded slightly from exposure to sunlight, but this has not affected the sling's performance or attractiveness, so it does not bother me.
B0019JF0T2 I received this as a baby shower gift and tried to use it several times.  We returned it because I didn't like it at all.  Well, we decided to give it another shot.  My husband went on their website to figure out how to properly use it.  Once we figured it out, it was great...it was just figuring it out to begin with.  I gave it 4 stars because of this (it shouldn't be complicated).  My now 5 week old who has minor colic falls asleep in it and absolutely loves it!
B0019JF0T2 Bought this for my wife, Seemed pretty cumbersome and the baby didn't fit in real well. So, I don't know, go ask my wife.
B0019JF0T2 We used the hotsling for the first 3 months of my baby's life and then we bought the Balboa after she outgrew the hotsling. This sling IS NO GOOD. First of all, the plastic ring digs into me and my baby's head is always hitting it. It's a huge BAG, basically and there are better slings out there. All of the weight is on your shoulder so I cannot comfortably wear my baby. Too bad. I will buy the ERGO.
B0019JF0T2 This carrier isn't perfect for everything, but it's perfect for what I want it for: very quick errands. Carrying my daughter in her car seat is way too heavy. Getting out the car seat AND the stroller is a hassle for just one quick errand. Putting this sling over my shoulder, getting her out of her car seat, and putting her in this takes seconds. I believe everyone needs at least two baby carriers: a fast one, and one for long amounts of time (like an ergobaby or a baby k'tan, both of which I have, and both of which take a little bit more time to get the baby in). Yes, this would probably start to hurt my back/shoulder as she gets heavier and if I used it for long amounts of time, but I don't... For long amounts of time, other types of carriers are better for your back, but this is the best fast carrier I've seen. I didn't get it until my daughter was 3 months old and 12 pounds with partial head control, and at that point, it worked great. Like most reviewers said, I wouldn't use it for a newborn (I actually think an ergobaby with infant insert is the best for newborns, assuming it isn't too hot when they're born), but it has its uses, and I'm happy with the purchase. I should mention that I got it for about 1/3 the full retail price (even less than the Amazon price) because I bought it used.
B0019JF0T2 So my sister used this sling for her little guy and loved it. I was looking for something quick to slip on and off to make taking care of my twins during the day easier. This sling works good, my only issue is sometimes the rings dig into my shoulder. My babies love it and usually fall asleep in the sling. A good alternative to the moby wrap which I also have but takes a bit more time to put on.
B0019JF0T2 The first complaint I have is that it was uncomfortable. I adjusted and adjusted, but it never felt right on my shoulder.It was hard to get my large baby in (she was 8 lbs, 8 oz at birth), and she got furious with me every time I tried to use it.I ended up shelving this until she could sit up fairly well. At that time I tried to use it as a hip carrier. It was VERY easy to place her in the pouch in this position. However, it still hurt my shoulder and my back. Then the baby tried to jump out of it!I am done trying this. I don't recommend it if you're very petite, have a large or long baby, or get a back ache easily.The good things about it are: cute design, nice little pocket for a paci, and washes easily.
B0019JF0T2 PROS:* This is a very nice sling, very well made and durable. The fabric color is nice, neutral and the embroidery is quite chic. The elasticized sides are wide and confortable. The outside pocket is too small to put much but fits a slim wallet or car keys.* Once you find the correct size adjustment for yourself, it's very easy to use. It's also fairly comfortable once put properly on the shoulder (not near the neck)* Baby took a couple times to get used to it (start walking as soon as baby is secured inside to avoid the cries!) but, after a few times, she even seemed to look forward to be put so snugly in there. Obviously, it is very confortable for baby. Actually, it can calm down a fussy baby quite quickly if you walk: baby ends up asleep in just a few minutes everytime!* It's convenient when running errands where pushing a stroller would be a problem (like visiting administrations where you go through metal detectors or narrow stores).* I also have a Moby wrap but it is way too hard to put properly everytime. This sling is super easy to put on and off and so it is getting all the use.CONS:* You cannot easily raise your arms over head when wearing the sling (That's a problem if you want something stocked on a high shelf!)* It cannot be used for very long walks as, even though it's comfortable for quite a while, it's not all that back friendly!* My baby does not like to be in it if I am not walking. I am sure every kid is different but that does not allow me to use it while seating in a restaurant for example.I would definitely recommend this purchase to new parents. I think the quality justifies the price.
B0019JF0T2 Love this sling! I have used multiple slings/wraps for my children and this is by far my favorite- It is easy to get my baby in and out quickly and she seems to like being in it!
B0019JF0T2 Let me start by explaining that my baby is 11lbs 4ozs, 22.5 inches long and was born two weeks late (seems to have more control over his body/head that most newborns), so what works for him might not work for your baby, but I wanted to write what I thought since reviews are so integral to making the best purchases! :)Pros:Very Sturdy Material, Breathable but Warm (important for my winter baby! :)Easy to Get Baby In and Out - I also have an Infantino Carrier which I find to more difficult to use than this carrier.Subdued Design - I'm the type of person that wants my baby close but doesn't want to feel like I'm wearing 2 extra shirts, which is the feeling I got with the wrap style carriers. This kept him up high and close without making me feel uncomfortable!Comfortable - The Support strap that goes around your back is VERY comfortable! It's nicely padded and really wide.Adjustable - This carrier would fit a wide range of sizes and its easy to figure out how to get your perfect fit since there is only ONE strap to adjust, unlike my other carrier that had like 6 different buckles - UGH!Elastic Edges - They are fabulous because they securely hold the baby close to you and are nicely padded so they are comfortable against the baby and you.Cons:Awkward at First- The only thing that made it a little awkward at first was the placement of the rings, you have to play around with the fit of it to make sure the rings aren't hitting your collarbone (ouch!) but this is a very minor and easily fixed since its completely adjustable.Too Deep - This is my only big warning about this carrier. In my opinion,the pocket was waaay too deep for my baby to safely be in the &#34;Cradle Hold&#34;, where the baby &#34;lays&#34; down in the sling. Now if you read the beginning of my review you understand that I have a HUGE newborn, so the  fact that someone would try the Cradle Hold with an even smaller baby than mine makes me nervous. This is just a precaution and will take some experimentation on your part with your own baby.I will say this is
B0019JF0T2 This has been a great product to have.  I also have a Baby Bjorn, but I love this one for around the house for my own comfort.  We just started to face him forward in this while I eat, it helps support him on my lap until he's big enough for a booster seat.  I still use my hand to support him as well since I feel more comfortable by doing so.
B0019JF0T2 I have used this sling with two babies, plus shared it with my sister-in-law, and it has been so useful with all three children.  My babies prefer facing out, so they both have loved this sling, as they can sit up and watch what's going on around them.  My three and a half month old son was content and cozy on our trip to the grocery store today.  He was often fussy when I would try to shop with him in the car seat, but as long as I'm wearing him in the sling, he's happy.  I wore my daughter in this until she was eight months old, and she would have happily sat in in much longer, but it began to hurt my back around that time.  My son is currently sixteen pounds and so far it's been very comfortable wearing him in this.  My favorite thing about it is how easy it is to use -- he also likes the Baby Bjorn, but I like just throwing on a sling and not having to worry about clips and fasteners.  Great product.  Makes an excellent shower gift.
B0019JF0T2 Beautiful product, comfortable but HUGE. My baby is 11 wks old,11 lbs and she's lost in this pouch. There is so much fabric that once you put baby in the sling it sags and then you have to tighten the strap a ton to keep them up to your chest area. I think I will love it when my baby can sit up more and not be in the cradle position. She'll be way too hot to be in all that fabric and I'd worry about her breathing too since it swallows her up over her head! I have to say though that I am keeping it for when she is bigger because it's so darn pretty and comfy otherwise!
B0019JF0T2 I like the ease of use of this sling. The only negative I have to report is thatthere are no instructions whatsoever of how to safely get your baby out of it.
B0019JF0T2 The first time I tried it on it was so easy to use. I had ordered the Moby and returned instantly. I couldn't imagine paying $45 for a long piece of fabric that makes me look like an elephant after putting it on. This sling is small and no unneccessary fabric. I stuck my 5 week old in it and he slept for 2 hours straight while i worked around the house. This is awesome. If there were more stars than 5 I would give them. Love it. I got the black to go with everything and so that if my husband is up for it he can \"wear\" our son as well.One thing to say is my son is 9lbs and after 20 minutes I could feel my back starting to hurt but to be fair I have a terrible back so that was to be expted with any baby wearing device.Love this.
B0019JF0T2 I was uneasy due to contradictory and differing instructions between the pamphlet and the website. Seems like a safety issue that is quite old and not adequately addressed. Perhaps this is better for older babies that can hold their heads up well. Very deep. My baby gets lost in it. I expected more from a Dr. Sears endorsed/designed product.
B0019JF0T2 I have tried several other carriers/slings/wraps, such as the Moby, baby bjorn, and Minchkin sling.  I like the Moby because it is comfortable, but it is hard to put on, hard to get baby in and out of, and my son didn't like the feeling go being so confined.  He does like Baby Bjorn, but after awhile it is uncomfortable for me and it seems to restrict my mobility.  The Munchin sling was too tight or too big, which is why I like the adjustable sling of the Balboa.  My 4-month old son is comfortable in it, and he doesn't feel squished,  I carry him upright in the front or cuddle style, and it has worked fine.  It is super easy getting him in and out.  When reviewing the product there were some concerns a few years ago  about the use of the sling for newborns and improper positioning; I think these concerns are valid because the pocket is really big and can turn into a &#34;sac&#34;.  I think the company has updated its instructions about positioning, but I still think this sling is best for babies with a little more head control than the average newborn; actually, I think the Moby is ideal during this newborn stage,  Overall, I feel the Balboa is safe and my son and I are happy that we have found an easy to use carrier,
B0019JF0T2 Well, as we all know, baby slings are very personal. You have to try it to see if you like it. I'd say ti took me a little time to get used to this one, and I even considered returning it, but eventually I got it to work the way I wanted it to.My daughter was very colicky and would scream and scream any time she was laid down or placed in any kind of bouncy seat or swing. She hated everything but being held.. and not just held, but walked around! So out of despiration, I needed to try something to free up my hands so I could at least make myself breakfast! I have a baby bjorn active, and I'd say that is my favorite baby carrier. It is completely hands free. I could put her in that and clean the house. She'd just fall off to sleep. The sling isn't quite as substantial as the bjorn, so you do need to keep at least one hand on the baby, especially if you're leaning over to do anything. The reason I got this was because my abby loved to be swaddled and I couldn't leave her swaddled and put her in the bjorn at the same time. I figured the sling would allow me to pop ehr in and out without unwrapping her.So here's what I found - I woudn't use this for a really young baby who has no head and neck control. The pouch is a bit deep. My baby didn't like being held in a  cradle hold. She wanted to be upright all the time. So while the sling has an elastic band at the top, it's really not supportive enough to hold a newborn's head still. You'd have to keep a hand on thieir head at all time. My daughter is also a very long baby, so I couldn't scrunch her legs up inside the pouch without her being uncomfortable. So once she was able to hold her own head up pretty well, I would put her in it upright, with her legs dangling out the bottom. So I'd put the bottom elastic band under her bum. That seemed to work well for her. It was good for holding her while sitting and rocking her. Gave my arms a rest. BUt whenever I venture out fo the house, I use the baby bjorn. I also could never figure out how to breastfeed using this. But maybe that's just me. It's definitely a pouch carrier, not a true sling. It's a fabric pouch with an eleastic rim.It was easily adjustable. You have to place it pretty high on you before you put the baby in because it stretches out with the weight of the baby, but it's easy to pull on the strap and tighten it once the baby is in.I love the color and pattern of the fabric. It's very gender neutral and pretty. The fabric is super soft and not too thick so the baby won't get hot. I coudl easily keep her swaddled in a muslin blanket and put her in the sling without her getting hot.I also had a Mobi Wrap. It was ok, but took me way too long to get on and off and adjusted when I had a screaming baby I needed to sooth. So I didn't like it much. Plus it's sucha  long piece of fabric, that I would get all tangled in it. I couldn't see using it out and about.So, my preferences would be a structured carrier like a baby bjorn for out and about and really hands free baby wearing around the house,  and a sling like this one for around the house not doing much, or just sitting and cuddling with the baby. I'd say it works better with a slightly older baby, not a newborn or preemie.Give yourself some time to practice and get used to it before deciding whether it's for you or not.
B0019JF0T2 I purchased this sling to use with my infant son because he didn't like the Baby Bjorn at first. It has been nice to have for events where I am more dressed up (it looks much more put together than the Bjorn).  It is super easy to use, and I love that you don't have to adjust it each time you wear it. You can just pull it over your head with the pocket on the right or the left.This worked better before my son wanted to put all his weight on his legs and stand up when I put him in the sling, but I think it will work again when he can sit on his own and I can pull his legs through and carry him on my hip. We have taken a break from using it because my son has some reflux and pulling his legs up into his tummy to use the sling makes him spit up a lot.  Overall though, it's good in at different stages.
B0019JF0T2 Was a little unhappy with the product.The pictures of how baby was carried in it in the pamplet it tells you to NEVER carry your baby this way using this product.With the pamplets way our child was too low and she was NOT happy.Hoping it will work better when child is older.
B0019JF0T2 I was reading on of Dr. Sears' books and he suggested this sling.  I was a little turned off at first because of the price but decided to order and test it out.  SO glad I did.  Very high quality fabric and pretty!  It took me a little practice to get used to it and figure out how to wear my baby in it but I LOVE it! I have tried a wrap and a baby carrier but I love the versatility of this sling.  I love that when my 5 week old falls asleep in my arms I can easily transfer her to this sling and head out on a walk without disturbing her like with the wrap and the carrier.I will tell you that at first the shoulder that bears the weight got very tired and sore after an hour of wearing, so wear it in increasing increments...15 min, 30 min, 45 min, etc until you are used to it.  My 8 lbs newborn got heavy after 30 min so I had to wear it less time until I was used to it.ALSO, very handy to breastfeed on the go!  In public if you can't stop for a feeding, this sling comes in handy for feeding and hides everything exposed from public! And then your LO can fall right back to sleep when they are done.
B0019JF0T2 The sling is gorgeous and well made, baby seems comfortable in it, and the pockets really come in handy. I really like that it's easy to take baby in and out of the sling. The only reason I'm giving it four stars is that my back starts to hurt after about 30 min., because weight is not evenly distributed. This one is more of my \"practical\" sling, for short periods of time such as going to the grocery store, etc.  I also have a Moby, and while it is much more comfortable on my back, it's a hassle to tie and I can't take my sleeping baby out of it without waking him up. Baby seems to love both carriers equally!
B0019JF0T2 I bought a maya ring sling which I like but found it too awkward to use. My son only fits comfortably in it sometimes; other times his head his hitting the metal rings. I just got this Balboa sling in the mail today and love it, I can already feel the difference. I love that the rails are elastic, I feel like he is very secure. I wish it was a bit more adjustable like the ring sling is but all in all I love it!
B0019JF0T2 I bought this for my newborn, since the structured carrier we had was just too big for her and was not convenient to wear around the house. This sling seems to be a well-made quality product, but it is just not comfortable. I don't know if it is because I am a \"large\" woman, but it would just never fit the way it seemed it should as in the photos in the user guide. Baby's feet would get pinched in the bottom and after a while she would start to cry. Should have just got a wrap-type carrier.
B0019JF0T2 I bought this sling with the hopes of getting more done around the house. It is comfortable for me while wearing it definitely. My baby is not sure if she likes it though, sometimes she goes to sleep in it right away, and sometimes she cries and doesn't like it. It might just take a bit more time for her to get used to it. I like the ease of getting her in and out of it compared to wraps.
B0019JF0T2 Although it seems to be taking my baby some time to get used to it, I love the sling. It is so comfortable unlike some others. The Ergo one took way too long to put on every time, I just wanted something I could slip on and run out the door. This Balboa sling is perfect. My 2 month old had a meltdown the first couple of times we tried it out. So, I tried the cuddle hold and he was okay.
B0019JF0T2 This product is seriously better than I expected!  I love wearing it every day!  I had some help learning how to use it by watching the videos on Balboa Baby's website.  [...]I am so happy with this sling.  I will be buying it for my next baby shower :)
B0019JF0T2 I found this sling so incredibly uncomfortable.  I wore it for an hour with my 5 month old and had severe back pain afterwards.  I have tried a lot of slings, and I can't say that there are any worse than this.  The pocket is TOO deep and the baby gets lost in there (not safe) and the pulls on your shoulder so hard you have to lift up to get relief.  In my opinion it's unsafe and uncomfortable and very hard to adjust.  I returned mine after using it once.  I did like the padding on the shoulder, the pocket, and the color, but that's about it.
B0019JF0T2 I bought three different slings all in various price ranges and styles to figure out which one worked best for me and my baby.  This sling is very well made, the fabric feels great, but my baby just didn't love it.  I felt awkward wearing it, and it just wasn't the right match for my family.  I ended up loving the Ergo carrier and how versatile it is.  I ended up returning this sling, but it was probably more of a personal preference thing because the sling is really nice, it just wasn't right for me.
B0019JF0T2 I'm sure most new parents and parents-to-be have read or heard about the CPSC warnings regarding positional asphyxiation of babies in slings. This is precisely the type of sling they are warning about. This sling has a deep pouch that is not adjustable making it very difficult to correctly position a newborn or small baby.  A baby should always be able to be placed upright, tummy-to-tummy in a sling and should always be well above the wearer's bellybutton close enough to be kissed! I love wearing my baby, but always do so safely and would never purchase a sling like this. If you want to wear your baby in a sling, buy a good ring sling (like a Maya or Ellaroo) and makes sure to search for online resources on how to correctly position your child. Good ring slings have a shoulder that can be spread for the mother's comfort and have no elastic or gatherings on the rails that would make it hard to adjust the depth of the pouch (though they may have lightly padded rails for baby's comfort). Please buy a good, safe sling for your baby and take the time to learn to use it. These cheaper slings look inviting and some look easier to use, but they are dangerous and uncomfortable!
B0019JF0T2 This obviously works for some people.  Our baby hated it.  You might as well throw your kid in a gunny sack and throw that over your shoulder.  This has little to no support.  It is basically an oversized purse to put your kid in.  Bad idea.
B0019JF0T2 I absolutely LOVE this sling for our 4 month old daughter.  I agree with another poster that it is magic.  I put her in it and she calms INSTANTLY.  She loves to sit in it sideways w/ her head out like the picture shows when we go shopping so she can look around (or look out around the house for that matter).  She's as happy as a little lark in that thing! I get comments on it wherever I go. It's easy to put in a diaper bag to carry out and about too. Easy to transport, easy to use. LOVE THIS THING!!!  I wish I'd had it for my other children.
B0019JF0T2 I am just not a sling fan. I tried about every type of carrying device for my baby because she was so fussy. I got this because I read Dr. Sears fussy baby book. My baby was hyperalert from a very young age and by 3-4 months, I kid you not, she could get out of the sling, she would pull and rip at it and try to throw herself overboard. It was just not safe. Same thing with the Moby wrap(gift), it worked while she was younger, but not by the time she hit 3-4 months, which make these seem wasteful. Also with the recent stories of children getting positional asphyxia in these from their heads being in too tight of a c-shape, I am not sure they are worth it.I tried the baby bjorn (gift) also when she was small and she loved it, but by around 4 months she wanted to ride forward, and for some reason she did not like riding forward in the bjorn.I also tried and ultimately purchased an Ergo, that was the best fit for baby and me. She does ride forward but can easily turn to the side and see, she can also ride on the hip. When she gets bigger I can use it as a backpack and carry her on my back up to 40lbs. I did not buy the infant insert or use the ergo until she was about 4-5 months old. So I can't speak to how well that one works for small infants. I can say she is currently 7 months old and loves her ergo. I know I can't use the sling for her even now, because she will try to \"escape\" and fall out. She can't get out of the ergo even if something upsets her (tired, fussy, general baby meltdown) and when she does fall asleep her head rests on my chest in an upright position with a nice clear airway (unlike what was happening with some of those slings- although this sling was not specifically cited in the infant sling deaths at the time of this writing)The sling was well made with nice soft fabrics and had a little storage pouch that was big enough for a few dollars or a pacifier to be tucked into it.
B0019JF0T2 The material & design is great but I don't know how mothers use this comfortably w/a newborn who is basically flopping around all over w/o any neck support. It was also difficult to transfer my 1 month old out of the sling smoothly and into her crib while keeping her semi-asleep.
B0019JF0T2 I was desperate for a good sling or baby carrier. Had big hopes for this one since I love all things Sears. But this didn't work at all for us. My baby boy basically disappeared in it laying inside. Seemed dangerous to me as for head position and breathing.
B0019JF0T2 I loved this sling at first for my nb it was his favorite and it fit him better than the bijorn or Moby but then I found a maya wrap similar ring sling & it is much better. The ring sling carrier style is great bc it fits small babies and it is easy to breastfeed in while still being somewhat free to do things. The reason I think the Maya is better is because it is more adjustable allowing for a better and more secure fit the balboa requires always one hand be on baby because of the padded strap and elastic edges you can not get a truly custom fit to the position and size of baby. Also the strap on Maya is wider and more comfy.
B0019LLC9W We have been using these for a few months now.  I bought my first set at a big box store and loved them.  We had no issue with the durability of the spout.  I thought I would buy some replacements online from amazon.  The spout on the cup that amazon sells is awful (it's the same nuby no spill cup, same size, same everything - except the valve design).  The older version has an \"X\" on the silicone top to prevent too much vacuum/suction from building up.  It worked great.  This new model has a round valve in it's place, and it doesn't work at all to prevent too much of a vacuum from the suction building up in the cup.  The spout was completely inverted when I took it out of my daughters mouth and I has to loosen the top to get it to go back to normal.  I tried manually pushing the valve in, no luck. I took the top off and fiddled with the valve in hopes that it was just stuck together because it's new, no luck.  Not loving these, and will have to hunt for the older model.  Which also came with a handy cover, and these don't.
B0019LLC9W I have a 13 month old who was having trouble transitioning from bottle to sippy cup.  This is the only cup he will drink from.  And BPA free to boot.  These newer models are much better than the older version of the Nuby.  The inserts are smaller and stay in place much better when putting the top on the cup.  Very satisfied with this product.  Only wish the product was more readily available in the marketplace.  Could only get online.  Couldn't find it in grocery stores, target or walmart.
B0019LLC9W These are the first sippy cups that have worked out well for my son. He has always refused a bottle, so we started trying him on a sippy cup around 8 months. I bought the cups with the stoppers that prevent leaks, but he couldn't get the hang of sucking on the cup to drink from it. So, I would have to take the stopper out for him to drink from it, which always led to a mess.I haven't had any issues with the nipples on the cups, and we've only had very minor spills/leaks with the cups, which have usually come from my son biting the spout.The reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because the cup is so large that my son can't hold it on his own (he's 11 months now). He didn't have a problem with the cups with two side handles, but this cup is to large for him to easily hold and use at this point. I think that by the time he could hold it that he will have moved on to a more advanced cup.Pros: Dishwasher safeEasy for baby to get the hang ofMostly spill-proofCons: Hard for baby to handle on his own*Update 1/28/11* I think that my son just needed time to get used to the cup. He's now almost 13 months old and can handle it with one hand with no problems.
B0019LLC9W just got these cups yesterday and i love that they don't have valves. also the spout is very soft. my baby likes to chew on the spout because i imagine it feels good on his gums so im sure we will have to replace the spouts in the future.FYI- these are much cheaper at babies r us. i just paid $5 and some change for a 2 pack.
B0019LLC9W These lasted me about two months before my son chewed through the top piece which I wasn't upset about. They are so sturdy at first that my son couldn't get anything out of it and he would just scream in frustration. When he could actually get something out the nipple part would invert! Hate these.
B0019LLC9W I purchased these cups and after only a week they started leaking. I would not recommend these cups to anyone.
B0019LLC9W Our daughter had one of these bottles for two months, until she slammed it down on the floor during dinner one night, cracking the bottom, so we had to throw it away. I bought a bunch to replace it...it's worth it, to keep her happy! They're easy to clean, dishwasher-safe (top drawer), and small enough to pack into a diaper bag easily. Love them.
B0019LLC9W The things that make this sippy great are a nice ergonomic shape for little hands, a soft spout for teethers and it's easy to clean. The negative, that makes it a one star item, is that the cap pops off when dropped. On several occasions my one year old was walking around with this, dropped it on the floor and one side of the cap popped up. I've tried everything from putting it on barely snug to crazy tight but the cover still pops off, if it hits the floor at the right angle. I've found my toddler playing in a large puddle of water more than once. Makes it useless if I need to worry about the cover popping off from being dropped.
B0019LLC9W My son isn't too fond of these because the spout is made out of stiff plastic.  It is much better for older babies, not as a transition cup.  Otherwise, I think it is a great cup.  It doesn't leak at all and there are only two parts to clean in the dishwasher, which is so nice.
B0019LLC9W the cups are cute and easy to clean, but leak. after the child sucks on the spout a few times, the airseal doesn't allow airflow in the cup so the spout starts to invert into the cup. the air vent hole doesn't work properly and i have to continuously pinch the spout or unscrew and screw the lid back on so my daughter can continue to drink from it. the spout is somewhat leaky and messy too. i have to put a bib on her  so prevent a mess on her clothes with this cup. she's not a messy eater/drinker but the spout on this sippy cup just isn't designed well.
B0019LLC9W I didnt purchcase my cups from Amazon but since I am looking for replacement cups...I thought I should leave a message. I purchased the two pack of this Nuby no spill cup for my 13 month old at the time. It is now two months later I put milk in the cup and began shaking it to make sure it was warmed throughout that I notice milk dripping from the spout. These bottles do not leak so Iam thinking what is going on? well upon further inspection there was a slit in the spout and the bars inside of the spout were all broken! Had I not realized this my child could have swallowed the tip of this spout. I just wrote the company today and am waiting for a response. My daughter had silicone nipples that never tore and she has had teeth since she was 3 months old! Nice cup but the spout needs to be redesigned.
B0019LLC9W These are great sippy cups. They don't ever leak unless you have a biter. My first son was a biter, so I went through a lot of replacement spouts until he was old enough to drink from a hard topped cup. They are very easy for the smallest hands to hold and super easy to clean.
B0019LLC9W The old lids were good the new lids don't let enough air back into the cup so after child has sucked for a few seconds the spout inverts back into the cup.  You have to remove the lid, allow air back into the cup and the spout to return to normal position and then put the lid back on.  I have no idea why the company would change this.  I compared the old with the new and it is different.  They also drip so if they are not sitting upright, they will leak water.  The good is they are BPA free and easy to hold but I would look for another brand.
B0019LLC9W My daughter had really good luck with a Nuby cup that my nephew used to use, so I decided to buy more. The vent in the cap is a little different in the newer style, and for some reason that is making all the difference. With the older cup, she never has a problem with suction or leaking. With the newer cups we regularly have to take the cup from her and unscrew then rescrew the lid to break the seal she somehow formed, which is preventing the liquids from coming out. The new cups also tend to leak when she's using them. They don't SPILL; they leak. If she drops it on the floor I don't have to worry about the liquid running out, but I do have to keep wiping her face when she's drinking. Still a very good cup, and it's still one we use a lot, but I wish the vent was like the older cups.
B0019LLC9W My son very quickly learned to hold these upside down and press the soft spout against any flat surface. This caused liquid to run out, which he then smeared around. After he repeated this process for several days I was tired of cleanign up the mess and the spout finally acquired a little tear which caused liquid to leak out steadily. Switched to cups with straws. Would not buy again.
B0019LLC9W This is a soft tip to ween from bottles. My daughter eats through them after about 6 months. Great job at getting her from bottle to cup with no fussing.
B0019LLC9W These are my favorite for my 13 month old daughter. I think I have enough of these for 4 children. But you just never know when you might lose one here and there. They do not leak and are a great product.
B0019LLC9W I was really excited to try these new cups with my girls. The first day I noticed that they aren't spill-proof. If the child leaves the cup laying on it's side like many do, it leaks. My girls are also in the throwing phase. One toss off the high chair and each cup cracked up the side-not even at the seam. Would have hoped for better quality in a child's cup.
B0019LPAHC Great value for the price. Sturdy piece. Drawers have plenty of room. I was able to put wide baskets on the first level but nothing too tall.The color is darker in person (see matching dresser listing for a better idea). It was also a little more complicated to assemble than the dresser. The directions are some of the worst we have seen.Overall, very happy with the purchase.
B0019LPAHC We ordered this despite all the reviews saying that it is impossible to assemble.I didn't think it was much more difficult than any other IKEA style furniture that I have built. Some things were a little difficult to understand in the manual, because like IKEA, the instructions only use pictures without text.There is a small plastic piece that comes with it, and the picture in the instructions have a picture of a hammer. It took a little figuring out before we realized that you use that piece to hammer the other piece into the wood so you don't damage the plastic. Quite well thought out.There were two problems we encountered in building this changing table, however.1. The top table surface was cracked on one corner. I have taken photos of it and will be writing the manufacturer to get a replacement part.2. There did not seem to be enough screws for the drawer guide rails. Although the instruction manual only said to use two screws, the guide rail had 4 screw holes. It doesn't make sense to leave those out, but I guess it was planned that way (probably saves the company a couple cents).Overall, the unit seems well built for what we expected. It's not an heirloom piece by any means, but it is as well built, maybe slightly higher quality, than your average IKEA unit. For the price, it's hard to beat.
B0019LPAHC I am a grandma to my 2 1/2 year old grandson.  I will be babysitting him daily, so I decorated a nursery for him.  I spent alot of money on the crib and the other nursery items, but decided not to spend a bunch on the changing table.Pros.....The table matches the cherry crib perfectly. My grandson already weighs 15 pounds, the table is sturdy enough to hold him at this weight and I am sure it will continue to support his weight as he grows.  In the opening above the drawers, I purchased 3 baskets to hold some of his little items, socks, bibs, changing table sheets, etc. and this works great because it offers additional storage.For the price, this is an excellent product and I do recommend, if you are on a budget like I was.
B0019LPAHC I opened the box and found that this piece of furniture is all fiberboard. Other than that, it's a great little changing table for the price, the only problem was when it got couple drops of water the drawer got ruined. Keep all water away from this furniture.
B0019LPAHC It is very sturdy! My son loves to roll and roll when you are changing him or after his bath. And the South Shore changing table doesn't wobble. My husband put it together in no time at all. I looks great. The drawers are solid. There were some scraps on the pieces when coming out of the box, but the pen provided covered them up very well, or they were hidden after construction. I would recommend this to anyone. We had to replace a hand me down, and we made the right choice.
B0019LPAHC we absolutely LOVE this changing table.  Its sturdy and just plain PERFECT. i love the drawer and shelf space underneath and i love the fact that my little angel can kick her feet and wiggle all she wants and i have no fear that the table will fall apart. it's just really nicely made and the wood is not fake wood, its REAL wood and although it cost a little more than i wanted to pay, its well worth every dime. the only thing i don't like is that it doesn't match my other furniture. but that's not the manufacturers fault. i took a chance and lost. it doesn't look bad, its just not the exact same color, just a tad bit lighter than her other furniture.  oh and it came in 8 million pieces. It took hubby FOREVER to put it together. hours and hours...ridiculous, but again, it was worth it because we love it!!
B0019LPAHC I was nervous about buying this based on others reviews, but I am glad I bought it. No, it's not the highest of quality...but once put together it was very sturdy and I have no reservations about putting our newborn on it. I tried putting it together myself (while my husband was busy with other things), but ended up needed a little extra muscles for help. I was so pleased that no pieces were missing, which tends to be a theme with assemble-yourself items. Overall I was very happy with the product. Nothing somthing our kid will grow up using...but serves its purpose for a changing table.
B0019LPAHC I purchased this item for my daughters nursery. It is by far the most used piece of furniture for her first 7 weeks here. Definitely a great buy for the price.
B0019LPAHC It's beautiful and arrived in perfect condition. My husband had this put together in an hour. The drawers are deep, the finish is beautiful and it's very sturdy! I would buy this again any day! I am 5'6 and the changing tables height fits me perfectly for changing our little one.
B0019LWEOY This was fine for my son. But my 6 mo daughter got this caught around her neck last night. She is a scooter, not a roller, and she must have moved and pushed up into it. Thank god for video cameras, because I heard her cry and was able to see what happened at 4:30 am! I took it off and will throw it out. Be wary of what you put in your crib!
B0019LWEOY My husband had a daughter that died from SIDS, so I did tons of research and reading before deciding to go with these bumpers vs. the traditional bumpers which may pose a suffocation/rebreathing hazard. I love this crib bumper because it allows me to see/check on my child during the night (his crib is next to our bed)without having to stand over the crib to check, the firm triangle-shaped wedge doesn't cover his breathing, it is super easy to just take out when you change the crib sheet, the foam is odorless/CFC-free, the slipcovers are organic cotton and completely washable, AND his binky no longer falls out onto the floor during the night! It also keeps my son from bumping his head into the wooden slats. It is pretty easy to put together...all it involves is slipping the foam pieces into the covers the correct way. I love the simplicity, functionality, and innovative design of this crib bumper.The thing I don't like about this crib bumper is the price! For some foam pieces and fabric, it's a little pricey but you might be able to find them on sale as I did. I would still absolutely recommend this product to others and still give it five stars!
B0019LWEOY So much better then the regualar bumper pads, So much safer and still protects the baby from banging its head on the crib. I LOVE IT!
B0019LWEOY We love it enough to buy another for baby no. 2 due later this year. The traditional bumper obliterated my view from the doorway and I didn't like to think that baby couldn't see out either. This was perfect for them to see out, for us to see them and it kept toys and paci's inside the crib too.The cover is easy to wash and I suppose I can concede that it's a pain to put all the foam inserts back in, but not so bad I would lower stars. We love this product!!
B0019LWEOY This bumper does not keep your child from putting his/her legs or arms outside of the crib.  It does keep your child from getting stuck when they do it.  My son can not get under it either!  With traditional bumpers he was going over or under them to get at the bars and getting stuck every day.  Not anymore!
B0019LWEOY Yes this product IS a bit on the expensive side considering you're only paying for some cloth and foam, but I absolutely love it compared to the traditional type of crib bumpers and am glad we got it.What I love most is being able to see my daughter laying in her crib the moment I look in the room, and not having to walk up to her crib to be able to see her.  Also it allows her to see out of the crib better and to see me near her, much easier than the taller fabric crib bumpers.
B0019LWEOY When the box came I opened it to find two fabric pieces, and many small segments of foam. The directions say to wash the cover for the best fit. I thought that this might be a bogus suggestion (you usually can't return a product once it has been washed). So, I took a chance. It doesn't prevent my son from sticking his feet though the bars, but that is really not a problem while he is asleep.I love that I can see my son from across the room without having to walk over to the crib.  Changing sheets is also easier than with a traditional bumper.
B0019LWEOY We bought this when my son started rolling around in the crib alot and banging his head on the sides (about 7 months).  We haven't heard him smack his little head against the rails since we installed it, and we feel so much better. It's made of fabric-covered hard foam, so it doesn't seem like a suffocation risk. It ties onto the crib sides, and it is GREAT at keeping his pacifiers in the crib at night.  IF we didn't have this, we would be pulling out the crib and fishing for pacifiers on the floor in the middle of the night! It also provides just enough of a \"wall\" so that he doesn't kick his feet through the slats & get them caught.
B0019LX628 This crib bedding set really exceeded my expectations. It's by far the softest and most well-made set that I found after months of searching. I'm shocked by how many other sets are scratchy and cheaply made. Not this one though, it's great quality but at the same price as most other sets. There are a ton of other fun accessories available in the line, which makes decorating your nursery a lot of fun.
B0019LX628 I looked for months for a good quality, good looking, yet affordable crib set. I still don't like the fact that I paid this much but compared to other sets, this was one of the best options. I bought this for my daughter because it is perfect for a boy or girl. I didn't want too many \"girly\" frills and this was perfect. Besides the look of the set, it is also a good quality made product. My baby deserves the best so that's what she got :)
B0019LX628 This set is exactly what I wanted.  I was hesitant because of the price but when I received it I was completely satisfied as the quality was more than I expected.  I have bought other items for the nursery and had no problems because of the variety of colors in this bedding set.  The only disappointing part was when I looked at the price today...the price went down.
B0019LX628 This has got to be the cutest bedding set I've ever seen!I put this set on an online baby registry for myself and my mom ended up ordering it for me. When I actually received it, I was even more amazed because not only is it cuter in person, but the materials and quality are just amazing! Amazon is offering it for an unbeatable price too! (Wish I would've known that months ago).I have a two month old son and my sister is pregnant with a little girl. My sister and I have been searching for sets for a girl, and even though this set is pretty neutral, I haven't seen any patterns for girls I like better either.And this set comes with everything you need to deck out the nursery. I also ended up ordering the matching wall hangings, blanket, monkey stuffed animal, and mobile. I love this whole set. Best I've seen yet!
B0019LX628 I honestly wish it were also sold in pieces. I purchased this for my baby boy. It was quite the trial picking one out. Every time I chose a set for a boy it would be discontinued. I actually had this problem a lot for everything just about that I picked out for a boy. The sheet is as soft as some of the others that I have purchased, also it doesn't fit my mattress very well. It is a bit too tight, and it can't be my mattress, because the others fit perfectly. The bumper doesn't fit perfectly, I would have liked it if there more than just the end ties on the side panels. Also, I have never used the diaper holder, not even as decoration. I did purchase several of the accompanying pieces, such as the lamp, border, decals and mobile. I do not recommend the mobile. I ended up ordering another that was battery operated and plays for twenty minutes. The reason I give it 3 stars is I don't use all of the bag set and would have preferred to purchase the items I wanted/ needed separately. Value wise it wasn't the best for me, but the quality, with exception to the sheet, is 5 stars.
B0019LX628 I saw this online at Babies \"R\" Us and fell in love with it (I ended up buying it from [...] for a much cheaper price than BRU). I was hesitant to buy it without seeing it person but decided to take a chance. The bedding set looks even better in person, the colors are so rich and the fabric is super soft. Each of the animal faces on the comforter and the bumpers are made of different textured fabric which my son loves to stare at and touch.  I have washed the set many times and it has held up beautifully.
B0019LX628 My daughter was 8 months before we ended up buying this, we moved and I just couldn't find one that I really loved, and I'm SO happy that I waited. Because it's gender neutral we can use it for the next baby when she'll be in her no doubt girly stage but right now she LOVES the different animals. She's learning them when every night we point out different ones and say the name of them. Not to mention this material is the BEST. I am so surprised at the quality of every part of this set. Even the valance has the different textures. The best part is it holds up in the wash. My daughter was sick awhile back and got green snot all over the comforter. I was so worried about washing it but figured it would have happened sometime so I sprayed it with stain remover and washed it cold then dried it low. It didn't unravel or ruin any part of it! Great buy, you won't find anything better!
B0019LX628 The quality is good, the set is beautiful. I wish I could have ordered the items separate since I don't use the bumper (they are not even safe, I got the breathable one), i barely use the diaper thing, it's there just for decoration. I use the quilt to put my baby on it on the floor and play. My baby's room is beautiful and I love the Nojo jungle Tales set
B0019LX628 I love this set, and I was so happy to find it on amazon.com for cheaper than I could buy it in the stores.  I think it is simple and looks great.  I also love the color pattern!
B0019LX628 This set feels and looks fantastic. I am really impressed at the quality and detail that you get for the price. My only complaint would be that the bumper ties are a little too short.
B0019QCGVK grandson really likes during the teething times,washes well and drys fast
B0019QCGVK My son is now almost 10 months and doesn't play with this toy as much, but when he was 4 months, this was his #1! It is about the size of a washcloth, so don't be mistaken that it's a blanket, it is just cloth material so that's why it's called that. He loved all of the colors & noises it makes! His favorite was the dark blue rubber corner of the star - he is always chewing on everything (he had 2 teeth at 3 months) so this toy was perfect. This toy was always perfect for playing peek-a-boo also! The zebra corner crinkles, and that always seemed to catch his attention.The one negative: The red corner is a squeaker. I've had to wash this toy numerous times (due to him spitting up on it, or just getting gross from him sucking on it) and after about the 3rd time, the squeaker stopped working. It's not a huge deal, consitering when my son learned how to squeak it, the dog went nuts :) Overall, it's a great toy, and will definitely be passed on to our next child! Highly recommend!
B0019QCGVK This is a hit with my baby. I hang it from her gym and she will play with it for a good while on her own. She likes to chew on the blue, and loves the crinkle.
B0019QCGVK I purchased this for my son when he was two and a half months old- he never showed much, if any, interest in it.
B0019QCGVK He likes the drinking sound and likes to chew on the yellow corner of the star it's many colors that are different textures
B0019QCGVK I purchased this toy for my six month old two months ago--she still has not shown much interest in it, and much prefers her various rattles and other teething toys.  I think different babies have different toy 'interests'-so if your baby loves softer teethers and blankets this might be the one.  It does have very nice colors and textures for the baby to play with.  If like mine they prefer rubber or plastic toys, sounds and activities, then this toy may go unused.  Also, while it is called a teething 'blanket', be aware that it is not large enough to use as a blanket-more a lovey size item.
B0019QCGVK My grandson quickly took to the Star teething blanket. The different textures on the points my six month old grandson found interesting right away. When I found out he was teething I told his Dad to dampen the cloth and put it In the freezers.Within a few minutes it was perfect, he loved it. It has been two months it cleans up well and he continues to love holding it,  squishing it. Glad I purchased it.
B0019QCGVK This was my son's favorite but not for the teething aspect but for the textures that he could feel for his mouth,
B0019QCGVK This toy is great - not only for teething but for distracting my son when he's fussy.  The crinkly aspect catches his attention, and he can grab it with his little hands and be entertained for...well, minutes.
B0019QCGVK This was one of the first things my baby would hold and &#34;play&#34; with. He did chew on the teethers but the crinkling of the blanket was by far his favorite thing about it! Washes well (we always air-dried). We will be bringing this back out soon for baby #2 due in 8 weeks.
B0019QCGVK My son (3 months) loves this blanket.  He chews on it, crinkles it in his hand 
B0019QCGVK I think it's the rattling sound from the center star that scares him.  He picks it up and throws it out of his crib quickly.  Other than that, it does look and feel ok to me as the teether. but kinda useless now.
B0019QCGVK My little guy loves this!  It's easy for him to hold on to, so he was able to start &#34;playing&#34; with it as soon as he was beginning to grasp things. He seems to like the crinkle sounds it makes when he grabs it.  Great for teething- he can chew on it anywhere and it soaks up the drool.  Highly recommended!
B0019QCGVK I don't know how something as simple as a colorful crinkly piece of cloth can make a baby so happy. He simply loves this thing! He can literally lay for an hour, just stare into space and crinkle on his new blanky. I am very happy with the purchase. Well made, fun, and most of all - baby-approved!
B0019QCGVK We use this to keep our son focused during mealtime. We crinkle &#34;star buddy&#34; up so you can't see the face (he's sitting in the bumbo facing us on the kitchen island) and snap stretch the star out so he gets surprised and sees his buddy. This has been the activity that recenters our son back to eating and refocusing.. and for having a good laugh.. for longer than any other toy we have (aside from the sleeping friends). I'm shocked actually. He also enjoys eating the edges. Not really so much into the textures, but does enjoy turning star buddy around and eating the different materials.
B0019QCGVK We bought this when baby girl started to teethe (at about 3 1/2 months). She's never really used this (we call it her starfish) as a teether, but loves it anyway. The starfish comes everywhere with us. Anytime baby girl (now 5 months) is in her carseat, starfish is too. I think the crinkle sound is what she likes so much about it. As a mom, I like that it's easy for baby girl to hold onto and easy for me to stick just about anywhere when she doesn't want to. And of course, it's machine washable - essential for something that goes as many places as starfish does.
B0019QCGVK I have every teething toy... I have bought dozens. Literally.  And finally my baby boy enjoys this one, right out of the package!  HOORAY!
B0019QCGVK I like it, because he likes it.I didn't realize how large it was going to be when I ordered it.  I expected baby washcloth size, and it's more like a dinner plate size.  It folds down/crushes easily, though, so this doesn't interfere with stuffing it in a pocket or diaper bag.  The bright colors make it easy to spot, too.This toy is all about the interesting textures.  Terrycloth, embroidered satin, slippery satin, bumpy corduroy, scritchy broadcloth, smooth velour, piping... The firm rubbery star point is interesting sometimes, chewing on the squeaky point is definitely drool worthy (though unsqueakable for my 5 month old).  The definite highlight for this one though is the crinkle.  OH! how this child loves the crinkle.  It is such an easy thing for him to do, to control, to learn what effects he can cause.  There are two types of crinkle. Subtler crinkle in the body of the green part, and stiffer/louder crinkle in the corduroy star point.  This has been a good, age appropriate purchase.  He's 5 months old now, has had interest in it for about 2 months now.
B0019QCGVK My 4 month old nephew LOVES this thing.  He always has it in his mouth.  And I just found out it has a squeaker in the orange section of the star.
B0019QCGVK This is, hands down, my son's most favorite toy! He loves the crinkle sound, it's really easy for him to grab and pick up, it's got lots of different textures, and he can chew on it when he feels like it. His face lights up every time he sees it! Best purchase we've made!
B0019QCGVK I bought this for my son who is three months old because he is already teething. He has turned down most of the teething toys we have already given him, but this has gone off without a hitch. He LOVES the noises it makes and loves grabbing onto it and playing with it. He squeals in excitement when he is playing with it. I picked a winner and definitely recommended to other moms! I did, however, take the plastic green thing that it came with off (you can see it in some pictures here), it can be used to hang it up but I just don't feel safe letting my three month old play with it. Anyway, the rest of the blankie is amazing.
B0019QCGVK This blanket was bigger than I thought. It was a great idea to have each corner do something different and keep my baby entertained. He likes the feel of it and like that it's big enough to play peekaboo with.
B0019QCGVK Such bright colors with a happy star face on this soft blanket. It is a nice hand held size for baby and washes well.
B0019QCGVK I didn't look at the dimensions of the toy, so when it arrived I was surprised at the size. Large washcloth is a good comparison.
B0019QCGVK Cute blanket, great materials. The green center is a terry cloth material which is great for soaking up the drool that goes with teething. Not shown in the picture is a green ring attachment that goes through the purple corner. The ring itself isn't great, the opening is too large to keep it attatched, but it was easily swapped out with another ring link. I liked having the option to attach it to the carseat or stroller so it wasn't dropped though.
B0019QCGVK My baby loves the crinkle, the different colors, and all the different textures of this little toy.  I love that I can throw it in the wash with his clothes after he's slimed it with drool!
B0019QCGVK My son loves this, it makes noise and it helps his gums while teething. No doubt a great buy, Thank you
B0019QCGVK I bought this for my then 4-mo. old to grow into.  He had already been long fascinated with blankets and pulling them over his face or trying to chew them.  He got his teeth in fairly early so I thought he'd get a lot of use from this.  In actuality, he didn't play with it to teeth on but he did like the crinkly texture of the star and the noises.  All in all, it was a good purchase but not a favorite toy or anything.  It was a little bigger in size than I expected which was cool - it made it more floppy and interesting for him.
B0019QCGVK My grandaughter is 5 months old and has been suffering from extreme teething pain. This item is a great distraction for her and the edge of each point on the star supplies a different sensation for her aching gums. When she squeezes the star to pull it to her mouth it makes a crinkling and crunching sound which also intrigues her. I would recommend this item as a teething toy and activity item.
B0019QCGVK The stuff in the center of the toy bunches when you wash it. It's really kind of cheap, but she still likes it ok...
B0019QCGVK This thing is too big for small babies (mine is 5 months old) I thought it would be something small that they could hold and fit in their mouth but its really large. The blue rubber piece in one corner is about 4.5&#34; x 3&#34; which is way too big for a baby. Maybe this would be better for a toddler but then I dont see why an older child would need this. Im returning it.
B0019QCGVK My little guy loved this blanket when he was little- although I would hesitate to call it a blanket.  It's the size of a large washcloth.  It has crinkly material inside which is fun- and one of the points of the star squeaks which he loved.  I would buy this again!
B0019QCGVK 3mo LOVES his star. It's perfect in the car, where I can't reach around to pick up a thrown toy. He happily crunches it up between his hands and sucks on whatever corner he can grab. Great purchase, although I bought in 2012 and the manufactured date on the product is 2009.
B0019QCGVK This is one of those toys that is a must for teething babies! Has Five different textures on each corner to chew on and has a papery kind of feeling to center that fascinates babies with it's sound and feel. My 6 month old granddaughter loves hers!
B0019QCGVK My baby likes to chew on little towel, and this is more interesting than that.The thing I really love for this blanket is it is really soft. So that's one of the few things I feel safe to leave the baby alone while I am driving alone. Also, I feel safe to leave this with him when put him down to his crib, after he can stand. Especially at the beginning, he stand up, and suddenly just dropped himself to the crib, I want some really soft toy  to make sure he won't bump his head.Also for a teething baby, if I forget his bib, this is the bib.The attached loop is a good feature makes it easy to hook on shopping cart cover, car seat, etc.
B0019QCGVK Teething blankets are new to me...O.K. it's not blanket size, but it is baby, toddler size.  It crinkles it absorbs slobbers it has teething corners...it works!
B0019QCGVK Mommy loves this star just as much as baby!  I like how each point is something different....the orange one that squeaks is the favorite!
B0019QCGVK My baby likes to play with fabric. She watches me intently when I am folding laundry and tries to grab the clothes in her reach and likes to chew on them. So, I got her this teething toy. She absolutely loves playing with it. Each of the triangle has a different kind of fabric and texture that she loves. The colors are attractive and the middle yellow portion is absorbent enough to handle drooling. There is also a rubbery end that is helpful when her gums hurt from teething pain.It also makes scrunching noises that keeps the baby engaged. This toy has provided hours of entertainment and teething pain relief.
B0019QCGVK I bought this blanket for my 4 month old when she had teething symptoms but was not able to hold onto teethers. She liked the blanket right away. She bites on only the blue rubber corner and doesn't use it while teething but she likes playing with it and the blanket keeps her busy.The blanket has a dark blue textured rubber corner..There is a red corduroy corner which squeaks when pressed.The corner with zebra pattern crinkles.The other two corner has a silky-satin feel. Among these the corner with multicolor has a slit and comes with a link to hang the blanket onto something. I used to attach the blanket to my baby's bouncer seat before but now that she is older she can find it on her own.The center green star part also crinkles.It is a good addition to her toys. I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because it is supposed to be a teething blanket but my baby did not find comfort biting on any of the corners while teething. If you are looking for something just for teething, my recommendation would be to try 'vullie sophie the giraffe'. I came to know of it after wasting a lot of money on teethers and that is by far the best. However, if you would like something to teach your baby different textures and have fun with bright colors,this is the blanket for you.Hope this helps :)
B0019QCGVK I bought this for my nephew when he was 5 months old and the reason I bought it is because he started teething. This toy is described to help with teething, hence the purchase.Although this isn't his favorite toy, I'm giving this toy 5-stars because it's doing what is described plus seems to be beneficial to him. It's mentally stimulating to the him (colors, textures, sounds via crinkle). When you dangle it in front of him, he'll smile and grab it. Plus the fact that it's machine washable makes it a plus (because we all know that babies drop stuff).Couldn't be happier with it.
B0019QCGVK My son loves this teething blanket and uses it all the time.  The edges are all different and the sounds the blanket makes really interest him.
B0019QCGVK I bought two of these from a different online store, and my daughter really likes them. She's too small to work the squeaker toy, but it sure gets her attention when mommy or daddy does it. They fit in the diaper bag wonderfully. Clean up is easy - just chuck it into the washer. The terry star is great for absorbing drool. I'd buy again.I took away one star because it does fall off the ring sometimes. I just switched it to a different, less flexible ring, and have had no problems.
B0019QCGVK I was a little upset at first, the product description says \"blanket\" but its really the size of a wash cloth!!! But my 5 month old loves playing with this teething toy.
B0019QCGVK This is a fun little toy/teether.The krinkle sounds keeps my grandson going back for this toy.It came with a little teething ring that he realy seems to like to chew on.
B0019QCGVK This is not my sons favorite teether, and he is the kind of baby that loves teethers. He likes the blue rubber part but that is about all and gets bored with it easily.
B0019QCGVK It washable and has different textures and sounds.  It is soft and easy to grab with those little fingers.  Also they can grab it and it doesn't knock them out.  It's very light weight so they all seem to love it.
B0019QCGVK Does the job...... but made in China.
B0019QCGVK We bought the Teething Blanket as a present for our 5 month old grandson. It is very well made and includes a variety of textures, colors and corners for those curious hands and mouths.  Highly recommend and would definitely buy again as a present for teething youngsters.
B0019QCGVK I got this for my niece as part of her Christmas present.  She loved it and was perfect because it had so many different textures for her to experiment on!
B0019QCGVK I tried various teething toys for my baby - highly rated ones.  However, this tops them all.  If you are not sure what to buy as the first teething toy - this will be a good one for babies 3 months above.  The other teething toys are hard for baby to hold.  This teething (mini) blanket is very well designed - can be used as a toy (different texture at each corner), or teething toy (for biting).  My only comment - as you open the package - you would first need to remove the \"attachment plastic ring\" - it is not small but it might become a hazard to the child - it is attached to the blanket by one of those white strip tag - meant for removal so that you can attach the mini blanket to any stroller bar etc (one of the edge of the stars has a small button hole to put in the attachment ring).  Also, remember to wash it first in a pillow case.  I threw mine in the dryer (low heat) as well. Overall - rated 5 stars for performance and quality !
B0019QCGVK I got this for our 3 month old son. He does enjoy it because the tissue like paper inside makes noise. However, the ends that are designed for teething are too big for his mouth so it doesn't exactly serve it's purpose for us. I think when he's a bit older it will be much better for him. But I love that I can just toss in the laundry and clean it!
B0019QCGVK My 5-month-old loves this toy! She is fascinated by all of the different textures. We love that it has no BPA, phthalates, or PVC, and it is machine washable. Highly recommend!
B0019QCGVK I was a bit skeptical about this toy for my daughter, but I am so glad I bought it! She squeals and reaches for it when I show it to her. She loves the crinkle sound that it makes and she loves to chew on the zebra striped crinkle corner of the star.To clean it, I hand wash it with mild soap and warm water. My daughter just loves this toy and I am so glad that I bought it! I would recommend this to anyone with a young child! (It also depends on the baby... Not all babies are the same.
