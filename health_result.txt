B0016NHN82 quality is not good, it had a little hole on it and I just unpacked in the the bathroom and use it right it way there.
B0017AE3BO We purchased this for our newborn and have used it for almost two years now. The dispenser is easy to access for an adult and holds a lot of soap, which means no frequent refills. The brush side was nice to use in her hair when she was little, though her hair is much too thick for it now. The sponge side works okay, but seemed as though it didn't dispense enough soap. You need to be careful how you store it when it is full or the soap will leak out-- there is a printed reminder on the brush that tells you what end is up. It was good for what we needed, but not really necessary.
B0017AE3BO Hands down, the gentlest but strongest brush around to prevent cradle cap.The bristles are thick but soft. The sponge part stinks though. You are better off just lathering the baby's head and then just using the bristle part. Sponge is too messy because you have to fill the body of the brush with shampoo to get it to work and it leaks everywhere if you do.
B0017AE3BO I love using this brush/sponge to shampoo my daughter's hair and her little hands and feet. If you rub the sponge too much it starts to peel off--we've already replaced ours once and my baby is only 6 months old. But, we bought it again because I couldn't find anything better, and now I know to be more gentle with it. Good, cheap buy!
B0017AE3BO It is very convenient.  The shampoo dispenser is awesome.  You fon't use a lot of shampoo, and the brush at the end is soft to wash my infant's hair.  The only inconvenience was the dispenser button.  It does not tell the amount of shampoo dispensed;  however, once you start using it, you will know.
B0017AE3BO I got this cause my baby has cradle cap, it really works the brush is just the perfect size and strenght for a baby I was able to used it on the dry hair to loose the flakes first, worked great. I was not worry too much about the dispenser wich it did not work very well with me, but I think is because of the consistency of the special shampoo I used for craddle cap wich is kind of heavy liquid, so it was taking too long for the dispenser to work and with a wet baby in the tub that moves a LOT you want to be quick I just used the shampoo as it is and the brush and I really liked it, I honestly recomend this one cause I also used the little sponge to bath my baby : )
B0017AE3BO I love this brush.  I love that it dispenses shampoo/body wash, I love the shape, I love that it is a sponge and a scrubber all in one.  However, they are not durable at all.  I've gone through 2 in 3 months (I bathe my son every 2 days).  I first thought that maybe I got a lemon, but the same thing happened to the second brush I ordered. The sponge is glued on and starts to slowly detach until the product becomes unusable.  I really wish they would figure out how to make it more durable because having it fall apart after 15-20 uses is unacceptable.
B0017AE3BO The brush I use in the bath, really just because I like to see her hair all brushed and her scalp stimulated, but it is useless otherwise. It is not good for skin, and the sponge side is not maneuverable enough to use in her crevases. I use a washcloth or my hands for most of her bathing. It would probably be more interesting if a baby has a lot of hair.
B0017LCZEU These were great and just what I had been looking for.  I've seen it since in stores for similar price but I was many, many months pregnant at the time I bought.  Much more convenient to order from Amazon. I was able to get 2 molds from it. Highly recommend.
B0017T4PXG This is one of the best presents we recieved at our shower.  I love that you can remove the dividers to make different size bottles fit.  I would highly reccomend purchasing this product.
B00186ZQUO I like this product because it heats very quickly.  Yes, the beep is quite loud, especially in the middle of the night.  (Fortunately, we didn't have many middle of the night bottles since nursing was an option as long as I was home.)  It does get scale in the bottom, even when using filtered water, but there are cleaning instructions that worked well.  My biggest concern was it sometimes worked too well.  As long as you are responsible and test the food or liquid before giving it to baby, the only problem is waiting for things to cool.The other warning concerns bottles.  Some bottles will melt under the heat of this tool.  ThesePlaytex 3 Pack Baby Drop Ins Nurser Holder 4 Ounce, Colors May Varymelted.  ThesePlaytex Drop-Ins Original BPA Free Nurser Newborn Starter Setdidn't.
B00186ZQUO We have had this bottle warmer for a week or two, and are very pleased with it.  I read other reviews on Amazon before purchasing it, and despite the variability of the reviews, got it and am happy that I did.I don't get overly concerned about how hot versus warm versus \"not cold\" it makes the bottle. We are giving our daughter both pumped breastmilk and formula, and I wanted something faster than microwaving water and the setting the breastmilk in it for 3-5 minutes to warm it and re-suspend the fat of the milk. My goal is that it's not refrigerator cold when I give it to my daughter, although she will take a straight from the fridge bottle of formula when she's really hungry.I selected this warmer to purchase because of all of the ones I looked at, this one was the fastest - shortest time it advertises is 90 seconds, versus 5+ minutes for some other brands.  I purchased it from Amazon because of the great price (and we have Prime so fast & free shipping).As other reviews have said, the beeping is loud.  It doesn't really bother me, nor does it seem to bother her.I have used the pacifier sanitizing feature - I do like that option as my daughter has a talent for spitting her pacifiers pretty far when she is done with them.I will say -- we use the Playtex Ventaire Bottles for formula.  These bottles have a large plastic disk at the bottom (for the air vent) and the disk does get quite hot from the warmer, even when the milk is just warm.  However, since I am wiping the steam off of the bottle with a towel/paper towel anyways, I just avoid handling the very bottom of the bottle and it cools very quickly.  We don't have this issue with the breastmilk in the plastic Medela bottles, as they have plain/normal bottoms.We have not had to descale the warmer yet, but I read the instructions and the vinegar/water rinse seems quite simple.Overall, for what I paid, I got exactly what I expected and I am very happy with the performance of the warmer.
B00186ZQUO After reading all the reviews, I decided to try the product anyway. The sound of the beep doesn't bother me at all, but then again my bedroom is fairly removed from the kitchen. The problem I have with this product is that it really overheats the bottle! Even though I followed the guidelines and instructions, the milk was always waaay too hot, and I ended up needing to cool it on ice.  In other words, it would have taken just as much time to just float the bottle in a thermos of hot water. I wouldn't recommend this product to anyone.
B00186ZQUO Pretty good.We use this product daily and it helps a lot in warming the milk. Really helpful. Thank you!
B00186ZQUO I absolutely love this bottle warmer, it is simple to use and very fast! I have three of these, one at home, one at work and another at our summer cabin. As a user of ready to feed formula, this makes heating up refrigerated formula a snap. Sure the alarm is loud but it doesn't bother me at all. If I'm awake and using the warmer, you can bet that my baby is awake too. The little sanitizing basket is a great addition and fits two pacifiers with no problem. As a warning, this thing generates a lot of steam. Do not make the mistake of sticking your hand into the steam before the alarm beeps or you will get burned. It's a common sense thing that is easy to forget when you're dead tired and warming up formula half asleep in the middle of the night :)
B00186ZQUO This item works inconsistently.When i first got it i tested the water setting to see what i needed for my bottles.It warmed properly 2 times after that, but then the 3rd time did not heat all the way up.I increased the amount of water used to \"Steam\" the bottle.  It worked about 2 more times then again, then did not heat the bottle.This pattern kept going until i needed more then the \"measuring\" container held to heat a 3 oz bottle.  I don't want to know what it would take to heat an 8 oz bottle!Baby is waiting to eat impatiently while i steam and re steam a bottle, never knowing how much water to put in because it changes / increases with use of the product.This is a problem because the safety feature on the product does not allow you to steam a 2nd time without the unit first cooling down, which takes at least 4-5 minutes.I do not recommend.
B00186ZQUO Ive had mine for a year now & stil using it & loving it. Fast & easy way to thaw frozen milk & chilled milk.
B0018EFGGU But a real pain in the you-know-what to clean. However, like I said, this was the only alternative to a bottle out of which we were able to get our kids to drink their formula. For that, I am very thankful!
B0018EFGGU I ordered extra spouts b/c my teething 15 month old likes to chew on them to help the pains in her teeth and I discovered real fast that she was wearing them out real fast. At least you don't have to buy a whole new cup!
B0018EHTH4 Hated this one. Impossible to open and the handle is too thick.  They are all a pain to clean, but this one is worse because opening it is so hard to do. Not a fan.
B000RYPZQ8 WONDERFUL TO USE WITH THE SUPPORT HANDLES ON EACH SIDE AND THE PADS KEEP MY KNEES FROM HEARTING AND EASY TO LIFT MYSELF UP.
B000BNSYHW Clean really good of prints and smell very nice. My first time using it but like it alot since it works good."
B000CCJP4I the effect it self is fine, but it is too noisy even though u don't dime it, for the price, and for this product, it is u get what u pay for."
B000CD1R7K I like this product, but wish it had a wider foot or base to it for carpeted areas, it does get a little unstable on carpet.  Does fine on hard floors."
B000EEHJS8 I purchased this wax for a brand new guitar to help minimize scratches on the back though I make every effort to avoid them, and to protect the side where I rest my arm when playing to keep from wearing through the finish over time.I've used Carnuba car wax many years ago, and this is a much higher grade, easier to apply, easy to remove.There were some really tiny cracks in the polyurethane finish that I did not notice at first and I was actually able to fill them using a couple of coats of this product so they now look like tiny indentations with a smooth surface. They were very minor and did not affect the wood, but this will seal them. Not a sufficient defect to return the instrument.Another reviewer mentioned a problem applying to metal. I have open tuning machines, and before applying Tri-Flow with a pinpoint applicator, I used this wax, let it dry then buffed it out with a pure cotton towel. The chrome is gleaming. They're really beautiful. Did a great job on the headstock as well with MOP and abalone inlay when the strings were removed. Also got the tuning pegs. This is a 000 - OM acoustic. Only way I can imagine harming metal is you slightly dampen the sponge, (I used distilled water) so if someone left too much water - possibly a problem, but all worked fine for me."
B000EEHJS8 This stuff works amazingly. If your interested in buying the product, don't listen to the people who say it is too dry. I thought it worked good, and mine was a bit dry. This stuff isn't supposed to be really waxy, its a hard wax so I would think it was supposed to be cracked. Mine wasn't that cracked, and it worked great! I love this product and would definitely recommend it and say this is a must-have."
B000EEJAWQ A bit invasive and awkward.  I like another brand more because they feel a little more solid..  These feel a bit weak."
B000EEJF4O I bought a guitar that had been sitting in a guys closet for the longest time, and the fret board was so dry and colorless. I used this, and the color became rich and less dry. If your fret board is pretty dry, DO NOT remove the oil. Let it sit overnight and then remove it with a towel. Leave it longer depending on how dry the fret board is. I love this because it doesn't leave an oily residue and it doesn't have a smell that stands out. I didn't even notice a smell. I definitely would say this is a must-have."
B000EEJF4O This stuff is great. Leaves board clean and fast. No residue, no sticky and no oil film. Price is right. If you use any fingerboard treatment, try this one..."
B000EEL50Q Dr. Duck's Ax Wax works great on all of my guitars, including my Nitro finished ones.  Can be hard to remove if you use too much, so apply only a few drops at a time."
B000EEL50Q Use very little of this. Rub it on and it then dries like wax then buff it off. It also lubes your strings. Good all around product."
B000J5XS3C the Beringer 802 mixer is by far the lowest costing and best performing mixer for the price on the market..  Works fantastic and I am very happy with it.."
B000KIRT6A don't let the system absorbs you !  this device as others is really  great for the money, check everything by yourself ! this is as good as other devices that cost 3-4 times more."
B000M23OQ8 loved this thing, I have since lost it, as happens with little doo-hickeys like this, lol. worked good. pretty precise, meaning you will fight with it to where it is happy. sometimes it felt a little off, but robots know best, right?"
B0013OXABS My vet recommended ubiquinol for my 12 year old chihuahua who has developed a heart murmur.  I researched it online and was impressed with the reviews and personal experiences I found, so when Vine provided me with a sample of it I was excited to try it.  Ollie, my chihuahua, is only 4 pounds so I poke a hole in the gelcap and squeeze a little on his food in the morning and evening, so a gelcap lasts about three days.  He doesn't seem to even notice the taste and he eats every bit of his food, so I know he's eating the entire dose each meal.  After several months, it seems to be working - he's seems much more energetic and even perky, which makes my very happy.I was so impressed with his results that I've started taking it myself.  I've only been taking it about a month, but I feel as though I have more energy during my workouts.  I've already ordered more for myself and for Ollie so I'll update this review with any new developments._______________________________________________March 29, 2013So Ollie (my little dog) and I have been taking this every day for about 5 months.  I didn't plan my \"subscribe & save\" well and we ran out about two weeks ago.  I started to notice about a week ago that Ollie had gotten really lethargic and after a few days I began to suspect that it was because of the lack of ubiquinol (the difference in his energy level is dramatic.)  And then I realized that I've been lethargic also!  I have been having trouble waking up for the past week and have overslept several times.  In the past four months before running out of the ubiquinol I have awakened with energy almost every morning and my energy has been really good throughout the day - I even commented to my partner how good I had been feeling.I can't say for certain that it's the ubiquinol, but it's rather coincidental that within a week of running out of it, both my dog and I have been experiencing extremely low energy.  I won't be able to say with any real certainty until we start taking it again on a daily basis after my order comes.  I'll update this again after we've both been on it for awhile again and I'll let you know if we gotten our respective energy levels back._______________________________________________September 7, 2013Both Ollie and I are feeling better.  I will make sure to never run out of this again!PS - It always makes my day to know that people find these reviews helpful. If you'd also like to ask a question or leave a comment I usually respond the same day, so if you have a question or comment (even if it's just to say, Hi!\") feel free to post it below.Thanks,Claire
B0013OXCJI After hearing several reports about Cat's Claw a while back, I had looked into it. My doctor also noticed a remarkable difference. Cat's Claw actually is in the pharmacopea as a blood pressure reducer. There actually is a warning associated with it for those with low blood pressure to take caution in using this product. But for those who have high blood pressure, this is a natural addition to your daily routine to help lower the pressure and bring you back towards normal. I can attest to the fact that this works.NOTE: It is important to understand that there are FIVE different plants that go by the name \"Cat's Claw.\" This particular product contains the Brazilian form. This is the only form that is used for the above symptoms. The others do not have the same effect.
B0013OXCU2 These Colloidal minerals taste awful. Bitter and gross. I had purchased a brand a couple of years back and they were very tasty, albeit expensive, but at least they were palatable. I did order the original flavor expecting it to be somewhat flavorless, my mistake. I don't see how the bitterness of it could even be masked by raspberry flavor or any other for that matter.I purchased these to help supplement my toddler's diet a bit as I'm not sure she is actually getting enough of the minerals she needs due to being a picky eater. No way she'll take this stuff, I've tried it in different juices and she seems to detect it every time.The products itself seems to have a good amount of minerals but I feel it could have more and I'm not crazy about the preservatives used in it. I believe there are better products out there that offer more essential trace minerals and taste better.
B0013OXCU2 I have used NOW Brand Colloidal Minerals for many years. Without it, I suffer respiratory and sinus complications from allergies and asthma. But when I take a sip of it daily during allergy season, I find that it simply makes me feel \"normal\"- no troubles with allergies or asthma! What a lifesaver this product has been for me, and for all the family and friends I have told - it really makes a difference.My doc told me I would need inhalers for the rest of my life,( I don't think so!)What I needed was a good nutritional foundation to let my body find its way back to balanced health! No more inhalers or meds for me! I can breathe now - in any season!As a terrific \"side\" benefit- when I take Colloidal Minerals, my fingernails are long, strong, and lovely~ and that was something I never had~I know that we aren't getting good minerals from most of our foods these days, and when I give my body these minerals, this supplies the nutritional foundation I need to stay in a healthy balance.These are the best tasting minerals I have found, and I have tried many brands... This is a REALLY great price, too~~
B0013OXD38 Creatine is the only new supplement that has been proven to generate real results. Creatine  Monohydrate Powder is all you need. All the new fancy pills and ethyl ester are just hype. Just put the powder in your mouth and swallow it with the shake to prevent any lost of potency. Use the creatine with the ABC Window of Opportunity formula to get the maximum results.I follow ABC bodybuilding's article on the Window of Opportunity. Everyone should read this article and use this formula. This is the best guideline on essential supplementation.Please keep in mind that it is a guide, not a dogma. Do what feels right and what works for you.The Window of Opportunity is a post-workout shake that I used when I put on over 30 pounds of muscle within 3 months. My bench went from 215 pounds to 450, body fat from 7% to 3%, and mile time from 6 minutes to 5. It works.Here're the quick basics, although you definitely must read the article yourself.After the work out, you should consume .22 gram of protein per pound of bodyweight and 5 grams of carbohydrate (half dextrose, half maltodextrin) per 10 pounds of lean muscle mass for bulking, or 2.5 grams of carbohydrate (half dextrose, half maltodextrin) per 10 pounds of lean muscle mass for cutting.You should also consume 5-10 grams of creatine, 5-10 grams of glutamine, and a multi-anti-oxidant formula. All this must be done over a 45-60 minute period.The 45-60 minute sequence is vital:Step One:Blend 1/3 protein (experiment to find the exact number for you), 1/3 dextrose (simple sugar), and 1/3 maltodextrin (complex sugar) with enough water (water should be at least 92% of the total mixture). Add 500 mg of sodium per liter of water used.Shake the ingredients well. Put creatine powder in your mouth (5-10 grams when starting, 2.5-5 grams once body is saturated with creatine) and drink the shake to wash the creatine down. It is better to do this than to mix the creatine in water, as that makes creatine lose its potency.Drink one half of the shake within 5 minutes of working out. After this 5 minutes, allow an additional 10-15 minutes for the solution to settle in your stomach.Step 2:After the solution has dissolved in your stomach for 10-15 minutes, consume 5-10 grams of Glutamine and your multi-vitamin with one gulp of the shake.Continue to drink the remaining half of the shake for the following 30-45 minute period.It is vital to drink small sips of your shake for the entire 30-45 minute period. This allows for maximum absorption rate of the nutrients into your body.Step 3:Take fish oil with a meal, preferably at breakfast.Take ZMA on an empty stomach, 30 minutes before you go to sleep.
B0013OXD38 used this during triathlon training season. helped me get about 15-20 extra watts for my average power on my long rides (70-90 miles). I was concerned the extra bulk would hurt my joints on the run, but this helped my run speed as well. Used on race day as well (Ironman lake placid) for pre-race and on the bike nutrition. highly recommended.btw I ignored serving guidelines, just put 5-6 teaspoons in my water bottles. When I followed the guidelines and just put 1-2 I didn't feel much of a result
B0013OXD38 Bought this and thought I would try it out after reading the reviews. Assumed it tasted like protein powder, was so wrong. It didn't melt easily had a very bland taste and not sure I am seeing or feeling results. To be fair I have not taken it as prescribed so this review is based on my taking it once a day post workout. Will take as prescribed and update review to see if results are accurate!!
B0013OXD38 I have been purchasing Creatine with Fruit Punch. The Fruit Punch flavors seem to be quite strong and sweet.So I decided to try a non-flavored one. I mix this in with my Cookies & Cream Flavored Casin Protein. I find the taste very good.Also it seems like I will get a lot more servings from this product than I did the others I have tried.I'm not sure if the product itself is better or worse than the others I purchased but the flavor and quanity will probably make this my prefered Creatine.
B0013OXD38 It's supposed to heal the muscles faster so you can workout again the next day or the day after that but my muscles are stubborn I guess, or this stuff is a lot of hot air and wind soup. The muscles still take their sweet old time recovering and all I get from it is diarrhea and farts that smell like I just crawled out of a sewer. I don't need such nonsense when I already have IBS and hemorrhoids. This stuff isn't cheap but if it isn't going to work and only makes your stomach miserable, I see no point in it.If it works for you without these problems, then great! It must work for some people otherwise there wouldn't be a market for it, but for me, as with everything, nothing works the way it is supposed to. Life is wonderful for some people and horrible for others.
B0013OXDBU I'm giving this four stars because in no way does the product description say it's supposed to be great tasting or anything like that. This product is meant to be nutrional and it succeeds at that.With that being said.. WOW, this tastes horrible! If you're thinking you don't care about taste, just nutrition, I thought the same thing! This thing tastes so badly that trust me, you will care.Also it's not instantized. It will clump together thickly and at the top of the liquid and is IMPOSSIBLE to stir. It will not unclump. You must must must use a blender.So why not just drink egg whites out of a carton? Well, traveler's will need to resort to this powder. If you have a fridge around though you may want to just drink egg whites.
B0013OXDBU My opinion about this product has changed dramatically, so I started over and re-wrote it.I use my Torani sugar free syrups to flavor it, and it has worked out pretty good for the taste.I use chocolate, lime, peach, hazelnut, English toffee, vanilla, etc...I tried using my magic bullet, my ninja blender, and a blender wand, to mix this powder. All three methods worked bad for the following reasons:1) It whips up too much (like meringue) in high speed blenders.2) It sticks to the sides of the cup or blender containers, as well as the blade.3) If you use a spoon to pre-stir so it doesn't stick to the blender, it sticks to the spoon.This powder seems like it is waterproof! It hits liquid, and blam.......clump city. It seems to form a protective barrier to not let the liquid in.But, I found it mixes quite well in my shaker cup (using a mixer ball inside the cup), by SHAKING it. (When I tried to use my shaker cup to mix it with a spoon, it was a mess). Just don't use cold liquids. I mix my shakes with almond milk and room temp water, add ground flax and my choice of Torani sugar-free sryup, and put it in the fridge. YUMMY!I would have bought this product again, but I found a 5 pound container of their whey powder, and it was a better value. It also mixes a lot better. I would buy this again if I found a good value.
B0013OXDBU Can't say whether this works or not -- just no way to know.  However, I will continue to order and use it because it allows me to cut back on the protein powder that I blend it with, cutting back on carbs, etc.  Eggwhite is supposedly the 'gold standard' of protein supplementation.As a product, it works well, mixing easily in my shaker jar with whole milk. it has no noticeable taste in the mix, and it's not that expensive.So, I'll continue to use it, assuming that what I've read is true and that is doing me some good.
B0013OXDBU This protein was recommended in theGain Muscle Blueprint.  Egg white protein is absolutely awesome for muscle gains.  I've been hitting the gym hard and trying to pack on muscle.  I've gained strength & over 10 pounds of solid lean muscle using this stuff.I use this protein first-thing in the morning and usually as a meal replacement sometime throughout the day.  My goal has been to transform my body by packing on muscle while getting lean.Protein is great to lose fat while gaining muscle at the same time.  And eggs are one of the best possible sources.This stuff tastes good, nice and smooth, and gets the job done.  NOW always produces great products.  They're top notch.  High recommendation for this one too.  Big ups to theGain Muscle Blueprintfor suggesting this to me.
B0013OXDBU I wanted to try a different protein, as I have a dairy allergy and have yet to find a non-dairy protein powder that isn't expensive and tastes good. This was by far the cheapest egg white option, but it is unflavored as well. So it was a trade off. I was disappointed that it is only 16 grams of protein per serving. Also, like other powders it can cause gas issues. But I've found if I take a half dose mixed with some other powders (I've found a protein powder concoction of several different ones tastes the best) I can mitigate this effect. Overall, for the price, it's not enough servings for only 16 grams of protein each. I will not being buying this again. I've tried MRM chocolate flavored egg white protein, which tasted pretty okay but is super expensive ($30+ for 15 servings). Alas, egg white protein isn't for me.
B0013OXDBU They really have no taste, I add black pepper to make it somewhat flavorful (when I scramble them). I tried it in a shake and it gave me a chalky flavor. It's a great source of protein and not that bad in the calorie department but it taste rather bland.
B0013OXDBU Love this product. I tried it because Dr Perricone says egg white protein is the best. Mixes well - I use it in smoothies, yogurt and oatmeal, and have baked pizza crust with it. There's no strong flavor so smoothies taste great. Easy way to get a protein boost if you want to eat less meat. Low fat too!
B0013OXE1Y The thing to remember is this: if you buy these hoping you can eat cupcakes and chips and sit around watching TV and have the body of Jilliam Michaels and a perfect A1C, you're sadly mistaken.  These and other suppliments are just what they say they are: FOR SUPPORT.I've been taking these for a few weeks now twice daily along with co-q 10 and omega 3's.  I have noticed a slight decrease in my sugar cravings.  My weight and belly fat are stable.  I went from weighing 114 at doctor's visit in October 2013 to 110 February 24th 2014.  My fasting glucose went from 95 to 87 which is an improvement. Of course I adopted a healthier lifestyle too; cutting salt, saturated fat, and decreasing  simple sugars and junk food along with doing yoga 3 times a week and walking.  So, suppliments are for people who are already conscienciously trying but need a little added &#34;support&#34;.
B0013OXE1Y It's been three weeks since I started taking this product and I have to say I do feel like I no longer have a big sweet tooth or cravings for bread or pasta in my meals. I also don't experience such a *big* sugar crash/drowsiness after eating a carb heavy meal now. I'm in the very early stages of becoming a diabetic and my doctor recommended taking vitamins high in Chronmium so I went around searching for a good brand of vitamins and I found this.I'm hoping this will really improve my blood sugar levels so I don't become a full blown diabetic.*****Update 04/27/2013*****Well after a month of using these vitamins, I have to say that I do have less of a sugar/sweet craving now. Now and then I do want something sweet, but my serving size has been reduce a lot. I usually can eat a king sized Snickers bars in one go, but now I got to divide it into 3 servings through out the day as I seem to have more control over my sweet cravings.
B0013OXEFU I bought this as an alternative to regular (conventional) deodorants. I have been working with my dermatologist for a while since my skin is ultra sensitive to the chemicals. The alternative she gave me was around $1K-$2K per year. Given the amount of positive reviews, I decided to give it a try. The deodorant works. However, I sweat and shower a lot (2-3x a day) so the cream wears off quickly. At most, it lasts 4 days- not bad. I also have to wear a lot of it in order for it to work.Not so appealing- I like to wear a lot of tank tops so you can imagine the look is not the most appealing. Since this is one of my only alternative, I will have to suck it up and continue searching for other products.Thank you everyone for posting your reviews. They are extremely helpful.
B0013OXEFU I can go 10 days without odor or reapplying. My kid can only go 3 or 4 so it definitely varies from person to person but this is still amazing. NO ODOR!! This is huge for anyone who ever had to struggle with a BO problem. My kid is so relieved and is never embarrassed at the end of the day anymore because a regular deodorant couldn't keep going after 12 hours. I joined Amazon Prime mostly so I could keep ordering this deodorant after we moved and I couldn't find Lavilin in any of my new local stores. I will NEVER go without this product again!
B0013OXEFU Love this stuff! Put it on at night once a week, wash it off the next morning and forget about deodorant for a week to ten days. This is not an anti-perspirant, so if you want that - go elsewhere. But for those of us who detest spraying that other \"stuff\" on or those gels and sticks with who-knows-what in it, this might be for you. Very simple ingredients, you wash it off within hours and nothing for days. If done on the weekend it's easy to remember to do one a week.
B0013OXEFU I've been looking for a natural deodorant, and this one came highly recommended on a skin care thread on a fitness forum I frequent.  More natural crystal deodorants have never worked for me in the past, and this one doesn't either.  I wish I had had the chance to try the older formulation of this that others have mentioned, since this one does not work well for me.The instructions state that you may need to apply this every day for about a week in order for it to start working.  That was true for me; it took a good five or six days for it to kick in, but, once it did, I still ended up very sweaty and stinky.  I gave this a good two weeks, but, during that whole time, I ended up feeling really icky and was embarrassed at how sweaty I always was.It is also really thick and messy to apply.  You scoop out a very small amount with a small spatula that comes with this, and then apply it with your fingers.  While it spreads easily on your underarms (especially if your skin is warm from the shower), it is *really* hard to get off your fingertips afterwards.I really wanted this to work, but will have to look for something else.
B0013OXEFU So, I sweat ALOT. I didn't expect to go very long. I made it one full day but I dont smell good. I didn't sweat but definitely dont smell good. I think my search continues....
B0013OXEFU I tried the roll-on first. It worked pretty well, and I was impressed. This cream product received such great reviews and was reportedly even better, so I decided to give it a try. I followed the directions exactly, and haven't used any aluminum-based products in years, so there was no adjustment period necessary. I used the cream for a few weeks. The first thing I noticed was that it didn't work. It didn't even last for 12 hours, never mind several days. This did not get any better as time went on. After a couple of weeks, not only was it not working, it started to give me a horrible rash. I stopped using it, and went back to the roll-on. It took weeks for the irritation to go away. The roll-on, by the way, has caused no irritation in the several months I've been using it. In the meantime, my husband tried the product as well. He finds it messy and hard to apply, although it did not give him a rash. He also prefers the roll-on. Beware -- this cream is definitely not for everyone.
B0013OXEFU Everybody seems to have a story to tell about Lavilin.  Here's mine:I first ordered the roll-on, which I used with satisfactory success for about three weeks.  It certainly did work better for me than other deodorants*,  but I needed to use it every day.  I wouldn't mind--I sweat in a profusely un-ladylike way, and wasn't expecting miracles--except that this stuff is a little pricey.At week three, I ordered the cream.  I'm used to the inconvenience/unpleasantness of cream deodorant, as I've been a fan of the Yodora for decades, still use it elsewhere on my body**, and recommend it with enthusiasm.  Suffice it to say, however, that my Aunt Dotty nicknamed me &#34;Stinky,&#34; so even my beloved Yodora sometimes needed a boost, and I carried around Tom's roll-on for occasional touch-ups.So the $14 Lavilin cream arrived, along with an unpleasant shock:  nestled inside the glossy-white box is a teeny-tiny little jar, with an even teeny-tinier bowl of deodorant inside, accompanied by an itsy-bitsy spatula. Not finding a retinue of Lilliputian chambermaids inside the box to help me apply the precious substance, I was feeling surly and ripped off.I decided to give it a go, but I was going to take them on their &#34;word,&#34; and test it in a quantity proportionate to the size of the container, which is to say a teeny-tiny amount at a time.To my surprise, it seemed to work.  In fact, after a couple of weeks,  I realized that I WAS only putting it on every three or four days, though, to the relief of friends and neighbors, I did continue to shower.Is the cream better than the roll-on, or is the credulity-straining claim actually true--you don't need much to begin with, and the longer you use it, the less you need? I don't know.  But two months into the Lavilin experiment, I have a bit left of the roll-on, and a lot...no, let me rephrase that...a significant portion left of the cream.Let me temper this just a bit: the hot weather has made a few short appearances here on the East Coast, and I'm finding that I do have to add a very sparing swipe of the roll-on here and there. Still, over all, I guess I'm impressed.* Antiperspirants are out of the question. According to my friend the scientist, my body chemistry reacts with the aluminum to create an acid. Not only do they all make me smell worse, they also ruin my clothes virtually instantly.** The Yodora packaging explicity says it can be used anywhere on your body that you sweat... For me, it works wonders on the feet, adding years of wear to everything from sneakers to absurdly expensive Italian extravagances, under the, er, bosom, or at the top of the thighs, for example.  Lavilin doesn't make this claim, and I can't identify the ingredients, so I'm reluctant to try it for these purposes.
B0013OXEFU Interestingproduct; have used for a full year.  Good replacement for anyone getting away from harsh ingredients/chemicals.  Prroduct has thick ssticky consistency but will rub in.  Follow directions.  Shaving often seems to affect it's ability to neutrallize odor.  I use every 4-5 days and have little odor.  Sometimes there is a \"sour\" odor but not a stinky odor.  I will never go back to commercial antiperspirents.
B0013OXEFU I struggled to find a deodorant that would work for me.I break out in a rash or they simply do not work due to my medications. I have a medicine odor that challenges other deodorants and often wins the battle.I tried Lavilin and I have never looked back. I've been using it for well over 6 years now.I apply it once a week. Odor and skin problems are a thing of the past.Tips:1. avoid washing it off if you can avoid it, at least for the first day or so.2. If you are a very hairy guy, I recommend trimming the hair in the area you wish to treat for better results. less surface area to cover means it goes further and works better at killing the bacteria hiding there.
B0013OXEFU I purchased this product with great skepticism. The last time I used a deodorant (instead of antiperspirant), was when I started going through puberty. Since then, I have migrated from Ban to Secret to DERMAdoctor's Total NonScents, which means I just spent the last few decades applying chemicals directly to my skin, chemicals that are doing who knows what to my endocrine system. So I recently decided to explore safer options, hoping I'd stumble across something that would prevent me from putting up a stink.I had never used the original Lavilin, which several reviewers seem to prefer, so as my subject line says, my expectations were extremely low. At first I was applying the deodorant daily because I could not get past the paranoia that I'd end up getting pitty by midday, but after a bit more experimentation, I discovered that a single application lasted 3-5 days, depending on various external conditions, such as weather and stress. All things being equal, I found there to be virtually no difference in the amount I perspired, but the most unexpected, welcome surprise was my clothing. As I did laundry, I noticed over time that the armpits of all white and light-colored shirts that I purchased after I started using Lavilin, were not taking on that faint tea-stained discoloration that no amount of cleansing ever removed. I had grown tired of throwing away perfectly good clothing, but I always assumed my body chemistry created the stains. Now I know it was the antiperspirant combined with the oils and salts in my perspiration.To be clear, if it's really hot out or I am doing something vigorous, like yard work or exercise, I'll sweat. Our bodies are meant to, but as long as I continue with daily hygiene and freshen up the Lavilin, as needed, I won't be a burden to the people near me! I see no reason to ever go back to antiperspirant, and I finally threw them away, along with all of the scented deodorants.
B0013OXEFU I was having a terrible time with perspiration odor all of a sudden.  I use to be able to use any brand every day like normal with no problems.  Then this summer I would apply after my evening shower and have to apply again the first thing in the morning.  Something was wrong!  I tried all popular brands Secret, Mitchum, Avon, etc., roll on, stick, gel even alcohol based liquid to no avail.I In the begining of using Lavilin, it was during the summer in Texas, I had to use after a couple of days a couple of times but after that I manages to go up to 9 days before re-applying.  Since the cooler weather it has been longer and longer between applications.  I am on day 25 now so, needless to say I am very pleased with the efficacy of this product.
B0013OXEFU As long as you follow the exact instructions it works very good. Kinda pricey though but i like this product. Really helps with sweat and odor. Will buy again
B0013OXEKK As an intermediate weight-lifter, I use this before and after workouts (as the product advises) in addition to the L-glutamine that I get from my Body Fortress whey protein powder which also has L-glutamine, but does not display the amount per serving.Once I added this to my large list of workout recovery-based supplements I have not noticed a big difference, but there is (I think) a difference--that is, being a little less sore and for less time after intense workouts.  Either way I'm glad I take it.  It lasts long enough that it doesn't feel like an expense.The taste is--interesting.  Bad is not the word, but \"off\".  In water (8-10 oz.), it's very noticeable.  I add it to over 20 oz of water or to a pre-workout shake.  I imagine a stronger flavor from a juice, or milk would make the powder unnoticebale.  In a protein shake (whey, I use Body Fortress, various flavors) it's totally unnoticeable.
B0013OXELE I am recovering from a life threatening illness so I'm always looking for new ways to improve my health. I have heard about this stuff on a couple of different radio shows and thought that I'd give it a try. I always start with a minimum dose so I don't expect to see results right away. One of the shows I listened to mentioned that it would help cure a hangover. I rarely drink alcohol, so when I do, the next morning often includes a headache. After a night with my wife, a friend, and a few drinks we decided to test the theory. The next morning I was fine! Our friend called and she was too! My wife, who had declined the glutathione, was hurting.Not exactly a scientific test but it's worth trying again in the future.I hope to see more favorable results as I increase my usage.
B0013OXEM8 A couple months ago I switched toNow Foods Liq Glucos/Chondroitin, 32-OuncefromNOW Foods Joint Support Powder, 11 Ouncesduring a time when the powder wasn't available.I found the liquid much less effective than the powder. Later I realized that the liquid has less glucosamine than the powder. The powder has 1,100 mg and the liquid 750 - enough to make a huge difference in pain relief. I didn't see Chondroitin in the powder but it has 500 MSM. Liquid has 600 Chondroitin and 150 MSM.I've been a Now Foods fan for years but next order I'm switching to other products. Vitacost has a liquid blend with 1000 mg glucosamine and 800 mg Chondroitin with 500 MSM. Tropical Oasis Joint CompleteTropical Oasis Joint Complete (32 oz) w/ Glucosamine, Chondroitin, MSM Hyaluronic Acid & Vitamin C for Maximum absorption - ALL IN ONE Liquidhas 1500 glucosamine, 800mg Chondroitin , 500 mg MSM and an additional 50 mg Hyaluronic Acid.So it helps to do your research. Since I've been taking the Now Foods Joint Support Liquid my mobility has been lessened, my hips hurt at night, my pain has increased. If you want 10 off your first purchase at Vitacost, comment.This is an updated review from the one I originally make in March of 2013.
B0013OXESM My doctor recommended a combination of B6, 5-HTP, Magnesium, Calcium, and L-Theanine to help with anxiety and insomnia. I had been taking the magnesium and calcium with some success; B6, 5-HTP, and L-Theanine were new. My insomnia got worse when I added these three in. I know that the L-Theanine comes from green tea, and that it is decaffinated. Unfortunately, I am one of those really caffeine-sensitive folks that has to watch even decaf products (which can contain small amounts of caffeine) in the afternoon and evening.That said, I moved this supplement to lunch time and things seemed to improve. (I have another natural sleep aid product that I've taken on occasion. I took it one night last week and I couldn't sleep with a darn. Had no clue why. Then I remembered it had L-Theanine in it. I won't be taking that supplement before bed anymore.) I take the B6 with dinner, I take the calcium around 8pm, and I take the magnesium and 5-HTP right before bed. I can't say I've noticed a huge change with my anxiety and insomnia; or rather, it's hard to tell what's been changing because I've been using other techniques to help cope.However, that's my advice to caffeine-sensitive people like myself. Don't write the product off, just don't take it before bedtime.
B0013OXESM I often drink Green Tea and whenever I take this brand with the Tea, I always get bad headache that last very long time.But if you don't drink Green Tea, I think it should be ok as I did not have any problem when I didn't take it with Green Tea.
B0013OXESM I had a lot of excitement waiting for this product.  I needed it for sleep.  It does help relax you somewhat.  I get about 7 hours of sleep.  I do not take it every night.  Perhaps one needs to take it nightly and one might get 8 hours sleep.  I do not know. What I do know is that it helps aid a night's rest.
B0013OXFQ8 I have to eat my last meal of the day kind of late some days. This helps to block some of the carbs from absorbing into my system. Sometimes causes me to have diarrhea the next day.
B0013OXGBC Arrived and am taking  will now in time if it does what it is advertised to do  thanks for the shipment
B0013OXIFQ Here I thought that I was doing the right thing by giving up my Flomax and using a natural supplement instead to reduce my nightly bathroom trips.  Touted as an organic way to treat enlarged prostates which affect many of us over 60, I ordered this supplement about two days before the American Medical Association (AMA) came out and said that there is absolutely no indication that this product works as intended.  I will take it anyway on the off chance that my mind will accept it as a placebo and allow me to sleep more peacefully.  Here's to the hope that the AMA doesn't eventually come out and state that they have determined that the use of this product can cause certain adverse results. Now wouldn't that be ironic?
B0013OXKHC This product is a great product from a very well respected company for me.  I look for the now name on things.  I have a problem with milk products and I can now tolerate coconut milk with taking this products. The problem is that I have a hard time discarding this product as a waste material. I am still experimenting with the now products. I have not drank milk for over 40 years that I can say.  So my system may have a problems breaking it down.  I am also taking their pro biotic. I have adjusted my eating habits as well. I still stand by the now name brand product.  So for all that I need the product for I would give it medium rating.
B0013OZAZ2 I have been using this brand for a while now and I really like it. So I was recently reordering it, what I thought was the same item or size as before, and I got these 2 SMALL containers. I remember once ordering a 2 pack that was bigger than these! So at 1st I was a little miffed because I could have got the 8oz bottle for cheaper, then went ahead and started using these anyway. Turns out I LIKE these little 2oz containers! I realized when I got the big 8oz before that you can't really dispense from it without using too much, so I ended up using it to refill a dropper bottle that I could control the amount from. Since I like these containers I will just refill them, maybe keep one in my purse, because you can control the drops and it's a sturdy bottle with a sturdy cap, unlike the dropper bottle.
B0013OZAZ2 To me this product is utterly disgusting, I nearly threw up! I put it in coffee which I guess you're not supposed to do. With that said some other people who like these type of sweeteners greatly enjoyed it. It was sent quickly and is the same thing you'd buy in a healthfood store, just cheaper here instead.I'll stick to my cavity loving sugar :)
B0013OZAZ2 Am using this since a long time now - perhaps more than 6-8 months and its still there in the refrigerator. I use it 3-4 times a week - few drops in a cup of tea/coffee - at least it has reduced my dependency on commercial sugar which is refined using char bones (of animals) - my purpose was to avoid any animal related products and to reduce the consumption of consumption sugar for health reasons. This product helped me achieve it. I ordered another for me to keep in the office.I have used it in preparation of rice pudding, sweetened korma (indian curry) dishes, tikka masala dishes, etc. with success. My only fault was that a few drops means way too much sweetness - gotta keep it to just a couple of drops and that's enough to give the sweet touch to curry dishes.
B0013OZAZ2 I needed a replacement for the Splenda I had been using as a sweetener because the Splenda makes me nauseous.  I decided to try stevia because it is a natural zero-calorie sweetener.  After reading all of the reviews, I was braced for something that was only just tolerable in aftertaste, like saccharin, but at least not upsetting to my stomach.  When it arrived, I tasted it straight out of the bottle.  Wow, this stuff is good!  I had my husband taste it, and he said it tastes minty.  I guess neither one of us is afflicted with whatever condition it is that causes people to think stevia tastes bad.The very first test I put it to was sweetening a batch of dark chocolate frozen kefir, with orange oil added.  This is a potentially very bitter mixture, and requires good sweetening to counteract the bitterness.  The stevia did the job.  I think I used about 30 drops, which sounds like a lot but is only enough for 6 - 10 cups of beverage according to the directions on the bottle.  Even assuming 2 tsp of sugar per cup of beverage and the maximum of 10 cups, that is equivalent to less than 0.5 cup of sugar.  The recipe called for 1.25 cups of sugar.  I think that is pretty good performance.  I didn't feel nauseous afterward, either, and I would have after using 1.25 cups of Splenda (at 1:1 replacement as per instructions) in the dessert.I bought both an 8-oz bottle and a 2-oz glass dropper bottle.  My plan is to use the dropper bottle to apply the sweetener, and fill it from the larger, more economical, bottle.Edit 5 days later:  I am finding that 5 drops per cup of kefir is enough for my frozen kefir desserts when the flavoring is not so bitter as the dark chocolate and orange oil.  It costs a little more than the Splenda, per serving, but it is worth it not to feel ill afterward.  I am about to buy more while the price is good, so I don't run out.
B0013OZAZ2 I have always used Sweet Leaf liquid Stevia but their price is outrageous.  There is no aftertaste with theirs but this NOW brand has no after taste, great sweetness and the price is phenomenal!  THANKS!!!
B0013OZCGE These are very strong in my opinion - they gave me some energy but also a terrible headache if I took two at a time.  Now I just take one per day, in the morning and I do feel it helps some. I did not have some of the other side effects that some reviewers had - like nausea or burping.  And mine don't smell bad either - there is barely any smell to them at all and what little bit I CAN smell just smells like any other vitamin.  My advice is to take one at a time for an entire week before you judge whether they work or not.  Remember if you are really hypo-thryroid, you are accustomed to feeling bad and fixing that might feel a little weird at first, so give it some time.
B0064JGWZS This wasn't my favorite show, but my husband sure did like it.  If you are into watching something different, then this is a safe bet."
B006FYDKMA I almost feel like I am picking with them or at one of their stores. I enjoy learning about the pickers and their customers. It is fun to be told what an item was originally used for."
B006FYDKMA Two childhood friends travel across America searching for the old and the unusual.  They take these items out of hiding and sell them in their store to other people who appreciate the history behind them.  Their enthusiasm for the history behind the items and their excitement in finding them is infectious."
B006OU14BO The women start to become friends, they are Clearly making money and you just know the other shoe is about to drop. Makes me want to do a show about my family"
B006SV4QFK Very interesting......this show makes me feel good about myself and helps me keep my house clean!"
B006SV5Z0U and should not be on tv. There is little redeeming value to this -only shock value. Swamp people is better"
B006U3MY7S This show gives an insight into what bounty hunters go through to capture fugitives. Some of the episodes are quite entertaining."
B006X41N2Q Rick and crew do amazing work resoring items of the past .I work in the trades and i really appriciate the craftsmanship envolved in these restorations"
B006X41N2Q Rick always seems to try to make exactly as they were originally.  Good work ethic.  I would encourage baby boomers to see what can be accomplished with forgotten items in attics and sheds."
B006Y5AV68 Love this show. They will test a recipe until it is perfect. Then they explain WHY it is prepared a certain way. Their product tests and taste-testing are also helpful."
B006Z48TZS This show is AWESOME. I can't describe it any better.  If I did, you, the reader may think I have a financial interest, but I assure you, I do not."
